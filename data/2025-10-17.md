### [1] [MultiFoodhat: A potential new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13889)
*Yue Hu,Guohang Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces MultiFoodChat, a zero-shot food recognition framework that uses dialogue-driven multi-agent reasoning between vision-language models and LLMs to improve accuracy and interpretability without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the dependency on large labeled datasets and limited generalization to unseen food categories; pursue unsupervised/few-shot capable, interpretable reasoning in complex food scenes.

Method: A multi-agent system where vision-language models and large language models collaborate through multi-round visual-textual dialogues. Key components include an Object Perception Token (OPT) that captures fine-grained visual attributes and an Interactive Reasoning Agent (IRA) that dynamically interprets contextual cues to refine predictions; the framework requires no extra training or manual annotations.

Result: Experiments on multiple public food datasets show superior recognition accuracy and interpretability compared with existing unsupervised and few-shot methods.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a promising zero-shot, multi-agent reasoning paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection and analysis, offering improved generalization and interpretability without additional labeled data.

Abstract: Food image classification plays a vital role in intelligent food quality
inspection, dietary assessment, and automated monitoring. However, most
existing supervised models rely heavily on large labeled datasets and exhibit
limited generalization to unseen food categories. To overcome these challenges,
this study introduces MultiFoodChat, a dialogue-driven multi-agent reasoning
framework for zero-shot food recognition. The framework integrates
vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs) to enable
collaborative reasoning through multi-round visual-textual dialogues. An Object
Perception Token (OPT) captures fine-grained visual attributes, while an
Interactive Reasoning Agent (IRA) dynamically interprets contextual cues to
refine predictions. This multi-agent design allows flexible and human-like
understanding of complex food scenes without additional training or manual
annotations. Experiments on multiple public food datasets demonstrate that
MultiFoodChat achieves superior recognition accuracy and interpretability
compared with existing unsupervised and few-shot methods, highlighting its
potential as a new paradigm for intelligent food quality inspection and
analysis.

### [2] [Post-surgical Endometriosis Segmentation in Laparoscopic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13899)
*Andreas Leibetseder,Klaus Schoeffmann,Jörg Keckstein,Simon Keckstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A demo system for segmenting dark endometriotic implants in laparoscopic videos, with colored overlays and a detection summary to help clinicians browse recordings; focused on a single common appearance of endometriosis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Endometriosis presents with diverse visual appearances, making identification difficult for non-specialists; automated segmentation could assist gynecologic surgeons by highlighting suspected implants.

Method: Train a segmentation model to identify one frequent visual phenotype (dark implants) in laparoscopic videos; generate multi-colored overlays on identified regions; produce a detection summary to facilitate video browsing.

Result: Demonstrates capability to annotate implant regions and provide a browse-friendly summary in laparoscopic footage. No quantitative metrics reported in the abstract.

Conclusion: A practical aid for intraoperative analysis and review, contingent on coverage of only one appearance; extension to other appearances and robustness across variability is needed.

Abstract: Endometriosis is a common women's condition exhibiting a manifold visual
appearance in various body-internal locations. Having such properties makes its
identification very difficult and error-prone, at least for laymen and
non-specialized medical practitioners. In an attempt to provide assistance to
gynecologic physicians treating endometriosis, this demo paper describes a
system that is trained to segment one frequently occurring visual appearance of
endometriosis, namely dark endometrial implants. The system is capable of
analyzing laparoscopic surgery videos, annotating identified implant regions
with multi-colored overlays and displaying a detection summary for improved
video browsing.

### [3] [Efficient Few-Shot Learning in Remote Sensing: Fusing Vision and Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13993)
*Jia Yun Chua,Argyrios Zolotas,Miguel Arana-Catania*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid approach combines YOLO-style detectors with vision-language models (LLaVA, ChatGPT, Gemini) to boost aircraft detection and scene understanding in remote sensing, yielding large gains in MAE for detection and a modest gain in CLIPScore, especially under degraded conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing data are abundant but labeling is costly and time-consuming. Traditional vision models struggle with context and degraded imagery. Vision-language models offer contextual, language-guided interpretation that can enhance understanding and support few-shot learning in remote sensing.

Method: Integrate a traditional vision detector (e.g., YOLO) with VLMs (LLaVA, ChatGPT, Gemini); evaluate on labelled and unlabelled remote sensing data, including degraded images; assess performance with MAE for aircraft detection/counting and CLIPScore for scene understanding; analyze effectiveness in few-shot scenarios.

Result: Average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models for aircraft detection/counting; notable improvements in degraded scenarios; CLIPScore improves by 6.17%.

Conclusion: The combined traditional vision models and VLMs lead to more accurate and context-aware remote sensing image analysis, enabling efficient few-shot learning and promising directions for advanced remote sensing applications.

Abstract: Remote sensing has become a vital tool across sectors such as urban planning,
environmental monitoring, and disaster response. While the volume of data
generated has increased significantly, traditional vision models are often
constrained by the requirement for extensive domain-specific labelled data and
their limited ability to understand the context within complex environments.
Vision Language Models offer a complementary approach by integrating visual and
textual data; however, their application to remote sensing remains
underexplored, particularly given their generalist nature. This work
investigates the combination of vision models and VLMs to enhance image
analysis in remote sensing, with a focus on aircraft detection and scene
understanding. The integration of YOLO with VLMs such as LLaVA, ChatGPT, and
Gemini aims to achieve more accurate and contextually aware image
interpretation. Performance is evaluated on both labelled and unlabelled remote
sensing data, as well as degraded image scenarios which are crucial for remote
sensing. The findings show an average MAE improvement of 48.46% across models
in the accuracy of aircraft detection and counting, especially in challenging
conditions, in both raw and degraded scenarios. A 6.17% improvement in
CLIPScore for comprehensive understanding of remote sensing images is obtained.
The proposed approach combining traditional vision models and VLMs paves the
way for more advanced and efficient remote sensing image analysis, especially
in few-shot learning scenarios.

*Kelvin Szolnoky,Anders Blilie,Nita Mulliqi,Toyonori Tsuzuki,Hemamali Samaratunga,Matteo Titus,Xiaoyi Ji,Sol Erika Boman,Einar Gudlaugsson,Svein Reidar Kjosavik,José Asenjo,Marcello Gambacorta,Paolo Libretti,Marcin Braun,Radisław Kordek,Roman Łowicki,Brett Delahunt,Kenneth A. Iczkowski,Theo van der Kwast,Geert J. L. H. van Leenders,Katia R. M. Leite,Chin-Chen Pan,Emiel Adrianus Maria Janssen,Martin Eklund,Lars Egevad,Kimmo Kartasalo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI model using EfficientNetV2-S with multiple instance learning achieves high AUC and intra-/interobserver agreement for cribriform pattern detection in prostate cancer across multi-cohort data, outperforming pathologists on internal data and supporting standardized reporting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cribriform morphology signals poor prognosis in prostate cancer but is underreported and shows high interobserver variability among pathologists; an AI tool could improve detection, consistency, and clinical decision-making.

Method: Deep learning model with EfficientNetV2-S encoder and multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. Trained on 640 digitized core biopsies from 430 patients across three cohorts; internal validation (261 slides, 171 patients) and external validation (266 slides, 104 patients) using independent instruments/labs. Annotations by three expert uropathologists; inter-rater analysis and comparison with nine expert pathologists on 88 internal slides.

Result: Internal AUC 0.97 (95% CI 0.95–0.99); Cohen's kappa 0.81 (95% CI 0.72–0.89). External AUC 0.90 (95% CI 0.86–0.93); Cohen's kappa 0.55 (95% CI 0.45–0.64). Model achieved highest average inter-rater agreement (kappa 0.66; 95% CI 0.57–0.74) compared with nine pathologists (kappa 0.35–0.62).

Conclusion: The AI approach demonstrates pathologist-level performance for cribriform morphology detection and has potential to enhance diagnostic reliability, standardize reporting, and inform treatment decisions in prostate cancer.

Abstract: Background: Cribriform morphology in prostate cancer is a histological
feature that indicates poor prognosis and contraindicates active surveillance.
However, it remains underreported and subject to significant interobserver
variability amongst pathologists. We aimed to develop and validate an AI-based
system to improve cribriform pattern detection.
  Methods: We created a deep learning model using an EfficientNetV2-S encoder
with multiple instance learning for end-to-end whole-slide classification. The
model was trained on 640 digitised prostate core needle biopsies from 430
patients, collected across three cohorts. It was validated internally (261
slides from 171 patients) and externally (266 slides, 104 patients from three
independent cohorts). Internal validation cohorts included laboratories or
scanners from the development set, while external cohorts used completely
independent instruments and laboratories. Annotations were provided by three
expert uropathologists with known high concordance. Additionally, we conducted
an inter-rater analysis and compared the model's performance against nine
expert uropathologists on 88 slides from the internal validation cohort.
  Results: The model showed strong internal validation performance (AUC: 0.97,
95% CI: 0.95-0.99; Cohen's kappa: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) and robust external
validation (AUC: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.93; Cohen's kappa: 0.55, 95% CI:
0.45-0.64). In our inter-rater analysis, the model achieved the highest average
agreement (Cohen's kappa: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.57-0.74), outperforming all nine
pathologists whose Cohen's kappas ranged from 0.35 to 0.62.
  Conclusion: Our AI model demonstrates pathologist-level performance for
cribriform morphology detection in prostate cancer. This approach could enhance
diagnostic reliability, standardise reporting, and improve treatment decisions
for prostate cancer patients.

### [5] [NAPPure: Adversarial Purification for Robust Image Classification under Non-Additive Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14025)
*Junjie Nan,Jianing Li,Wei Chen,Mingkun Zhang,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Presents NAPPure, an extended adversarial purification framework to handle non-additive perturbations (blur, occlusion, distortion) by disentangling clean image and perturbations through likelihood maximization; improves robustness on GTSRB and CIFAR-10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-additive perturbations are common in real-world scenarios; existing purification methods assume additive perturbations and underperform against non-additive attacks; need framework to model non-additive perturbations.

Method: Model generation process of adversarial image; disentangle clean image and perturbation parameters via likelihood maximization; extend purification framework to non-additive perturbations; experiments on GTSRB and CIFAR-10.

Result: NAPPure significantly boosts robustness of image classification models against non-additive perturbations.

Conclusion: Extends adversarial purification to non-additive perturbations; demonstrates effectiveness on benchmark datasets; potential for real-world robustness improvements.

Abstract: Adversarial purification has achieved great success in combating adversarial
image perturbations, which are usually assumed to be additive. However,
non-additive adversarial perturbations such as blur, occlusion, and distortion
are also common in the real world. Under such perturbations, existing
adversarial purification methods are much less effective since they are
designed to fit the additive nature. In this paper, we propose an extended
adversarial purification framework named NAPPure, which can further handle
non-additive perturbations. Specifically, we first establish the generation
process of an adversarial image, and then disentangle the underlying clean
image and perturbation parameters through likelihood maximization. Experiments
on GTSRB and CIFAR-10 datasets show that NAPPure significantly boosts the
robustness of image classification models against non-additive perturbations.

### [6] [Vgent: Graph-based Retrieval-Reasoning-Augmented Generation For Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14032)
*Xiaoqian Shen,Wenxuan Zhang,Jun Chen,Mohamed Elhoseiny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vgent combines graph-based video representation with an intermediate reasoning step to augment LVLMs for long-video understanding, achieving improved retrieval and reasoning and outperforming baselines on MLVU and long-video benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long videos exceed token budgets and challenge LVLMs’ ability to retain long-term dependencies. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation helps LLMs with long contexts, it struggles with temporal coherence and noise in video data. A structured, noise-robust approach is needed for long-video reasoning.

Method: Represent videos as structured graphs that preserve semantic relationships across clips to enhance retrieval. Introduce an intermediate reasoning step with structured verification to mitigate LVLM limitations and explicitly aggregate relevant information across clips across the graph. Evaluate with multiple open-source LVLMs on three long-video benchmarks; provide public code.

Result: 3.0%–5.4% improvement over base models on MLVU; outperforms state-of-the-art video RAG methods by 8.6%.

Conclusion: Graph-based retrieval with an intermediate reasoning step improves long-video understanding in LVLMs, offering better retrieval quality and reasoning accuracy. The work provides reproducible results (code release).

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over long videos pose significant challenges for
large video language models (LVLMs) due to the difficulty in processing
intensive video tokens beyond context window and retaining long-term sequential
information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated
effectiveness in processing long context for Large Language Models (LLMs);
however, applying RAG to long video faces challenges such as disrupted temporal
dependencies and inclusion of irrelevant information that can hinder accurate
reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Vgent, a novel graph-based
retrieval-reasoning-augmented generation framework to enhance LVLMs for long
video understanding. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (i) It
represents videos by structured graphs with semantic relationships across video
clips preserved to improve retrieval effectiveness. (ii) It introduces an
intermediate reasoning step to mitigate the reasoning limitation of LVLMs,
which leverages structured verification to reduce retrieval noise and
facilitate the explicit aggregation of relevant information across clips,
resulting in more accurate and context-aware responses. We comprehensively
evaluate our framework with various open-source LVLMs on three long-video
understanding benchmarks. Our approach yielded an overall performance
improvement of $3.0\%\sim 5.4\%$ over base models on MLVU, and outperformed
state-of-the-art video RAG methods by $8.6\%$. Our code is publicly available
at https://xiaoqian-shen.github.io/Vgent.

### [7] [Synchronization of Multiple Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14051)
*Avihai Naaman,Ron Shapira Weber,Oren Freifeld*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Temporal Prototype Learning (TPL) constructs a shared 1D prototype sequence from high-dimensional embeddings to synchronize videos across scenes and generative AI sources, avoiding exhaustive pairwise matching; it improves accuracy and efficiency and supports fine-grained frame retrieval and phase classification; claims to be the first to address synchronization of multiple generative AI videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synchronizing videos from different scenes or from multiple generative AI sources is difficult due to diverse subjects, backgrounds, and nonlinear temporal misalignment; existing methods relying on pairwise matching do not scale or robustly handle such variability.

Method: TPL learns a unified, compact 1D prototype sequence by aggregating embeddings from pretrained models into a shared representation; this prototype anchors key action phases and enables robust alignment without exhaustive pairwise comparisons.

Result: Empirical results show improved synchronization accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across diverse datasets, including fine-grained frame retrieval and phase classification; demonstrates capability to mitigate synchronization issues in multiple generative AI videos depicting the same action.

Conclusion: TPL provides a robust, scalable framework for cross-domain video synchronization by using a prototype-based 1D representation; avoids pairwise matching and supports multiple encoder sources; code and a new dataset are released for further research.

Abstract: Synchronizing videos captured simultaneously from multiple cameras in the
same scene is often easy and typically requires only simple time shifts.
However, synchronizing videos from different scenes or, more recently,
generative AI videos, poses a far more complex challenge due to diverse
subjects, backgrounds, and nonlinear temporal misalignment. We propose Temporal
Prototype Learning (TPL), a prototype-based framework that constructs a shared,
compact 1D representation from high-dimensional embeddings extracted by any of
various pretrained models. TPL robustly aligns videos by learning a unified
prototype sequence that anchors key action phases, thereby avoiding exhaustive
pairwise matching. Our experiments show that TPL improves synchronization
accuracy, efficiency, and robustness across diverse datasets, including
fine-grained frame retrieval and phase classification tasks. Importantly, TPL
is the first approach to mitigate synchronization issues in multiple generative
AI videos depicting the same action. Our code and a new multiple video
synchronization dataset are available at https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/TPL/

### [8] [Capture, Canonicalize, Splat: Zero-Shot 3D Gaussian Avatars from Unstructured Phone Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14081)
*Emanuel Garbin,Guy Adam,Oded Krams,Zohar Barzelay,Eran Guendelman,Michael Schwarz,Moran Vatelmacher,Yigal Shenkman,Eli Peker,Itai Druker,Uri Patish,Yoav Blum,Max Bluvstein,Junxuan Li,Rawal Khirodkar,Shunsuke Saito*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot pipeline that converts unstructured phone images into hyperrealistic, identity-preserving 3D avatars using a canonicalization step and a transformer trained on a dome-captured, high-fidelity Gaussian-splat dataset, enabling static quarter-body avatars from casual photos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-view methods struggle with geometric inconsistencies and hallucinations, degrading identity; synthetic training data misses high-frequency details (skin, hair). A robust, unstructured-view pipeline is needed to preserve identity and realism without extensive per-subject data.

Method: 1) Generative canonicalization module transforms multiple unstructured views into a standardized, consistent representation. 2) A transformer-based model trained on a large-scale dataset of high-fidelity Gaussian splatting avatars derived from dome captures of real people. The pipeline is labeled 'Capture, Canonicalize, Splat' and outputs static quarter-body avatars.

Result: The proposed zero-shot pipeline produces static quarter-body avatars that exhibit strong realism and robust identity preservation from unstructured photos, addressing key limitations of prior single-view and synthetic-data based approaches.

Conclusion: The Capture, Canonicalize, Splat framework effectively combines canonicalization with a data-driven, generative 3D representation to enable realistic, identity-preserving avatars from casual images, though it is focused on static quarter-body outputs and may depend on the quality and diversity of the dome-derived training data.

Abstract: We present a novel, zero-shot pipeline for creating hyperrealistic,
identity-preserving 3D avatars from a few unstructured phone images. Existing
methods face several challenges: single-view approaches suffer from geometric
inconsistencies and hallucinations, degrading identity preservation, while
models trained on synthetic data fail to capture high-frequency details like
skin wrinkles and fine hair, limiting realism. Our method introduces two key
contributions: (1) a generative canonicalization module that processes multiple
unstructured views into a standardized, consistent representation, and (2) a
transformer-based model trained on a new, large-scale dataset of high-fidelity
Gaussian splatting avatars derived from dome captures of real people. This
"Capture, Canonicalize, Splat" pipeline produces static quarter-body avatars
with compelling realism and robust identity preservation from unstructured
photos.

### [9] [cubic: CUDA-accelerated 3D Bioimage Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14143)
*Alexandr A. Kalinin,Anne E. Carpenter,Shantanu Singh,Matthew J. O'Meara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: cubic is an open-source Python library that GPU-accelerates common bioimage analysis tasks by augmenting SciPy/scikit-image with CuPy/cuCIM, enabling scalable 2D/3D processing and seamless CPU/GPU execution while preserving algorithmic fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As 2D/3D bioimage datasets grow, existing tools struggle with scalability, GPU acceleration, APIs, and 3D capabilities. There is a need for a programmable, interoperable, GPU-backed workflow that integrates with the Python scientific stack.

Method: Augmenting SciPy/scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated counterparts from CuPy and cuCIM; a device-agnostic API that dispatches to GPU when data reside on the device and to CPU otherwise; supports preprocessing, segmentation, and feature extraction for 2D and 3D data; evaluated via benchmarks and replication of deconvolution/segmentation pipelines.

Result: Achieves substantial speedups over CPU baselines while maintaining algorithmic fidelity; reproduces existing deconvolution and segmentation pipelines; emphasizes scalable, reproducible, GPU-accelerated bioimage analysis that integrates with Python ecosystem.

Conclusion: Provides a robust foundation for scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis with broad interoperability and support for interactive as well as automated high-throughput workflows, via an open-source API that seamlessly leverages GPU acceleration when available.

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of multidimensional biological images is useful for
understanding complex cellular phenotypes and accelerating advances in
biomedical research. As modern microscopy generates ever-larger 2D and 3D
datasets, existing computational approaches are increasingly limited by their
scalability, efficiency, and integration with modern scientific computing
workflows. Existing bioimage analysis tools often lack application programmable
interfaces (APIs), do not support graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration,
lack broad 3D image processing capabilities, and/or have poor interoperability
for compute-heavy workflows. Here, we introduce cubic, an open-source Python
library that addresses these challenges by augmenting widely used SciPy and
scikit-image APIs with GPU-accelerated alternatives from CuPy and RAPIDS cuCIM.
cubic's API is device-agnostic and dispatches operations to GPU when data
reside on the device and otherwise executes on CPU, seamlessly accelerating a
broad range of image processing routines. This approach enables GPU
acceleration of existing bioimage analysis workflows, from preprocessing to
segmentation and feature extraction for 2D and 3D data. We evaluate cubic both
by benchmarking individual operations and by reproducing existing deconvolution
and segmentation pipelines, achieving substantial speedups while maintaining
algorithmic fidelity. These advances establish a robust foundation for
scalable, reproducible bioimage analysis that integrates with the broader
Python scientific computing ecosystem, including other GPU-accelerated methods,
enabling both interactive exploration and automated high-throughput analysis
workflows. cubic is openly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data-driven framework for multi-view identity preservation and 3D camera control in video diffusion, using 4D Gaussian Splatting and relighting to train customizable characters; it supports multi-subject generation via joint training or noise blending for efficient virtual production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve consistent identity across viewpoints, controllable camera/lighting, and flexible composition of multiple customized subjects in video diffusion for virtual production—areas where existing models struggle with multi-view consistency, dynamic lighting, and scalable multi-subject customization.

Method: Train a character-consistency component on volumetric captures re-rendered with diverse camera trajectories via 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) and lighting variability with a video relighting model. Fine-tune open-source video diffusion models on this data to enable strong multi-view identity preservation, accurate camera control, and lighting adaptability. Support multi-subject generation through two approaches: (1) joint training and (2) noise blending, enabling efficient composition of independently customized models at inference. Additional capabilities include scene/real-life video customization, motion control, and spatial layout control during customization.

Result: Extensive experiments show improved video quality, higher personalization accuracy, and enhanced camera control and lighting adaptability, facilitating better integration of video generation into virtual production. The framework enables multi-subject generation and efficient inference-time composition.

Conclusion: This work advances the practical deployment of video generation in virtual production by delivering a comprehensive customization pipeline that achieves multi-view consistency, robust camera/lighting control, and scalable multi-subject customization; project page available.

Abstract: We introduce a framework that enables both multi-view character consistency
and 3D camera control in video diffusion models through a novel customization
data pipeline. We train the character consistency component with recorded
volumetric capture performances re-rendered with diverse camera trajectories
via 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), lighting variability obtained with a video
relighting model. We fine-tune state-of-the-art open-source video diffusion
models on this data to provide strong multi-view identity preservation, precise
camera control, and lighting adaptability. Our framework also supports core
capabilities for virtual production, including multi-subject generation using
two approaches: joint training and noise blending, the latter enabling
efficient composition of independently customized models at inference time; it
also achieves scene and real-life video customization as well as control over
motion and spatial layout during customization. Extensive experiments show
improved video quality, higher personalization accuracy, and enhanced camera
control and lighting adaptability, advancing the integration of video
generation into virtual production. Our project page is available at:

### [11] [Joint Modeling of Big Five and HEXACO for Multimodal Apparent Personality-trait Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14203)
*Ryo Masumura,Shota Orihashi,Mana Ihori,Tomohiro Tanaka,Naoki Makishima,Taiga Yamane,Naotaka Kawata,Satoshi Suzuki,Taichi Katayama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A joint multitask model predicts both Big Five and HEXACO personality traits from multimodal behavior, showing effective recognition and potential insights into trait relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Big Five is well-studied; HEXACO is gaining attention; there is a gap in joint modeling and understanding how the two trait models relate when learned by machine learning.

Method: An end-to-end joint modeling framework that simultaneously predicts Big Five and HEXACO from multimodal data (e.g., self-introduction videos), optimizing for both tasks.

Result: Experiments on a self-introduction video dataset indicate the proposed method effectively recognizes both Big Five and HEXACO traits, demonstrating the benefits of joint optimization.

Conclusion: Jointly modeling Big Five and HEXACO enhances apparent personality recognition and advances understanding of how the two trait frameworks relate within machine learning.

Abstract: This paper proposes a joint modeling method of the Big Five, which has long
been studied, and HEXACO, which has recently attracted attention in psychology,
for automatically recognizing apparent personality traits from multimodal human
behavior. Most previous studies have used the Big Five for multimodal apparent
personality-trait recognition. However, no study has focused on apparent HEXACO
which can evaluate an Honesty-Humility trait related to displaced aggression
and vengefulness, social-dominance orientation, etc. In addition, the
relationships between the Big Five and HEXACO when modeled by machine learning
have not been clarified. We expect awareness of multimodal human behavior to
improve by considering these relationships. The key advance of our proposed
method is to optimize jointly recognizing the Big Five and HEXACO. Experiments
using a self-introduction video dataset demonstrate that the proposed method
can effectively recognize the Big Five and HEXACO.

### [12] [LOTA: Bit-Planes Guided AI-Generated Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14230)
*Hongsong Wang,Renxi Cheng,Yang Zhang,Chaolei Han,Jie Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bit-plane guided noisy image analysis (LOTA) for fast, cross-generator AI-image detection using bit-plane noise features, achieving 98.9% accuracy on GenImage with millisecond processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reconstruction-error based detectors are costly and miss intrinsic noise; need efficient, robust features capturing noise in raw images to distinguish GAN/Diffusion outputs from real images and generalize across generators.

Method: Refine error extraction via bit-plane processing; leverage lower bit planes to capture noise; introduce bit-planes guided noisy image generation; apply scaling/thresholding for normalization; use maximum gradient patch selection with multi-directional gradients to amplify noise score; develop lightweight classification heads: noise-based and noise-guided.

Result: On GenImage benchmark, average accuracy 98.9%, +11.9% improvement; cross-generator accuracy: GAN->Diffusion >98.2%, Diffusion->GAN >99.2%; detection speed: millisecond-level, ~100x faster than existing methods; code at github.

Conclusion: Proposes a fast, high-accuracy, cross-generator generalizable detector leveraging bit-plane noise features; efficient enough for real-time applications; outperforms existing approaches.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GAN and Diffusion models makes it more difficult to
distinguish AI-generated images from real ones. Recent studies often use
image-based reconstruction errors as an important feature for determining
whether an image is AI-generated. However, these approaches typically incur
high computational costs and also fail to capture intrinsic noisy features
present in the raw images. To solve these problems, we innovatively refine
error extraction by using bit-plane-based image processing, as lower bit planes
indeed represent noise patterns in images. We introduce an effective bit-planes
guided noisy image generation and exploit various image normalization
strategies, including scaling and thresholding. Then, to amplify the noise
signal for easier AI-generated image detection, we design a maximum gradient
patch selection that applies multi-directional gradients to compute the noise
score and selects the region with the highest score. Finally, we propose a
lightweight and effective classification head and explore two different
structures: noise-based classifier and noise-guided classifier. Extensive
experiments on the GenImage benchmark demonstrate the outstanding performance
of our method, which achieves an average accuracy of \textbf{98.9\%}
(\textbf{11.9}\%~$\uparrow$) and shows excellent cross-generator generalization
capability. Particularly, our method achieves an accuracy of over 98.2\% from
GAN to Diffusion and over 99.2\% from Diffusion to GAN. Moreover, it performs
error extraction at the millisecond level, nearly a hundred times faster than
existing methods. The code is at https://github.com/hongsong-wang/LOTA.

### [13] [PIA: Deepfake Detection Using Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14241)
*Soumyya Kanti Datta,Tanvi Ranga,Chengzhe Sun,Siwei Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal audio-visual detector (PIA) detects deepfakes by fusing phoneme cues, lip motion, and facial identity embeddings to catch subtle temporal inconsistencies that unimodal detectors miss; code available on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes are increasingly realistic, but existing detectors rely on single modalities or fixed phoneme-viseme thresholds and often miss micro-temporal discrepancies introduced by advanced generators (GANs, diffusion, neural rendering). A multimodal approach can exploit cross-modal inconsistencies.

Method: Introduce Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic Analysis (PIA), a multimodal framework that combines language (phoneme sequences), dynamic face motion (lip geometry), and identity embeddings to detect inconsistencies across modalities and improve detection of subtle manipulations.

Result: Significant improvement in detecting subtle deepfake alterations by leveraging cross-modal cues (phoneme, lip motion, and identity signals); code for the framework is available at the referenced GitHub repository.

Conclusion: Multimodal integration with phoneme, motion, and identity cues enhances deepfake detection over conventional unimodal methods and is applicable to advanced generative models.

Abstract: The rise of manipulated media has made deepfakes a particularly insidious
threat, involving various generative manipulations such as lip-sync
modifications, face-swaps, and avatar-driven facial synthesis. Conventional
detection methods, which predominantly depend on manually designed
phoneme-viseme alignment thresholds, fundamental frame-level consistency
checks, or a unimodal detection strategy, inadequately identify modern-day
deepfakes generated by advanced generative models such as GANs, diffusion
models, and neural rendering techniques. These advanced techniques generate
nearly perfect individual frames yet inadvertently create minor temporal
discrepancies frequently overlooked by traditional detectors. We present a
novel multimodal audio-visual framework, Phoneme-Temporal and Identity-Dynamic
Analysis(PIA), incorporating language, dynamic face motion, and facial
identification cues to address these limitations. We utilize phoneme sequences,
lip geometry data, and advanced facial identity embeddings. This integrated
method significantly improves the detection of subtle deepfake alterations by
identifying inconsistencies across multiple complementary modalities. Code is

### [14] [Event Interval Modulation: A Novel Scheme for Event-based Optical Camera Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14245)
*Miu Sumino,Mayu Ishii,Shun Kaizu,Daisuke Hisano,Yu Nakayama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Event Interval Modulation (EIM) enables data transmission in event-based OCC by encoding information in the intervals between EVS events, achieving higher speeds than conventional schemes; experiments report 28 kbps at 10 m and 8.4 kbps at 50 m indoors, setting a new benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of frame-based OCC (low bit rate, high processing load) by leveraging the fast, asynchronous, high-dynamic-range nature of event-based vision sensors, and to develop a modulation that fully exploits EVS characteristics.

Method: Propose and model EIM modulation, tune EVS parameters for optimized frequency response for EIM, experimentally determine maximum usable modulation order, and perform indoor transmission experiments to validate performance.

Result: Successful transmission at 28 kbps over 10 m and 8.4 kbps over 50 m in indoor environments using the proposed EIM scheme, establishing a new performance benchmark for event-based OCC.

Conclusion: EIM effectively increases transmission speed for event-based OCC and demonstrates the EVS’s potential for high-rate optical communications; further optimization and real-world deployment are promising directions.

Abstract: Optical camera communication (OCC) represents a promising visible light
communication technology. Nonetheless, typical OCC systems utilizing
frame-based cameras are encumbered by limitations, including low bit rate and
high processing load. To address these issues, OCC system utilizing an
event-based vision sensor (EVS) as receivers have been proposed. The EVS
enables high-speed, low-latency, and robust communication due to its
asynchronous operation and high dynamic range. In existing event-based OCC
systems, conventional modulation schemes such as on-off keying (OOK) and pulse
position modulation have been applied, however, to the best of our knowledge,
no modulation method has been proposed that fully exploits the unique
characteristics of the EVS. This paper proposes a novel modulation scheme,
called the event interval modulation (EIM) scheme, specifically designed for
event-based OCC. EIM enables improvement in transmission speed by modulating
information using the intervals between events. This paper proposes a
theoretical model of EIM and conducts a proof-of-concept experiment. First, the
parameters of the EVS are tuned and customized to optimize the frequency
response specifically for EIM. Then, the maximum modulation order usable in EIM
is determined experimentally. We conduct transmission experiments based on the
obtained parameters. Finally, we report successful transmission at 28 kbps over
10 meters and 8.4 kbps over 50 meters in an indoor environment. This sets a new
benchmark for bit rate in event-based OCC systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MACE: a mixed-expert accelerated coordinate encoding for large-scale localization that uses a gating MOE-like network to activate a single sub-network per query, plus ALF-LB load balancing, achieving efficient localization and high-quality rendering with minimal training (Cambridge set; ~10 min).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SCR methods work well in small scenes but struggle to scale due to limited capacity and high computation. There is a need for scalable, accurate localization and rendering in large-scale scenes.

Method: Introduce a gating network to implicitly classify and select sub-networks from a pool, ensuring only a single sub-network is activated during inference (MOE-inspired). Add Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing (ALF-LB) to improve localization accuracy on large-scale scenes. Evaluate on large-scale datasets (Cambridge test set) and report efficient training.

Result: Demonstrates significant cost reduction while maintaining higher precision; achieves high-quality rendering with only 10 minutes of training on the Cambridge test set.

Conclusion: MACE offers an efficient, scalable solution for large-scale scene localization and rendering by combining MOE-based gating with an auxiliary-loss-free load-balancing strategy, though further experiments on more datasets and ablations would strengthen claims.

Abstract: Efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes
remain a significant challenge due to the computational cost involved. While
Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods perform well in small-scale
localization, they are limited by the capacity of a single network when
extended to large-scale scenes. To address these challenges, we propose the
Mixed Expert-based Accelerated Coordinate Encoding method (MACE), which enables
efficient localization and high-quality rendering in large-scale scenes.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of MOE in large model domains, we
introduce a gating network to implicitly classify and select sub-networks,
ensuring that only a single sub-network is activated during each inference.
Furtheremore, we present Auxiliary-Loss-Free Load Balancing(ALF-LB) strategy to
enhance the localization accuracy on large-scale scene. Our framework provides
a significant reduction in costs while maintaining higher precision, offering
an efficient solution for large-scale scene applications. Additional
experiments on the Cambridge test set demonstrate that our method achieves
high-quality rendering results with merely 10 minutes of training.

### [16] [Identity-Preserving Image-to-Video Generation via Reward-Guided Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14255)
*Liao Shen,Wentao Jiang,Yiran Zhu,Tiezheng Ge,Zhiguo Cao,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IPRO is a reinforcement-learning-based tuning framework for diffusion-model–driven image-to-video generation that aims to preserve identity in human-centric videos. It uses a face identity scorer as a reward, backpropagates the reward through the final sampling steps for richer gradients, and introduces a facial scoring mechanism that pools facial features from ground-truth videos for multi-angle identity cues, with KL-divergence regularization to stabilize training. It avoids architectural changes and is validated on Wan 2.2 I2V and an in-house model, with code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identity drift in I2V during expression changes or motion, especially when the face occupies a small image region, causes perceptual identity inconsistencies. There is a need for a lightweight tuning-based approach that preserves identity without altering model architectures.

Method: Reinforcement-learning–based optimization of diffusion models using a face identity scorer as the reward signal. Backpropagation through the last steps of the sampling chain to provide richer gradients. A novel facial scoring mechanism treats faces from ground-truth videos as a feature pool to supply multi-angle identity cues. KL-divergence regularization is applied to stabilize training and mitigate overfitting to the reward. No modifications to model architecture or auxiliary modules; tuning only.

Result: Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V and an in-house I2V model show that IPRO effectively preserves identity during video synthesis (precise metrics not specified in the abstract).

Conclusion: IPRO offers a direct tuning approach to improve identity preservation in I2V without changing model architectures or adding modules, and leverages multi-angle facial information via face feature pools; code is released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Recent advances in image-to-video (I2V) generation have achieved remarkable
progress in synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent videos from static
images. Among all the applications of I2V, human-centric video generation
includes a large portion. However, existing I2V models encounter difficulties
in maintaining identity consistency between the input human image and the
generated video, especially when the person in the video exhibits significant
expression changes and movements. This issue becomes critical when the human
face occupies merely a small fraction of the image. Since humans are highly
sensitive to identity variations, this poses a critical yet under-explored
challenge in I2V generation. In this paper, we propose Identity-Preserving
Reward-guided Optimization (IPRO), a novel video diffusion framework based on
reinforcement learning to enhance identity preservation. Instead of introducing
auxiliary modules or altering model architectures, our approach introduces a
direct and effective tuning algorithm that optimizes diffusion models using a
face identity scorer. To improve performance and accelerate convergence, our
method backpropagates the reward signal through the last steps of the sampling
chain, enabling richer gradient feedback. We also propose a novel facial
scoring mechanism that treats faces in ground-truth videos as facial feature
pools, providing multi-angle facial information to enhance generalization. A
KL-divergence regularization is further incorporated to stabilize training and
prevent overfitting to the reward signal. Extensive experiments on Wan 2.2 I2V
model and our in-house I2V model demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

*Xiangyu Meng,Zixian Zhang,Zhenghao Zhang,Junchao Liao,Long Qin,Weizhi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Identity-GRPO introduces a human-feedback-driven optimization pipeline to improve multi-human identity preservation in video generation. It uses a video reward model trained on a large-scale preference dataset (human-annotated and synthetic distortions) and a GRPO variant for multi-human consistency, showing up to 18.9% gains in human-consistency metrics over baselines like VACE and Phantom.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video-generation systems (e.g., VACE, Phantom) struggle to keep consistent identities across multiple humans in dynamic scenes, which is essential for believable multi-person synthesis.

Method: 1) Train a video reward model on a large preference dataset with human annotations and synthetic distortions focused on preserving human consistency. 2) Apply a GRPO variant tailored for multi-human consistency to refine policy optimization. 3) Conduct ablations on annotation quality and design choices. 4) Evaluate on improvements to VACE and Phantom and report human-consistency gains.

Result: Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human-consistency metrics over baseline methods, with ablations highlighting the impact of annotation quality and design choices on policy optimization.

Conclusion: A human-feedback-driven RL approach (Identity-GRPO) effectively improves multi-human identity preservation in video generation, offering actionable insights for aligning reinforcement learning with personalized video creation.

Abstract: While advanced methods like VACE and Phantom have advanced video generation
for specific subjects in diverse scenarios, they struggle with multi-human
identity preservation in dynamic interactions, where consistent identities
across multiple characters are critical. To address this, we propose
Identity-GRPO, a human feedback-driven optimization pipeline for refining
multi-human identity-preserving video generation. First, we construct a video
reward model trained on a large-scale preference dataset containing
human-annotated and synthetic distortion data, with pairwise annotations
focused on maintaining human consistency throughout the video. We then employ a
GRPO variant tailored for multi-human consistency, which greatly enhances both
VACE and Phantom. Through extensive ablation studies, we evaluate the impact of
annotation quality and design choices on policy optimization. Experiments show
that Identity-GRPO achieves up to 18.9% improvement in human consistency
metrics over baseline methods, offering actionable insights for aligning
reinforcement learning with personalized video generation.

### [18] [MatchAttention: Matching the Relative Positions for High-Resolution Cross-View Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14260)
*Tingman Yan,Tao Liu,Xilian Yang,Qunfei Zhao,Zeyang Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MatchAttention with BilinearSoftmax for dynamic, position-aware cross-view matching; introduces MatchDecoder, gated cross-MatchAttention, and consistency loss to handle occlusions; achieves state-of-the-art and real-time performance on stereo benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-view matching is hampered by quadratic complexity and weak explicit matching constraints in standard cross-attention; high-resolution matching requires explicit relative-position modeling and occlusion robustness at low latency.

Method: Dynamic relative-position sampling via MatchAttention; BilinearSoftmax enables differentiable sliding-window attention; iterative updates of relative positions through residual connections embedded in feature channels; hierarchical MatchDecoder; gated cross-MatchAttention; consistency-constrained loss; applied to stereo matching.

Result: MatchStereo-B ranked 1st in average error on the Middlebury stereo benchmark; 29 ms inference at KITTI resolution; 4K UHD processing in 0.1 s with 3 GB RAM; state-of-the-art on KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, and Spring flow.

Conclusion: The approach achieves high accuracy with low computational cost, enabling real-time, high-resolution cross-view matching and robust occlusion handling.

Abstract: Cross-view matching is fundamentally achieved through cross-attention
mechanisms. However, matching of high-resolution images remains challenging due
to the quadratic complexity and lack of explicit matching constraints in the
existing cross-attention. This paper proposes an attention mechanism,
MatchAttention, that dynamically matches relative positions. The relative
position determines the attention sampling center of the key-value pairs given
a query. Continuous and differentiable sliding-window attention sampling is
achieved by the proposed BilinearSoftmax. The relative positions are
iteratively updated through residual connections across layers by embedding
them into the feature channels. Since the relative position is exactly the
learning target for cross-view matching, an efficient hierarchical cross-view
decoder, MatchDecoder, is designed with MatchAttention as its core component.
To handle cross-view occlusions, gated cross-MatchAttention and a
consistency-constrained loss are proposed. These two components collectively
mitigate the impact of occlusions in both forward and backward passes, allowing
the model to focus more on learning matching relationships. When applied to
stereo matching, MatchStereo-B ranked 1st in average error on the public
Middlebury benchmark and requires only 29ms for KITTI-resolution inference.
MatchStereo-T can process 4K UHD images in 0.1 seconds using only 3GB of GPU
memory. The proposed models also achieve state-of-the-art performance on KITTI
2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, and Spring flow datasets. The combination of high
accuracy and low computational complexity makes real-time, high-resolution, and
high-accuracy cross-view matching possible. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GauSSmart is a hybrid 2D-3D method that uses 2D priors and DINO features to densify and refine Gaussian Splatting, improving scene coverage and detail; it outperforms standard Gaussian Splatting on most scenes across three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian Splatting excels on large datasets but struggles with fine details and sparse coverage. Integrating 2D foundational models and segmentation priors can provide priors to guide 3D reconstruction, addressing these limitations.

Method: Combine 2D techniques (convex filtering, semantic supervision) and 2D feature embeddings from foundational models (e.g., DINO) with 3D Gaussian Splatting. Use 2D segmentation priors and high-dimensional features to densify and refine Gaussian splats, enhancing coverage in underrepresented regions while preserving structural details.

Result: Validated on three datasets; GauSSmart consistently outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes.

Conclusion: Hybrid 2D-3D approaches leveraging 2D priors and features can overcome limitations of purely 3D methods, offering improved coverage and detail in scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Scene reconstruction has emerged as a central challenge in computer vision,
with approaches such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting
achieving remarkable progress. While Gaussian Splatting demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets, it often struggles to capture fine details
or maintain realism in regions with sparse coverage, largely due to the
inherent limitations of sparse 3D training data.
  In this work, we propose GauSSmart, a hybrid method that effectively bridges
2D foundational models and 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Our approach
integrates established 2D computer vision techniques, including convex
filtering and semantic feature supervision from foundational models such as
DINO, to enhance Gaussian-based scene reconstruction. By leveraging 2D
segmentation priors and high-dimensional feature embeddings, our method guides
the densification and refinement of Gaussian splats, improving coverage in
underrepresented areas and preserving intricate structural details.
  We validate our approach across three datasets, where GauSSmart consistently
outperforms existing Gaussian Splatting in the majority of evaluated scenes.
Our results demonstrate the significant potential of hybrid 2D-3D approaches,
highlighting how the thoughtful combination of 2D foundational models with 3D
reconstruction pipelines can overcome the limitations inherent in either
approach alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift from acquisition processes and data sources impairs generalization of deep learning models. Existing methods emphasize statistical alignment but often ignore causal structure and confounding.

Method: Proposes a causal-inference framework that leverages semantic features and mitigates confounders via the front-door adjustment. It designs transformation strategies that explicitly incorporate mediators and observed tissue slides to isolate causal effects across domains.

Result: Evaluated on CAMELYON17 and a private histopathology dataset with consistent improvements on unseen domains; up to 7% improvement over baselines.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of causal inference, specifically front-door-based methods, for addressing domain shift in histopathology image analysis.

Abstract: Domain shift in histopathology, often caused by differences in acquisition
processes or data sources, poses a major challenge to the generalization
ability of deep learning models. Existing methods primarily rely on modeling
statistical correlations by aligning feature distributions or introducing
statistical variation, yet they often overlook causal relationships. In this
work, we propose a novel causal-inference-based framework that leverages
semantic features while mitigating the impact of confounders. Our method
implements the front-door principle by designing transformation strategies that
explicitly incorporate mediators and observed tissue slides. We validate our
method on the CAMELYON17 dataset and a private histopathology dataset,
demonstrating consistent performance gains across unseen domains. As a result,
our approach achieved up to a 7% improvement in both the CAMELYON17 dataset and
the private histopathology dataset, outperforming existing baselines. These
results highlight the potential of causal inference as a powerful tool for
addressing domain shift in histopathology image analysis.

TL;DR: Training-free tri-layer contrastive decoding with watermarking reduces hallucinations in LVLMs by layer selection and a pivot grounding check; achieves state-of-the-art on POPE/MME/AMBER.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs risk hallucinations and over-reliance on a single modality; grounding without retraining is desirable.

Method: Three-step decoding: (1) select a mature and an amateur layer among decoding layers, (2) identify a pivot layer using a watermark-related question to assess visual grounding, (3) apply tri-layer contrastive decoding to generate final output; watermarking aids grounding; training-free.

Result: Experiments on POPE, MME, AMBER show state-of-the-art reduction in hallucinations and more visually grounded responses.

Conclusion: Training-free tri-layer contrastive decoding with watermarking is an effective approach to mitigate hallucinations and improve grounding in LVLMs without additional training.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently shown promising results on
various multimodal tasks, even achieving human-comparable performance in
certain cases. Nevertheless, LVLMs remain prone to hallucinations -- they often
rely heavily on a single modality or memorize training data without properly
grounding their outputs. To address this, we propose a training-free, tri-layer
contrastive decoding with watermarking, which proceeds in three steps: (1)
select a mature layer and an amateur layer among the decoding layers, (2)
identify a pivot layer using a watermark-related question to assess whether the
layer is visually well-grounded, and (3) apply tri-layer contrastive decoding
to generate the final output. Experiments on public benchmarks such as POPE,
MME and AMBER demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
in reducing hallucinations in LVLMs and generates more visually grounded
responses.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-GAN-based multi-domain framework (MID-StyleGAN) generates synthetic iris images across bonafide, printed eyes, and cosmetic contact lens domains, significantly improving PAD performance and alleviating data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Iris PAD suffers from limited real PA data and dataset scarcity. Synthetic multi-domain ocular data can train robust PAD systems and enable better domain coverage (bonafide and various PAs).

Method: Introduce MID-StyleGAN, a multi-domain diffusion-GAN architecture that translates between bonafide and PA domains (printed eyes, cosmetic lenses). It uses adaptive loss functions tailored for ocular data to preserve domain consistency and realism across domains.

Result: MID-StyleGAN produces high-quality, diverse synthetic ocular images and enhances PAD performance. On LivDet2020, true detect rate at 1% false detect rate improved from 93.41% to 98.72%, indicating strong practical impact.

Conclusion: MID-StyleGAN offers scalable, cross-domain synthetic data generation for iris/ocular biometrics, addressing data scarcity and boosting PAD effectiveness across multiple attack scenarios.

Abstract: An iris biometric system can be compromised by presentation attacks (PAs)
where artifacts such as artificial eyes, printed eye images, or cosmetic
contact lenses are presented to the system. To counteract this, several
presentation attack detection (PAD) methods have been developed. However, there
is a scarcity of datasets for training and evaluating iris PAD techniques due
to the implicit difficulties in constructing and imaging PAs. To address this,
we introduce the Multi-domain Image Translative Diffusion StyleGAN
(MID-StyleGAN), a new framework for generating synthetic ocular images that
captures the PA and bonafide characteristics in multiple domains such as
bonafide, printed eyes and cosmetic contact lens. MID-StyleGAN combines the
strengths of diffusion models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) to
produce realistic and diverse synthetic data. Our approach utilizes a
multi-domain architecture that enables the translation between bonafide ocular
images and different PA domains. The model employs an adaptive loss function
tailored for ocular data to maintain domain consistency. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MID-StyleGAN outperforms existing methods in generating
high-quality synthetic ocular images. The generated data was used to
significantly enhance the performance of PAD systems, providing a scalable
solution to the data scarcity problem in iris and ocular biometrics. For
example, on the LivDet2020 dataset, the true detect rate at 1% false detect
rate improved from 93.41% to 98.72%, showcasing the impact of the proposed
method.

TL;DR: VaCo enhances multimodal LLMs by Vision-Centric activation and coordination across multiple VFMs, using MTQs, VALs, and a Token Gateway Mask to fuse task-aware visual features and unify textual+visual outputs, improving visual reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs are trained mainly with next-token prediction on text, neglecting vision-centric information essential for analytical capabilities. Leveraging diverse vision foundation models (VFMs) and coordinating their signals can improve visual understanding and analytical performance.

Method: VaCo introduces Visual Discriminative Alignment and integrates learnable Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) into MLLMs. It activates specific visual signals under supervision from multiple VFMs and uses a Token Gateway Mask (TGM) to restrict information flow among groups of MTQs to resolve cross-VFM conflicts.

Result: Extensive experiments show VaCo significantly boosts the performance of different MLLMs across various benchmarks, demonstrating enhanced visual comprehension and analytical abilities.

Conclusion: VaCo provides a generalizable framework to align visual signals from multiple VFMs with MLLMs, unifying textual and visual outputs and mitigating cross-VFM conflicts to strengthen multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) integrate image features from visual
encoders with LLMs, demonstrating advanced comprehension capabilities. However,
mainstream MLLMs are solely supervised by the next-token prediction of textual
tokens, neglecting critical vision-centric information essential for analytical
abilities. To track this dilemma, we introduce VaCo, which optimizes MLLM
representations through Vision-Centric activation and Coordination from
multiple vision foundation models (VFMs). VaCo introduces visual discriminative
alignment to integrate task-aware perceptual features extracted from VFMs,
thereby unifying the optimization of both textual and visual outputs in MLLMs.
Specifically, we incorporate the learnable Modular Task Queries (MTQs) and
Visual Alignment Layers (VALs) into MLLMs, activating specific visual signals
under the supervision of diverse VFMs. To coordinate representation conflicts
across VFMs, the crafted Token Gateway Mask (TGM) restricts the information
flow among multiple groups of MTQs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VaCo
significantly improves the performance of different MLLMs on various
benchmarks, showcasing its superior capabilities in visual comprehension.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cycle-consistent keypoints for improved RGB-D registration and a GRU-based pose block; achieves state-of-the-art self-supervised results on ScanNet and 3DMatch, outperforming some supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is abundant unlabeled RGB-D data; traditional registration methods rely on geometric/feature-based similarity and may not leverage cycle-consistency or temporal history. Cycle-consistency and history-aware modeling offer a self-supervised signal and better correspondence.

Method: Use cycle-consistent keypoints as salient points to enforce spatial coherence during matching. Introduce a pose block that merges a GRU recurrent unit with transformation synchronization to fuse historical and multi-view data. Integrate components into existing registration pipelines and evaluate on standard datasets.

Result: Surpasses previous self-supervised registration methods on ScanNet and 3DMatch, and even outperforms some older supervised methods. Demonstrates effectiveness of integrating the proposed components.

Conclusion: Cycle-consistent keypoints and the GRU-based pose block improve self-supervised RGB-D registration; the approach is adaptable and can enhance existing methods by leveraging unlabeled data and temporal information.

Abstract: With the rise in consumer depth cameras, a wealth of unlabeled RGB-D data has
become available. This prompts the question of how to utilize this data for
geometric reasoning of scenes. While many RGB-D registration meth- ods rely on
geometric and feature-based similarity, we take a different approach. We use
cycle-consistent keypoints as salient points to enforce spatial coherence
constraints during matching, improving correspondence accuracy. Additionally,
we introduce a novel pose block that combines a GRU recurrent unit with
transformation synchronization, blending historical and multi-view data. Our
approach surpasses previous self- supervised registration methods on ScanNet
and 3DMatch, even outperforming some older supervised methods. We also
integrate our components into existing methods, showing their effectiveness.

### [26] [Spatial Preference Rewarding for MLLMs Spatial Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14374)
*Han Qiu,Peng Gao,Lewei Lu,Xiaoqin Zhang,Ling Shao,Shijian Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPR is a reward-based fine-tuning approach for multimodal LLMs that improves fine-grained spatial understanding (region descriptions and object localization) by evaluating and optimizing both semantic quality and localization accuracy of MLLM outputs using random image regions and descriptions, leading to better alignment with visual inputs with minimal training overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with fine-grained spatial perception and fail to consistently meet user requirements for detailed localization. Most methods rely on pre-annotated instruction data rather than supervising actual model responses, limiting their ability to produce precise localizations.

Method: SPR (Spatial Preference Rewarding) introduces semantic and localization scores to evaluate MLLM-generated region descriptions. It randomly samples image regions and corresponding descriptions, refines descriptions for better localization, and pairs the best refinement with the worst initial output for direct preference optimization, thereby steering the model toward more accurate and detailed spatial explanations.

Result: SPR yields improved spatial understanding on standard referring and grounding benchmarks with minimal training overhead, demonstrating more accurate localization and richer region descriptions.

Conclusion: SPR effectively enhances fine-grained spatial alignment of MLLMs with visual inputs through a lightweight, reward-based training regime, with expected releases of data and code.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models~(MLLMs) have demonstrated promising spatial
understanding capabilities, such as referencing and grounding object
descriptions. Despite their successes, MLLMs still fall short in fine-grained
spatial perception abilities, such as generating detailed region descriptions
or accurately localizing objects. Additionally, they often fail to respond to
the user's requirements for desired fine-grained spatial understanding. This
issue might arise because existing approaches primarily focus on tuning MLLMs
to model pre-annotated instruction data to inject spatial knowledge, without
direct supervision of MLLMs' actual responses. We address this issue by SPR, a
Spatial Preference Rewarding~(SPR) approach that enhances MLLMs' spatial
capabilities by rewarding MLLMs' detailed responses with precise object
localization over vague or inaccurate responses. With randomly selected image
regions and region descriptions from MLLMs, SPR introduces semantic and
localization scores to comprehensively evaluate the text quality and
localization quality in MLLM-generated descriptions. We also refine the MLLM
descriptions with better localization accuracy and pair the best-scored
refinement with the initial descriptions of the lowest score for direct
preference optimization, thereby enhancing fine-grained alignment with visual
input. Extensive experiments over standard referring and grounding benchmarks
show that SPR improves MLLM spatial understanding capabilities effectively with
minimal overhead in training. Data and code will be released at

### [27] [DOS: Directional Object Separation in Text Embeddings for Multi-Object Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14376)
*Dongnam Byun,Jungwon Park,Jumgmin Ko,Changin Choi,Wonjong Rhee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DOS modifies three CLIP text embeddings to reduce inter-object confusion in multi-object text-to-image generation, addressing four failure modes (Similar Shapes, Similar Textures, Dissimilar Background Biases, Many Objects) and yielding higher success and lower object mixing, as supported by human evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-object prompts cause neglect and mixing of objects in T2I generation due to inter-object relationships and biases. Observations about CLIP embeddings suggest directional separability can be exploited to improve object control.

Method: Directional Object Separation (DOS): modify three types of CLIP text embeddings before feeding them into text-to-image models to steer generation so that objects are separated and correctly placed in multi-object prompts.

Result: DOS consistently improves multi-object image generation success and reduces object mixing. Human evaluations show DOS significantly outperforms four competing methods across four benchmarks (26.24%-43.04% more votes).

Conclusion: DOS is a practical and effective solution for improving multi-object image generation by reweighting or reconfiguring CLIP embeddings to better enforce object separation.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generative models has led to
significant improvements in generating high-quality images aligned with text
prompts. However, these models still struggle with prompts involving multiple
objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing. Through extensive
studies, we identify four problematic scenarios, Similar Shapes, Similar
Textures, Dissimilar Background Biases, and Many Objects, where inter-object
relationships frequently lead to such failures. Motivated by two key
observations about CLIP embeddings, we propose DOS (Directional Object
Separation), a method that modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before
passing them into text-to-image models. Experimental results show that DOS
consistently improves the success rate of multi-object image generation and
reduces object mixing. In human evaluations, DOS significantly outperforms four
competing methods, receiving 26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks.
These results highlight DOS as a practical and effective solution for improving
multi-object image generation.

### [28] [DRBD-Mamba for Robust and Efficient Brain Tumor Segmentation with Analytical Insights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14383)
*Danish Ali,Ajmal Mian,Naveed Akhtar,Ghulam Mubashar Hassan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DRBD-Mamba, an efficient dual-resolution 3D brain tumor segmentation model that uses space-filling curves for 3D-to-1D mapping, a gated fusion module, and feature quantization to capture multi-scale dependencies with low overhead. Systematic BraTS2023 evaluation shows modest Dice gains on a 20% test subset and larger gains across five folds, plus ~15x efficiency improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is hindered by tumor subregion heterogeneity and high computational cost of Mamba-based state space models. There is a need for robust evaluation across diverse BraTS partitions and for methods that balance accuracy with efficiency.

Method: Introduce dual-resolution bi-directional Mamba (DRBD-Mamba) to capture multi-scale long-range dependencies with reduced overhead. Use a space-filling curve to map 3D features to 1D while preserving locality. Add a gated fusion module to adaptively integrate forward and reverse contexts and a quantization block to discretize features for robustness. Evaluate on five systematic BraTS2023 folds, plus a 20% test subset.

Result: On the 20% test set used by recent methods, Dice improvements: whole tumor +0.10%, tumor core +1.75%, enhancing tumor +0.93%. Across five folds, average Dice gains: tumor core +0.86%, enhancing tumor +1.45%, with competitive whole-tumor accuracy. The method achieves about 15x improvement in efficiency while maintaining high accuracy.

Conclusion: DRBD-Mamba demonstrates robust gains in core and enhancing tumor regions and strong efficiency benefits, suggesting practical robustness and effectiveness over existing state-of-the-art approaches. The five-fold evaluation offers insights into failure modes and the stability of improvements across diverse partitions.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is significant for clinical diagnosis and
treatment. It is challenging due to the heterogeneity of tumor subregions.
Mamba-based State Space Models have demonstrated promising performance.
However, they incur significant computational overhead due to sequential
feature computation across multiple spatial axes. Moreover, their robustness
across diverse BraTS data partitions remains largely unexplored, leaving a
critical gap in reliable evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose
dual-resolution bi-directional Mamba (DRBD-Mamba), an efficient 3D segmentation
model that captures multi-scale long-range dependencies with minimal
computational overhead. We leverage a space-filling curve to preserve spatial
locality during 3D-to-1D feature mapping, thereby reducing reliance on
computationally expensive multi-axial feature scans. To enrich feature
representation, we propose a gated fusion module that adaptively integrates
forward and reverse contexts, along with a quantization block that discretizes
features to improve robustness. In addition, we propose five systematic folds
on BraTS2023 for rigorous evaluation of segmentation techniques under diverse
conditions and present detailed analysis of common failure scenarios. On the
20\% test set used by recent methods, our model achieves Dice improvements of
0.10\% for whole tumor, 1.75\% for tumor core, and 0.93\% for enhancing tumor.
Evaluations on the proposed systematic five folds demonstrate that our model
maintains competitive whole tumor accuracy while achieving clear average Dice
gains of 0.86\% for tumor core and 1.45\% for enhancing tumor over existing
state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our model attains 15 times improvement in
efficiency while maintaining high segmentation accuracy, highlighting its
robustness and computational advantage over existing approaches.

*Brandon Hill,Kma Solaiman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BoardVision establishes an assembly-level motherboard defect detection framework, benchmarks YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN, introduces a Confidence-Temporal Voting ensemble, tests robustness, and ships a GUI tool for practical QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assembly-level defects on fully assembled motherboards are underexplored; existing PCB inspection largely targets bare-board or trace-level defects, leaving a gap for reliable, deployable inspection at the assembly level.

Method: Benchmark two detectors on the MiracleFactory motherboard dataset; propose a lightweight ensemble (Confidence-Temporal Voting) to balance precision and recall; evaluate robustness to perturbations (sharpness, brightness, orientation); release a GUI-driven inspection tool for operator usability.

Result: Demonstrates complementary strengths of YOLOv7 (precision) and Faster R-CNN (recall); the CTV Voter improves overall precision–recall balance; robustness tests reveal stability challenges under realistic perturbations; provides a reproducible benchmark suite and a deployable GUI tool.

Conclusion: CV methods can transition from benchmark results to practical, reliable assembly-level quality assurance for high-volume motherboard manufacturing, bridging research with operator-focused deployment.

Abstract: Motherboard defect detection is critical for ensuring reliability in
high-volume electronics manufacturing. While prior research in PCB inspection
has largely targeted bare-board or trace-level defects, assembly-level
inspection of full motherboards inspection remains underexplored. In this work,
we present BoardVision, a reproducible framework for detecting assembly-level
defects such as missing screws, loose fan wiring, and surface scratches. We
benchmark two representative detectors - YOLOv7 and Faster R-CNN, under
controlled conditions on the MiracleFactory motherboard dataset, providing the
first systematic comparison in this domain. To mitigate the limitations of
single models, where YOLO excels in precision but underperforms in recall and
Faster R-CNN shows the reverse, we propose a lightweight ensemble,
Confidence-Temporal Voting (CTV Voter), that balances precision and recall
through interpretable rules. We further evaluate robustness under realistic
perturbations including sharpness, brightness, and orientation changes,
highlighting stability challenges often overlooked in motherboard defect
detection. Finally, we release a deployable GUI-driven inspection tool that
bridges research evaluation with operator usability. Together, these
contributions demonstrate how computer vision techniques can transition from
benchmark results to practical quality assurance for assembly-level motherboard
manufacturing.

*Chao Tu,Kun Huang,Jie Zhang,Qianjin Feng,Yu Zhang,Zhenyuan Ning*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCMIL is an easy-to-hard progressive dual-curriculum contrastive MIL framework that processes gigapixel WSIs for cancer prognosis without dense annotations, outperforming standard WSI-based prognostic models across 12 cancer types and revealing fine-grained prognostic regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address computational bottlenecks of gigapixel WSIs and the scarcity of dense manual annotations, while leveraging multi-magnification information and tumor microenvironment variation to improve prognosis and enable biological insights.

Method: Proposes dual-curriculum contrastive multi-instance learning (DCMIL) using an easy-to-hard progressive representation learning strategy. It operates on WSIs without dense labels, aggregates information from multiple magnifications and tiles via MIL, employs contrastive learning, and yields prognosis predictions along with saliency and uncertainty estimates; code is publicly available.

Result: DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models across twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles), provides robust instance-level uncertainty estimation, identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, and captures morphological differences between normal and tumor tissue; code released at GitHub.

Conclusion: DCMIL enables efficient end-to-end translation of gigapixel WSIs into outcome predictions without dense annotations, offers interpretable prognostic regions and uncertainties, and holds potential to generate new biological insights, with open-source code for replication.

Abstract: The burgeoning discipline of computational pathology shows promise in
harnessing whole slide images (WSIs) to quantify morphological heterogeneity
and develop objective prognostic modes for human cancers. However, progress is
impeded by the computational bottleneck of gigapixel-size inputs and the
scarcity of dense manual annotations. Current methods often overlook
fine-grained information across multi-magnification WSIs and variations in
tumor microenvironments. Here, we propose an easy-to-hard progressive
representation learning model, termed dual-curriculum contrastive
multi-instance learning (DCMIL), to efficiently process WSIs for cancer
prognosis. The model does not rely on dense annotations and enables the direct
transformation of gigapixel-size WSIs into outcome predictions. Extensive
experiments on twelve cancer types (5,954 patients, 12.54 million tiles)
demonstrate that DCMIL outperforms standard WSI-based prognostic models.
Additionally, DCMIL identifies fine-grained prognosis-salient regions, provides
robust instance uncertainty estimation, and captures morphological differences
between normal and tumor tissues, with the potential to generate new biological
insights. All codes have been made publicly accessible at

### [31] [Real-Time Neural Video Compression with Unified Intra and Inter Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14431)
*Hui Xiang,Yifan Bian,Li Li,Jingran Wu,Xianguo Zhang,Dong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unified intra/inter neural video compression with a bidirectional two-frame design improves efficiency and stability, outperforming DCVC-RT by ~10.7% BD-rate while keeping real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address key limitations of neural video coding (disocclusion, new content handling, interframe error propagation) by reintroducing intra coding within inter frames and enabling bidirectional inter-frame redundancy exploitation.

Method: Single model processes every frame with adaptive intra/inter coding; introduces simultaneous two-frame compression that leverages both forward and backward redundancy.

Result: Outperforms DCVC-RT by an average 10.7% BD-rate reduction; provides more stable bitrate/quality per frame; preserves real-time encoding/decoding performance.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that unified intra/inter coding with bidirectional two-frame design improves compression efficiency and stability in NVC; code and models to be released.

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent
years, yielding state-of-the-art schemes such as DCVC-RT that offer superior
compression efficiency to H.266/VVC and real-time encoding/decoding
capabilities. Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations,
including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe
error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these
limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow
intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled,
disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error
propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh
mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding,
where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform
intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame
compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also
backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an
average of 10.7\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality
per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances. Code and
models will be released.

*Sven Jacob,Weijia Shao,Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A minimally distorted universal attack for video object detection using nuclear norm regularization to concentrate perturbations in the background, optimized with an adaptive optimistic exponentiated gradient; outperforms baseline low-rank PGD and Frank-Wolfe attacks while remaining stealthy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-based detectors are vulnerable to universal perturbations; there is a need for scalable, stealthy attacks that induce structured perturbations (preferably in background regions) to evaluate and stress-test defense mechanisms.

Method: Formulates a universal perturbation via nuclear norm regularization to encourage structured perturbations concentrated in the background. Optimizes the perturbation using an adaptive, optimistic exponentiated gradient approach for scalability and fast convergence. Compares against low-rank projected gradient descent and Frank-Wolfe attacks.

Result: The proposed attack is more effective than the compared baselines and maintains high stealthiness, demonstrating stronger vulnerability of video object detectors under structured universal perturbations; the authors also provide public code and data.

Conclusion: The work advances understanding of adversarial threats to video object detectors by delivering a scalable, stealthy universal attack that exploits background-focused structure, and it offers a reproducible framework for robustness evaluation and defense development.

Abstract: Video-based object detection plays a vital role in safety-critical
applications. While deep learning-based object detectors have achieved
impressive performance, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
particularly those involving universal perturbations. In this work, we propose
a minimally distorted universal adversarial attack tailored for video object
detection, which leverages nuclear norm regularization to promote structured
perturbations concentrated in the background. To optimize this formulation
efficiently, we employ an adaptive, optimistic exponentiated gradient method
that enhances both scalability and convergence. Our results demonstrate that
the proposed attack outperforms both low-rank projected gradient descent and
Frank-Wolfe based attacks in effectiveness while maintaining high stealthiness.

### [33] [Unsupervised Deep Generative Models for Anomaly Detection in Neuroimaging: A Systematic Scoping Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14462)
*Youwan Mahé,Elise Bannier,Stéphanie Leplaideur,Elisa Fromont,Francesca Galassi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised deep generative models trained on healthy brain data can detect anomalies as deviations, showing promise for brain MRI/CT across several pathologies; a PRISMA-guided scoping review of 49 studies (2018–2025) highlights strengths in large lesions and interpretability via pseudo-healthy reconstructions, with future work needed for clinical translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Supervised anomaly detection in neuroimaging requires extensive voxel-level annotations and well-characterised pathologies, while healthy-data-trained generative models can identify deviations and support rare or heterogeneous diseases, semi-supervised learning, and biomarker discovery.

Method: PRISMA-guided scoping review of unsupervised deep generative models (autoencoders, VAEs, GANs, denoising diffusion models) applied to brain MRI and CT across tumours, stroke, MS, and small vessel disease; 49 studies published 2018–2025; analysis includes performance metrics and architectural design.

Result: Models achieved encouraging performance for large focal lesions; progress in detecting subtler abnormalities; ability to produce interpretable pseudo-healthy (counterfactual) reconstructions; potential to enable semi-supervised learning, discovery of new imaging biomarkers, and cross-disease deviation mapping within unified frameworks.

Conclusion: Future work should emphasize anatomy-aware modelling, development of foundation models, task-appropriate evaluation metrics, and rigorous clinical validation to translate these methods into clinical practice.

Abstract: Unsupervised deep generative models are emerging as a promising alternative
to supervised methods for detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain imaging.
Unlike fully supervised approaches, which require large voxel-level annotated
datasets and are limited to well-characterised pathologies, these models can be
trained exclusively on healthy data and identify anomalies as deviations from
learned normative brain structures. This PRISMA-guided scoping review
synthesises recent work on unsupervised deep generative models for anomaly
detection in neuroimaging, including autoencoders, variational autoencoders,
generative adversarial networks, and denoising diffusion models. A total of 49
studies published between 2018 - 2025 were identified, covering applications to
brain MRI and, less frequently, CT across diverse pathologies such as tumours,
stroke, multiple sclerosis, and small vessel disease. Reported performance
metrics are compared alongside architectural design choices. Across the
included studies, generative models achieved encouraging performance for large
focal lesions and demonstrated progress in addressing more subtle
abnormalities. A key strength of generative models is their ability to produce
interpretable pseudo-healthy (also referred to as counterfactual)
reconstructions, which is particularly valuable when annotated data are scarce,
as in rare or heterogeneous diseases. Looking ahead, these models offer a
compelling direction for anomaly detection, enabling semi-supervised learning,
supporting the discovery of novel imaging biomarkers, and facilitating within-
and cross-disease deviation mapping in unified end-to-end frameworks. To
realise clinical impact, future work should prioritise anatomy-aware modelling,
development of foundation models, task-appropriate evaluation metrics, and
rigorous clinical validation.

*Thomas Katraouras,Dimitrios Rafailidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIR-L finds a highly sparse subnetwork (10% of parameters) within an overparameterized multi-task image restoration model using iterative magnitude pruning with weight reset, achieving comparable or better performance on deraining, dehazing, and denoising benchmarks while dramatically reducing parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce computational cost and memory footprint of multi-task image restoration models deployed on web platforms without sacrificing restoration quality.

Method: Iterative pruning across multiple rounds, removing low-magnitude weights, and resetting the remaining weights to their initial values (lot of 'winning tickets' discovery) within an overparameterized model trained for multi-task restoration.

Result: Maintains high restoration performance with only 10% trainable parameters on deraining, dehazing, denoising benchmarks; matches or surpasses dense state-of-the-art; public release of code and models.

Conclusion: Sparse subnetworks discovered via weight-reset pruning are effective for multi-task image restoration, enabling efficient, high-quality restoration suitable for deployment on resource-constrained platforms.

Abstract: Image quality is a critical factor in delivering visually appealing content
on web platforms. However, images often suffer from degradation due to lossy
operations applied by online social networks (OSNs), negatively affecting user
experience. Image restoration is the process of recovering a clean high-quality
image from a given degraded input. Recently, multi-task (all-in-one) image
restoration models have gained significant attention, due to their ability to
simultaneously handle different types of image degradations. However, these
models often come with an excessively high number of trainable parameters,
making them computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a strategy
for compressing multi-task image restoration models. We aim to discover highly
sparse subnetworks within overparameterized deep models that can match or even
surpass the performance of their dense counterparts. The proposed model, namely
MIR-L, utilizes an iterative pruning strategy that removes low-magnitude
weights across multiple rounds, while resetting the remaining weights to their
original initialization. This iterative process is important for the multi-task
image restoration model's optimization, effectively uncovering "winning
tickets" that maintain or exceed state-of-the-art performance at high sparsity
levels. Experimental evaluation on benchmark datasets for the deraining,
dehazing, and denoising tasks shows that MIR-L retains only 10% of the
trainable parameters while maintaining high image restoration performance. Our
code, datasets and pre-trained models are made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CNN-LSTM on Sentinel-2 time series detects seasonal grazing at field scale with solid accuracy, enabling efficient inspection prioritization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grazing influences agricultural output and biodiversity, yet scalable, high-resolution monitoring of grazing is scarce. Freely available satellite data offers a scalable alternative.

Method: Train an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal Sentinel-2 L2A reflectance features (April–October) for polygon-defined fields to perform binary grazing prediction (grazed vs not).

Result: Average F1 score of 0.77 across five validation splits; 90% recall on grazed pastures. Operationally, with 4% site visit capacity, prioritizing fields predicted as non-grazed yields 17.2× more confirmed non-grazing sites than random inspection. Code and models are publicly available.

Conclusion: Coarse-resolution, freely available satellite data can reliably guide inspection resources for conservation-oriented land-use compliance.

Abstract: Grazing shapes both agricultural production and biodiversity, yet scalable
monitoring of where grazing occurs remains limited. We study seasonal grazing
detection from Sentinel-2 L2A time series: for each polygon-defined field
boundary, April-October imagery is used for binary prediction (grazed / not
grazed). We train an ensemble of CNN-LSTM models on multi-temporal reflectance
features, and achieve an average F1 score of 77 percent across five validation
splits, with 90 percent recall on grazed pastures. Operationally, if inspectors
can visit at most 4 percent of sites annually, prioritising fields predicted by
our model as non-grazed yields 17.2 times more confirmed non-grazing sites than
random inspection. These results indicate that coarse-resolution, freely
available satellite data can reliably steer inspection resources for
conservation-aligned land-use compliance. Code and models have been made
publicly available.

*Ali Kashefi,Tapan Mukerji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Mamba is proposed as a backbone for predicting permeability in 3D porous media, offering linear scaling with input resolution and lower parameter count than ViTs and CNNs, leading to improved efficiency; a comparison with ViT and CNN baselines and ablation studies are performed, and code is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome quadratic scaling in ViTs and memory/parameter demands of CNNs by using Vision Mamba, and to apply it to a scientific prediction task (permeability of 3D porous media).

Method: Implement Vision Mamba as the backbone for permeability prediction on 3D porous media, compare with ViT and CNN models across multiple permeability metrics, perform ablations to assess component contributions, and release source code.

Result: Vision Mamba shows favorable efficiency and competitive or superior accuracy relative to ViT and CNN baselines in permeability prediction; ablations reveal the impact of its components; the approach demonstrates memory/parameter efficiency and potential for integration into larger vision models.

Conclusion: Vision Mamba is a viable, efficient backbone for scientific prediction tasks and could replace ViTs in larger vision models; code release supports reproducibility and extension.

Abstract: Vision Mamba has recently received attention as an alternative to Vision
Transformers (ViTs) for image classification. The network size of Vision Mamba
scales linearly with input image resolution, whereas ViTs scale quadratically,
a feature that improves computational and memory efficiency. Moreover, Vision
Mamba requires a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters than
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and thus, they can be more
memory efficient. Because of these features, we introduce, for the first time,
a neural network that uses Vision Mamba as its backbone for predicting the
permeability of three-dimensional porous media. We compare the performance of
Vision Mamba with ViT and CNN models across multiple aspects of permeability
prediction and perform an ablation study to assess the effects of its
components on accuracy. We demonstrate in practice the aforementioned
advantages of Vision Mamba over ViTs and CNNs in the permeability prediction of
three-dimensional porous media. We make the source code publicly available to
facilitate reproducibility and to enable other researchers to build on and
extend this work. We believe the proposed framework has the potential to be
integrated into large vision models in which Vision Mamba is used instead of
ViTs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgScan introduces an AI-powered defect detection framework for surgical instruments using YOLOv8, achieving real-time defect classification with high accuracy on a large dataset, aiming for scalable industrial QC and regulatory compliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual inspection in surgical instrument manufacturing is error-prone and inconsistent, risking sterility, integrity, and patient safety. There is a need for scalable, automated, real-time quality control that meets regulatory standards.

Method: YOLOv8-based defect detection trained on a high-resolution dataset of 102,876 images spanning 11 instrument types and 5 defect categories. Includes contrast-enhanced preprocessing and comparison against state-of-the-art CNNs. Real-time inference (4.2–5.8 ms/image).

Result: SurgScan achieves 99.3% accuracy with real-time speeds across the tested setup; contrast-enhanced preprocessing significantly improves defect detection performance; performs favorably against CNN baselines.

Conclusion: Proposes a scalable, cost-effective AI QC solution that reduces reliance on manual inspection while aiming to comply with ISO 13485 and FDA standards, enabling broader adoption of automated defect detection in medical manufacturing.

Abstract: Defective surgical instruments pose serious risks to sterility, mechanical
integrity, and patient safety, increasing the likelihood of surgical
complications. However, quality control in surgical instrument manufacturing
often relies on manual inspection, which is prone to human error and
inconsistency. This study introduces SurgScan, an AI-powered defect detection
framework for surgical instruments. Using YOLOv8, SurgScan classifies defects
in real-time, ensuring high accuracy and industrial scalability. The model is
trained on a high-resolution dataset of 102,876 images, covering 11 instrument
types and five major defect categories. Extensive evaluation against
state-of-the-art CNN architectures confirms that SurgScan achieves the highest
accuracy (99.3%) with real-time inference speeds of 4.2-5.8 ms per image,
making it suitable for industrial deployment. Statistical analysis demonstrates
that contrast-enhanced preprocessing significantly improves defect detection,
addressing key limitations in visual inspection. SurgScan provides a scalable,
cost-effective AI solution for automated quality control, reducing reliance on
manual inspection while ensuring compliance with ISO 13485 and FDA standards,
paving the way for enhanced defect detection in medical manufacturing.

### [38] [Noise Projection: Closing the Prompt-Agnostic Gap Behind Text-to-Image Misalignment in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14526)
*Yunze Tong,Didi Zhu,Zijing Hu,Jinluan Yang,Ziyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A prompt-aware noise projector refines initial noise conditioned on the prompt to better align SD outputs with the prompt, using VLM-derived feedback and reward-model optimization, without changing the SD model and with low inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a training-inference mismatch: training uses prompt-conditioned noises from a prompt-specific latent subset, while inference samples from a prompt-agnostic Gaussian prior, causing misalignment with the prompt.

Method: Introduce a noise projector that, given the prompt embedding, maps the initial noise to a prompt-aware latent without editing the SD model. The pipeline samples noises, obtains token-level feedback on generated images from a vision-language model, distills signals into a reward model, and optimizes the noise projector via quasi-direct preference optimization.

Result: Experiments show improved text-image alignment across diverse prompts. The approach requires no reference images or handcrafted priors and incurs only a small inference cost by replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass.

Conclusion: A prompt-aware noise projection effectively closes the training-inference gap, enabling better alignment with prompts while keeping the diffusion model intact and inference efficient.

Abstract: In text-to-image generation, different initial noises induce distinct
denoising paths with a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model. While this
pattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with
the prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the
denoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection.
In this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch:
during training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of
the latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a
prompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector
that applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising.
Conditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware
counterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training,
without modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first
sample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding
images from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a
reward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct
preference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no
reference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference
cost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive
experiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves
text-image alignment across diverse prompts.

*Xinrui Huang,Fan Xiao,Dongming He,Anqi Gao,Dandan Li,Xiaofan Zhang,Shaoting Zhang,Xudong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DentVFM is a new family of vision foundation models for dentistry that uses self-supervised learning on a large multi-modal dental imaging dataset to produce generalist, label-efficient AI capable of diverse dental tasks and cross-modality diagnostics, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dental radiology faces a shortage of trained professionals and is burdened by single-modality, task-specific AI that requires costly labeled data and lacks generalization. A scalable, generalist, label-efficient model could improve diagnostic coverage and global oral healthcare.

Method: Develop DentVFM, a family of 2D/3D Vision Transformer-based models trained with self-supervised learning on DentVista (≈1.6M multi-modal dental radiographs from multiple centers). Create DentBench to benchmark eight subspecialties, more diseases, imaging modalities, and geographic diversity. Evaluate DentVFM on tasks including disease diagnosis, treatment analysis, biomarker identification, and landmark detection/segmentation, and compare against supervised, self-supervised, and weakly supervised baselines; assess cross-modality diagnostics.

Result: DentVFM achieves strong generalization and label efficiency, significantly outperforming baselines across tasks, with robust performance across modalities and diseases, and enabling cross-modality diagnostics that can outperform experienced dentists when traditional imaging is unavailable.

Conclusion: DentVFM establishes a new paradigm for dental AI as scalable, adaptable, and label-efficient, capable of improving intelligent dental healthcare and addressing global oral health gaps.

Abstract: Oral and maxillofacial radiology plays a vital role in dental healthcare, but
radiographic image interpretation is limited by a shortage of trained
professionals. While AI approaches have shown promise, existing dental AI
systems are restricted by their single-modality focus, task-specific design,
and reliance on costly labeled data, hindering their generalization across
diverse clinical scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce DentVFM,
the first family of vision foundation models (VFMs) designed for dentistry.
DentVFM generates task-agnostic visual representations for a wide range of
dental applications and uses self-supervised learning on DentVista, a large
curated dental imaging dataset with approximately 1.6 million multi-modal
radiographic images from various medical centers. DentVFM includes 2D and 3D
variants based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture. To address gaps in
dental intelligence assessment and benchmarks, we introduce DentBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering eight dental subspecialties, more diseases,
imaging modalities, and a wide geographical distribution. DentVFM shows
impressive generalist intelligence, demonstrating robust generalization to
diverse dental tasks, such as disease diagnosis, treatment analysis, biomarker
identification, and anatomical landmark detection and segmentation.
Experimental results indicate DentVFM significantly outperforms supervised,
self-supervised, and weakly supervised baselines, offering superior
generalization, label efficiency, and scalability. Additionally, DentVFM
enables cross-modality diagnostics, providing more reliable results than
experienced dentists in situations where conventional imaging is unavailable.
DentVFM sets a new paradigm for dental AI, offering a scalable, adaptable, and
label-efficient model to improve intelligent dental healthcare and address
critical gaps in global oral healthcare.

*Yixuan Li,Yuhui Chen,Mingcai Zhou,Haoran Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Augment Vision-Language-Action models with a depth-prediction auxiliary task using a depth expert and quantized latent depth tokens to improve spatial reasoning for manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models often lack robust understanding of 3D structures essential for precise, fine-grained manipulation, limiting depth-aware control and generalization.

Method: Introduce QDepth-VLA, a general framework that adds a dedicated depth expert to predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps (from a VQ-VAE encoder). This depth-prediction auxiliary task fosters depth-aware representations that capture key geometric cues and are integrated into the VLA model.

Result: The approach yields strong spatial reasoning and competitive manipulation performance, demonstrated on both simulation benchmarks and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: Depth-aware learning via depth token prediction improves 3D understanding in VLA models, enabling more precise control in manipulation across simulated and real environments.

Abstract: Spatial perception and reasoning are crucial for Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models to accomplish fine-grained manipulation tasks. However, existing
approaches often lack the ability to understand and reason over the essential
3D structures necessary for precise control. To address this limitation, we
propose QDepth-VLA, a general framework that augments VLA models with an
auxiliary depth prediction task. A dedicated depth expert is designed to
predict quantized latent tokens of depth maps obtained from a VQ-VAE encoder,
enabling the model to learn depth-aware representations that capture critical
geometric cues. Experimental results on the simulation benchmarks and
real-world tasks demonstrate that QDepth-VLA yields strong spatial reasoning
and competitive performance on manipulation tasks.

### [42] [Acquisition of interpretable domain information during brain MR image harmonization for content-based image retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14535)
*Keima Abe,Hayato Muraki,Shuhei Tomoshige,Kenichi Oishi,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PL-SE-ADA is a domain harmonization and interpretable representation learning framework for brain MRI that uses two encoders to separate domain-invariant (z_u) and domain-specific (z_d) factors, a decoder, and a domain predictor. It reconstructs the input by summing contributions from z_u and z_d, enabling harmonization with preserved disease information and interpretability. It achieves equal or better performance than prior methods in reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition, while providing visualizable domain-specific and domain-invariant features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical MR images suffer from domain shifts across sites due to scanners/protocols, reducing ML performance. While disentangled latent representations have been used, they often lack interpretability. There is a need for a framework that achieves domain harmonization and yields interpretable, disease-relevant features.

Method: The framework introduces two encoders f_E and f_SE to extract z_u (domain-invariant) and z_d (domain-specific), a decoder f_D to reconstruct images, and a domain predictor g_D. Training includes adversarial forces between the encoder and domain predictor, and image reconstruction by summing reconstructions from z_u and z_d to ensure both harmonization and informativeness. Compared to prior methods, PL-SE-ADA attains equal or superior performance in image reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition, with the added benefit of visualizing both domain-independent and domain-specific brain features for interpretability.

Result: PL-SE-ADA achieves equal or better performance than prior approaches in reconstruction quality, disease classification accuracy, and domain recognition accuracy, while enabling interpretable visualization of the latent factors (z_u and z_d) corresponding to domain-invariant and domain-specific brain features.

Conclusion: A general, interpretable framework for domain harmonization in medical imaging that preserves disease-relevant information, enabling visualization of both domain-invariant and domain-specific brain features without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Medical images like MR scans often show domain shifts across imaging sites
due to scanner and protocol differences, which degrade machine learning
performance in tasks such as disease classification. Domain harmonization is
thus a critical research focus. Recent approaches encode brain images
$\boldsymbol{x}$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\boldsymbol{z}$, then
disentangle it into $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ (domain-invariant) and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$ (domain-specific), achieving strong results. However, these
methods often lack interpretability$-$an essential requirement in medical
applications$-$leaving practical issues unresolved. We propose
Pseudo-Linear-Style Encoder Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PL-SE-ADA), a
general framework for domain harmonization and interpretable representation
learning that preserves disease-relevant information in brain MR images.
PL-SE-ADA includes two encoders $f_E$ and $f_{SE}$ to extract
$\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and $\boldsymbol{z_d}$, a decoder to reconstruct the image
$f_D$, and a domain predictor $g_D$. Beyond adversarial training between the
encoder and domain predictor, the model learns to reconstruct the input image
$\boldsymbol{x}$ by summing reconstructions from $\boldsymbol{z_u}$ and
$\boldsymbol{z_d}$, ensuring both harmonization and informativeness. Compared
to prior methods, PL-SE-ADA achieves equal or better performance in image
reconstruction, disease classification, and domain recognition. It also enables
visualization of both domain-independent brain features and domain-specific
components, offering high interpretability across the entire framework.

### [43] [Ponimator: Unfolding Interactive Pose for Versatile Human-human Interaction Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14976)
*Shaowei Liu,Chuan Guo,Bing Zhou,Jian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ponimator is a diffusion-based framework that uses proximal interactive poses as priors to animate and synthesize interactive human poses, enabling image-based, reaction, and text-to-interaction animation via two conditional diffusion models: a pose animator (temporal prior) and a pose generator (spatial prior).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverages rich close-proximity two-person interaction poses to provide robust priors that enable realistic, context-aware animation and pose synthesis in open-world scenarios, addressing data scarcity for interactive motion.

Method: Train two conditional diffusion models on mocap-based close-contact two-person poses with surrounding temporal context: (1) pose animator conditioned on temporal priors to produce motion sequences from poses; (2) pose generator conditioned on spatial priors to synthesize interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both. Supports image-based, reaction, and text-to-interaction synthesis.

Result: Empirical results across diverse datasets show the pose priors' universality and the framework's effectiveness and robustness across tasks, demonstrating Ponimator's versatility in transferring mocap interaction knowledge to open-world settings.

Conclusion: Ponimator provides a simple, universal, diffusion-based framework that leverages interactive pose priors to enable versatile interaction animation, with strong generalization across domains.

Abstract: Close-proximity human-human interactive poses convey rich contextual
information about interaction dynamics. Given such poses, humans can
intuitively infer the context and anticipate possible past and future dynamics,
drawing on strong priors of human behavior. Inspired by this observation, we
propose Ponimator, a simple framework anchored on proximal interactive poses
for versatile interaction animation. Our training data consists of
close-contact two-person poses and their surrounding temporal context from
motion-capture interaction datasets. Leveraging interactive pose priors,
Ponimator employs two conditional diffusion models: (1) a pose animator that
uses the temporal prior to generate dynamic motion sequences from interactive
poses, and (2) a pose generator that applies the spatial prior to synthesize
interactive poses from a single pose, text, or both when interactive poses are
unavailable. Collectively, Ponimator supports diverse tasks, including
image-based interaction animation, reaction animation, and text-to-interaction
synthesis, facilitating the transfer of interaction knowledge from high-quality
mocap data to open-world scenarios. Empirical experiments across diverse
datasets and applications demonstrate the universality of the pose prior and
the effectiveness and robustness of our framework.

### [44] [Exploring Image Representation with Decoupled Classical Visual Descriptors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14536)
*Chenyuan Qu,Hao Chen,Jianbo Jiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualSplit decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors (edges, color, intensity) and uses reconstruction-driven pre-training to learn interpretable, independent visual attributes, enabling explicit attribute control in tasks like image generation and editing beyond standard classification/segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep models offer powerful representations but are often opaque. Classical descriptors are intuitive but underutilized in modern learning. The paper aims to combine the interpretability of classical cues with the power of deep learning by explicitly decomposing visuals into decoupled descriptors and preserving their interpretability.

Method: Introduce VisualSplit, a framework that explicitly decomposes images into independent, classical descriptors (e.g., edge, color, intensity distributions). Training uses a reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme to capture the essence of each descriptor while maintaining interpretability, enabling separate control over attributes.

Result: Explicitly decomposing visual attributes enables effective attribute control in advanced tasks such as image generation and editing, extending capabilities beyond typical classification and segmentation and suggesting a promising direction for interpretable, controllable visual learning.

Conclusion: Leveraging classical visual cues within a learnable, decoupled framework can enhance interpretability and controllability of visual models, offering a path toward more transparent and controllable image understanding and generation.

Abstract: Exploring and understanding efficient image representations is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision. While deep learning has achieved
remarkable progress across image understanding tasks, its internal
representations are often opaque, making it difficult to interpret how visual
information is processed. In contrast, classical visual descriptors (e.g. edge,
colour, and intensity distribution) have long been fundamental to image
analysis and remain intuitively understandable to humans. Motivated by this
gap, we ask a central question: Can modern learning benefit from these
classical cues? In this paper, we answer it with VisualSplit, a framework that
explicitly decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors, treating
each as an independent but complementary component of visual knowledge. Through
a reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme, VisualSplit learns to capture the
essence of each visual descriptor while preserving their interpretability. By
explicitly decomposing visual attributes, our method inherently facilitates
effective attribute control in various advanced visual tasks, including image
generation and editing, extending beyond conventional classification and
segmentation, suggesting the effectiveness of this new learning approach for
visual understanding. Project page: https://chenyuanqu.com/VisualSplit/.

### [45] [Exploring Cross-Modal Flows for Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14543)
*Ziqi Jiang,Yanghao Wang,Long Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A model-agnostic, multi-step cross-modal alignment method (Flow Matching Alignment, FMA) that learns a cross-modal velocity field to iteratively refine alignment between vision and language features, improving over one-step PEFT methods on challenging datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing PEFT methods fine-tune only a small subset of parameters in a single step, which is insufficient when visual and textual features are highly entangled. A multi-step adjustment approach is needed to achieve more precise and robust cross-modal alignment.

Method: Propose Flow Matching Alignment (FMA), a model-agnostic, multi-step adjustment framework that learns a cross-modal velocity field to morph features across modalities. Key components include a fixed coupling strategy to maintain category correspondence during training, a noise augmentation strategy to mitigate data scarcity, and an early-stopping solver to terminate the transformation earlier for efficiency and accuracy.

Result: FMA yields significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks and backbones, with pronounced improvements on challenging datasets compared to traditional one-step PEFT methods.

Conclusion: Multi-step cross-modal alignment via a learned velocity field (FMA) provides more precise and robust cross-modal feature alignment than existing one-step PEFT approaches, and is broadly applicable across models and datasets.

Abstract: Aligning features from different modalities, is one of the most fundamental
challenges for cross-modal tasks. Although pre-trained vision-language models
can achieve a general alignment between image and text, they often require
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for further adjustment. Today's PEFT
methods (e.g., prompt tuning, LoRA-based, or adapter-based) always selectively
fine-tune a subset of parameters, which can slightly adjust either visual or
textual features, and avoid overfitting. In this paper, we are the first to
highlight that all existing PEFT methods perform one-step adjustment. It is
insufficient for complex (or difficult) datasets, where features of different
modalities are highly entangled. To this end, we propose the first
model-agnostic multi-step adjustment approach by learning a cross-modal
velocity field: Flow Matching Alignment (FMA). Specifically, to ensure the
correspondence between categories during training, we first utilize a fixed
coupling strategy. Then, we propose a noise augmentation strategy to alleviate
the data scarcity issue. Finally, we design an early-stopping solver, which
terminates the transformation process earlier, improving both efficiency and
accuracy. Compared with one-step PEFT methods, FMA has the multi-step
rectification ability to achieve more precise and robust alignment. Extensive
results have demonstrated that FMA can consistently yield significant
performance gains across various benchmarks and backbones, particularly on
challenging datasets.

*Song Tang,Peihao Gong,Kunyu Li,Kai Guo,Boyu Wang,Mao Ye,Jianwei Zhang,Xiatian Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free prompt-editing method (SDeC) suppresses scene-ID contextualization to improve identity preservation in T2I across unseen scenes, without requiring prior knowledge of all target scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identity shift arises from natural scene contextualization—the built-in correlation between subject and scene context—present in large training distributions. Prior methods assume knowledge of all target scenes, which is impractical. The authors formalize the universal nature of scene-ID correlation and seek a flexible solution.

Method: Introduce Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC): a prompt-editing approach that inverts the model's scene contextualization. It identifies and suppresses latent scene-ID correlation in the identity prompt embedding by analyzing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the embedding space and adaptively reweighting eigenvalues to reduce the correlation. It is training-free and supports per-scene prompts (one scene per prompt) without needing access to all target scenes.

Result: Empirical results show substantially better identity preservation with preserved scene diversity across scenes, compared to baselines relying on full scene knowledge.

Conclusion: SDeC provides a flexible, efficient, and practical solution for real-world T2I systems to maintain identity across scenes without large-scale prior scene annotations, contributing to robust, identity-consistent generation.

Abstract: Consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation seeks to produce
identity-preserving images of the same subject across diverse scenes, yet it
often fails due to a phenomenon called identity (ID) shift. Previous methods
have tackled this issue, but typically rely on the unrealistic assumption of
knowing all target scenes in advance. This paper reveals that a key source of
ID shift is the native correlation between subject and scene context, called
scene contextualization, which arises naturally as T2I models fit the training
distribution of vast natural images. We formally prove the near-universality of
this scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On
this basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding
editing approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an
inversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization. Specifically, it
identifies and suppresses the latent scene-ID correlation within the ID
prompt's embedding by quantifying the SVD directional stability to adaptively
re-weight the corresponding eigenvalues. Critically, SDeC allows for per-scene
use (one scene per prompt) without requiring prior access to all target scenes.
This makes it a highly flexible and general solution well-suited to real-world
applications where such prior knowledge is often unavailable or varies over
time. Experiments demonstrate that SDeC significantly enhances identity
preservation while maintaining scene diversity.

Motivation: Aim to enable AI to function effectively in human-like, dynamic settings by actively understanding, predicting, and responding to unfolding events from ego-centric video. Existing benchmarks underrepresent proactive, timely reasoning and synchronized perception in streaming contexts.

Method: Introduce ESTP-Bench (Ego Streaming Proactive Benchmark) and ESTP-F1 as evaluation frameworks. Propose a practical pipeline with three components: (1) a data engine, (2) a multi-stage training strategy, and (3) a proactive dynamic compression technique to train models to proactively answer evolving questions while maintaining synchronized perception and reasoning.

Result: The proposed model addresses the three key properties and outperforms multiple baselines across various online and offline benchmarks.

Conclusion: ESTP-Bench and the accompanying pipeline offer a rigorous framework for evaluating proactive, just-in-time, synchronized ego-streaming AI and show promise for human-like assistive systems; project page available.

Abstract: Envision an AI capable of functioning in human-like settings, moving beyond
mere observation to actively understand, anticipate, and proactively respond to
unfolding events. Towards this vision, we focus on the innovative task where,
given ego-streaming video input, an assistant proactively answers diverse,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BalanceGS optimizes training for 3D Gaussian Splatting by balancing Gaussian density, adaptively distributing workloads, and improving memory access, achieving 1.44x speedup with negligible quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3DGS training suffers from skewed density, imbalanced workloads, and fragmented memory access across the three-stage pipeline, limiting efficiency and scalability.

Method: Algorithm level: workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to prune redundant Gaussians in dense regions and fill gaps in sparse ones. System level: similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging to adapt thread-Gaussian mapping based on local density. Mapping level: reordering-based memory access to enable batch loading of RGB in shared memory.

Result: 1.44x training speedup on NVIDIA A100 with negligible quality degradation compared to the baseline 3DGS.

Conclusion: BalanceGS demonstrates that coordinating algorithmic heuristics, system scheduling, and memory access patterns can substantially accelerate 3DGS training while preserving reconstruction quality by balancing workloads and reducing redundancy.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising 3D reconstruction
technique. The traditional 3DGS training pipeline follows three sequential
steps: Gaussian densification, Gaussian projection, and color splatting.
Despite its promising reconstruction quality, this conventional approach
suffers from three critical inefficiencies: (1) Skewed density allocation
during Gaussian densification, (2) Imbalanced computation workload during
Gaussian projection and (3) Fragmented memory access during color splatting.
  To tackle the above challenges, we introduce BalanceGS, the algorithm-system
co-design for efficient training in 3DGS. (1) At the algorithm level, we
propose heuristic workload-sensitive Gaussian density control to automatically
balance point distributions - removing 80% redundant Gaussians in dense regions
while filling gaps in sparse areas. (2) At the system level, we propose
Similarity-based Gaussian sampling and merging, which replaces the static
one-to-one thread-pixel mapping with adaptive workload distribution - threads
now dynamically process variable numbers of Gaussians based on local cluster
density. (3) At the mapping level, we propose reordering-based memory access
mapping strategy that restructures RGB storage and enables batch loading in
shared memory.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with 3DGS, our approach
achieves a 1.44$\times$ training speedup on a NVIDIA A100 GPU with negligible
quality degradation.

TL;DR: CALM-Net is a curvature-aware, multi-branch LiDAR point-cloud network for vehicle re-identification that fuses edge convolution, point attention, and curvature embedding to capture discriminative geometric features, achieving ~1.97 percentage points improvement on nuScenes over a strong baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve LiDAR-based vehicle re-identification by capturing local surface variation and complementary geometric cues from 3D point clouds, addressing the challenge of learning discriminative features for reID.

Method: A multi-branch architecture combining edge convolution, point attention, and a curvature embedding that encodes local surface variation in LiDAR point clouds; evaluated on the nuScenes dataset with re-identification accuracy as the metric.

Result: Mean re-identification accuracy improves by approximately 1.97 percentage points over the strongest baseline in the study, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating curvature information and multi-branch feature learning.

Conclusion: Curvature-aware embeddings and multi-branch fusion enhance LiDAR-based vehicle re-identification and validate the benefit of curvature information for deep learning on 3D point clouds.

Abstract: This paper presents CALM-Net, a curvature-aware LiDAR point cloud-based
multi-branch neural network for vehicle re-identification. The proposed model
addresses the challenge of learning discriminative and complementary features
from three-dimensional point clouds to distinguish between vehicles. CALM-Net
employs a multi-branch architecture that integrates edge convolution, point
attention, and a curvature embedding that characterizes local surface variation
in point clouds. By combining these mechanisms, the model learns richer

re-identification task. Experimental evaluation on the large-scale nuScenes
dataset demonstrates that CALM-Net achieves a mean re-identification accuracy
improvement of approximately 1.97\% points compared with the strongest baseline

multi-branch feature learning for LiDAR point cloud-based vehicle
re-identification.

### [50] [Talking Points: Describing and Localizing Pixels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14583)
*Matan Rusanovsky,Shimon Malnick,Shai Avidan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-component framework for pixel-level keypoint grounding using free-form descriptions; introduces a synthetic dataset (LlamaPointInPart) with 20k+ triplets, and a GRPO-based training setup with a frozen localizer as reward; evaluated by a localization-accuracy protocol and shows strong performance; code and data released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models excel at object/region grounding but lack pixel-precise keypoint understanding via natural language. There is a need for free-form, contextual descriptions that anchor keypoints in visual context, and for training data to support pixel-level grounding.

Method: Point Descriptor generates rich, contextual, free-form descriptions of individual keypoints. Point Localizer regresses exact pixel coordinates from these descriptions. LlamaPointInPart is a 20k+ image-keypoint-description dataset synthesized from multiple vision-language models. Descriptor is optimized on AP-10K via GRPO, using the frozen Point Localizer as a reward to maximize localization accuracy. Evaluation uses a protocol that measures how close the predicted point is to the ground-truth rather than text-ground-truth match.

Result: The approach achieves superior performance over baselines on LlamaPointInPart, demonstrating effective pixel-level grounding and cross-category generalization. The bidirectional framework also suggests potential for future language-guided precise localization.

Conclusion: Pixel-level keypoint grounding is feasible with a descriptor–localizer architecture. The framework enables precise localization guided by natural language and supports future applications in keypoint-guided image understanding. The dataset and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal
understanding. Yet, these models remain limited to object-level or region-level
grounding, lacking the capability for pixel-precise keypoint comprehension
through natural language. We introduce a novel framework for pixel level
grounding. The framework consists of two complementary components: a Point
Descriptor that generates rich, contextual descriptions of individual
keypoints, and a Point Localizer that regresses precise pixel coordinates from
these descriptions. Unlike prior work that relies on templated prompts or
keypoint names, our approach produces free-form, coarse-to-fine descriptions
that situate keypoints within their visual context. Since there is no available
dataset to train such a system, we introduce LlamaPointInPart, a carefully
curated dataset of 20K+ image-keypoint-description triplets synthesized from
multiple vision-language models, capturing multi-scale information from
scene-level context to visual features around the keypoint. For cross-category
generalization, we optimize the Point Descriptor on AP-10K via GRPO, using the
frozen Point Localizer as a reward model to produce descriptions that maximize
localization accuracy. To evaluate our results we establish a new evaluation
protocol. Instead of comparing the text description produced by our method to
the ground truth, we use the localizer to determine how close is the predicted
point generated to the ground truth point. Experiments demonstrate superior
performance compared to baseline models on LlamaPointInPart.The bidirectional
nature of our framework should enable future applications in both
keypoint-guided image understanding and language-guided precise localization.

### [51] [STANCE: Motion Coherent Video Generation Via Sparse-to-Dense Anchored Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14588)
*Zhifei Chen,Tianshuo Xu,Leyi Wu,Luozhou Wang,Dongyu Yan,Zihan You,Wenting Luo,Guo Zhang,Yingcong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STANCE is a two-component image-to-video framework for better temporal coherence and ease of use. It introduces Instance Cues to convert sparse, user hint guidance into a dense, 2.5D motion field, and Dense RoPE to preserve motion cue salience in token space. Joint RGB plus auxiliary-map prediction anchors structure while appearance is handled by RGB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation struggles with two bottlenecks: (i) sparse human-provided motion hints collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance; (ii) optimizing appearance and motion in a single head biases toward texture over temporal consistency. There is a need for easy-to-use motion hints and more stable temporal coherence.

Method: Instance Cues: a pixel-aligned control signal that converts sparse hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the instance mask. Dense RoPE: tags a small set of motion tokens anchored on the first frame with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings, preserving cue salience in token space. Joint RGB (+ auxiliary-map prediction such as segmentation or depth) to anchor structure while appearance is handled by RGB.

Result: The approach improves temporal coherence and stability, reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrows, and does not require per-frame trajectory scripts. It makes motion guidance easier to use by dense tokenization and preserves cue salience in tokens, while RGB drives appearance.

Conclusion: STANCE decouples motion guidance from appearance to achieve coherent object motion in video generation. The two components—Instance Cues and Dense RoPE—anchor structural cues while enabling stable optimization and better temporal consistency.

Abstract: Video generation has recently made striking visual progress, but maintaining
coherent object motion and interactions remains difficult. We trace two
practical bottlenecks: (i) human-provided motion hints (e.g., small 2D maps)
often collapse to too few effective tokens after encoding, weakening guidance;
and (ii) optimizing for appearance and motion in a single head can favor
texture over temporal consistency. We present STANCE, an image-to-video
framework that addresses both issues with two simple components. First, we
introduce Instance Cues -- a pixel-aligned control signal that turns sparse,
user-editable hints into a dense 2.5D (camera-relative) motion field by
averaging per-instance flow and augmenting with monocular depth over the
instance mask. This reduces depth ambiguity compared to 2D arrow inputs while
remaining easy to use. Second, we preserve the salience of these cues in token
space with Dense RoPE, which tags a small set of motion tokens (anchored on the
first frame) with spatial-addressable rotary embeddings. Paired with joint RGB
\(+\) auxiliary-map prediction (segmentation or depth), our model anchors
structure while RGB handles appearance, stabilizing optimization and improving
temporal coherence without requiring per-frame trajectory scripts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current state-of-the-art classifiers like SpeciesNet use conservative rollups, labeling many animals only at high taxonomic levels. This work aims to recover species-level identifications to improve granularity for conservation and monitoring.

Combines SpeciesNet EfficientNetV2-M predictions with CLIP embeddings and metric learning within the Animal Detect platform. Evaluated on the LILA BC Desert Lion Conservation dataset (4,018 images, 15,031 detections).

Result: Recovered 761 bird detections from blank/animal labels. Re-classified 456 detections labeled animal, mammal, or blank with 96.5% accuracy. Achieved species-level identification for 64.9% of target cases.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of hierarchical re-classification to move from coarse to species-level labels, yielding substantial species-level identifications on a conservation dataset and illustrating the utility of combining deep predictions with metric learning and CLIP embeddings.

Abstract: State-of-the-art animal classification models like SpeciesNet provide
predictions across thousands of species but use conservative rollup strategies,
resulting in many animals labeled at high taxonomic levels rather than species.
We present a hierarchical re-classification system for the Animal Detect
platform that combines SpeciesNet EfficientNetV2-M predictions with CLIP
embeddings and metric learning to refine high-level taxonomic labels toward
species-level identification. Our five-stage pipeline (high-confidence
acceptance, bird override, centroid building, triplet-loss metric learning, and
adaptive cosine-distance scoring) is evaluated on a segment of the LILA BC
Desert Lion Conservation dataset (4,018 images, 15,031 detections). After
recovering 761 bird detections from "blank" and "animal" labels, we re-classify

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zero-shot organization of unlabeled wildlife images using self-supervised vision transformers, evaluated with unsupervised clustering (DBSCAN, GMM) across three architectures (CLIP, DINOv2, MegaDescriptor) and dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP); DINOv2 + UMAP + GMM achieved high accuracy (macro-F1 0.874) and 1D similarity ordering was effective; deployed in production to aid biodiversity annotation.


<details>

Conclusion: Continuous similarity ordering was deployed in production, enabling rapid exploratory analysis and accelerating manual annotation workflows for biodiversity monitoring.

Abstract: Camera traps generate millions of wildlife images, yet many datasets contain
species that are absent from existing classifiers. This work evaluates
zero-shot approaches for organizing unlabeled wildlife imagery using
self-supervised vision transformers, developed and tested within the Animal
Detect platform for camera trap analysis. We compare unsupervised clustering
methods (DBSCAN, GMM) across three architectures (CLIP, DINOv2, MegaDescriptor)
combined with dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, UMAP), and we
demonstrate continuous 1D similarity ordering via t-SNE projection. On a
5-species test set with ground truth labels used only for evaluation, DINOv2
with UMAP and GMM achieves 88.6 percent accuracy (macro-F1 = 0.874), while 1D
sorting reaches 88.2 percent coherence for mammals and birds and 95.2 percent
for fish across 1,500 images. Based on these findings, we deployed continuous
similarity ordering in production, enabling rapid exploratory analysis and
accelerating manual annotation workflows for biodiversity monitoring.

*Yuyang Hong,Jiaqi Gu,Qi Yang,Lubin Fan,Yue Wu,Ying Wang,Kun Ding,Shiming Xiang,Jieping Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Wiki-PRF is a three-stage framework for knowledge-based VQA that combines Processing (dynamic visual-tool use), Retrieval (multimodal knowledge retrieval), and Filtering (relevance-focused curation) with reinforcement learning to optimize answer accuracy and format. It achieves state-of-the-art results on E-VQA and InfoSeek, with large reported gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KB-VQA requires seamless integration of visual understanding and external knowledge. Existing retrieval-augmented methods (RAG) struggle with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved content, hindering answer quality.

Method: Three-stage approach: (1) Processing: dynamically invoke visual tools to extract precise multimodal information for retrieval; (2) Retrieval: fuse visual and text features to perform multimodal knowledge retrieval; (3) Filtering: relevance filtering and concentration of retrieval results. A visual-language model is trained with rewards for answer accuracy and format consistency via reinforcement learning to improve reasoning, tool invocation, and content filtering.

Result: Experiments on E-VQA and InfoSeek show significant improvements in answer quality (36.0 and 42.8) and achieve state-of-the-art performance; code is released at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: A structured, tool-guided processing pipeline combined with RL-aware training of a visual-language model effectively enhances KB-VQA performance, validating the benefits of multimodal-aware retrieval and relevance filtering for knowledge-grounded visual tasks.

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires visual language
models (VLMs) to integrate visual understanding with external knowledge
retrieval. Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant
advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles
with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results.
To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed
Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing
stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal
information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text
features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage
performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this
end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and
format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This
enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and
filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and
InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality,
achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at

### [55] [Shot2Tactic-Caption: Multi-Scale Captioning of Badminton Videos for Tactical Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14617)
*Ning Ding,Keisuke Fujii,Toru Tamaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Shot2Tactic-Caption, a dual-branch video captioning framework for badminton that generates shot-level and tactic-level captions using a spatio-temporal Transformer, plus a Tactic Unit Detector and shot-wise prompt-guided decoding; accompanied by the Shot2Tactic-Caption Dataset (5,494 shot captions, 544 tactic captions).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable semantic and temporal understanding of badminton tactics, addressing the need for captions that describe both individual actions and their dynamic execution over time within tactical play.

Method: A dual-branch architecture where each branch has a visual encoder (ResNet50 variants), a spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and a Transformer decoder. A Tactic Unit Detector identifies valid tactic units, types, and states. A shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism embeds predicted tactic type/state as prompts into the decoder via cross-attention to guide tactic captioning and handle interrupted/resumed tactics.

Result: Experiments show the approach effectively generates both shot and tactic captions. Ablation studies indicate the ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms alternatives, and shot-wise prompt structuring yields more coherent and accurate tactic captions.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances badminton captioning by delivering multi-scale, temporally-aware descriptions and a dataset to support this task; the shot-wise prompting mechanism specifically enhances the description of interrupted/resumed tactics.

Abstract: Tactical understanding in badminton involves interpreting not only individual
actions but also how tactics are dynamically executed over time. In this paper,
we propose \textbf{Shot2Tactic-Caption}, a novel framework for semantic and
temporal multi-scale video captioning in badminton, capable of generating
shot-level captions that describe individual actions and tactic-level captions
that capture how these actions unfold over time within a tactical execution. We
also introduce the Shot2Tactic-Caption Dataset, the first badminton captioning
dataset containing 5,494 shot captions and 544 tactic captions.
Shot2Tactic-Caption adopts a dual-branch design, with both branches including a
visual encoder, a spatio-temporal Transformer encoder, and a Transformer-based
decoder to generate shot and tactic captions. To support tactic captioning, we
additionally introduce a Tactic Unit Detector that identifies valid tactic
units, tactic types, and tactic states (e.g., Interrupt, Resume). For tactic
captioning, we further incorporate a shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism, where
the predicted tactic type and state are embedded as prompts and injected into
the decoder via cross-attention. The shot-wise prompt-guided mechanism enables
our system not only to describe successfully executed tactics but also to
capture tactical executions that are temporarily interrupted and later resumed.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in
generating both shot and tactic captions. Ablation studies show that the
ResNet50-based spatio-temporal encoder outperforms other variants, and that
shot-wise prompt structuring leads to more coherent and accurate tactic
captioning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVS reduces token redundancy in video inputs by pruning temporally static patches, enabling faster VLM/LLM inference with minimal accuracy loss, without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video vision-language models incur quadratic token costs; long videos exceed language model budgets, causing context limitations and latency. A simple method to reduce tokens without retraining could unlock scalable video understanding.

Method: Identify temporally static patches across consecutive frames and prune them, preserving their positional identity. Plug-and-play with no architectural changes or retraining. Applied at inference time to speed up processing; with an uptraining phase using stochastic pruning, improve robustness across compression levels.

Result: Substantial token reduction with preserved semantic fidelity, enabling faster inference and longer input sequences. Inference-time EVS can reduce LLM time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 4x with minimal accuracy loss. Uptraining yields robustness to varying pruning levels and maintains full performance under aggressive pruning. Experiments show consistent efficiency-accuracy gains across datasets.

Conclusion: EVS provides a simple, deployable approach to scalable video-language understanding by reducing token redundancy without sacrificing quality; it substantially improves efficiency-accuracy trade-offs and does not require architectural changes.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently expanded from static image
understanding to video reasoning, but their scalability is fundamentally
limited by the quadratic cost of processing dense frame sequences. Long videos
often exceed the token budget of modern language models, leading to severe
context limitations and latency issues. We introduce Efficient Video Sampling
(EVS), a simple, plug-and-play method for reducing token redundancy in videos
by identifying and pruning temporally static patches -- spatial regions that
remain unchanged across consecutive frames. EVS preserves positional identity,
requires no architectural changes or retraining. We show that EVS substantially
reduces token count while maintaining semantic fidelity, enabling faster
inference and longer input sequences. Applied at inference time, EVS reduces
large language model (LLM) time-to-first-token (TTFT) by up to 4x with minimal
accuracy loss. When combined with an uptraining phase using stochastic pruning
rates, EVS yields models that are robust to varying compression levels and
retain full performance under aggressive pruning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that EVS consistently improves efficiency-accuracy trade-offs,
unlocking scalable video-language understanding without sacrificing quality.

*Ming Gui,Johannes Schusterbauer,Timy Phan,Felix Krause,Josh Susskind,Miguel Angel Bautista,Björn Ommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RepTok introduces a single-token latent representation derived from a pre-trained self-supervised vision encoder, paired with a generative decoder and trained with flow matching. It achieves faithful image reconstruction with lower training costs, providing competitive ImageNet generation and zero-shot MS-COCO performance with limited budgets for text-to-image synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to reduce the complexity and cost of deep generative models by leveraging compact, geometry-preserving SSL features as latent spaces, enabling efficient training and generation without sacrificing fidelity.

Method: Start from a pre-trained self-supervised encoder. Fine-tune only the semantic token embedding and pair it with a generative decoder trained jointly using a standard flow-matching objective. To preserve SSL geometry, apply a cosine-similarity loss to regularize the adapted token. Use a single continuous latent token to avoid 2D spatial redundancies and reduce training cost.

Result: Achieves competitive results on class-conditional ImageNet generation and extends naturally to text-to-image synthesis, including competitive zero-shot MS-COCO performance under extremely limited training budgets.

Conclusion: Fine-tuning SSL representations yields compact, effective latent spaces for efficient generative modeling. A single-token latent reduces spatial redundancies and training costs while maintaining fidelity and enabling T2I with limited data.

Abstract: We introduce Representation Tokenizer (RepTok), a generative modeling
framework that represents an image using a single continuous latent token
obtained from self-supervised vision transformers. Building on a pre-trained
SSL encoder, we fine-tune only the semantic token embedding and pair it with a
generative decoder trained jointly using a standard flow matching objective.
This adaptation enriches the token with low-level, reconstruction-relevant
details, enabling faithful image reconstruction. To preserve the favorable
geometry of the original SSL space, we add a cosine-similarity loss that
regularizes the adapted token, ensuring the latent space remains smooth and
suitable for generation. Our single-token formulation resolves spatial
redundancies of 2D latent spaces and significantly reduces training costs.
Despite its simplicity and efficiency, RepTok achieves competitive results on
class-conditional ImageNet generation and naturally extends to text-to-image
synthesis, reaching competitive zero-shot performance on MS-COCO under
extremely limited training budgets. Our findings highlight the potential of
fine-tuned SSL representations as compact and effective latent spaces for
efficient generative modeling.

*Jihyun Yu,Yoojin Oh,Wonho Bae,Mingyu Kim,Junhyug Noh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inference-only diffusion-based test-time adaptation (SteeringTTA) uses Feynman-Kac steering with multiple particle trajectories guided by pseudo-label rewards to adapt inputs for classification, achieving better robustness on ImageNet-C without model updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time adaptation under distribution shifts is hindered when input-only diffusion methods rely on gradient guidance, which can limit exploration across distortion types and often requires access to source data. An inference-only, exploration-friendly approach is desirable.

Method: SteeringTTA is an inference-only framework that applies Feynman-Kac steering to guide diffusion-based input adaptation for classification. It maintains multiple particle trajectories steered by a combination of cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule to balance exploration and confidence, using pseudo-label rewards to drive the adaptation. No model updates or source data are used.

Result: On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently outperforms the baseline without any model updates or source data.

Conclusion: SteeringTTA offers an effective inference-only test-time adaptation method that enhances robustness to corruptions by better exploration and leveraging pseudo-label rewards, without requiring training-time data or model updates.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to correct performance degradation of deep
models under distribution shifts by updating models or inputs using unlabeled
test data. Input-only diffusion-based TTA methods improve robustness for
classification to corruptions but rely on gradient guidance, limiting
exploration and generalization across distortion types. We propose SteeringTTA,
an inference-only framework that adapts Feynman-Kac steering to guide
diffusion-based input adaptation for classification with rewards driven by
pseudo-label. SteeringTTA maintains multiple particle trajectories, steered by
a combination of cumulative top-K probabilities and an entropy schedule, to
balance exploration and confidence. On ImageNet-C, SteeringTTA consistently
outperforms the baseline without any model updates or source data.

*Xinyao Liao,Xianfang Zeng,Ziye Song,Zhoujie Fu,Gang Yu,Guosheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A low-cost pretraining strategy uses unpaired video clips to bootstrap instruction-based video editing, followed by fine-tuning on a small set of paired editing data, yielding strong editing capability and higher fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale paired video editing datasets are costly to construct. The work seeks a scalable approach to enable instruction-based video editing by leveraging abundant unpaired video data to learn editing concepts.

Method: Pretrain a foundation video generation model (based on HunyuanVideoT2V) on ~1M real video clips to learn basic editing concepts via in-context learning from unpaired clips. Then fine-tune on fewer than 150k curated editing pairs to expand editing tasks and improve quality.

Result: The method surpasses existing instruction-based video editing approaches in instruction alignment and visual fidelity, with about 12% higher editing instruction following and 15% higher editing quality.

Conclusion: Low-cost pretraining on unpaired data can endow a video-editing foundation model with versatile editing capabilities, which can be efficiently refined with a relatively small amount of high-quality paired data, reducing data requirements while improving performance.

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension
to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and
complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To
address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for
instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from
unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation
model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as
adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing
instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small
amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our
framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic
editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated
editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality.
Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing
instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and
visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following
and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.

TL;DR: DBP-enhanced MAE pre-training accelerates ViT training and reduces energy use while boosting downstream segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the substantial compute cost of MAE pre-training in resource-constrained industrial settings without sacrificing performance.

Method: Integrate Decorrelated Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, applying it selectively to the encoder to decorrelate inputs per layer and speed up convergence.

Result: On ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning, DBP-MAE reduces wall-clock time to baseline by 21.1%, lowers carbon emissions by 21.4%, and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points; gains persist on proprietary industrial data.

Conclusion: DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training, demonstrating practical applicability in real-world settings.

Abstract: Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pre-training of vision transformers (ViTs) yields
strong performance in low-label regimes but comes with substantial
computational costs, making it impractical in time- and resource-constrained
industrial settings. We address this by integrating Decorrelated
Backpropagation (DBP) into MAE pre-training, an optimization method that
iteratively reduces input correlations at each layer to accelerate convergence.
Applied selectively to the encoder, DBP achieves faster pre-training without
loss of stability. On ImageNet-1K pre-training with ADE20K fine-tuning, DBP-MAE
reduces wall-clock time to baseline performance by 21.1%, lowers carbon
emissions by 21.4% and improves segmentation mIoU by 1.1 points. We observe
similar gains when pre-training and fine-tuning on proprietary industrial data,
confirming the method's applicability in real-world scenarios. These results
demonstrate that DBP can reduce training time and energy use while improving
downstream performance for large-scale ViT pre-training.

*Weikang Yu,Vincent Nwazelibe,Xianping Ma,Xiaokang Zhang,Richard Gloaguen,Xiao Xiang Zhu,Pedram Ghamisi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EuroMineNet is a comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining footprint mapping using Sentinel-2 imagery across 133 EU sites (2015–2024), introducing a Change-Aware Temporal IoU metric and benchmarking 20 deep learning models for both multitemporal mapping and cross-temporal change detection, with open data/code to advance sustainable land-use monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for long-term, continental-scale monitoring of mining-induced land surface changes. Existing datasets lack temporal depth and geographic scope, hindering sustainable resource management and environmental governance. A standardized, temporally consistent benchmark would enable evaluation of GeoAI methods for detecting gradual and abrupt mining-related surface transformations.

Method: Construct EuroMineNet from Sentinel-2 imagery for 133 mining sites in the European Union, providing annual observations from 2015 to 2024 with expert-verified annotations. Define two tasks: (1) multitemporal mining footprint mapping for consistent annual land-use delineation, evaluated with a Change-Aware Temporal IoU (CA-TIoU) metric; (2) cross-temporal change detection to capture gradual and abrupt surface transformations. Benchmark 20 state-of-the-art deep learning models and release code/dataset aligned with FAIR principles.

Result: Demonstrates that GeoAI methods effectively identify long-term environmental changes but struggle with short-term dynamics. CA-TIoU provides a tailored evaluation for temporally-aware mapping. EuroMineNet enables consistent annual mining footprint delineation and cross-temporal change detection at continental scale, with 20 models benchmarked and insights into their strengths/weaknesses. Dataset and code release supports reproducibility and broad application to sustainable land-use monitoring.

Conclusion: EuroMineNet advances temporally consistent and explainable mining monitoring at continental scale, contributing to sustainable land-use management and environmental resilience. By releasing data and code under FAIR/open-science practices, it facilitates broader adoption of GeoAI for social and environmental good.

Abstract: Mining activities are essential for industrial and economic development, but
remain a leading source of environmental degradation, contributing to
deforestation, soil erosion, and water contamination. Sustainable resource
management and environmental governance require consistent, long-term
monitoring of mining-induced land surface changes, yet existing datasets are
often limited in temporal depth or geographic scope. To address this gap, we
present EuroMineNet, the first comprehensive multitemporal benchmark for mining
footprint mapping and monitoring based on Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery.
Spanning 133 mining sites across the European Union, EuroMineNet provides
annual observations and expert-verified annotations from 2015 to 2024, enabling
GeoAI-based models to analyze environmental dynamics at a continental scale. It
supports two sustainability-driven tasks: (1) multitemporal mining footprint
mapping for consistent annual land-use delineation, evaluated with a novel
Change-Aware Temporal IoU (CA-TIoU) metric, and (2) cross-temporal change
detection to capture both gradual and abrupt surface transformations.
Benchmarking 20 state-of-the-art deep learning models reveals that while GeoAI
methods effectively identify long-term environmental changes, challenges remain
in detecting short-term dynamics critical for timely mitigation. By advancing
temporally consistent and explainable mining monitoring, EuroMineNet
contributes to sustainable land-use management, environmental resilience, and
the broader goal of applying GeoAI for social and environmental good. We
release the codes and datasets by aligning with FAIR and the open science
paradigm at https://github.com/EricYu97/EuroMineNet.

### [62] [WeCKD: Weakly-supervised Chained Distillation Network for Efficient Multimodal Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14668)
*Md. Abdur Rahman,Mohaimenul Azam Khan Raiaan,Sami Azam,Asif Karim,Jemima Beissbarth,Amanda Leach*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WeCKD introduces a weakly-supervised, chain-based knowledge distillation that forms a progressive distillation chain of multiple models. Each model learns from its predecessor and refines knowledge with limited data, improving over traditional single-teacher KD and achieving strong cross-dataset generalization, including gains up to ~23% with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional knowledge distillation (KD) suffers from knowledge degradation, data inefficiency, and over-reliance on very strong teachers or large labeled datasets. In real-world, data-limited medical imaging, there is a need for more data-efficient and robust transfer of knowledge.

Method: Propose a distillation chain named WeCKD consisting of multiple interconnected models. Each stage learns from its predecessor and refines the accumulated knowledge before passing it forward, with each model trained on only a fraction of the dataset. The chain is evaluated across four otoscopic imaging datasets and extended to other modalities to assess generalization.

Result: The chain-based, weakly-supervised KD matches or surpasses supervised methods on otoscopic datasets, with cumulative accuracy gains of up to 23% over a single backbone trained on the same limited data. It also demonstrates generalization to microscopic and MRI imaging across different datasets.

Conclusion: Chain-based, weakly-supervised knowledge distillation effectively mitigates data limitations and knowledge degradation, offering robust knowledge transfer, improved learning efficiency, and strong cross-domain generalization, suggesting strong potential for real-world medical imaging deployment.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has traditionally relied on a static
teacher-student framework, where a large, well-trained teacher transfers
knowledge to a single student model. However, these approaches often suffer
from knowledge degradation, inefficient supervision, and reliance on either a
very strong teacher model or large labeled datasets, which limits their
effectiveness in real-world, limited-data scenarios. To address these, we
present the first-ever Weakly-supervised Chain-based KD network (WeCKD) that
redefines knowledge transfer through a structured sequence of interconnected
models. Unlike conventional KD, it forms a progressive distillation chain,
where each model not only learns from its predecessor but also refines the
knowledge before passing it forward. This structured knowledge transfer further
enhances feature learning, reduces data dependency, and mitigates the
limitations of one-step KD. Each model in the distillation chain is trained on
only a fraction of the dataset and demonstrates that effective learning can be
achieved with minimal supervision. Extensive evaluations across four otoscopic
imaging datasets demonstrate that it not only matches but in many cases
surpasses the performance of existing supervised methods. Experimental results
on two other datasets further underscore its generalization across diverse
medical imaging modalities, including microscopic and magnetic resonance
imaging. Furthermore, our evaluations resulted in cumulative accuracy gains of
up to +23% over a single backbone trained on the same limited data, which
highlights its potential for real-world adoption.

Method: Proposes VTimeCoT, a training-free framework with two novel visual tools: (1) a plug-and-play progress bar integration tool and (2) a high-efficiency highlighting tool. Introduces visuotemporal CoT to integrate cross-modality reasoning across video and text. Evaluates on Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o for video temporal grounding and reasoning-based QA.

Result: Significant performance improvements are reported on the two baselines (Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o) for both video temporal grounding and reasoning-based QA. The approach also demonstrates a compositional and interpretable reasoning process.

Conclusion: VTimeCoT is a simple, training-free framework that enhances video grounding and reasoning in multimodal LLMs, achieving improved performance and offering interpretable reasoning; the authors provide a project page for further exploration.

Abstract: In recent years, video question answering based on multimodal large language
models (MLLM) has garnered considerable attention, due to the benefits from the
substantial advancements in LLMs. However, these models have a notable
deficiency in the domains of video temporal grounding and reasoning, posing
challenges to the development of effective real-world video understanding
systems. Inspired by how humans use video players to interact with the progress
bar for video comprehension, we introduce VTimeCoT, a simple yet effective
training-free framework, designed for high-performance video grounding and
reasoning. The proposed framework incorporates two novel visual tools of the
progress bar: a plug-and-play progress bar integration tool and a
high-efficiency highlighting tool. In addition, to address the limitations of
conventional text-based chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, we introduce a
visuotemporal CoT process that integrates cross-modality reasoning across both
video and text. Our approach demonstrates significant performance improvements
on both Qwen2VL-7B and GPT4o baselines in tasks of video temporal grounding and
reasoning-based question answering. Finally, we showcase that the proposed
framework achieves a compositional and interpretable reasoning process. Project

### [64] [Leveraging Learned Image Prior for 3D Gaussian Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14705)
*Seungjoo Shin,Jaesik Park,Sunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A learned-prior based framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) compression that restores artifacts via a restoration network applied to degraded Gaussians, using coarse rendering residuals as side information, achieving better rate-distortion and rendering quality at substantially lower storage and remaining compatible with existing compression baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation that existing 3DGS compression lacks learned priors, which constrains rate-distortion performance and rendering quality.

Method: Start from already compressed Gaussians and train a restoration network to model compression artifacts in image space, mapping degraded Gaussians back toward originals. Incorporate coarse rendering residuals as side information to guide restoration. Supervise the restoration using restored images, then refine the compressed Gaussians to boost rendering quality. Framework is designed to be compatible with existing Gaussian compression methods.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior rate-distortion performance and improved rendering quality over state-of-the-art 3DGS compression methods, while requiring substantially less storage.

Conclusion: Integrating learned image priors and side-information-driven restoration into 3DGS compression yields notable gains in efficiency and quality, with broad compatibility across baselines.

Abstract: Compression techniques for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have recently
achieved considerable success in minimizing storage overhead for 3D Gaussians
while preserving high rendering quality. Despite the impressive storage
reduction, the lack of learned priors restricts further advances in the
rate-distortion trade-off for 3DGS compression tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel 3DGS compression framework that leverages the powerful
representational capacity of learned image priors to recover
compression-induced quality degradation. Built upon initially compressed
Gaussians, our restoration network effectively models the compression artifacts
in the image space between degraded and original Gaussians. To enhance the
rate-distortion performance, we provide coarse rendering residuals into the
restoration network as side information. By leveraging the supervision of
restored images, the compressed Gaussians are refined, resulting in a highly
compact representation with enhanced rendering performance. Our framework is
designed to be compatible with existing Gaussian compression methods, making it
broadly applicable across different baselines. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior rate-distortion
performance and outperforming the rendering quality of state-of-the-art 3DGS
compression methods while requiring substantially less storage.

*Caleb Robinson,Kimberly T. Goetz,Christin B. Khan,Meredith Sackett,Kathleen Leonard,Rahul Dodhia,Juan M. Lavista Ferres*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semi-automated anomaly-based whale detection in VHR satellite imagery; high recall with huge reduction in expert work; no labeled training data; open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need scalable, cost-effective whale monitoring. Traditional surveys are expensive and hard to scale; annotated data are scarce and conditions vary.

Method: Spatial outlier anomaly detector surfaces candidate 'interesting points' in VHR imagery; web-based labeling interface lets experts annotate quickly; no supervised training data required; evaluated on three scenes with known whale annotations; open-source pipeline.

Result: Recalls of 90.3% to 96.4%; expert inspection area reduced by up to 99.8% (from >1000 sq km to <2 sq km); open-sourced pipeline at GitHub.

Conclusion: Represents a scalable first step toward machine-assisted marine mammal monitoring from space, enabling large-scale screening without labeled data; can be extended with additional labeling and refinement.

Abstract: Effective monitoring of whale populations is critical for conservation, but
traditional survey methods are expensive and difficult to scale. While prior
work has shown that whales can be identified in very high-resolution (VHR)
satellite imagery, large-scale automated detection remains challenging due to a
lack of annotated imagery, variability in image quality and environmental
conditions, and the cost of building robust machine learning pipelines over
massive remote sensing archives. We present a semi-automated approach for
surfacing possible whale detections in VHR imagery using a statistical anomaly
detection method that flags spatial outliers, i.e. "interesting points". We
pair this detector with a web-based labeling interface designed to enable
experts to quickly annotate the interesting points. We evaluate our system on
three benchmark scenes with known whale annotations and achieve recalls of
90.3% to 96.4%, while reducing the area requiring expert inspection by up to
99.8% -- from over 1,000 sq km to less than 2 sq km in some cases. Our method
does not rely on labeled training data and offers a scalable first step toward
future machine-assisted marine mammal monitoring from space. We have open
sourced this pipeline at https://github.com/microsoft/whales.

TL;DR: First systematic evaluation of deep video camera movement classification on archival WWII footage; Video Swin Transformer leads with 80.25% accuracy on HISTORIAN, revealing generalization challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether modern camera movement classification models generalize to low-quality, archival material and to map differences in datasets and model design that impact performance.

Method: Summarize representative CMC methods and datasets; empirically assess five standard video classification models on the HISTORIAN archival dataset with expert-annotated World War II footage; analyze label definitions and architectural differences; evaluate performance and convergence with limited training data.

Result: Video Swin Transformer achieves 80.25% accuracy on HISTORIAN, showing strong convergence despite limited data; others provide insights on strengths/weaknesses; results highlight difficulty of adapting CMC models to archival footage and potential gains from multimodal inputs and temporal architectures.

Conclusion: There is promise in applying modern CMC models to archival material, but significant challenges remain; future work should explore multi-modal inputs and temporal architectures to improve robustness and generalization to low-quality historical video.

Abstract: Camera movement conveys spatial and narrative information essential for
understanding video content. While recent camera movement classification (CMC)
methods perform well on modern datasets, their generalization to historical
footage remains unexplored. This paper presents the first systematic evaluation
of deep video CMC models on archival film material. We summarize representative
methods and datasets, highlighting differences in model design and label
definitions. Five standard video classification models are assessed on the
HISTORIAN dataset, which includes expert-annotated World War II footage. The
best-performing model, Video Swin Transformer, achieves 80.25% accuracy,
showing strong convergence despite limited training data. Our findings
highlight the challenges and potential of adapting existing models to
low-quality video and motivate future work combining diverse input modalities
and temporal architectures.

### [67] [Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module for Multi-Scale Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14726)
*Dingzhou Xie,Rushi Lan,Cheng Pang,Enhao Ning,Jiahao Zeng,Wei Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module (CFSAM) to model inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale features, boosting SSD300 performance with notable gains on PASCAL VOC and COCO while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current attention-based detectors largely refine single-layer features or fuse only two layers, neglecting rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale representations, which limits performance for objects with large scale variation.

Method: Introduce CFSAM consisting of a convolutional local feature extractor, a Transformer-based global modeling unit to capture cross-layer interactions, and a feature fusion mechanism to restore/enhance representations; integrated into the SSD300 framework.

Result: Significant performance gains: 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs. 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO (vs. 43.1% baseline); outperforms existing attention modules and accelerates convergence with modest overhead.

Conclusion: Explicit cross-layer attention modeling across multi-scale features is effective for improving multi-scale object detection, and CFSAM provides a practical approach to leverage cross-layer dependencies in detection frameworks.

Abstract: Recent object detection methods have made remarkable progress by leveraging
attention mechanisms to improve feature discriminability. However, most
existing approaches are confined to refining single-layer or fusing dual-layer
features, overlooking the rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale
representations. This limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information essential for detecting objects with large scale variations. In
this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module
(CFSAM), which holistically models both local and global dependencies within
multi-scale feature maps. CFSAM consists of three key components: a
convolutional local feature extractor, a Transformer-based global modeling unit
that efficiently captures cross-layer interactions, and a feature fusion
mechanism to restore and enhance the original representations. When integrated
into the SSD300 framework, CFSAM significantly boosts detection performance,
achieving 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs. 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO
(vs. 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules. Moreover, the
module accelerates convergence during training without introducing substantial
computational overhead. Our work highlights the importance of explicit
cross-layer attention modeling in advancing multi-scale object detection.

### [68] [Free-Grained Hierarchical Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14737)
*Seulki Park,Zilin Wang,Stella X. Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces ImageNet-F, a benchmark for mixed-granularity hierarchical image classification, and free-grain learning. Uses CLIP-based label simulation to reflect human annotation ambiguity and combines pseudo-attributes from vision-language models with semi-supervised learning to improve performance under heterogeneous supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world annotations vary in granularity and quality; existing methods often assume complete, fine-grained labels, making them ill-suited for practical settings. A benchmark capturing cognitive-inspired taxonomy and mixed granularity is needed to study and improve hierarchical classification under realistic supervision.

Method: Construct ImageNet-F organized into basic, subordinate, and fine-grained levels; simulate realistic mixed-granularity labels using CLIP as a proxy for semantic ambiguity; propose free-grain learning with instance-wise heterogeneous supervision; develop approaches to enhance semantic guidance via pseudo-attributes derived from vision-language models and to strengthen visual guidance via semi-supervised learning.

Result: The proposed approaches, along with strong baselines, substantially improve accuracy under mixed supervision on the ImageNet-F benchmark.

Conclusion: Benchmark and methods together advance hierarchical image classification in real-world conditions by effectively leveraging mixed-granularity supervision through pseudo-attributes and SSL-based visual guidance.

Abstract: Hierarchical image classification predicts labels across a semantic taxonomy,
but existing methods typically assume complete, fine-grained annotations, an
assumption rarely met in practice. Real-world supervision varies in
granularity, influenced by image quality, annotator expertise, and task
demands; a distant bird may be labeled Bird, while a close-up reveals Bald
eagle. We introduce ImageNet-F, a large-scale benchmark curated from ImageNet
and structured into cognitively inspired basic, subordinate, and fine-grained
levels. Using CLIP as a proxy for semantic ambiguity, we simulate realistic,
mixed-granularity labels reflecting human annotation behavior. We propose
free-grain learning, with heterogeneous supervision across instances. We
develop methods that enhance semantic guidance via pseudo-attributes from
vision-language models and visual guidance via semi-supervised learning. These,
along with strong baselines, substantially improve performance under mixed
supervision. Together, our benchmark and methods advance hierarchical
classification under real-world constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEXTER is a data-free framework that uses diffusion models and LLMs to synthesize class-conditional images that activate a target classifier, enabling natural-language explanations of its decision process without training data or labels, and it outperforms prior methods on global explanations and bias reporting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable transparent, trustworthy AI by providing model-wide explanations without access to training data or ground-truth labels, addressing the data dependence and limitations of traditional explanation methods.

Method: Optimize prompts to generate class-conditioned images that strongly activate a target classifier using diffusion models, then use these synthetic samples with large language models to produce detailed natural-language reports describing class-specific decision patterns and biases. The framework is demonstrated on activation maximization, slice discovery/debiasing, and bias explanation across ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces.

Result: DEXTER yields accurate, interpretable NL outputs, validated by quantitative and qualitative evaluations and a user study, and it outperforms existing approaches in global model explanations and class-level bias reporting.

Conclusion: DEXTER enables natural-language explanations of a classifier’s decision process without access to training data, illustrating flexible applicability across tasks and datasets; code is publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Understanding and explaining the behavior of machine learning models is
essential for building transparent and trustworthy AI systems. We introduce
DEXTER, a data-free framework that employs diffusion models and large language
models to generate global, textual explanations of visual classifiers. DEXTER
operates by optimizing text prompts to synthesize class-conditional images that
strongly activate a target classifier. These synthetic samples are then used to
elicit detailed natural language reports that describe class-specific decision
patterns and biases. Unlike prior work, DEXTER enables natural language
explanation about a classifier's decision process without access to training
data or ground-truth labels. We demonstrate DEXTER's flexibility across three
tasks-activation maximization, slice discovery and debiasing, and bias
explanation-each illustrating its ability to uncover the internal mechanisms of
visual classifiers. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including a user
study, show that DEXTER produces accurate, interpretable outputs. Experiments
on ImageNet, Waterbirds, CelebA, and FairFaces confirm that DEXTER outperforms
existing approaches in global model explanation and class-level bias reporting.

### [70] [LightQANet: Quantized and Adaptive Feature Learning for Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14753)
*Xu Wu,Zhihui Lai,Xianxu Hou,Jie Zhou,Ya-nan Zhang,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces LightQANet with quantized and adaptive feature learning for robust low-light image enhancement, achieving state-of-the-art results across diverse lighting conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light images suffer from severely degraded pixel information, making it hard to extract reliable features. This leads to poor texture restoration, color inconsistency, and artifacts. A robust feature representation and adaptability to varying illumination are needed.

Method: Proposes Light Quantization Module (LQM) to extract and quantify illumination-related factors and enforce structured light factor learning for light-invariant representations. Introduces Light-Aware Prompt Module (LAPM) to encode illumination priors into learnable prompts, dynamically guiding feature learning to adapt to changing lighting conditions.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple low-light datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with superior qualitative and quantitative results across challenging lighting scenarios.

Conclusion: LightQANet delivers consistent and robust image quality across diverse lighting conditions by combining quantized illumination factor extraction with dynamic, illumination-aware prompts for adaptive feature learning.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve illumination while
preserving high-quality color and texture. However, existing methods often fail
to extract reliable feature representations due to severely degraded
pixel-level information under low-light conditions, resulting in poor texture
restoration, color inconsistency, and artifact. To address these challenges, we
propose LightQANet, a novel framework that introduces quantized and adaptive
feature learning for low-light enhancement, aiming to achieve consistent and
robust image quality across diverse lighting conditions. From the static
modeling perspective, we design a Light Quantization Module (LQM) to explicitly
extract and quantify illumination-related factors from image features. By
enforcing structured light factor learning, LQM enhances the extraction of
light-invariant representations and mitigates feature inconsistency across
varying illumination levels. From the dynamic adaptation perspective, we
introduce a Light-Aware Prompt Module (LAPM), which encodes illumination priors
into learnable prompts to dynamically guide the feature learning process. LAPM
enables the model to flexibly adapt to complex and continuously changing
lighting conditions, further improving image enhancement. Extensive experiments
on multiple low-light datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior qualitative and quantitative
results across various challenging lighting scenarios.

*Giuseppe Lorenzo Catalano,Agata Marta Soccini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-based void-filling for Martian heightmaps yields superior reconstruction over classic interpolation methods, using 12k HiRISE-derived samples and 128x128 resolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D representations of extraterrestrial terrains are critical for VR-based space exploration tasks; Mars datasets have many missing values and lack Earth-like conditioning data, limiting traditional inpainting.

Method: Train an unconditional diffusion model on augmented Martian heightmaps (12k samples) with non-homogeneous multi-scale rescaling, resize to 128x128; evaluate vs IDW, kriging, Navier-Stokes on 1k test samples.

Result: Outperforms baselines in reconstruction accuracy (4-15% RMSE improvement) and perceptual similarity (29-81% LPIPS improvement) relative to the original data.

Conclusion: Unconditional diffusion models are effective for Martian terrain reconstruction, enabling more reliable VR-ready heightmaps and supporting broader extraterrestrial mapping tasks; future work could explore conditioning or higher resolutions.

Abstract: Space exploration increasingly relies on Virtual Reality for several tasks,
such as mission planning, multidisciplinary scientific analysis, and astronaut
training. A key factor for the reliability of the simulations is having
accurate 3D representations of planetary terrains. Extraterrestrial heightmaps
derived from satellite imagery often contain missing values due to acquisition
and transmission constraints. Mars is among the most studied planets beyond
Earth, and its extensive terrain datasets make the Martian surface
reconstruction a valuable task, although many areas remain unmapped. Deep
learning algorithms can support void-filling tasks; however, whereas Earth's
comprehensive datasets enables the use of conditional methods, such approaches
cannot be applied to Mars. Current approaches rely on simpler interpolation
techniques which, however, often fail to preserve geometric coherence. In this
work, we propose a method for reconstructing the surface of Mars based on an
unconditional diffusion model. Training was conducted on an augmented dataset
of 12000 Martian heightmaps derived from NASA's HiRISE survey. A
non-homogeneous rescaling strategy captures terrain features across multiple
scales before resizing to a fixed 128x128 model resolution. We compared our
method against established void-filling and inpainting techniques, including
Inverse Distance Weighting, kriging, and Navier-Stokes algorithm, on an
evaluation set of 1000 samples. Results show that our approach consistently
outperforms these methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy (4-15% on RMSE)
and perceptual similarity (29-81% on LPIPS) with the original data.

*Zhang Nengbo,Hann Woei Ho,Ye Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A visual, energy-efficient MAV swarm communication method using event cameras and a four-primitives codebook, decoded by segmentation and a lightweight SNN, enabling robust, low-power signaling in constrained environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of radio-based MAV swarm communication (spectrum congestion, jamming, high power consumption) by leveraging passive visual signaling inspired by waggle dances.

Method: MAVs convey information via deliberate motion patterns (four primitives). Event cameras passively capture these motions. A visual codebook maps primitives to control symbols (start/end/1/0). Decoding uses an event-frame segmentation model and a lightweight Spiking Neural Network for action recognition, with an integrated decoding algorithm combining segmentation and classification.

Result: Experimentally, the framework achieves accurate decoding with low power consumption, demonstrating viability as an energy-efficient alternative for MAV communication in constrained environments.

Conclusion: The approach is promising for energy-efficient MAV communication. Further work should address robustness, scalability, noise, and real-world deployment in diverse environments and multi-swarm scenarios.

Abstract: Reliable communication in Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) swarms is challenging in
environments, where conventional radio-based methods suffer from spectrum
congestion, jamming, and high power consumption. Inspired by the waggle dance
of honeybees, which efficiently communicate the location of food sources
without sound or contact, we propose a novel visual communication framework for
MAV swarms using motion-based signaling. In this framework, MAVs convey
information, such as heading and distance, through deliberate flight patterns,
which are passively captured by event cameras and interpreted using a
predefined visual codebook of four motion primitives: vertical (up/down),
horizontal (left/right), left-to-up-to-right, and left-to-down-to-right,
representing control symbols (``start'', ``end'', ``1'', ``0''). To decode
these signals, we design an event frame-based segmentation model and a
lightweight Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for action recognition. An integrated
decoding algorithm then combines segmentation and classification to robustly
interpret MAV motion sequences. Experimental results validate the framework's
effectiveness, which demonstrates accurate decoding and low power consumption,
and highlights its potential as an energy-efficient alternative for MAV
communication in constrained environments.

### [73] [CoT-PL: Visual Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Meets Pseudo-Labeling for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14792)
*Hojun Choi,Youngsun Lim,Jaeyo Shin,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoT-PL introduces structured visual chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into pseudo-labeling for open-vocabulary object detection, using a three-step process (region perception, zero-shot category recognition, background grounding) and a contrastive background learning (CBL). It achieves significant improvements in novel-class pseudo-label quality and sets new state-of-the-art on open-vocabulary COCO and LVIS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current open-vocabulary detection methods rely on direct image-text matching with vision-language models, which lacks interpretable intermediate reasoning steps and struggles with robustness in crowded or occluded scenes. There is a need for structured reasoning and feature disentanglement to improve generalization to unseen classes.

Method: CoT-PL decomposes object understanding into three interpretable steps: (1) region perception for unseen objects, (2) zero-shot category recognition, and (3) background grounding. The third step enables a contrastive background learning (CBL) that uses pre-computed background cues as negatives to promote feature disentanglement between objects and background. This integrated CoT reasoning with CBL enhances pseudo-labeling for crowded/occluded scenes.

Result: In crowded or occluded settings, the method reports relative improvements of 103.4% and 168.4% in novel-class pseudo-label quality over the best prior methods. It achieves +7.7 AP50 on open-vocabulary COCO and +2.9 mask AP on LVIS for novel classes, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: CoT-PL demonstrates that integrating structured chain-of-thought visual reasoning into pseudo-labeling, along with contrastive background learning, yields robust open-vocabulary detection and strong performance on COCO and LVIS for novel classes.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) seeks to recognize and localize object
categories beyond those seen during training. Recent approaches typically
leverage vision-language models (VLMs) to generate pseudo-labels using
image-text alignment, allowing detectors to generalize to unseen classes
without explicit supervision. However, these methods depend heavily on direct
image-text matching, neglecting the intermediate reasoning steps essential for
interpreting semantically complex scenes. This results in limited robustness
when confronted with crowded or occluded visual contexts. In this paper, we
introduce CoT-PL, a new framework that employs structured visual
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into the pseudo-labeling process. CoT-PL
decomposes object understanding into three interpretable steps: (1) region
perception even for unseen objects, (2) category recognition via zero-shot
reasoning, and (3) background grounding to separate semantically complex
objects. Crucially, the third step naturally motivates our contrastive
background learning (CBL) that uses the pre-computed background cues as
negatives to promote feature disentanglement between objects and background. In
this way, CoT reasoning and CBL form an integrated pipeline tailored to robust
pseudo-labeling in crowded or occluded scenes. Notably, in these two settings,
our novel-class pseudo-label quality achieves relative improvements of 103.4%
and 168.4% over the best prior, respectively. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that CoT-PL achieves +7.7 AP50 on open-vocabulary COCO and +2.9
mask AP on LVIS for novel classes, setting a new state of the art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM is an interpretable AI model for colorectal cancer pathology that encodes a continuous spectrum of morphological variation to prognosticate five-year overall survival, outperforming CRC-specific and foundation-model baselines with robustness across sex, subgroups, and treatment regimens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current task-agnostic foundation models in computational pathology may miss organ- and process-specific morphological patterns that drive tumor behavior and treatment response. There is a need for interpretable representations that capture intra-m morphological diversity and reflect incremental tumor evolution to improve prognostication in colorectal cancer.

Method: Develop PRISM (Prognostic Representation of Integrated Spatial Morphology) which represents a continuous variability spectrum within each distinct morphology to capture phenotypic diversity. Trained on 8.74 million histology images from 424 stage III CRC surgical resections, learning an integrated spatial morphology-based prognostic representation designed for interpretability and robust prognosis.

Result:  Five-year OS prognostic metrics: AUC 0.70±0.04; accuracy 68.37%±4.75%; HR 3.34 (95% CI 2.28–4.90); p<0.0001. Outperformed existing CRC-specific methods by ~15% and AI foundation models by ~23% in accuracy. Shows sex-agnostic robustness (AUC delta 0.02; accuracy delta 0.15%) and stable performance across clinicopathological subgroups, with minimal accuracy fluctuation (delta 1.44%) between 5FU/LV and CPT-11/5FU/LV regimens, aligning with Alliance cohort finding of no survival difference between treatments.

Conclusion: PRISM provides an interpretable, morphology-informed prognostic representation that improves long-term survival prediction in stage III CRC and demonstrates robustness across sex, subgroups, and treatments, suggesting potential clinical utility over generic foundation models and underscoring the value of incorporating continuous morphological variation into prognostic AI models.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most prevalent malignancy globally,
with approximately 154,000 new cases and 54,000 projected deaths anticipated
for 2025. The recent advancement of foundation models in computational
pathology has been largely propelled by task agnostic methodologies that can
overlook organ-specific crucial morphological patterns that represent distinct
biological processes that can fundamentally influence tumor behavior,
therapeutic response, and patient outcomes. The aim of this study is to develop
a novel, interpretable AI model, PRISM (Prognostic Representation of Integrated
Spatial Morphology), that incorporates a continuous variability spectrum within
each distinct morphology to characterize phenotypic diversity and reflecting
the principle that malignant transformation occurs through incremental
evolutionary processes rather than abrupt phenotypic shifts. PRISM is trained
on 8.74 million histological images extracted from surgical resection specimens
of 424 patients with stage III CRC. PRISM achieved superior prognostic
performance for five-year OS (AUC = 0.70 +- 0.04; accuracy = 68.37% +- 4.75%;
HR = 3.34, 95% CI = 2.28-4.90; p < 0.0001), outperforming existing CRC-specific
methods by 15% and AI foundation models by ~23% accuracy. It showed
sex-agnostic robustness (AUC delta = 0.02; accuracy delta = 0.15%) and stable
performance across clinicopathological subgroups, with minimal accuracy
fluctuation (delta = 1.44%) between 5FU/LV and CPT-11/5FU/LV regimens,
replicating the Alliance cohort finding of no survival difference between
treatments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R-Super: a scalable weakly-supervised tumor segmentation model trained on radiology reports to segment tumors without voxel-wise masks, achieving performance on par with mask-trained models and improving when combined with masks; enables segmentation across multiple organs previously lacking public masks; promises scalable early detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual tumor masking for supervised segmentation is costly and slow, creating a bottleneck for AI-assisted detection. Clinically available radiology reports contain rich tumor descriptors that are underutilized for training. Leveraging these reports can scale segmentation models and broaden applicability to diverse tumor types.

Method: Train segmentation models to produce tumor masks that match descriptions in medical reports (weakly supervised from text). Use large datasets of radiology reports to supervise segmentation; optionally combine with a smaller set of manually drawn masks to further improve performance. Evaluate on multi-organ CT data, including organs with no prior public masks.

Result: On 101,654 reports, the model achieved performance comparable to models trained on 723 masks. Combining reports with masks increased sensitivity by 13 percentage points and specificity by 8 percentage points, surpassing radiologists in detecting five of seven tumor types. Enabled segmentation in spleen, gallbladder, prostate, bladder, uterus, and esophagus where no public masks or AI models existed.

Conclusion: Large-scale report-based supervision can replace or substantially reduce the need for manual tumor masks, enabling scalable, diverse tumor segmentation across organs. The approach opens access to early detection for tumor types previously limited by lack of annotated masks. The authors plan to release code, models, and data.

Abstract: Early tumor detection save lives. Each year, more than 300 million computed
tomography (CT) scans are performed worldwide, offering a vast opportunity for
effective cancer screening. However, detecting small or early-stage tumors on
these CT scans remains challenging, even for experts. Artificial intelligence
(AI) models can assist by highlighting suspicious regions, but training such
models typically requires extensive tumor masks--detailed, voxel-wise outlines
of tumors manually drawn by radiologists. Drawing these masks is costly,
requiring years of effort and millions of dollars. In contrast, nearly every CT
scan in clinical practice is already accompanied by medical reports describing
the tumor's size, number, appearance, and sometimes, pathology
results--information that is rich, abundant, and often underutilized for AI
training. We introduce R-Super, which trains AI to segment tumors that match
their descriptions in medical reports. This approach scales AI training with
large collections of readily available medical reports, substantially reducing
the need for manually drawn tumor masks. When trained on 101,654 reports, AI
models achieved performance comparable to those trained on 723 masks. Combining
reports and masks further improved sensitivity by +13% and specificity by +8%,
surpassing radiologists in detecting five of the seven tumor types. Notably,
R-Super enabled segmentation of tumors in the spleen, gallbladder, prostate,
bladder, uterus, and esophagus, for which no public masks or AI models
previously existed. This study challenges the long-held belief that
large-scale, labor-intensive tumor mask creation is indispensable, establishing
a scalable and accessible path toward early detection across diverse tumor
types.

### [76] [Unifying Environment Perception and Route Choice Modeling for Trajectory Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14819)
*Ji Cao,Yu Wang,Tongya Zheng,Zujie Ren,Canghong Jin,Gang Chen,Mingli Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRTraj unifies environment perception and route-choice modeling to learn trajectory representations, improving multi-task performance and data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TRL methods treat trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, neglecting external environmental knowledge and internal route-choice dynamics, which limits representation quality and downstream performance.

Method: Introduce an Environment Perception Module that enriches the road network with multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions, followed by a Route Choice Encoder that models trajectory route segments as a sequence of decisions; the resulting route-choice-aware representations are aggregated into a global trajectory embedding.

Result: Empirical evaluation on 3 real-world datasets across 5 downstream tasks demonstrates improved effectiveness, generalization, and robustness in few-shot settings; code is released for reproducibility.

Conclusion: PRTraj delivers environment-aware trajectory representations with strong transferability and data efficiency across multiple tasks.

Abstract: Trajectory Representation Learning (TRL) aims to encode raw trajectories into
low-dimensional vectors, which can then be leveraged in various downstream
tasks, including travel time estimation, location prediction, and trajectory
similarity analysis. However, existing TRL methods suffer from a key oversight:
treating trajectories as isolated spatio-temporal sequences, without
considering the external environment and internal route choice behavior that
govern their formation. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that
unifies comprehensive environment \textbf{P}erception and explicit
\textbf{R}oute choice modeling for effective \textbf{Traj}ectory representation
learning, dubbed \textbf{PRTraj}. Specifically, PRTraj first introduces an
Environment Perception Module to enhance the road network by capturing
multi-granularity environmental semantics from surrounding POI distributions.
Building on this environment-aware backbone, a Route Choice Encoder then
captures the route choice behavior inherent in each trajectory by modeling its
constituent road segment transitions as a sequence of decisions. These
route-choice-aware representations are finally aggregated to form the global
trajectory embedding. Extensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets across 5
downstream tasks validate the effectiveness and generalizability of PRTraj.
Moreover, PRTraj demonstrates strong data efficiency, maintaining robust
performance under few-shot scenarios. Our code is available at:

### [77] [FraQAT: Quantization Aware Training with Fractional bits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14823)
*Luca Morreale,Alberto Gil C. P. Ramos,Malcolm Chadwick,Mehid Noroozi,Ruchika Chavhan,Abhinav Mehrotra,Sourav Bhattacharya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a fractional bits quantization approach that progressively reduces model precision from 32 to 4 bits while leveraging fractional bits during optimization, improving diffusion-model quality and enabling mobile deployment with modest FiD gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SOTA generative models are too large for on-device use due to memory and compute limits. While quantization helps, aggressive quantization often harms quality. A simple fractional bits strategy aims to preserve performance under heavy quantization.

Method: Progressively quantize parameters from 32 to 4 bits and utilize fractional bits during optimization to maintain generation quality. Evaluate on diffusion models (SD3.5-Medium, Sana, pixart, FLUX.1-schnell) and compare FiD to standard QAT. Demonstrate deployment by running Sana on a Samsung S25U with Qualcomm HTP.

Result: Achieves improved generation quality across tested diffusion models and yields 4–7% lower FiD than standard QAT. Validated by deploying Sana on a Samsung S25U (Qualcomm HTP).

Conclusion: Fractional bits quantization provides a simple yet effective route to aggressive model quantization, preserving quality and enabling mobile deployment of diffusion models.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in image synthesis or text generation, often with a large capacity
model. However, these large models cannot be deployed on smartphones due to the
limited availability of on-board memory and computations. Quantization methods
lower the precision of the model parameters, allowing for efficient
computations, \eg, in \INT{8}. Although aggressive quantization addresses
efficiency and memory constraints, preserving the quality of the model remains
a challenge. To retain quality in previous aggressive quantization, we propose
a new fractional bits quantization (\short) approach. The novelty is a simple
yet effective idea: we progressively reduce the model's precision from 32 to 4
bits per parameter, and exploit the fractional bits during optimization to
maintain high generation quality. We show that the \short{} yields improved
quality on a variety of diffusion models, including SD3.5-Medium, Sana,
\pixart, and FLUX.1-schnell, while achieving $4-7\%$ lower FiD than standard
QAT. Finally, we deploy and run Sana on a Samsung S25U, which runs on the
Qualcomm SM8750-AB Snapdragon 8 Elite Hexagon Tensor Processor (HTP).

*Qi Chen,Xinze Zhou,Chen Liu,Hao Chen,Wenxuan Li,Zekun Jiang,Ziyan Huang,Yuxuan Zhao,Dexin Yu,Junjun He,Yefeng Zheng,Ling Shao,Alan Yuille,Zongwei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synthetic data can reduce real data needs and accelerate performance gains in CT tumor segmentation; AbdomenAtlas 2.0 provides a large, multi-organ, expert-annotated dataset that improves in-distribution and out-of-distribution segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle the scarcity of voxel-wise annotated medical imaging data and the diminishing returns of larger real datasets by leveraging synthetic data and scaling up to a multi-organ atlas.

Method: Demonstrated data efficiency with synthetic data on a 3,000-scan JHH pancreatic dataset, showing performance plateaus that can be overcome with synthetic augmentation. Built AbdomenAtlas 2.0: a large, expert-annotated CT dataset with 10,135 scans, 15,130 tumor instances per-voxel across six organs, and 5,893 controls, annotated by 23 radiologists. Evaluated on in-distribution and out-of-distribution tests.

Result: Synthetic data enabled reaching the same performance with only 500 real scans vs 1,500; AbdomenAtlas 2.0 achieved +7% DSC gain on in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests compared to public datasets.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws and reduce real-data requirements for tumor segmentation; a large, expert-labeled multi-organ dataset like AbdomenAtlas 2.0 substantially improves segmentation performance and generalization across organs.

Abstract: AI for tumor segmentation is limited by the lack of large, voxel-wise
annotated datasets, which are hard to create and require medical experts. In
our proprietary JHH dataset of 3,000 annotated pancreatic tumor scans, we found
that AI performance stopped improving after 1,500 scans. With synthetic data,
we reached the same performance using only 500 real scans. This finding
suggests that synthetic data can steepen data scaling laws, enabling more
efficient model training than real data alone. Motivated by these lessons, we
created AbdomenAtlas 2.0--a dataset of 10,135 CT scans with a total of 15,130
tumor instances per-voxel manually annotated in six organs (pancreas, liver,
kidney, colon, esophagus, and uterus) and 5,893 control scans. Annotated by 23
expert radiologists, it is several orders of magnitude larger than existing
public tumor datasets. While we continue expanding the dataset, the current
version of AbdomenAtlas 2.0 already provides a strong foundation--based on
lessons from the JHH dataset--for training AI to segment tumors in six organs.
It achieves notable improvements over public datasets, with a +7% DSC gain on
in-distribution tests and +16% on out-of-distribution tests.

*Meiqi Wu,Jiashu Zhu,Xiaokun Feng,Chubin Chen,Chen Zhu,Bingze Song,Fangyuan Mao,Jiahong Wu,Xiangxiang Chu,Kaiqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImagerySearch is an adaptive test-time prompt-guided search that tunes both search space and rewards based on semantic relations in prompts, enabling better imaginative video generation; paired with LDT-Bench, a benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video generation excels in realistic scenarios but struggles with imaginative prompts involving rarely co-occurring concepts and long-range semantic relationships outside training distributions. Fixed test-time scaling and static rewards limit adaptability.

Method: Introduce ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search that dynamically adjusts inference search space and reward function according to the semantic relationships in the prompt. Propose LDT-Bench with 2,839 concept pairs and an automated protocol to assess creative generation.

Result: ImagerySearch consistently outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling methods on LDT-Bench, with competitive gains on VBench, demonstrating robustness across prompt types.

Conclusion: This approach improves coherence and visual plausibility in imaginative video generation; LDT-Bench and code will be released to foster future research on imaginative video generation.

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress, particularly
excelling in realistic scenarios; however, their performance degrades notably
in imaginative scenarios. These prompts often involve rarely co-occurring
concepts with long-distance semantic relationships, falling outside training
distributions. Existing methods typically apply test-time scaling for improving
video quality, but their fixed search spaces and static reward designs limit
adaptability to imaginative scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose
ImagerySearch, a prompt-guided adaptive test-time search strategy that
dynamically adjusts both the inference search space and reward function
according to semantic relationships in the prompt. This enables more coherent
and visually plausible videos in challenging imaginative settings. To evaluate
progress in this direction, we introduce LDT-Bench, the first dedicated
benchmark for long-distance semantic prompts, consisting of 2,839 diverse
concept pairs and an automated protocol for assessing creative generation
capabilities. Extensive experiments show that ImagerySearch consistently
outperforms strong video generation baselines and existing test-time scaling
approaches on LDT-Bench, and achieves competitive improvements on VBench,
demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse prompt types. We will release
LDT-Bench and code to facilitate future research on imaginative video
generation.

### [80] [A Multi-Task Deep Learning Framework for Skin Lesion Classification, ABCDE Feature Quantification, and Evolution Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14855)
*Harsha Kotla,Arun Kumar Rajasekaran,Hannah Rana*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning framework that jointly classifies skin lesions and quantifies ABCD features, simulates their evolution (E) over time, and visualizes ABCD trajectories in latent space; evaluated on HAM10000 (~10k images); achieves ~89% classification accuracy and melanoma AUC of 0.96; A, B, C, D predictions are strong, with border irregularity being more challenging; aims to connect ML outputs to clinically meaningful criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early melanoma detection strongly improves survival; current automated skin lesion analysis remains challenging. ABCDE is a clinically interpretable criterion set, but many deep learning models are black-box. The work seeks to produce interpretable ML outputs by quantifying ABCD scores and illustrating their evolution.

Method: A deep learning framework that, in addition to lesion classification, outputs quantitative ABCD scores (A, B, C, D) and models the evolution of the E feature over time. It also visualizes ABCD feature trajectories in latent space as lesions evolve from benign nevus to malignant melanoma. The HAM10000 dataset (~10k images) is used for evaluation.

Result: Classification accuracy around 89%; melanoma AUC ~0.96. The ABCD feature predictions perform well for asymmetry, color variation, and diameter; border irregularity is more difficult to model.

Conclusion: The framework links ML diagnoses to clinically relevant criteria, aiding clinicians in understanding skin cancer progression and laying groundwork for future exploration of lesion evolution and explainable AI in dermatology.

Abstract: Early detection of melanoma has grown to be essential because it
significantly improves survival rates, but automated analysis of skin lesions
still remains challenging. ABCDE, which stands for Asymmetry, Border
irregularity, Color variation, Diameter, and Evolving, is a well-known
classification method for skin lesions, but most deep learning mechanisms treat
it as a black box, as most of the human interpretable features are not
explained. In this work, we propose a deep learning framework that both
classifies skin lesions into categories and also quantifies scores for each
ABCD feature. It simulates the evolution of these features over time in order
to represent the E aspect, opening more windows for future exploration. The A,
B, C, and D values are quantified particularly within this work. Moreover, this
framework also visualizes ABCD feature trajectories in latent space as skin
lesions evolve from benign nevuses to malignant melanoma. The experiments are
conducted using the HAM10000 dataset that contains around ten thousand images
of skin lesions of varying stages. In summary, the classification worked with
an accuracy of around 89 percent, with melanoma AUC being 0.96, while the
feature evaluation performed well in predicting asymmetry, color variation, and
diameter, though border irregularity remains more difficult to model. Overall,
this work provides a deep learning framework that will allow doctors to link ML
diagnoses to clinically relevant criteria, thus improving our understanding of
skin cancer progression.

### [81] [Multi-modal video data-pipelines for machine learning with minimal human supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14862)
*Mihai-Cristian Pîrvu,Marius Leordeanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A compact, multi-modal learning pipeline that autonomously collects and fuses visual modalities with pre-trained experts using PHG-MAE; distilled to under 1M parameters to achieve competitive results with much larger models, enabling real-time on-device semantic segmentation and depth estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data is inherently multi-modal; traditional unimodal or bi-modal models fail to capture cross-modal cues and are data-hungry and compute-intensive. There is a need for scalable, low-supervision approaches that can run on commodity hardware.

Method: An autonomous data-pipeline using pre-trained experts and procedural combinations on raw videos; leverages PHG-MAE tailored for multi-modal data; distills into a small (<1M) model; deploys for real-time semantic segmentation; also showcases off-the-shelf models like DPT for depth estimation; open-sourced.

Result: The distilled PHG-MAE with <1M parameters shows competitive performance relative to models with ~300M parameters; can perform real-time semantic segmentation on handheld devices or webcams; demonstrates depth estimation on commodity hardware.

Conclusion: Validates compact, autonomous multi-modal learning frameworks and their on-device viability; sets the stage for broader multimodal integration with low supervision and modular, out-of-the-box components.

Abstract: The real-world is inherently multi-modal at its core. Our tools observe and
take snapshots of it, in digital form, such as videos or sounds, however much
of it is lost. Similarly for actions and information passing between humans,
languages are used as a written form of communication. Traditionally, Machine
Learning models have been unimodal (i.e. rgb -> semantic or text ->
sentiment_class). Recent trends go towards bi-modality, where images and text
are learned together, however, in order to truly understand the world, we need
to integrate all these independent modalities. In this work we try to combine
as many visual modalities as we can using little to no human supervision. In
order to do this, we use pre-trained experts and procedural combinations
between them on top of raw videos using a fully autonomous data-pipeline, which
we also open-source. We then make use of PHG-MAE, a model specifically designed
to leverage multi-modal data. We show that this model which was efficiently
distilled into a low-parameter (<1M) can have competitive results compared to
models of ~300M parameters. We deploy this model and analyze the use-case of
real-time semantic segmentation from handheld devices or webcams on commodity
hardware. Finally, we deploy other off-the-shelf models using the same
framework, such as DPT for near real-time depth estimation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs for face recognition across multiple datasets; MLLMs show semantic cue usefulness but underperform specialized models in high-precision/zero-shot tasks; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of evaluation of open-source MLLMs on face recognition against traditional models; establish baseline and guide future model design.

Method: Evaluate on LFW, CALFW, CPLFW, CFP, AgeDB, RFW; compare MLLMs with specialized face recognition models under standard protocol; use zero-shot as a focus; report performance and generalization.

Result: MLLMs capture rich semantic cues for face-related tasks but lag behind specialized models for high-precision recognition in zero-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: Benchmark provides foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition; insights to design next-gen models with higher accuracy and generalization; source code available.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance
across diverse vision-and-language tasks. However, their potential in face
recognition remains underexplored. In particular, the performance of
open-source MLLMs needs to be evaluated and compared with existing face
recognition models on standard benchmarks with similar protocol. In this work,
we present a systematic benchmark of state-of-the-art MLLMs for face
recognition on several face recognition datasets, including LFW, CALFW, CPLFW,
CFP, AgeDB and RFW. Experimental results reveal that while MLLMs capture rich
semantic cues useful for face-related tasks, they lag behind specialized models
in high-precision recognition scenarios in zero-shot applications. This
benchmark provides a foundation for advancing MLLM-based face recognition,
offering insights for the design of next-generation models with higher accuracy
and generalization. The source code of our benchmark is publicly available in

*Guangyi Han,Wei Zhai,Yuhang Yang,Yang Cao,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-based Free-Form HOI Generation (TOUCH) enabling controllable, diverse, physically plausible hand-object interactions beyond grasping, powered by the WildO2 in-the-wild 3D HOI dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current HOI generation is dominated by fixed grasping priors and generic language conditioning, limiting diversity and realism of daily hand-object interactions.

Method: Introduce WildO2, a large in-the-wild 3D HOI dataset (4.4k interactions, 92 intents, 610 objects). Propose TOUCH, a three-stage diffusion-based framework with multi-level semantic conditioning, explicit contact modeling, and refinement via contact consistency and physical constraints to produce versatile hand poses beyond grasping.

Result: Comprehensive experiments demonstrate controllable, diverse, and physically plausible HOIs that reflect daily activities.

Conclusion: The work enables fine-grained, controllable HOI generation beyond grasping using diffusion-based generation and rich in-the-wild data, advancing realistic, everyday hand-object interactions.

Abstract: Hand-object interaction (HOI) is fundamental for humans to express intent.
Existing HOI generation research is predominantly confined to fixed grasping
patterns, where control is tied to physical priors such as force closure or
generic intent instructions, even when expressed through elaborate language.
Such an overly general conditioning imposes a strong inductive bias for stable
grasps, thus failing to capture the diversity of daily HOI. To address these
limitations, we introduce Free-Form HOI Generation, which aims to generate
controllable, diverse, and physically plausible HOI conditioned on fine-grained
intent, extending HOI from grasping to free-form interactions, like pushing,
poking, and rotating. To support this task, we construct WildO2, an in-the-wild
diverse 3D HOI dataset, which includes diverse HOI derived from internet
videos. Specifically, it contains 4.4k unique interactions across 92 intents
and 610 object categories, each with detailed semantic annotations. Building on
this dataset, we propose TOUCH, a three-stage framework centered on a
multi-level diffusion model that facilitates fine-grained semantic control to
generate versatile hand poses beyond grasping priors. This process leverages
explicit contact modeling for conditioning and is subsequently refined with
contact consistency and physical constraints to ensure realism. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate our method's ability to generate controllable, diverse,
and physically plausible hand interactions representative of daily activities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BADAS is a family of ego-centric collision-prediction models trained on Nexar dashcam data to distinguish ego-involved threats from random accidents, addressing false alerts with ego-centric benchmarks and producing state-of-the-art AP/AUC across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce false alerts in ego-centric collision prediction by clearly separating ego-involved incidents from non-ego incidents; establish ego-centric benchmarks and evaluation protocols to enable fair AP/AUC and temporal evaluation.

Method: End-to-end training of BADAS using a V-JEPA2 backbone. Re-annotate existing benchmarks for ego involvement, add consensus alert-time labels, synthesize negatives, and develop two variants: BADAS-Open (1.5k public videos) and BADAS1.0 (40k proprietary videos).

Result: State-of-the-art AP/AUC on DAD, DADA-2000, DoTA, Nexar; outperforms a forward-collision ADAS baseline; provides more realistic time-to-accident estimates; release of BADAS-Open weights/code and re-annotated datasets.

Conclusion: BADAS advances ego-centric collision prediction, enabling fair evaluation and reproducibility, and fosters research by releasing data, models, and annotations.

Abstract: Existing collision prediction methods often fail to distinguish between
ego-vehicle threats and random accidents not involving the ego vehicle, leading
to excessive false alerts in real-world deployment. We present BADAS, a family
of collision prediction models trained on Nexar's real-world dashcam collision
dataset -- the first benchmark designed explicitly for ego-centric evaluation.
We re-annotate major benchmarks to identify ego involvement, add consensus
alert-time labels, and synthesize negatives where needed, enabling fair AP/AUC
and temporal evaluation. BADAS uses a V-JEPA2 backbone trained end-to-end and
comes in two variants: BADAS-Open (trained on our 1.5k public videos) and
BADAS1.0 (trained on 40k proprietary videos). Across DAD, DADA-2000, DoTA, and
Nexar, BADAS achieves state-of-the-art AP/AUC and outperforms a
forward-collision ADAS baseline while producing more realistic time-to-accident
estimates. We release our BADAS-Open model weights and code, along with
re-annotations of all evaluation datasets to promote ego-centric collision
prediction research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScaleWeaver enables high-fidelity, controllable text-to-image generation on visual autoregressive (VAR) models using a parameter-efficient Reference Attention mechanism, achieving better efficiency than diffusion-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill the gap of controllable generation within VAR-based text-to-image models, where control mechanisms have been explored in diffusion models but are underdeveloped for VARs.

Method: Introduce ScaleWeaver with an improved MMDiT block and a Reference Attention module that omits image→condition attention to reduce computation, emphasizes parameter reuse, and uses a zero-initialized linear projection to safely inject control signals. The approach relies on few trainable parameters to process control information while preserving the base VAR backbone and uses parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments show ScaleWeaver delivers high-quality generation with precise control and improved efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods, validating its practicality for controllable T2I under the VAR paradigm.

Conclusion: ScaleWeaver provides an effective, efficient solution for controllable text-to-image generation in visual autoregressive models, enabling practical deployment and future research in VAR-based controllable generation.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation with visual autoregressive~(VAR) models has recently
achieved impressive advances in generation fidelity and inference efficiency.
While control mechanisms have been explored for diffusion models, enabling
precise and flexible control within VAR paradigm remains underexplored. To
bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we introduce ScaleWeaver, a novel
framework designed to achieve high-fidelity, controllable generation upon
advanced VAR models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The core module in
ScaleWeaver is the improved MMDiT block with the proposed Reference Attention
module, which efficiently and effectively incorporates conditional information.
Different from MM Attention, the proposed Reference Attention module discards
the unnecessary attention from image$\rightarrow$condition, reducing
computational cost while stabilizing control injection. Besides, it
strategically emphasizes parameter reuse, leveraging the capability of the VAR
backbone itself with a few introduced parameters to process control
information, and equipping a zero-initialized linear projection to ensure that
control signals are incorporated effectively without disrupting the generative
capability of the base model. Extensive experiments show that ScaleWeaver
delivers high-quality generation and precise control while attaining superior
efficiency over diffusion-based methods, making ScaleWeaver a practical and
effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual
autoregressive paradigm. Code and models will be released.

TL;DR: Two-stage nlg2choice method enables open-ended LLMs to handle large multi-way MCQs in FGVC by constrained decoding and early stopping, improving classification and retrieval across seven datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address evaluation of free-form responses from autoregressive LLMs in high-branching, highly related multi-way MCQs for FGVC, and extend to retrieval settings where computing probabilities over many choices is costly.

Method: Stage 1: query LLM with minimal constraints to get an open-ended answer; Stage 2: perform text-only constrained decoding to select the most likely choice. In retrieval, compute probability of constrained response for that choice with early stopping to improve throughput.

Result: Showed improvement on seven FGVC datasets for both classification and retrieval tasks, robust across different natural language task formulations.

Conclusion: nlg2choice effectively bridges free-form LLM outputs with precise, scalable choice selection under large MCQ regimes, offering throughput gains and broad applicability.

Abstract: Despite the renewed interest in zero-shot visual classification due to the
rise of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the problem of evaluating
free-form responses of auto-regressive models remains a persistent challenge.
Most existing works focus on language-only tasks or don't consider Multiple
Choice Questions (MCQs) beyond 5-way options, both of which are critical
capabilities to solve tasks in Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) where
choice counts are in the hundreds to thousands and the choices are highly
related. Furthermore, in this highly multi-way MCQ setting it is not clear how
to extend LLM choice extraction to retrieval-based problems, where computing
probabilities over the choice set is computationally costly. In this work we
investigate nlg2choice, a simple two-stage method which first asks the MLLM an
open-ended question for the task with minimal constraints, then uses text-only
constrained decoding to predict the most likely choice. In retrieval settings,
we compute the probability of the constrained response taking that choice with
an early stopping method to significantly improve throughput. Our results show
improvement over a suite of seven fine-grained visual datasets when evaluating
in terms of classification and retrieval, and show that this performance holds
over the various ways that users of LLMs can implement tasks in natural
language.

*Furkan Mumcu,Michael J. Jones,Anoop Cherian,Yasin Yilmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semi-supervised VAD approach using Multimodal LLMs to extract and compare textual descriptions of object activity/interactions over time, enabling explainable anomaly detection and improving performance, especially for interaction-based anomalies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of current semi-supervised VAD methods which struggle with complex object interactions and lack interpretability. Leverage Multimodal LLMs to generate high-level, textual representations of object activity that can explain and guide anomaly detection.

Method: Query an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs at multiple moments to produce textual descriptions of activity and interactions. Build textual representations from nominal training videos. At test time, detect anomalies by comparing test descriptions to nominal descriptions. Provide explainability and compatibility with traditional VAD methods.

Result: The approach achieves strong performance on benchmarks, particularly for datasets without interaction anomalies, and effectively detects complex interaction-based anomalies, achieving state-of-the-art results in some settings.

Conclusion: The framework offers inherent explainability, can enhance existing VAD methods, and demonstrates strong performance on interaction-aware anomaly detection tasks, suggesting its generalizability to broader VAD scenarios.

Abstract: Existing semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) methods often struggle
with detecting complex anomalies involving object interactions and generally
lack explainability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel VAD
framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Unlike previous
MLLM-based approaches that make direct anomaly judgments at the frame level,
our method focuses on extracting and interpreting object activity and
interactions over time. By querying an MLLM with visual inputs of object pairs
at different moments, we generate textual descriptions of the activity and
interactions from nominal videos. These textual descriptions serve as a
high-level representation of the activity and interactions of objects in a
video. They are used to detect anomalies during test time by comparing them to
textual descriptions found in nominal training videos. Our approach inherently
provides explainability and can be combined with many traditional VAD methods
to further enhance their interpretability. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method not only detects complex interaction-based
anomalies effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on
datasets without interaction anomalies.

*Gabriel Fiastre,Antoine Yang,Cordelia Schmid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: End-to-end DVOC model MaskCaptioner trained with synthetic captions on extended LVIS/LV-VIS datasets (LVISCap, LV-VISCap) achieves state-of-the-art results on VidSTG, VLN, and BenSMOT benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DVOC requires joint detection, tracking, and captioning of object trajectories, but manual annotation is costly and disjoint training can limit performance. Synthetic captions generated via a state-of-the-art vision-language model can align tasks and enable end-to-end training, reducing annotation burden and improving results.

Method: Extend LVIS and LV-VIS with synthetic captions to form LVISCap and LV-VISCap. Train MaskCaptioner, an end-to-end model that jointly detects, segments, tracks, and captions object trajectories, leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM for captioning. Pretrain on LVISCap/LV-VISCap to achieve strong DVOC performance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three benchmarks: VidSTG, VLN, and BenSMOT. Datasets and code are released for reproducibility.

Conclusion: Synthetic caption augmentation and end-to-end training via MaskCaptioner demonstrate strong DVOC performance and provide resources to the community, suggesting a viable path to reduce annotation cost while improving joint detection–captioning capabilities.

Abstract: Dense Video Object Captioning (DVOC) is the task of jointly detecting,
tracking, and captioning object trajectories in a video, requiring the ability
to understand spatio-temporal details and describe them in natural language.
Due to the complexity of the task and the high cost associated with manual
annotation, previous approaches resort to disjoint training strategies,
potentially leading to suboptimal performance. To circumvent this issue, we
propose to generate captions about spatio-temporally localized entities
leveraging a state-of-the-art VLM. By extending the LVIS and LV-VIS datasets
with our synthetic captions (LVISCap and LV-VISCap), we train MaskCaptioner, an
end-to-end model capable of jointly detecting, segmenting, tracking and
captioning object trajectories. Moreover, with pretraining on LVISCap and
LV-VISCap, MaskCaptioner achieves state-of-the-art DVOC results on three
existing benchmarks, VidSTG, VLN and BenSMOT. The datasets and code are

*JoungBin Lee,Jaewoo Jung,Jisang Han,Takuya Narihira,Kazumi Fukuda,Junyoung Seo,Sunghwan Hong,Yuki Mitsufuji,Seungryong Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DScenePrompt generates the next video chunk using dual spatio-temporal conditioning and a 3D static-scene memory, enabling long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control while efficiently handling dynamic elements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of conditioning on a single image/short clip and to maintain scene consistency across long sequences with controllable camera, by separating static geometry from dynamic content and leveraging dynamic SLAM.

Method: Use temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent content for scene consistency; construct a 3D memory of static geometry from entire input via dynamic SLAM with a dynamic masking strategy; project static geometry as 3D prompts to target viewpoints; allow dynamic areas to evolve from temporal context.

Result: Empirical results show substantial improvements in scene consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: The approach enables long-range coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing efficiency by decoupling static geometry from dynamics and using memory-driven 3D prompts.

Abstract: We present 3DScenePrompt, a framework that generates the next video chunk
from arbitrary-length input while enabling precise camera control and
preserving scene consistency. Unlike methods conditioned on a single image or a
short clip, we employ dual spatio-temporal conditioning that reformulates
context-view referencing across the input video. Our approach conditions on
both temporally adjacent frames for motion continuity and spatially adjacent
content for scene consistency. However, when generating beyond temporal
boundaries, directly using spatially adjacent frames would incorrectly preserve
dynamic elements from the past. We address this by introducing a 3D scene
memory that represents exclusively the static geometry extracted from the
entire input video. To construct this memory, we leverage dynamic SLAM with our
newly introduced dynamic masking strategy that explicitly separates static
scene geometry from moving elements. The static scene representation can then
be projected to any target viewpoint, providing geometrically consistent warped
views that serve as strong 3D spatial prompts while allowing dynamic regions to
evolve naturally from temporal context. This enables our model to maintain
long-range spatial coherence and precise camera control without sacrificing
computational efficiency or motion realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework significantly outperforms existing methods in scene
consistency, camera controllability, and generation quality. Project page :

*Zhe Li,Weihao Yuan,Weichao Shen,Siyu Zhu,Zilong Dong,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer for whole-body multimodal generation, integrating text, speech, and music via gated linear attention, RMSNorm, and diffusion-style condition propagation (DiT), with AdaLN and cross-attention for fusion; claims state-of-the-art across text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses two key challenges in whole-body motion generation: (1) designing an effective, continuous generation mechanism that respects the temporal causality of motion, and (2) seamlessly integrating multiple modalities (text, speech, music) into a cohesive framework, avoiding limitations of discrete masked or autoregressive methods.

Method: Proposes a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer with causal attention over motion sequences. Introduces gated linear attention and RMSNorm to stabilize training and focus on key actions. Uses a DiT-style diffusion of conditions from the transformer to targets. Fuses modalities via AdaLN and cross-attention to inject text, speech, and music signals.

Result: Experimental results indicate the proposed framework outperforms prior methods across modalities, including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance; the authors plan to release code publicly.

Conclusion: A unified, robust approach for whole-body multimodal motion generation that improves generation quality and multimodal generalization, with practical interest due to public code release.

Abstract: Whole-body multi-modal human motion generation poses two primary challenges:
creating an effective motion generation mechanism and integrating various
modalities, such as text, speech, and music, into a cohesive framework. Unlike
previous methods that usually employ discrete masked modeling or autoregressive
modeling, we develop a continuous masked autoregressive motion transformer,
where a causal attention is performed considering the sequential nature within
the human motion. Within this transformer, we introduce a gated linear
attention and an RMSNorm module, which drive the transformer to pay attention
to the key actions and suppress the instability caused by either the abnormal
movements or the heterogeneous distributions within multi-modalities. To
further enhance both the motion generation and the multimodal generalization,
we employ the DiT structure to diffuse the conditions from the transformer
towards the targets. To fuse different modalities, AdaLN and cross-attention
are leveraged to inject the text, speech, and music signals. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous methods across all
modalities, including text-to-motion, speech-to-gesture, and music-to-dance.
The code of our method will be made public.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RealDPO introduces Direct Preference Optimization using real-world videos as positive samples to align video motion synthesis with reality, enabling iterative self-correction and improved motion realism. It is supported by the RealAction-5K dataset and shows gains over SFT and existing preference methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in generating natural, smooth, and contextually consistent motions in video synthesis, by leveraging real-world data as positives to better guide the model beyond traditional supervised fine-tuning.

Method: Apply Direct Preference Optimization with a tailored loss that contrasts real-world videos (positives) against erroneous model outputs (negatives), enabling iterative self-correction. Introduce RealAction-5K as a curated dataset of high-quality human motion videos to support post-training for complex motion synthesis.

Result: Significant improvements in video quality, text alignment, and motion realism compared with state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization techniques.

Conclusion: RealDPO provides a practical and effective framework for aligning video motion synthesis with real-world dynamics, with RealAction-5K enabling enhanced post-training for complex motions.

Abstract: Video generative models have recently achieved notable advancements in
synthesis quality. However, generating complex motions remains a critical
challenge, as existing models often struggle to produce natural, smooth, and
contextually consistent movements. This gap between generated and real-world
motions limits their practical applicability. To address this issue, we
introduce RealDPO, a novel alignment paradigm that leverages real-world data as
positive samples for preference learning, enabling more accurate motion
synthesis. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which offers
limited corrective feedback, RealDPO employs Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) with a tailored loss function to enhance motion realism. By contrasting
real-world videos with erroneous model outputs, RealDPO enables iterative
self-correction, progressively refining motion quality. To support
post-training in complex motion synthesis, we propose RealAction-5K, a curated
dataset of high-quality videos capturing human daily activities with rich and
precise motion details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RealDPO
significantly improves video quality, text alignment, and motion realism
compared to state-of-the-art models and existing preference optimization
techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MathCanvas introduces a two-stage framework enabling intrinsic visual reasoning for math in unified LMMs. It leverages a large pretraining corpus for diagram generation/editing and a targeted instruction-tuning phase, yielding BAGEL-Canvas with strong gains on a new MathCanvas-Bench and good generalization to other math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel at textual reasoning but struggle with geometry/math that rely on visual aids; existing Visual Chain-of-Thought approaches depend on external tools and often fail to produce high-fidelity, well-timed diagrams. There is a need for unified large multimodal models with intrinsic visual reasoning capabilities for mathematics.

Method: Phase 1 (Visual Manipulation): pre-train on a 15.2M-pair corpus (MathCanvas-Imagen: 10M caption-to-diagram; MathCanvas-Edit: 5.2M step-by-step editing trajectories) to master diagram generation/editing. Phase 2 (Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning): fine-tune on MathCanvas-Instruct (219K examples) of interleaved visual-text reasoning paths to teach when/how to leverage visual aids. Evaluation on MathCanvas-Bench (3K problems requiring interleaved visual-textual solutions).

Result: BAGEL-Canvas achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on MathCanvas-Bench and demonstrates excellent generalization to other public math benchmarks.

Conclusion: Provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and benchmark to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs; project page available.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have excelled in textual reasoning, they
struggle with mathematical domains like geometry that intrinsically rely on
visual aids. Existing approaches to Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) are often
limited by rigid external tools or fail to generate the high-fidelity,
strategically-timed diagrams necessary for complex problem-solving. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MathCanvas, a comprehensive framework designed to endow
unified Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with intrinsic VCoT capabilities for
mathematics. Our approach consists of two phases. First, a Visual Manipulation
stage pre-trains the model on a novel 15.2M-pair corpus, comprising 10M
caption-to-diagram pairs (MathCanvas-Imagen) and 5.2M step-by-step editing
trajectories (MathCanvas-Edit), to master diagram generation and editing.
Second, a Strategic Visual-Aided Reasoning stage fine-tunes the model on
MathCanvas-Instruct, a new 219K-example dataset of interleaved visual-textual
reasoning paths, teaching it when and how to leverage visual aids. To
facilitate rigorous evaluation, we introduce MathCanvas-Bench, a challenging
benchmark with 3K problems that require models to produce interleaved
visual-textual solutions. Our model, BAGEL-Canvas, trained under this
framework, achieves an 86% relative improvement over strong LMM baselines on
MathCanvas-Bench, demonstrating excellent generalization to other public math
benchmarks. Our work provides a complete toolkit-framework, datasets, and
benchmark-to unlock complex, human-like visual-aided reasoning in LMMs. Project

### [93] [C4D: 4D Made from 3D through Dual Correspondences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14960)
*Shizun Wang,Zhenxiang Jiang,Xingyi Yang,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C4D introduces temporal correspondences (short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking) to extend monocular 4D reconstruction to dynamic scenes. It uses a dynamic-aware point tracker to generate motion masks and dynamic scene optimization, yielding per-frame geometry and camera parameters and smooth 3D trajectories, achieving complete 4D recovery and improvements in depth, pose, and tracking tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic scenes violate multi-view geometry, causing static-reconstruction methods to fail. There is a need to jointly recover 4D geometry and camera motion from monocular video by accounting for moving objects through temporal information.

Method: C4D augments pointmap-based reconstruction with two temporal correspondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. It trains a dynamic-aware point tracker to infer mobility and motion masks, separates dynamic from static components, and introduces dynamic-scene optimization objectives to recover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. The 2D trajectories are lifted to smooth 3D trajectories for integrated 4D reconstruction.

Result: Experiments demonstrate complete 4D recovery and strong performance on downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation, and point tracking.

Conclusion: Incorporating temporal correspondences and dynamic-aware optimization enables fully integrated 4D reconstruction from monocular video, effectively handling moving objects and improving multiple downstream tasks.

Abstract: Recovering 4D from monocular video, which jointly estimates dynamic geometry
and camera poses, is an inevitably challenging problem. While recent
pointmap-based 3D reconstruction methods (e.g., DUSt3R) have made great
progress in reconstructing static scenes, directly applying them to dynamic
scenes leads to inaccurate results. This discrepancy arises because moving
objects violate multi-view geometric constraints, disrupting the
reconstruction. To address this, we introduce C4D, a framework that leverages
temporal Correspondences to extend existing 3D reconstruction formulation to
4D. Specifically, apart from predicting pointmaps, C4D captures two types of
correspondences: short-term optical flow and long-term point tracking. We train
a dynamic-aware point tracker that provides additional mobility information,
facilitating the estimation of motion masks to separate moving elements from
the static background, thus offering more reliable guidance for dynamic scenes.
Furthermore, we introduce a set of dynamic scene optimization objectives to
recover per-frame 3D geometry and camera parameters. Simultaneously, the
correspondences lift 2D trajectories into smooth 3D trajectories, enabling
fully integrated 4D reconstruction. Experiments show that our framework
achieves complete 4D recovery and demonstrates strong performance across
multiple downstream tasks, including depth estimation, camera pose estimation,
and point tracking. Project Page: https://littlepure2333.github.io/C4D

### [94] [RainDiff: End-to-end Precipitation Nowcasting Via Token-wise Attention Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14962)
*Thao Nguyen,Jiaqi Ma,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Souhaib Ben Taieb,Salman Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based precipitation nowcasting model that uses token-wise attention integrated into both the U-Net backbone and a spatio-temporal encoder, achieving efficient, scalable long-range modeling without separate latent modules and outperforming state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precipitation nowcasting requires capturing chaotic, tightly coupled spatio-temporal atmospheric dynamics. Latent-space diffusion relies on autoencoders, which can harm generalization and add complexity; pixel-space diffusion is computationally intensive and often lacks attention for long-range dependencies. There is a need for an architecture with built-in attention that models multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution efficiently.

Method: Introduce token-wise attention integrated into both the U-Net diffusion model and the spatio-temporal encoder. This design dynamically captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution, enabling attention to be natively embedded without the extra cost of latent modules or heavy pixel-space diffusion.

Result: Extensive experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex precipitation forecasting scenarios.

Conclusion: Token-wise attention integrated diffusion-based nowcasting provides a scalable, efficient architecture that eliminates the need for separate latent modules and enhances performance across datasets for precipitation forecasting.

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, predicting future radar echo sequences from current
observations, is a critical yet challenging task due to the inherently chaotic
and tightly coupled spatio-temporal dynamics of the atmosphere. While recent
advances in diffusion-based models attempt to capture both large-scale motion
and fine-grained stochastic variability, they often suffer from scalability
issues: latent-space approaches require a separately trained autoencoder,
adding complexity and limiting generalization, while pixel-space approaches are
computationally intensive and often omit attention mechanisms, reducing their
ability to model long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. To address these
limitations, we propose a Token-wise Attention integrated into not only the
U-Net diffusion model but also the spatio-temporal encoder that dynamically
captures multi-scale spatial interactions and temporal evolution. Unlike prior
approaches, our method natively integrates attention into the architecture
without incurring the high resource cost typical of pixel-space diffusion,
thereby eliminating the need for separate latent modules. Our extensive
experiments and visual evaluations across diverse datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, yielding
superior local fidelity, generalization, and robustness in complex
precipitation forecasting scenarios.

*Miao Hu,Zhiwei Huang,Tai Wang,Jiangmiao Pang,Dahua Lin,Nanning Zheng,Runsen Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This work introduces ChangingGrounding, a benchmark for memory-driven 3D visual grounding in dynamic environments and Mem-ChangingGrounder, a zero-shot method that uses cross-modal retrieval and multi-view fusion to locate objects with minimal re-scans, achieving high accuracy and lower exploration cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world robotics face changing scenes and rely on up-to-date point clouds; re-scanning is costly and impractical. There is a need for active, memory-aware 3D visual grounding to efficiently use past observations.

Method: Mem-ChangingGrounder identifies the target object type from the natural-language query, retrieves relevant memories to guide actions, selectively explores the scene, falls back when memories are invalid, performs multi-view scanning, and fuses evidence to project accurate 3D bounding boxes. The paper also introduces ChangingGrounding, a benchmark that measures how well agents leverage past observations, explore only when needed, and maintain precise localization in changing scenes.

Result: Mem-ChangingGrounder achieves the highest localization accuracy while greatly reducing exploration cost on the ChangingGrounding benchmark, outperforming baselines.

Conclusion: The benchmark and the proposed method push toward memory-centric 3D visual grounding for real-world robotics, enabling more practical, efficient, and robust 3D object localization in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Real-world robots localize objects from natural-language instructions while
scenes around them keep changing. Yet most of the existing 3D visual grounding
(3DVG) method still assumes a reconstructed and up-to-date point cloud, an
assumption that forces costly re-scans and hinders deployment. We argue that
3DVG should be formulated as an active, memory-driven problem, and we introduce
ChangingGrounding, the first benchmark that explicitly measures how well an
agent can exploit past observations, explore only where needed, and still
deliver precise 3D boxes in changing scenes. To set a strong reference point,
we also propose Mem-ChangingGrounder, a zero-shot method for this task that
marries cross-modal retrieval with lightweight multi-view fusion: it identifies
the object type implied by the query, retrieves relevant memories to guide
actions, then explores the target efficiently in the scene, falls back when
previous operations are invalid, performs multi-view scanning of the target,
and projects the fused evidence from multi-view scans to get accurate object
bounding boxes. We evaluate different baselines on ChangingGrounding, and our
Mem-ChangingGrounder achieves the highest localization accuracy while greatly
reducing exploration cost. We hope this benchmark and method catalyze a shift
toward practical, memory-centric 3DVG research for real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based method, WithAnyone, uses a large paired MultiID-2M dataset and a contrastive identity loss to reduce copy-paste while preserving identity and enabling controllable pose/expression in generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scarcity of large-scale paired datasets with multiple images per identity leads to copy-paste artifacts and limited controllability in identity-consistent text-to-image generation; there is a need to balance identity fidelity with natural variation.

Method: Construct MultiID-2M dataset for multi-person identity references, develop a benchmark to quantify copy-paste and the fidelity-diversity trade-off, and train a diffusion model WithAnyone using a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data to enforce identity fidelity while allowing variation in pose, expression, and lighting.

Result: Extensive experiments show reduced copy-paste artifacts, improved controllability over pose and expression, and maintained perceptual quality; quantitative metrics and user studies indicate high identity fidelity with expressive controllability.

Conclusion: The approach mitigates copy-paste while preserving identity and enabling expressive, controllable generation; the new dataset and benchmark offer valuable resources for future research in identity-consistent text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Identity-consistent generation has become an important focus in text-to-image
research, with recent models achieving notable success in producing images
aligned with a reference identity. Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired
datasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most
approaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to
a failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the
reference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in
pose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability
and limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we
(1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for
multi-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2)
introduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the
trade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel
training paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data
to balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in
WithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while
preserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste
artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains
strong perceptual quality. User studies further validate that our method
achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable
generation.

*Yuanhui Huang,Weiliang Chen,Wenzhao Zheng,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan,Jie Zhou,Jiwen Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Terra presents a native 3D world model that encodes 3D scenes into a latent point space via a point-to-Gaussian VAE and refines it with sparse point flow, enabling exact multi-view consistency, single-pass flexible rendering, and explorable 3D generation, achieving state-of-the-art results on ScanNet v2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-aligned 3D world models often struggle to enforce true 3D consistency and can be inefficient. A native 3D latent representation aims to better capture geometry and appearance in 3D, improving consistency and renderability across viewpoints.

Method: Introduce P2G-VAE: encodes 3D inputs into a latent point representation, decoded as 3D Gaussian primitives to model geometry and appearance. Use SPFlow to generate and denoise the latent points. Enable progressive generation in the point latent space for explorable world modeling, providing exact multi-view rendering from a single generation.

Result: Extensive experiments on indoor scenes from ScanNet v2 show Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction and generation with high 3D consistency.

Conclusion: Terra demonstrates the viability of native 3D latent-space world modeling, delivering accurate, view-consistent rendering and explorable environments, with strong performance on challenging benchmarks; suggests promising direction for 3D scene modeling and generation.

Abstract: World models have garnered increasing attention for comprehensive modeling of
the real world. However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned
representations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D
nature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and
diminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present
Terra, a native 3D world model that represents and generates explorable
environments in an intrinsic 3D latent space. Specifically, we propose a novel
point-to-Gaussian variational autoencoder (P2G-VAE) that encodes 3D inputs into
a latent point representation, which is subsequently decoded as 3D Gaussian
primitives to jointly model geometry and appearance. We then introduce a sparse
point flow matching network (SPFlow) for generating the latent point
representation, which simultaneously denoises the positions and features of the
point latents. Our Terra enables exact multi-view consistency with native 3D
representation and architecture, and supports flexible rendering from any
viewpoint with only a single generation process. Furthermore, Terra achieves
explorable world modeling through progressive generation in the point latent
space. We conduct extensive experiments on the challenging indoor scenes from
ScanNet v2. Terra achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction
and generation with high 3D consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training paradigm for image editing diffusion models that eliminates paired data by unrolling the diffusion process and using vision-language feedback to guide optimization, plus a distribution-matching loss, achieving competitive results with supervised methods and outperforming RL-based approaches in few-step settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Paired input-target editing data are scarce and expensive to curate; existing synthetic-to-real strategies propagate artifacts from pretrained models. An unsupervised approach using VLM feedback could align edits to instructions without requiring pairs.

Method: Unroll a few-step diffusion model during training and use feedback from vision-language models (VLMs) to assess if the edit follows the instruction and preserves content, providing direct gradients for end-to-end optimization. Include distribution matching loss to keep generated images in the pretrained image manifold.

Result: Without any paired data, the method matches the performance of diffusion models trained with extensive supervised pairs in a few-step setting, and with the same VLM reward, it outperforms RL-based methods such as Flow-GRPO.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a viable unsupervised training paradigm for image-editing diffusion models, achieving competitive results without paired data, and highlights the effectiveness of VLM-guided feedback and distribution matching in maintaining fidelity.

Abstract: Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following
natural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning
with large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as
such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds
use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of
existing models. However, this can propagate and magnify the artifacts of the
pretrained model into the final trained model. In this work, we present a new
training paradigm that eliminates the need for paired data entirely. Our
approach directly optimizes a few-step diffusion model by unrolling it during
training and leveraging feedback from vision-language models (VLMs). For each
input and editing instruction, the VLM evaluates if an edit follows the
instruction and preserves unchanged content, providing direct gradients for
end-to-end optimization. To ensure visual fidelity, we incorporate distribution
matching loss (DMD), which constrains generated images to remain within the
image manifold learned by pretrained models. We evaluate our method on standard
benchmarks and include an extensive ablation study. Without any paired data,
our method performs on par with various image editing diffusion models trained
on extensive supervised paired data, under the few-step setting. Given the same
VLM as the reward model, we also outperform RL-based techniques like Flow-GRPO.

Motivation: There is a tension between native VLMs and modular VLMs showing fundamental constraints; there is a need to clarify these barriers and democratize native-VLM research.

Method: Define a native VLM primitive that aligns pixel and word representations in a shared semantic space, seamlessly integrate vision and language within a single architecture, and embed cross-modal properties for unified encoding, alignment, and reasoning.

apart from modular ones, and to what extent can these barriers be overcome? (-)
How to make research in native VLMs more accessible and democratized, thereby
accelerating progress in the field. In this paper, we clarify these challenges
and outline guiding principles for constructing native VLMs. Specifically, one
native VLM primitive should: (i) effectively align pixel and word
representations within a shared semantic space; (ii) seamlessly integrate the
strengths of formerly separate vision and language modules; (iii) inherently
embody various cross-modal properties that support unified vision-language
encoding, aligning, and reasoning. Hence, we launch NEO, a novel family of
native VLMs built from first principles, capable of rivaling top-tier modular
counterparts across diverse real-world scenarios. With only 390M image-text
examples, NEO efficiently develops visual perception from scratch while
mitigating vision-language conflicts inside a dense and monolithic model
crafted from our elaborate primitives. We position NEO as a cornerstone for
scalable and powerful native VLMs, paired with a rich set of reusable
components that foster a cost-effective and extensible ecosystem. Our code and
models are publicly available at: https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/NEO.

### [100] [Coupled Diffusion Sampling for Training-Free Multi-View Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14981)
*Hadi Alzayer,Yunzhi Zhang,Chen Geng,Jia-Bin Huang,Jiajun Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based method for achieving multi-view consistency in image edits by coupling diffusion trajectories across 2D edited and multi-view distributions, avoiding explicit 3D optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D editing models produce high-quality edits per image but lack cross-view consistency; traditional 3D optimization is slow and unstable with sparse views.

Method: Introduce coupled diffusion sampling that jointly samples from a multi-view image distribution and a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce consistency, providing implicit 3D regularization.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness and generality across three multi-view editing tasks and various model architectures, showing broad applicability.

Conclusion: Presents a practical, general framework for multi-view consistent editing using pre-trained 2D models without heavy 3D optimization; robust across tasks and views.

Abstract: We present an inference-time diffusion sampling method to perform multi-view
consistent image editing using pre-trained 2D image editing models. These
models can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of
multi-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency
across views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over
explicit 3D representations, but they suffer from a lengthy optimization
process and instability under sparse view settings. We propose an implicit 3D
regularization approach by constraining the generated 2D image sequences to
adhere to a pre-trained multi-view image distribution. This is achieved through
coupled diffusion sampling, a simple diffusion sampling technique that
concurrently samples two trajectories from both a multi-view image distribution
and a 2D edited image distribution, using a coupling term to enforce the
multi-view consistency among the generated images. We validate the
effectiveness and generality of this framework on three distinct multi-view
image editing tasks, demonstrating its applicability across various model
architectures and highlighting its potential as a general solution for
multi-view consistent editing.

### [101] [A Diffusion-Refined Planner with Reinforcement Learning Priors for Confined-Space Parking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14000)
*Mingyang Jiang,Yueyuan Li,Jiaru Zhang,Songan Zhang,Ming Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A diffusion-refined planner (DRIP) leverages an RL-pretrained prior action distribution to guide diffusion-based planning for automated parking in confined spaces, improving success rates and reducing inference steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In restricted parking environments, high-precision maneuvers are essential, but explicit action modeling is difficult and may fail under spatial constraints. A planner that integrates RL priors into a diffusion framework can achieve more reliable action distributions.

Method: Train a diffusion model conditioned on an RL-provided prior action distribution, regularizing the diffusion process with RL priors. During inference, denoise from the priors to refine actions. The training steers the denoising trajectory with the RL prior, yielding a better initialization and improved accuracy, with fewer inference steps.

Result: Evaluations across parking scenarios with varying spatial constraints show significant improvements in planning performance in confined spaces while maintaining generalization to common scenarios.

Conclusion: DRIP demonstrates that incorporating RL priors into diffusion-based planning yields more accurate action modeling, higher success rates, and improved efficiency in inference for confined-space parking, with good generalization.

Abstract: The growing demand for parking has increased the need for automated parking
planning methods that can operate reliably in confined spaces. In restricted
and complex environments, high-precision maneuvers are required to achieve a
high success rate in planning, yet existing approaches often rely on explicit
action modeling, which faces challenges when accurately modeling the optimal
action distribution. In this paper, we propose DRIP, a diffusion-refined
planner anchored in reinforcement learning (RL) prior action distribution, in
which an RL-pretrained policy provides prior action distributions to regularize
the diffusion training process. During the inference phase the denoising
process refines these coarse priors into more precise action distributions. By
steering the denoising trajectory through the reinforcement learning prior
distribution during training, the diffusion model inherits a well-informed
initialization, resulting in more accurate action modeling, a higher planning
success rate, and reduced inference steps. We evaluate our approach across
parking scenarios with varying degrees of spatial constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method significantly improves planning performance
in confined-space parking environments while maintaining strong generalization
in common scenarios.

### [102] [Spatially Intelligent Patrol Routes for Concealed Emitter Localization by Robot Swarms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14018)
*Adam Morris,Timothy Pelham,Edmund R. Hunt*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A swarm-based method uses differential evolution to design patrol routes that localize concealed radio emitters, showing directional antennas outperform omnidirectional in detection rate and localization accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unknown electromagnetic emitters pose surveillance challenges; robust localization must be independent of emitter parameters and leverage spatial intelligence through patrol design and sensing configuration.

Method: Simulated four-robot swarm across eight configurations; pre-generated patrol routes selected by patrol shape and antenna type (omnidirectional or directional); emitters with randomized position, power, and frequency; differential evolution used to generate routes; evaluate localization success and error.

Result: Omnidirectional localization success is mainly influenced by source location, with more failures when emitters are in map peripheries. Directional antennas achieve higher success due to gain/directivity (avg 98.75% vs 80.25%). Localization errors: directional 1.01–1.30 m; omnidirectional 1.67–1.90 m. Shorter patrol edges benefit directional sensing.

Conclusion: Spatial intelligence—optimized patrol routing and antenna choice—critically enhances predictive localization of electromagnetic phenomena; practical robotic surveillance should integrate route design with sensing configuration to maximize coverage and accuracy.

Abstract: This paper introduces a method for designing spatially intelligent robot
swarm behaviors to localize concealed radio emitters. We use differential
evolution to generate geometric patrol routes that localize unknown signals
independently of emitter parameters, a key challenge in electromagnetic
surveillance. Patrol shape and antenna type are shown to influence information
gain, which in turn determines the effective triangulation coverage. We
simulate a four-robot swarm across eight configurations, assigning
pre-generated patrol routes based on a specified patrol shape and sensing
capability (antenna type: omnidirectional or directional). An emitter is placed
within the map for each trial, with randomized position, transmission power and
frequency. Results show that omnidirectional localization success rates are
driven primarily by source location rather than signal properties, with
failures occurring most often when sources are placed in peripheral areas of
the map. Directional antennas are able to overcome this limitation due to their
higher gain and directivity, with an average detection success rate of 98.75%
compared to 80.25% for omnidirectional. Average localization errors range from
1.01-1.30 m for directional sensing and 1.67-1.90 m for omnidirectional
sensing; while directional sensing also benefits from shorter patrol edges.
These results demonstrate that a swarm's ability to predict electromagnetic
phenomena is directly dependent on its physical interaction with the
environment. Consequently, spatial intelligence, realized here through
optimized patrol routes and antenna selection, is a critical design
consideration for effective robotic surveillance.

*Nan Li,Jiming Ren,Haris Miller,Samuel Coogan,Karen M. Feigh,Ye Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OATH introduces obstacle-aware MATP with adaptive Halton sampling and cluster-auction-selection, plus LLM-guided planning; demonstrates improved task allocation, scalability, and adaptability in obstacle-rich settings, validated in NVIDIA Isaac Sim.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MATP faces scalability, spatial reasoning, and adaptability challenges in obstacle-rich environments; there is a need for obstacle-aware sampling, efficient coordination among heterogeneous robots, and interactive guidance from LLMs.

Method: 1) adaptive Halton sampling map with obstacle-aware density; 2) cluster-auction-selection combining obstacle-aware clustering, weighted auctions, and intra-cluster task selection; 3) LLM interpreting human commands to guide planner in real time.

Result: Substantial improvements in task assignment quality, scalability, adaptability to dynamic changes, and overall execution performance versus state-of-the-art MATP baselines in NVIDIA Isaac Sim.

Conclusion: OATH advances MATP by integrating obstacle-aware sampling, cluster-based auctions, and LLM-guided planning to achieve scalable, near-optimal heterogeneous robot task allocations in challenging environments.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Task Assignment and Planning (MATP) has attracted growing
attention but remains challenging in terms of scalability, spatial reasoning,
and adaptability in obstacle-rich environments. To address these challenges, we
propose OATH: Adaptive Obstacle-Aware Task Assignment and Planning for
Heterogeneous Robot Teaming, which advances MATP by introducing a novel
obstacle-aware strategy for task assignment. First, we develop an adaptive
Halton sequence map, the first known application of Halton sampling with
obstacle-aware adaptation in MATP, which adjusts sampling density based on
obstacle distribution. Second, we propose a cluster-auction-selection framework
that integrates obstacle-aware clustering with weighted auctions and
intra-cluster task selection. These mechanisms jointly enable effective
coordination among heterogeneous robots while maintaining scalability and
near-optimal allocation performance. In addition, our framework leverages an
LLM to interpret human instructions and directly guide the planner in real
time. We validate OATH in NVIDIA Isaac Sim, showing substantial improvements in
task assignment quality, scalability, adaptability to dynamic changes, and
overall execution performance compared to state-of-the-art MATP baselines. A

*Gaoyuan Liu,Joris de Winter,Yuri Durodie,Denis Steckelmacher,Ann Nowe,Bram Vanderborght*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Integrate RL-generated skills into TAMP with a plan refinement step to handle probabilistic actions, improving efficiency and applicability to uncertain long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TAMP struggles with uncertainty and probabilistic actions in long-horizon robotic planning; RL provides robust short-horizon skills, but lacks long-horizon planning integration.

Method: Introduce RL skills as data-driven logical components that can be invoked by symbolic planners, coupled with a plan refinement sub-routine to mitigate uncertainty. Compare against baselines from TAMP and RL literature.

Result: Empirically shows that embedding RL skills extends TAMP to domains with probabilistic skills and achieves higher planning efficiency than prior methods.

Conclusion: Embedding RL-informed skills into TAMP with a refinement step offers a practical and effective approach for planning under uncertainty in robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Task and motion planning (TAMP) for robotics manipulation necessitates
long-horizon reasoning involving versatile actions and skills. While
deterministic actions can be crafted by sampling or optimizing with certain
constraints, planning actions with uncertainty, i.e., probabilistic actions,
remains a challenge for TAMP. On the contrary, Reinforcement Learning (RL)
excels in acquiring versatile, yet short-horizon, manipulation skills that are
robust with uncertainties. In this letter, we design a method that integrates
RL skills into TAMP pipelines. Besides the policy, a RL skill is defined with
data-driven logical components that enable the skill to be deployed by symbolic
planning. A plan refinement sub-routine is designed to further tackle the
inevitable effect uncertainties. In the experiments, we compare our method with
baseline hierarchical planning from both TAMP and RL fields and illustrate the
strength of the method. The results show that by embedding RL skills, we extend
the capability of TAMP to domains with probabilistic skills, and improve the
planning efficiency compared to the previous methods.

*Hemjyoti Das,Christian Ott*

TL;DR: PFL-based control stabilizes a suspended platform with a load using only onboard sensors; handles underactuation and coupling; robust to disturbances; validated by simulations and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underactuated suspended aerial platforms (e.g., cranes with loads) on outdoor construction sites require reliable stabilization using onboard sensing; coupling terms matter for full-system stability.

Method: Apply partial feedback linearization to the coupled dynamics; analyze stability numerically; perform robustness analysis against wind, sensor noise, and model uncertainties; validate via simulations and experimental tests with onboard sensors.

Result: Coupled dynamic terms are crucial for stabilization; the method shows robustness to disturbances; simulations and experiments confirm effective stabilization using only onboard sensors.

Conclusion: A PFL-based approach that leverages interlinked dynamics achieves stable stabilization of a suspended platform with load under underactuation, with onboard sensing, suitable for outdoor crane applications.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel control approach based on partial feedback
linearization (PFL) for the stabilization of a suspended aerial platform with
an attached load. Such systems are envisioned for various applications in
construction sites involving cranes, such as the holding and transportation of
heavy objects. Our proposed control approach considers the underactuation of
the whole system while utilizing its coupled dynamics for stabilization. We
demonstrate using numerical stability analysis that these coupled terms are
crucial for the stabilization of the complete system. We also carried out
robustness analysis of the proposed approach in the presence of external wind
disturbances, sensor noise, and uncertainties in system dynamics. As our
envisioned target application involves cranes in outdoor construction sites,
our control approaches rely on only onboard sensors, thus making it suitable
for such applications. We carried out extensive simulation studies and
experimental tests to validate our proposed control approach.

*Zhiyuan Wu,Yijiong Lin,Yongqiang Zhao,Xuyang Zhang,Zhuo Chen,Nathan Lepora,Shan Luo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ViTacGen proposes vision-to-touch generation for visual robotic pushing, enabling zero-shot deployment on vision-only robots by generating contact depth images from visual input, fusing visual and generated tactile with contrastive learning within RL, achieving up to 86% success in sim and real-world experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tactile sensors are expensive, fragile, and require calibration; cross-sensor variations hinder deployment; vision-only policies often underperform; inspired by humans, the work aims to infer tactile states from vision to enable tactile-informed manipulation without real tactile data.

Method: An encoder-decoder network translates visual image sequences into generated contact depth images (a standardized tactile representation). A reinforcement learning policy fuses visual and generated tactile data, using contrastive learning to align visual and tactile modalities. The approach is validated in both simulation and real-world scenarios.

Result: Demonstrates superior performance with a reported success rate of up to 86% and zero-shot deployment on visual-only robots.

Conclusion: ViTacGen reduces reliance on high-resolution tactile sensors by generating tactile cues from vision, enabling tactile-informed manipulation in visual-only systems and offering a path toward broader zero-shot transfer; further work could address realism gaps and generalization to more diverse tasks.

Abstract: Robotic pushing is a fundamental manipulation task that requires tactile
feedback to capture subtle contact forces and dynamics between the end-effector
and the object. However, real tactile sensors often face hardware limitations
such as high costs and fragility, and deployment challenges involving
calibration and variations between different sensors, while vision-only
policies struggle with satisfactory performance. Inspired by humans' ability to
infer tactile states from vision, we propose ViTacGen, a novel robot
manipulation framework designed for visual robotic pushing with vision-to-touch
generation in reinforcement learning to eliminate the reliance on
high-resolution real tactile sensors, enabling effective zero-shot deployment
on visual-only robotic systems. Specifically, ViTacGen consists of an
encoder-decoder vision-to-touch generation network that generates contact depth
images, a standardized tactile representation, directly from visual image
sequence, followed by a reinforcement learning policy that fuses visual-tactile
data with contrastive learning based on visual and generated tactile
observations. We validate the effectiveness of our approach in both simulation
and real world experiments, demonstrating its superior performance and
achieving a success rate of up to 86\%.

### [107] [Prescribed Performance Control of Deformable Object Manipulation in Spatial Latent Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14234)
*Ning Han,Gu Gong,Bin Zhang,Yuexuan Xu,Bohan Yang,Yunhui Liu,David Navarro-Alarcon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A model-free shape control framework for 3D deformable objects using DL-extracted keypoints and a deformation Jacobian, with barrier Lyapunov functions to enforce point constraints, achieving stable, constrained manipulation validated experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manipulating deformable objects is challenging due to an infinite-dimensional state space and complex dynamics. Existing methods rely on high-dimensional features; there is a need for a low-dimensional, robust approach that preserves spatial information and enforces constraints on key points.

Method: Extract key-point coordinates from the object's point cloud via deep learning to form a compact feature vector. Use a deformation Jacobian to relate key-point motion to shape changes, framing manipulation as visual servoing. Apply prescribed performance control with barrier Lyapunov functions to enforce constraints on key points, and analyze stability with Lyapunov methods. No explicit model of the deformable dynamics required (model-free).

Result: The approach reduces feature dimensionality while preserving spatial information, simplifies deformable manipulation to a visual servoing problem, and achieves accurate, constrained control. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness and robustness of the method.

Conclusion: A model-free, constrained shape control framework for deformable objects is feasible using DL-extracted key points and a BLF-based prescribed performance controller, with Lyapunov-based stability guarantees and experimental validation.

Abstract: Manipulating three-dimensional (3D) deformable objects presents significant
challenges for robotic systems due to their infinite-dimensional state space
and complex deformable dynamics. This paper proposes a novel model-free
approach for shape control with constraints imposed on key points. Unlike
existing methods that rely on feature dimensionality reduction, the proposed
controller leverages the coordinates of key points as the feature vector, which
are extracted from the deformable object's point cloud using deep learning
methods. This approach not only reduces the dimensionality of the feature space
but also retains the spatial information of the object. By extracting key
points, the manipulation of deformable objects is simplified into a visual
servoing problem, where the shape dynamics are described using a deformation
Jacobian matrix. To enhance control accuracy, a prescribed performance control
method is developed by integrating barrier Lyapunov functions (BLF) to enforce
constraints on the key points. The stability of the closed-loop system is
rigorously analyzed and verified using the Lyapunov method. Experimental
results further demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed
method.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proprioception-only RL COLA enables compliant leader-follower human-humanoid collaboration for full-body tasks using a single policy to coordinate trajectories without external sensing; validated by simulation and real-world tests showing reduced human effort and robust performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unexplored area: compliant whole-body human-humanoid collaboration due to complex dynamics; solution: leverage proprioception to avoid external sensors and complex interaction models.

Method: Proprioception-only reinforcement learning; single policy combines leader and follower roles; trained in closed-loop sim with dynamic object interactions; implicit prediction of object motion and human intent; trajectory planning to balance load.

Result: Simulation shows ~24.7% reduction in human effort with maintained stability; real-world tests across object types and movement patterns; human-subject study with 23 participants shows ~27.4% improvement; robust across terrains and objects; no external sensors required.

Conclusion: COLA provides practical, sensor-free compliant collaboration for real-world deployment, bridging the gap in full-body human-humanoid interaction.

Abstract: Human-humanoid collaboration shows significant promise for applications in
healthcare, domestic assistance, and manufacturing. While compliant robot-human
collaboration has been extensively developed for robotic arms, enabling
compliant human-humanoid collaboration remains largely unexplored due to
humanoids' complex whole-body dynamics. In this paper, we propose a
proprioception-only reinforcement learning approach, COLA, that combines leader
and follower behaviors within a single policy. The model is trained in a
closed-loop environment with dynamic object interactions to predict object
motion patterns and human intentions implicitly, enabling compliant
collaboration to maintain load balance through coordinated trajectory planning.
We evaluate our approach through comprehensive simulator and real-world
experiments on collaborative carrying tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness,
generalization, and robustness of our model across various terrains and
objects. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our model reduces human effort
by 24.7%. compared to baseline approaches while maintaining object stability.
Real-world experiments validate robust collaborative carrying across different
object types (boxes, desks, stretchers, etc.) and movement patterns
(straight-line, turning, slope climbing). Human user studies with 23
participants confirm an average improvement of 27.4% compared to baseline
models. Our method enables compliant human-humanoid collaborative carrying
without requiring external sensors or complex interaction models, offering a
practical solution for real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AdaMoE introduces a decoupled Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) extension to pretrained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, enabling scalable, real-time robotic manipulation by replacing dense feedforward layers with sparse MoE layers and using a separate scale adapter to decouple expert selection from weighting, achieving better performance with pretrained weights and improved real-world efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling Vision-Language-Action models for robotics faces two main challenges: (1) training from scratch is resource-intensive and data-scarce in robotics, so leveraging pretrained VLA weights is valuable; (2) real-time control requires a balance between model capacity and computational efficiency.

Method: AdaMoE inherits pretrained dense VLA weights and substitutes feedforward layers with sparsely activated MoE layers to expand action experts. It introduces a decoupling technique that uses an independent scale adapter alongside the router to separate expert selection (task relevance) from expert weighting, enabling collaborative rather than winner-takes-all expert utilization.

Result: AdaMoE consistently outperforms the baseline on LIBERO (+1.8%), RoboTwin (+9.3%), and shows a substantial real-world improvement (+21.5%), validating its effectiveness for robotic manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: Leveraging pretrained weights with a decoupled MoE architecture allows scalable, efficient, and collaborative expert utilization in VLA models, delivering meaningful performance gains and practical real-world benefits in robotics.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are experiencing rapid development and
demonstrating promising capabilities in robotic manipulation tasks. However,
scaling up VLA models presents several critical challenges: (1) Training new
VLA models from scratch demands substantial computational resources and
extensive datasets. Given the current scarcity of robot data, it becomes
particularly valuable to fully leverage well-pretrained VLA model weights
during the scaling process. (2) Real-time control requires carefully balancing
model capacity with computational efficiency. To address these challenges, We
propose AdaMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that inherits
pretrained weights from dense VLA models, and scales up the action expert by
substituting the feedforward layers into sparsely activated MoE layers. AdaMoE
employs a decoupling technique that decouples expert selection from expert
weighting through an independent scale adapter working alongside the
traditional router. This enables experts to be selected based on task relevance
while contributing with independently controlled weights, allowing
collaborative expert utilization rather than winner-takes-all dynamics. Our
approach demonstrates that expertise need not monopolize. Instead, through
collaborative expert utilization, we can achieve superior performance while
maintaining computational efficiency. AdaMoE consistently outperforms the
baseline model across key benchmarks, delivering performance gains of 1.8% on
LIBERO and 9.3% on RoboTwin. Most importantly, a substantial 21.5% improvement
in real-world experiments validates its practical effectiveness for robotic
manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Trains a family of risk-conditioned quadrupedal policies with CVaR constraints and uses a bandit to adaptively select the best policy online based on episodic returns, achieving robust, fast adaptation to unseen environments in simulation and on hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve stability, robustness, and sample efficiency of risk-sensitive quadrupedal locomotion under unknown dynamics and perturbations, enabling rapid adaptation without privileged environment information.

Method: Train multiple CVaR-constrained RL policies at different risk levels to form a policy family. Deploy with a multi-armed bandit that selects the policy with the best observed episodic return, without relying on privileged data. Evaluate across diverse unseen dynamics, noise, contacts, terrain; test on a Unitree Go2.

Result: Risk-aware policy family yields nearly 2x improvements in mean and tail performance in unseen environments compared with baselines. Bandit-based adaptation selects the top-performing policy within ~2 minutes in unknown terrain.

Conclusion: A CVaR-based policy family combined with online bandit selection provides robust, fast-adapting quadrupedal locomotion in unseen conditions, without access to environment information at deployment.

Abstract: In this work, we study risk-aware reinforcement learning for quadrupedal
locomotion. Our approach trains a family of risk-conditioned policies using a
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constrained policy optimization technique that
provides improved stability and sample efficiency. At deployment, we adaptively
select the best performing policy from the family of policies using a
multi-armed bandit framework that uses only observed episodic returns, without
any privileged environment information, and adapts to unknown conditions on the
fly. Hence, we train quadrupedal locomotion policies at various levels of
robustness using CVaR and adaptively select the desired level of robustness
online to ensure performance in unknown environments. We evaluate our method in
simulation across eight unseen settings (by changing dynamics, contacts,
sensing noise, and terrain) and on a Unitree Go2 robot in previously unseen
terrains. Our risk-aware policy attains nearly twice the mean and tail
performance in unseen environments compared to other baselines and our
bandit-based adaptation selects the best-performing risk-aware policy in
unknown terrain within two minutes of operation.

*Xiaobei Zhao,Xingqi Lyu,Xiang Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SUM-AgriVLN introduces a spatial-memory module for agricultural vision-and-language navigation, leveraging 3D reconstruction to reuse past experiences, achieving improved success rate on the A2A benchmark (0.54) with a marginal navigation error (2.93m), advancing state-of-the-art in agricultural VLN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real agricultural tasks, navigation instructions recur and leverage spatial context across episodes. Prior work (AgriVLN) treats each instruction independently, missing opportunities to reuse prior navigational experiences.

Method: Introduce Spatial Understanding Memory (SUM) module that builds and saves spatial memory via 3D reconstruction and representation, integrated into AgriVLN to form SUM-AgriVLN; evaluated on the A2A benchmark.

Result: On A2A, Success Rate improves from 0.47 to 0.54; Navigation Error changes from 2.91m to 2.93m (slight increase); claimed state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.

Conclusion: Spatial memory via 3D spatial reconstruction yields measurable gains in clearance of target positions amidst natural-language navigation in agricultural settings, with a code release for reproducibility.

Abstract: Agricultural robots are emerging as powerful assistants across a wide range
of agricultural tasks, nevertheless, still heavily rely on manual operation or
fixed rail systems for movement. The AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark
pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural
domain, enabling robots to navigate to the target positions following the
natural language instructions. In practical agricultural scenarios, navigation
instructions often repeatedly occur, yet AgriVLN treat each instruction as an
independent episode, overlooking the potential of past experiences to provide
spatial context for subsequent ones. To bridge this gap, we propose the method
of Spatial Understanding Memory for Agricultural Vision-and-Language Navigation
(SUM-AgriVLN), in which the SUM module employs spatial understanding and save
spatial memory through 3D reconstruction and representation. When evaluated on
the A2A benchmark, our SUM-AgriVLN effectively improves Success Rate from 0.47
to 0.54 with slight sacrifice on Navigation Error from 2.91m to 2.93m,
demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A 1.92 kg powered transtibial prosthesis (RoboANKLE) with ESER and Extra Energy Storage (EES) provides complete push-off and natural-like ankle motion, validated by CAD/FEA and experimental tests, outperforming natural torque and power requirements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address core challenges in active transtibial prostheses—achieving natural ankle motion and push-off while maintaining energy autonomy and low weight.

Method: A design-and-analysis workflow including kinematic/kinetic analyses, CAD modeling, dynamic and structural analyses, topology optimization, prototype fabrication, and experimental evaluation.

Result: Prototype achieves natural dorsiflexion with 95% accuracy; generates 57% more torque than required for natural walking; power generation is 10% above natural gait; prototype mass is 1.92 kg with dimensions 261×107×420 mm.

Conclusion: The RoboANKLE demonstrates effective push-off with a close-to-natural torque profile and adequate power margins, validating the ESER/EES-based approach and CAD/analysis-driven design. The results support feasibility for lightweight, high-performance transtibial prostheses, though further work on energy autonomy and ongoing weight reduction is likely needed.

Abstract: This study presents a powered transtibial prosthesis with complete push-off
assistance, RoboANKLE. The design aims to fulfill specific requirements, such
as a sufficient range of motion (RoM) while providing the necessary torque for
achieving natural ankle motion in daily activities. Addressing the challenges
faced in designing active transtibial prostheses, such as maintaining energetic
autonomy and minimizing weight, is vital for the study. With this aim, we try
to imitate the human ankle by providing extensive push-off assistance to
achieve a natural-like torque profile. Thus, Energy Store and Extended Release
mechanism (ESER) is employed with a novel Extra Energy Storage (EES) mechanism.
Kinematic and kinetic analyses are carried out to determine the design
parameters and assess the design performance. Subsequently, a Computer-Aided
Design (CAD) model is built and used in comprehensive dynamic and structural
analyses. These analyses are used for the design performance evaluation and
determine the forces and torques applied to the prosthesis, which aids in
optimizing the design for minimal weight via structural analysis and topology
optimization. The design of the prototype is then finalized and manufactured
for experimental evaluation to validate the design and functionality. The
prototype is realized with a mass of 1.92 kg and dimensions of 261x107x420 mm.
The Functional evaluations of the RoboANKLE revealed that it is capable of
achieving the natural maximum dorsi-flexion angle with 95% accuracy. Also,
Thanks to the implemented mechanisms, the results show that RoboANKLE can
generate 57% higher than the required torque for natural walking. The result of
the power generation capacity of the RoboANKLE is 10% more than the natural
power during the gait cycle.

### [113] [Towards Adaptable Humanoid Control via Adaptive Motion Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14454)
*Tao Huang,Huayi Wang,Junli Ren,Kangning Yin,Zirui Wang,Xiao Chen,Feiyu Jia,Wentao Zhang,Junfeng Long,Jingbo Wang,Jiangmiao Pang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AdaMimic is a motion-tracking method that enables adaptable humanoid control from a single reference motion by sparsifying it into keyframes, creating dense intermediate motions, and training adapters for time warping and low-level action refinement, achieving improved imitation accuracy with reduced data requirements and validated in simulation and on a Unitree G1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing motion priors trade off adaptability and imitation accuracy, requiring many demonstrations; motion-tracking methods need extensive training data and test-time target motions. The paper aims to unify strengths by enabling adaptable control from a single reference motion.

Method: 1) Augment data by sparsifying the single reference motion into keyframes with light edits and minimal physics assumptions. 2) Initialize a policy by tracking sparse keyframes to produce dense motions. 3) Train adapters to adjust tracking speed and refine low-level actions, enabling flexible time warping and better imitation/adaptability.

Result: Demonstrates significant improvements in imitation accuracy and adaptability in both simulation and real-world experiments on the Unitree G1 humanoid across multiple tasks and adaptation conditions; resources (videos and code) are provided at the project site.

Conclusion: AdaMimic provides adaptable humanoid control from a single reference motion, reducing data dependence while achieving strong imitation performance across varied tasks and conditions, validated in both simulation and real hardware.

Abstract: Humanoid robots are envisioned to adapt demonstrated motions to diverse
real-world conditions while accurately preserving motion patterns. Existing
motion prior approaches enable well adaptability with a few motions but often
sacrifice imitation accuracy, whereas motion-tracking methods achieve accurate
imitation yet require many training motions and a test-time target motion to
adapt. To combine their strengths, we introduce AdaMimic, a novel motion
tracking algorithm that enables adaptable humanoid control from a single
reference motion. To reduce data dependence while ensuring adaptability, our
method first creates an augmented dataset by sparsifying the single reference
motion into keyframes and applying light editing with minimal physical
assumptions. A policy is then initialized by tracking these sparse keyframes to
generate dense intermediate motions, and adapters are subsequently trained to
adjust tracking speed and refine low-level actions based on the adjustment,
enabling flexible time warping that further improves imitation accuracy and
adaptability. We validate these significant improvements in our approach in
both simulation and the real-world Unitree G1 humanoid robot in multiple tasks
across a wide range of adaptation conditions. Videos and code are available at

### [114] [Restoring Noisy Demonstration for Imitation Learning With Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14467)
*Shang-Fu Chen,Co Yong,Shao-Hua Sun*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A filter-and-restore framework for imitation learning that handles imperfect expert demonstrations by filtering clean samples and using conditional diffusion models to recover noisy ones, yielding robust performance across manipulation and locomotion tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning often assumes perfect demonstrations, but real data contain noise from humans or sensors; improving robustness to noisy offline demonstrations is critical for practical IL.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) filter clean samples from demonstrations; (2) train conditional diffusion models to restore/recover noisy samples; evaluate on robot arm manipulation, dexterous manipulation, and locomotion; ablation studies; robustness to noise types/levels.

Result: The proposed framework consistently outperforms existing imitation learning methods across all tasks; ablations confirm effectiveness of components and robustness to noise.

Conclusion: The filter-and-restore framework is practically applicable to noisy offline demonstration data and generalizes across domains, offering a robust IL solution when expert data are imperfect.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) aims to learn a policy from expert demonstrations and
has been applied to various applications. By learning from the expert policy,
IL methods do not require environmental interactions or reward signals.
However, most existing imitation learning algorithms assume perfect expert
demonstrations, but expert demonstrations often contain imperfections caused by
errors from human experts or sensor/control system inaccuracies. To address the
above problems, this work proposes a filter-and-restore framework to best
leverage expert demonstrations with inherent noise. Our proposed method first
filters clean samples from the demonstrations and then learns conditional
diffusion models to recover the noisy ones. We evaluate our proposed framework
and existing methods in various domains, including robot arm manipulation,
dexterous manipulation, and locomotion. The experiment results show that our
proposed framework consistently outperforms existing methods across all the
tasks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component
and demonstrate the framework's robustness to different noise types and levels.
These results confirm the practical applicability of our framework to noisy
offline demonstration data.

### [115] [Stability Criteria and Motor Performance in Delayed Haptic Dyadic Interactions Mediated by Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14511)
*Mingtian Du,Suhas Raghavendra Kulkarni,Simone Kager,Domenico Campolo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Two stability criteria for robot-mediated dyadic haptic systems with network delays: a delay-independent criterion ensuring stability for any delay, and a delay-dependent criterion giving a maximum tolerable delay; stability depends on controller/robot dynamics and stiffness; experiments support the link between stability and motor performance and guide delay-compensation strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address stability and performance in remotely coupled human-human haptic interactions subject to network-induced time delays; enable reliable design of teleoperation and collaborative robots.

Method: Frequency-domain analysis with numerical simulations; derivation of stability criteria; parameter studies on stiffness/control; experiments with robots performing human-like movements to validate.

Result: Identified delay-independent and delay-dependent criteria; instability arises beyond a max delay; increasing stiffness reduces tolerable delay nonlinearly; criteria generalizable to a wide range of robot-mediated interactions; findings inform delay-compensation strategies.

Conclusion: Provides prereqs for effective delay-compensation and design guidelines for stable remote dyadic systems; experiments corroborate theory linking stability to motor performance; future work on broader applications.

Abstract: This paper establishes analytical stability criteria for robot-mediated
human-human (dyadic) interaction systems, focusing on haptic communication
under network-induced time delays. Through frequency-domain analysis supported
by numerical simulations, we identify both delay-independent and
delay-dependent stability criteria. The delay-independent criterion guarantees
stability irrespective of the delay, whereas the delay-dependent criterion is
characterised by a maximum tolerable delay before instability occurs. The
criteria demonstrate dependence on controller and robot dynamic parameters,
where increasing stiffness reduces the maximum tolerable delay in a non-linear
manner, thereby heightening system vulnerability. The proposed criteria can be
generalised to a wide range of robot-mediated interactions and serve as design
guidelines for stable remote dyadic systems. Experiments with robots performing
human-like movements further illustrate the correlation between stability and
motor performance. The findings of this paper suggest the prerequisites for
effective delay-compensation strategies.

*Matti Pekkanen,Francesco Verdoja,Ville Kyrki*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An encoder-agnostic method to improve open-vocabulary querying of robotic maps by leveraging synonyms/antonyms in embedding space to estimate the relevant language region and train a lightweight classifier to separate matches from non-matches, boosting map and image queryability with limited supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots use embeddings from visual-language models to represent semantics, enabling on-demand queries, but identifying which parts of the environment are relevant to a user query remains challenging.

Method: Use natural-language synonyms and antonyms associated with the query in the embedding space, apply heuristics to estimate the language region relevant to the query, and train a classifier to partition the environment into matches and non-matches. The approach is encoder-agnostic and requires limited training.

Result: Experiments on maps and standard image benchmarks show increased queryability of both maps and images. The querying technique is agnostic to the representation/encoder and needs limited training.

Conclusion: A lightweight, language-aware filtering step can substantially improve open-vocabulary querying of semantic maps and images across representations, enabling more accurate and efficient retrieval with minimal supervision.

Abstract: Embeddings from Visual-Language Models are increasingly utilized to represent
semantics in robotic maps, offering an open-vocabulary scene understanding that
surpasses traditional, limited labels. Embeddings enable on-demand querying by
comparing embedded user text prompts to map embeddings via a similarity metric.
The key challenge in performing the task indicated in a query is that the robot
must determine the parts of the environment relevant to the query.
  This paper proposes a solution to this challenge. We leverage
natural-language synonyms and antonyms associated with the query within the
embedding space, applying heuristics to estimate the language space relevant to
the query, and use that to train a classifier to partition the environment into
matches and non-matches. We evaluate our method through extensive experiments,
querying both maps and standard image benchmarks. The results demonstrate
increased queryability of maps and images. Our querying technique is agnostic
to the representation and encoder used, and requires limited training.

### [117] [A Generalized Placeability Metric for Model-Free Unified Pick-and-Place Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14584)
*Benno Wingender,Nils Dengler,Rohit Menon,Sicong Pan,Maren Bennewitz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A model-free generalized placeability metric directly from noisy point clouds enables unified pick-and-place reasoning for unknown objects, achieving stable, collision-free placements without CAD priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world grasping and placing of unknown objects is hampered by sensing noise and the reliance on strong priors (CAD models or planar supports). There is a need for a unified, generalizable framework that couples grasping and placing without shape priors.

Method: Introduce a generalized placeability metric that evaluates placement poses directly from noisy point clouds, without shape priors. It jointly scores stability, graspability, and clearance. From raw geometry, extract object-supported surfaces to generate diverse placement candidates with multiple orientations and sample contacts that satisfy collision and stability constraints. Condition grasp scores on each candidate placement to enable model-free unified pick-and-place reasoning and select grasp–place pairs that yield stable, collision-free placements.

Result: On unseen real objects and non-planar supports, the metric achieves CAD-comparable accuracy in predicting stability loss and tends to produce more physically plausible placements than learning-based predictors.

Conclusion: The proposed metric enables model-free, unified pick-and-place reasoning that generalizes beyond CAD priors and planar supports, delivering stable and plausible placements in challenging real-world scenarios.

Abstract: To reliably pick and place unknown objects under real-world sensing noise
remains a challenging task, as existing methods rely on strong object priors
(e.g., CAD models), or planar-support assumptions, limiting generalization and
unified reasoning between grasping and placing. In this work, we introduce a
generalized placeability metric that evaluates placement poses directly from
noisy point clouds, without any shape priors. The metric jointly scores
stability, graspability, and clearance. From raw geometry, we extract the
support surfaces of the object to generate diverse candidates for
multi-orientation placement and sample contacts that satisfy collision and
stability constraints. By conditioning grasp scores on each candidate
placement, our proposed method enables model-free unified pick-and-place
reasoning and selects grasp-place pairs that lead to stable, collision-free
placements. On unseen real objects and non-planar object supports, our metric
delivers CAD-comparable accuracy in predicting stability loss and generally
produces more physically plausible placements than learning-based predictors.

*Gabriel Fischer Abati,João Carlos Virgolino Soares,Giulio Turrisi,Victor Barasuol,Claudio Semini*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a cross-modal, image-based encoding of proprioceptive time-series for quadruped locomotion; CNNs improve contact estimation, achieving 94.5% accuracy with 15x shorter windows vs MI-HGNN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable learning from rich, morphology-preserving representations of proprioceptive data by leveraging CNNs and capturing inter-signal correlations and gait dynamics.

Method: Encode temporal dynamics from multiple proprioceptive signals (joint positions, IMU readings, foot velocities) into structured 2D images that preserve robot morphology, then apply CNN-based models for contact estimation.

Result: Image-based representation consistently enhances prediction accuracy and generalization over conventional sequence models, achieving 94.5% contact accuracy (from 87.7%) on the target dataset with 15x shorter window; outperforms MI-HGNN.

Conclusion: Cross-modal image-based encodings of proprioceptive signals are effective for learning locomotion-related tasks and can improve stability and adaptability across terrains by enabling richer feature spaces and better generalization.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for representing proprioceptive
time-series data from quadruped robots as structured two-dimensional images,
enabling the use of convolutional neural networks for learning
locomotion-related tasks. The proposed method encodes temporal dynamics from
multiple proprioceptive signals, such as joint positions, IMU readings, and
foot velocities, while preserving the robot's morphological structure in the
spatial arrangement of the image. This transformation captures inter-signal
correlations and gait-dependent patterns, providing a richer feature space than
direct time-series processing. We apply this concept in the problem of contact
estimation, a key capability for stable and adaptive locomotion on diverse
terrains. Experimental evaluations on both real-world datasets and simulated
environments show that our image-based representation consistently enhances
prediction accuracy and generalization over conventional sequence-based models,
underscoring the potential of cross-modal encoding strategies for robotic state
learning. Our method achieves superior performance on the contact dataset,
improving contact state accuracy from 87.7% to 94.5% over the recently proposed
MI-HGNN method, using a 15 times shorter window size.

*Edward Sandra,Lander Vanroye,Dries Dirckx,Ruben Cartuyvels,Jan Swevers,Wilm Decré*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CAMPD presents a context-aware diffusion-based motion planner that generalizes to unseen environments without retraining by conditioning a classifier-free denoising diffusion model on sensor-agnostic contextual information via an attention-augmented U-Net, enabling fast, multi-modal trajectories for a 7-DoF manipulator.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical motion planning methods struggle with scalability and generalization in high-dimensional, complex environments. Diffusion models can learn rich, high-dimensional, multi-modal distributions, but existing approaches are environment-specific or sensor-dependent. A sensor-agnostic, context-aware diffusion model promises better generalization across diverse scenarios.

Method: A classifier-free denoising diffusion model conditioned on arbitrary contextual parameters. An attention mechanism integrated into a U-Net architecture allows conditioning on multiple contextual inputs with no fixed sensor. Trained to handle multiple environments without retraining. Evaluated on a 7-DoF manipulator against state-of-the-art baselines on real-world tasks, with faster trajectory generation and multi-modality.

Result: The approach generalizes to unseen environments, producing high-quality, multi-modal trajectories. It achieves competitive or superior planning quality while requiring substantially less planning time than existing methods.

Conclusion: Context-aware diffusion with sensor-agnostic conditioning enables scalable, generalizable motion planning across diverse environments without retraining, offering efficient generation of high-quality, multi-modal trajectories for high-DoF robots.

Abstract: Classical methods in robot motion planning, such as sampling-based and
optimization-based methods, often struggle with scalability towards
higher-dimensional state spaces and complex environments. Diffusion models,
known for their capability to learn complex, high-dimensional and multi-modal
data distributions, provide a promising alternative when applied to motion
planning problems and have already shown interesting results. However, most of
the current approaches train their model for a single environment, limiting
their generalization to environments not seen during training. The techniques
that do train a model for multiple environments rely on a specific camera to
provide the model with the necessary environmental information and therefore
always require that sensor. To effectively adapt to diverse scenarios without
the need for retraining, this research proposes Context-Aware Motion Planning
Diffusion (CAMPD). CAMPD leverages a classifier-free denoising probabilistic
diffusion model, conditioned on sensor-agnostic contextual information. An
attention mechanism, integrated in the well-known U-Net architecture,
conditions the model on an arbitrary number of contextual parameters. CAMPD is
evaluated on a 7-DoF robot manipulator and benchmarked against state-of-the-art
approaches on real-world tasks, showing its ability to generalize to unseen
environments and generate high-quality, multi-modal trajectories, at a fraction
of the time required by existing methods.

*Yao Zhong,Hanzhi Chen,Simon Schaefer,Anran Zhang,Stefan Leutenegger*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hierarchical GOPLA framework combines semantic planning via a multi-modal LLM, 3D affordance mapping, and diffusion-based pose planning to achieve generalizable object placement in households, aided by synthetic data expansion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the integration challenge of semantic preferences and geometric feasibility in robot object placement, especially under data scarcity, enabling robust and generalizable placement in real-world homes.

Method: 1) A multi-modal LLM converts human instructions and visual inputs into structured pairwise object-relational plans. 2) A spatial mapper turns plans into 3D affordance maps encoding geometric common sense for feasible placements. 3) A diffusion-based planner generates plausible placement poses guided by test-time costs, handling multiple plan distributions and collision avoidance. 4) A scalable pipeline expands human demonstrations into diverse synthetic training data to overcome data scarcity.

Result: Placement success improves by 30.04 percentage points over the runner-up; higher positioning accuracy and physical plausibility; demonstrates strong generalization across a broad range of real-world robotic placement scenarios.

Conclusion: GOPLA offers a scalable, data-efficient framework that fuses semantic reasoning and geometric reasoning for robust, generalizable object placement in household robots.

Abstract: Robots are expected to serve as intelligent assistants, helping humans with
everyday household organization. A central challenge in this setting is the
task of object placement, which requires reasoning about both semantic
preferences (e.g., common-sense object relations) and geometric feasibility
(e.g., collision avoidance). We present GOPLA, a hierarchical framework that
learns generalizable object placement from augmented human demonstrations. A
multi-modal large language model translates human instructions and visual
inputs into structured plans that specify pairwise object relationships. These
plans are then converted into 3D affordance maps with geometric common sense by
a spatial mapper, while a diffusion-based planner generates placement poses
guided by test-time costs, considering multi-plan distributions and collision
avoidance. To overcome data scarcity, we introduce a scalable pipeline that
expands human placement demonstrations into diverse synthetic training data.
Extensive experiments show that our approach improves placement success rates
by 30.04 percentage points over the runner-up, evaluated on positioning
accuracy and physical plausibility, demonstrating strong generalization across
a wide range of real-world robotic placement scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A generative predictive control (GPC) framework that amortizes sampling-based MPC by bootstrapping with conditional flow-matching models trained on SPC data; demonstrates real-world quadruped loco-manipulation; improves sample efficiency and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) can be computationally expensive due to the need to draw and evaluate many samples. The work proposes learning proposal distributions from SPC data to speed up online planning, and extends to challenging real-world contact-rich loco-manipulation with a quadruped.

Method: Train conditional flow-matching models on SPC control sequences collected in simulation to learn informative proposal distributions. Use these learned proposals to guide sampling in generative predictive control, avoiding iterative refinement or gradient-based solvers. Validate the approach in simulation and on hardware for a quadruped.

Result: The method improves sample efficiency, reduces required planning horizons, and generalizes robustly across task variations, with successful demonstrations in both simulation and real-world hardware.

Conclusion: Learning from noisy SPC data yields effective proposal distributions for GPC, enabling efficient online planning and enabling real-world contact-rich loco-manipulation with a quadruped, while generalizing across task variations.

Abstract: We present a generative predictive control (GPC) framework that amortizes
sampling-based Model Predictive Control (SPC) by bootstrapping it with
conditional flow-matching models trained on SPC control sequences collected in
simulation. Unlike prior work relying on iterative refinement or gradient-based
solvers, we show that meaningful proposal distributions can be learned directly
from noisy SPC data, enabling more efficient and informed sampling during
online planning. We further demonstrate, for the first time, the application of
this approach to real-world contact-rich loco-manipulation with a quadruped
robot. Extensive experiments in simulation and on hardware show that our method
improves sample efficiency, reduces planning horizon requirements, and
generalizes robustly across task variations.

*Jialei Huang,Yang Ye,Yuanqing Gong,Xuezhou Zhu,Yang Gao,Kaifeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Spatial grounding of tactile data via SaTA enables end-to-end policies to infer hand-centered object geometry, achieving sub-millimeter precision tasks and superior performance over visuo-tactile baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing visuo-tactile learning struggles with sub-millimeter precision and fails to leverage tactile spatial relationships with hand kinematics; there is a need for a tactile representation that grounds contact in a stable reference frame while preserving sensory detail to infer geometry without object models.

Method: Propose SaTA (Spatially-anchored Tactile Awareness): an end-to-end policy framework that anchors tactile features to the hand's kinematic frame via forward kinematics, enabling geometric reasoning in hand coordinates without object models or pose estimation; validated on challenging dexterous tasks including bimanual USB-C mating, light bulb installation, and card sliding.

Result: SaTA significantly outperforms strong visuo-tactile baselines across benchmarks, achieving up to ~30 percentage-point gains in success rate and about 27% faster task completion times.

Conclusion: Spatially grounded tactile representations enable precise geometric reasoning in the hand frame and improve dexterous manipulation without requiring object models or explicit pose estimation.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation requires precise geometric reasoning, yet existing
visuo-tactile learning methods struggle with sub-millimeter precision tasks
that are routine for traditional model-based approaches. We identify a key
limitation: while tactile sensors provide rich contact information, current
learning frameworks fail to effectively leverage both the perceptual richness
of tactile signals and their spatial relationship with hand kinematics. We
believe an ideal tactile representation should explicitly ground contact
measurements in a stable reference frame while preserving detailed sensory
information, enabling policies to not only detect contact occurrence but also
precisely infer object geometry in the hand's coordinate system. We introduce
SaTA (Spatially-anchored Tactile Awareness for dexterous manipulation), an
end-to-end policy framework that explicitly anchors tactile features to the
hand's kinematic frame through forward kinematics, enabling accurate geometric
reasoning without requiring object models or explicit pose estimation. Our key
insight is that spatially grounded tactile representations allow policies to
not only detect contact occurrence but also precisely infer object geometry in
the hand's coordinate system. We validate SaTA on challenging dexterous
manipulation tasks, including bimanual USB-C mating in free space, a task
demanding sub-millimeter alignment precision, as well as light bulb
installation requiring precise thread engagement and rotational control, and
card sliding that demands delicate force modulation and angular precision.
These tasks represent significant challenges for learning-based methods due to
their stringent precision requirements. Across multiple benchmarks, SaTA
significantly outperforms strong visuo-tactile baselines, improving success
rates by up to 30 percentage while reducing task completion times by 27
percentage.

*Steffen Hagedorn,Luka Donkov,Aron Distelzweig,Alexandru P. Condurache*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Integrating SMART into nuPlan shows IDM-based simulation overestimates planner performance; learned planners excel in standard scenarios but falter in edge cases; SMART-reactive simulation is recommended as the new closed-loop benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address biases in planner evaluation caused by simplistic, passive traffic agents (IDM) that fail to reflect realistic interactions and test planner capabilities adequately; close the sim-to-real gap.

Method: Replace IDM with SMART in nuPlan's closed-loop simulation; evaluate 14 planners and baselines across multi-lane, interaction-heavy scenarios; compare performance under SMART vs IDM; analyze robustness in edge cases.

Result: IDM overestimates performance; many scores deteriorate under SMART; some planners show improved or more realistic interaction, particularly in complex scenarios; closed-loop learned planners are most stable but degrade near edge cases; rule-based planners remain robust but basic.

Conclusion: Propose SMART-reactive simulation as the new standard closed-loop benchmark in nuPlan and release SMART agents as drop-in IDM alternatives to enhance realism in planner evaluation.

Abstract: Planner evaluation in closed-loop simulation often uses rule-based traffic
agents, whose simplistic and passive behavior can hide planner deficiencies and
bias rankings. Widely used IDM agents simply follow a lead vehicle and cannot
react to vehicles in adjacent lanes, hindering tests of complex interaction
capabilities. We address this issue by integrating the state-of-the-art learned
traffic agent model SMART into nuPlan. Thus, we are the first to evaluate
planners under more realistic conditions and quantify how conclusions shift
when narrowing the sim-to-real gap. Our analysis covers 14 recent planners and
established baselines and shows that IDM-based simulation overestimates
planning performance: nearly all scores deteriorate. In contrast, many planners
interact better than previously assumed and even improve in multi-lane,
interaction-heavy scenarios like lane changes or turns. Methods trained in
closed-loop demonstrate the best and most stable driving performance. However,
when reaching their limits in augmented edge-case scenarios, all learned
planners degrade abruptly, whereas rule-based planners maintain reasonable
basic behavior. Based on our results, we suggest SMART-reactive simulation as a
new standard closed-loop benchmark in nuPlan and release the SMART agents as a
drop-in alternative to IDM at https://github.com/shgd95/InteractiveClosedLoop.

*Fan Yang,Zixuan Huang,Abhinav Kumar,Sergio Aguilera Marinovic,Soshi Iba,Rana Soltani Zarrin,Dmitry Berenson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CADRE is a reinforcement learning framework for catching a falling object within grasp range and resetting the system to a favorable state, using a Neural Descriptor Field–inspired module to extract implicit contact features. This contact-aware approach improves RL training efficiency, convergence, and recovery success, and generalizes to unseen object geometries without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world dexterous manipulation is prone to unexpected errors and disturbances that can cause objects to be dropped. Effective recovery requires understanding finger–object contacts and geometry, not just object pose or point clouds. A robust recovery mechanism can resume manipulation tasks quickly after disturbances.

Method: Propose CADRE, a reinforcement learning framework that includes a Neural Descriptor Field–inspired module to extract implicit contact features, enabling finger–object correspondence and geometry-aware recovery. This contrasts with methods that rely solely on object pose or point clouds, and supports zero-shot generalization to new object geometries.

Result: Experiments show that incorporating contact features improves training efficiency and convergence of RL, leading to more successful recoveries. CADRE demonstrates zero-shot generalization to unseen objects with different geometries.

Conclusion: Contact-aware dynamic recovery via CADRE enables more reliable recovery from disturbances in dexterous manipulation and can generalize to unseen object geometries, improving resilience in real-world tasks.

Abstract: Real-world dexterous manipulation often encounters unexpected errors and
disturbances, which can lead to catastrophic failures, such as dropping the
manipulated object. To address this challenge, we focus on the problem of
catching a falling object while it remains within grasping range and,
importantly, resetting the system to a configuration favorable for resuming the
primary manipulation task. We propose Contact-Aware Dynamic Recovery (CADRE), a
reinforcement learning framework that incorporates a Neural Descriptor Field
(NDF)-inspired module to extract implicit contact features. Compared to methods
that rely solely on object pose or point cloud input, NDFs can directly reason
about finger-object correspondence and adapt to different object geometries.
Our experiments show that incorporating contact features improves training
efficiency, enhances convergence performance for RL training, and ultimately
leads to more successful recoveries. Additionally, we demonstrate that CADRE
can generalize zero-shot to unseen objects with different geometries.

Motivation: Current autonomous drone racing (ADR) systems are highly specialized and many end-to-end vision approaches struggle to transfer from simulation to real world, operate onboard, and achieve champion-level performance simultaneously. A general, calibration-free solution with onboard execution is needed.

Method: SkyDreamer extends the Dreamer model-based RL framework. The world model learns a latent state and, during training, decodes privileged information to improve interpretability. The policy operates directly from pixel inputs to motor commands, runs fully onboard without external aid, uses the world-model latent state to resolve visual ambiguities, and does not require camera calibration. It also handles robustness challenges (e.g., varying segmentation quality, battery depletion) by relying on the latent state and estimated maximum motor RPM to adjust flight in real time.

Result: Real-world experiments show high-speed, agile flight (up to 21 m/s and 6 g), executing complex maneuvers (inverted loop, split-S, ladder). Demonstrates non-trivial visual sim-to-real transfer with poor-quality segmentation masks and robustness to battery depletion by estimating max RPM and adjusting path. Requires no retraining for deployment across different drones.

Conclusion: SkyDreamer advances end-to-end vision-based ADR by achieving onboard execution, robust sim-to-real transfer, and high-performance flight, addressing key reality-gap challenges and enabling rapid, calibration-free deployment across drones.

Abstract: Autonomous drone racing (ADR) systems have recently achieved champion-level
performance, yet remain highly specific to drone racing. While end-to-end
vision-based methods promise broader applicability, no system to date
simultaneously achieves full sim-to-real transfer, onboard execution, and
champion-level performance. In this work, we present SkyDreamer, to the best of
our knowledge, the first end-to-end vision-based ADR policy that maps directly
from pixel-level representations to motor commands. SkyDreamer builds on
informed Dreamer, a model-based reinforcement learning approach where the world
model decodes to privileged information only available during training. By
extending this concept to end-to-end vision-based ADR, the world model
effectively functions as an implicit state and parameter estimator, greatly
improving interpretability. SkyDreamer runs fully onboard without external aid,
resolves visual ambiguities by tracking progress using the state decoded from
the world model's hidden state, and requires no extrinsic camera calibration,
enabling rapid deployment across different drones without retraining.
Real-world experiments show that SkyDreamer achieves robust, high-speed flight,
executing tight maneuvers such as an inverted loop, a split-S and a ladder,
reaching speeds of up to 21 m/s and accelerations of up to 6 g. It further
demonstrates a non-trivial visual sim-to-real transfer by operating on
poor-quality segmentation masks, and exhibits robustness to battery depletion
by accurately estimating the maximum attainable motor RPM and adjusting its
flight path in real-time. These results highlight SkyDreamer's adaptability to
important aspects of the reality gap, bringing robustness while still achieving
extremely high-speed, agile flight.

*Yufei Zhu,Shih-Min Yang,Andrey Rudenko,Tomasz P. Kucner,Achim J. Lilienthal,Martin Magnusson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A continuous spatio-temporal Maps of Dynamics (MoD) using an implicit neural network maps coordinates to Semi-Wrapped Gaussian Mixture Model parameters, enabling discretization-free, smooth motion modeling with improved accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MoD representations rely on discrete spatial sampling and offline construction, suffer from costly imputation in uneven regions and lack smooth generalization across space and time. A continuous model can improve safety and efficiency for robots operating in complex human environments.

Method: Proposed a continuous spatio-temporal MoD representation that uses implicit neural functions to directly map coordinates (x, y, t) to the parameters of a Semi-Wrapped Gaussian Mixture Model, removing discretization and enabling smooth generalization.

Result: On a large public dataset with long-term real-world people tracking data, the method achieves better accuracy in motion representation and smoother velocity distributions in sparse regions, while remaining computationally efficient compared with baselines.

Conclusion: The approach provides a powerful and efficient way to model complex human motion patterns, enabling safer, more reliable robot operation in human environments.

Abstract: Safe and efficient robot operation in complex human environments can benefit
from good models of site-specific motion patterns. Maps of Dynamics (MoDs)
provide such models by encoding statistical motion patterns in a map, but
existing representations use discrete spatial sampling and typically require
costly offline construction. We propose a continuous spatio-temporal MoD
representation based on implicit neural functions that directly map coordinates
to the parameters of a Semi-Wrapped Gaussian Mixture Model. This removes the
need for discretization and imputation for unevenly sampled regions, enabling
smooth generalization across both space and time. Evaluated on a large public
dataset with long-term real-world people tracking data, our method achieves
better accuracy of motion representation and smoother velocity distributions in
sparse regions while still being computationally efficient, compared to
available baselines. The proposed approach demonstrates a powerful and
efficient way of modeling complex human motion patterns.

*Kun Lei,Huanyu Li,Dongjie Yu,Zhenyu Wei,Lingxiao Guo,Zhennan Jiang,Ziyu Wang,Shiyu Liang,Huazhe Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RL-100 is a real-world RL framework that learns diffusion-based visuomotor policies via a three-stage pipeline (imitation learning, offline RL with OPE-gated PPO updates in denoising, then online RL) and a distillation head to enable fast, single-step policies. It is task-, embodiment-, and representation-agnostic and achieves near-perfect real-world performance across seven tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To close the gap between real-world robotic manipulation performance and skilled human operators by creating a robust, efficient, and general RL framework capable of operating across diverse tasks, inputs, and robots in real time.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: (1) imitation learning to leverage human priors; (2) iterative offline RL with an Offline Policy Evaluation (OPE) gate to constrain PPO-like updates during denoising, ensuring conservative improvement; (3) online RL to address remaining failure modes. A lightweight consistency distillation head compresses the diffusion sampling into a single-step policy for high-frequency control. Supports 3D point clouds or 2D RGB inputs, various robots, single-step or action-chunk policies.

Result: Achieves 100% success over 900 evaluated episodes across seven real-robot tasks, including up to 250/250 consecutive trials on one task; matches or exceeds teleoperation efficiency and demonstrates multi-hour robustness (up to two hours) in uninterrupted operation.

Conclusion: RL-100 demonstrates a versatile, robust, and efficient real-world RL framework for diffusion-based visuomotor policies, achieving high reliability across diverse tasks, embodiments, and representations, with substantial latency reduction and sustained long-duration operation.

Abstract: Real-world robotic manipulation in homes and factories demands reliability,
efficiency, and robustness that approach or surpass skilled human operators. We
present RL-100, a real-world reinforcement learning training framework built on
diffusion visuomotor policies trained bu supervised learning. RL-100 introduces
a three-stage pipeline. First, imitation learning leverages human priors.
Second, iterative offline reinforcement learning uses an Offline Policy
Evaluation procedure, abbreviated OPE, to gate PPO-style updates that are
applied in the denoising process for conservative and reliable improvement.
Third, online reinforcement learning eliminates residual failure modes. An
additional lightweight consistency distillation head compresses the multi-step
sampling process in diffusion into a single-step policy, enabling
high-frequency control with an order-of-magnitude reduction in latency while
preserving task performance. The framework is task-, embodiment-, and
representation-agnostic and supports both 3D point clouds and 2D RGB inputs, a
variety of robot platforms, and both single-step and action-chunk policies. We
evaluate RL-100 on seven real-robot tasks spanning dynamic rigid-body control,
such as Push-T and Agile Bowling, fluids and granular pouring, deformable cloth
folding, precise dexterous unscrewing, and multi-stage orange juicing. RL-100
attains 100\% success across evaluated trials for a total of 900 out of 900
episodes, including up to 250 out of 250 consecutive trials on one task. The
method achieves near-human teleoperation or better time efficiency and
demonstrates multi-hour robustness with uninterrupted operation lasting up to
two hours.

*Marcello Sorge,Nicola Cigarini,Riccardo Lorigiola,Giulia Michieletto,Andrea Masiero,Angelo Cenedese,Alberto Guarnieri*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Multi-agent switching-mode control for acoustic source localization, covering single-source with rigid formation and multi-source independent search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sound-based sensing enables locating targets when line-of-sight is blocked; cooperation among multiple agents can improve robustness and search speed.

Method: Proposes a switching-mode cooperative control strategy for a team of acoustic-sensing agents. In the single-source case, agents maintain a rigid formation while advancing toward the source; in the multi-source case, each agent searches independently without enforcing inter-agent formation.

Result: The abstract introduces the design and scenarios but does not report empirical results or theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: Provides a framework for cooperative acoustic source localization with two deployment scenarios, addressing robustness and efficiency under challenging sensing conditions.

Abstract: Source seeking is an important topic in robotic research, especially
considering sound-based sensors since they allow the agents to locate a target
even in critical conditions where it is not possible to establish a direct line
of sight. In this work, we design a multi- agent switching mode control
strategy for acoustic-based target localization. Two scenarios are considered:
single source localization, in which the agents are driven maintaining a rigid
formation towards the target, and multi-source scenario, in which each agent
searches for the targets independently from the others.

*Jakob Bichler,Andreu Matoses Gimenez,Javier Alonso-Mora*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Sadcher is a real-time task assignment framework for heterogeneous multi-robot teams that uses imitation learning, graph attention, and transformers to predict assignment rewards. A relaxed bipartite matching step yields feasible, high-quality schedules, considering spatiotemporal state (positions, task durations, remaining processing times). Trained on optimally solved small-scale instances, it scales to larger problems and outperforms baselines in real-time scenarios. A dataset of 250k optimal schedules is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently and robustly assign tasks to heterogeneous robots in real-time while accommodating dynamic coalitions and temporal constraints, and to generalize across different spatiotemporal environments beyond the training distribution.

Method: Combine imitation learning with graph attention networks and transformers to predict assignment rewards between robots and tasks. Use a relaxed bipartite matching step to generate schedules with feasibility guarantees. Explicitly model robot/task positions, task durations, and robots' remaining processing times to enable temporal/spatial reasoning. Train on optimally solved small-scale instances and evaluate scalability; explore sampling-based variants; release a large dataset of optimal schedules.

Result: The approach outperforms other learning-based and heuristic baselines on randomized, unseen problems for small and medium-sized teams, with computation times compatible with real-time operation; demonstrates scalability across robot and task counts; provides feasibility guarantees for generated schedules.

Conclusion: Sadcher provides an effective framework for real-time, uncertain, and dynamic task assignment in heterogeneous robotic teams, offering strong generalization to new environments, scalability, and a valuable dataset to support future research.

Abstract: We present Sadcher, a real-time task assignment framework for heterogeneous
multi-robot teams that incorporates dynamic coalition formation and task
precedence constraints. Sadcher is trained through Imitation Learning and
combines graph attention and transformers to predict assignment rewards between
robots and tasks. Based on the predicted rewards, a relaxed bipartite matching
step generates high-quality schedules with feasibility guarantees. We
explicitly model robot and task positions, task durations, and robots'
remaining processing times, enabling advanced temporal and spatial reasoning
and generalization to environments with different spatiotemporal distributions
compared to training. Trained on optimally solved small-scale instances, our
method can scale to larger task sets and team sizes. Sadcher outperforms other
learning-based and heuristic baselines on randomized, unseen problems for small
and medium-sized teams with computation times suitable for real-time operation.
We also explore sampling-based variants and evaluate scalability across robot
and task counts. In addition, we release our dataset of 250,000 optimal

### [131] [STITCHER: Constrained Trajectory Planning in Known Environments with Real-Time Motion Primitive Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14893)
*Helene J. Levy,Brett T. Lopez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An optimization-free planning framework (STITCHER) stitches short trajectory segments via graph search to generate long-range, real-time trajectories that are dynamically feasible and collision-free, outperforming optimization-based planners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimization-based planners often suffer from high computation times and numerical instability, which can be unsafe for real-time, high-speed navigation in large, complex environments. There is a need for real-time, expressive, and safe planning that avoids heavy optimization bottlenecks.

Method: STITCHER builds a library of short, dynamically feasible trajectory segments and stitches them into long trajectories using graph search. It enforces nonconvex constraints (e.g., tilt limits, motor force limits) and collision avoidance, enabling real-time planning without solving heavy optimization problems.

Result: Simulation tests show safe trajectories can be generated in milliseconds for paths spanning two 50 m x 50 m environments. Hardware experiments with a custom quadrotor demonstrate real-time, trackable paths that respect nonconvex constraints, and STITCHER outperforms two state-of-the-art optimization planners.

Conclusion: Optimization-free stitching with graph search enables real-time, long-range, expressive trajectories with near-optimal quality, expanding the applicability of autonomous navigation in safety-critical contexts.

Abstract: Autonomous high-speed navigation through large, complex environments requires
real-time generation of agile trajectories that are dynamically feasible,
collision-free, and satisfy state or actuator constraints. Modern trajectory
planning techniques primarily use numerical optimization, as they enable the
systematic computation of high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy
various constraints. However, stringent requirements on computation time and
the risk of numerical instability can limit the use of optimization-based
planners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free
planning framework called STITCHER that stitches short trajectory segments
together with graph search to compute long-range, expressive, and near-optimal
trajectories in real-time. STITCHER outperforms modern optimization-based
planners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic
developments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation
testing is performed to analyze the algorithmic components that make up
STITCHER, along with a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art
optimization planners. Simulation tests show that safe trajectories can be
created within a few milliseconds for paths that span the entirety of two 50 m
x 50 m environments. Hardware tests with a custom quadrotor verify that
STITCHER can produce trackable paths in real-time while respecting nonconvex
constraints, such as limits on tilt angle and motor forces, which are otherwise
hard to include in optimization-based planners.

*Han Zhao,Jiaxuan Zhang,Wenxuan Song,Pengxiang Ding,Donglin Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLA^2 extends vision-language-action models with external knowledge modules to handle unseen objects, achieving strong generalization on a LIBERO-based benchmark with three difficulty levels; it outperforms OpenVLA and preserves in-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLA models struggle with object concepts outside training data. Integrating external visual/textual knowledge via web retrieval and object detection can mitigate out-of-distribution failures.

Method: Use OpenVLA as backbone; incorporate external modules (web retrieval, object detection) to supply knowledge about target objects to the VLA. Create a LIBERO-based benchmark with three difficulty levels; evaluate against baselines.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art on the hard level of the designed benchmark; 44.2% higher success rate than standalone OpenVLA; average 20.2% improvement across customized environments; no degradation in in-domain tasks.

Conclusion: External knowledge integration in an agentic VLA framework significantly improves generalization to out-of-distribution objects without sacrificing in-domain performance; the new benchmark demonstrates robustness.

Abstract: Current vision-language-action (VLA) models, pre-trained on large-scale
robotic data, exhibit strong multi-task capabilities and generalize well to
variations in visual and language instructions for manipulation. However, their
success rate drops significantly when faced with object concepts outside the
training data, such as unseen object descriptions and textures in the dataset.
To address this, we propose a novel agentic framework, VLA^2, which leverages
OpenVLA as the execution backbone and effectively leverages external modules
such as web retrieval and object detection to provide visual and textual
knowledge about target objects to the VLA. This approach mitigates
generalization failure when handling out-of-distribution objects. Based on the
LIBERO simulation environment, we introduced novel objects and object
descriptions to construct a new evaluation benchmark with three difficulty
levels to test the effectiveness of our method. Our framework successfully
outperformed the current state-of-the-art models on our designed hard-level
generalization benchmark. Compared to the standalone OpenVLA baseline, VLA^2
achieves a 44.2% improvement in the success rate in the hard-level benchmark
and an average improvement of 20.2% in all customized environments without any
performance degradation on in-domain tasks. Project website:

*Binghao Huang,Jie Xu,Iretiayo Akinola,Wei Yang,Balakumar Sundaralingam,Rowland O'Flaherty,Dieter Fox,Xiaolong Wang,Arsalan Mousavian,Yu-Wei Chao,Yunzhu Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VT-Refine introduces a visuo-tactile diffusion-policy framework that uses limited real demonstrations, high-fidelity tactile simulation, and RL in a digital twin to improve precise, contact-rich bimanual assembly and enable robust sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic bimanual assembly relies on rich tactile feedback, which is difficult to replicate with imitation learning from limited, suboptimal human demonstrations. A method that fuses real, tactile-rich data with scalable simulation and learning could improve robustness and generalization.

Method: Train a diffusion policy on a small set of synchronized visuo-tactile demonstrations. Transfer the learned policy to a simulated digital twin with modeled tactile sensors, then refine it via large-scale reinforcement learning. Use high-resolution piezoresistive tactile sensors (normal force signals) and GPU-accelerated tactile simulation to enable realistic, efficient training and sim-to-real transfer.

Result: VT-Refine yields improved assembly performance in both simulation and real-world tests by increasing data diversity and enabling more effective policy fine-tuning. A project page is provided for detailed results and implementation details.

Conclusion: Integrating visuo-tactile diffusion learning with sim-to-real RL refinement, aided by realistic tactile sensing and tactile simulation, can enhance precision and robustness in contact-rich, bimanual assembly tasks.

Abstract: Humans excel at bimanual assembly tasks by adapting to rich tactile feedback
-- a capability that remains difficult to replicate in robots through
behavioral cloning alone, due to the suboptimality and limited diversity of
human demonstrations. In this work, we present VT-Refine, a visuo-tactile
policy learning framework that combines real-world demonstrations,
high-fidelity tactile simulation, and reinforcement learning to tackle precise,
contact-rich bimanual assembly. We begin by training a diffusion policy on a
small set of demonstrations using synchronized visual and tactile inputs. This
policy is then transferred to a simulated digital twin equipped with simulated
tactile sensors and further refined via large-scale reinforcement learning to
enhance robustness and generalization. To enable accurate sim-to-real transfer,
we leverage high-resolution piezoresistive tactile sensors that provide normal
force signals and can be realistically modeled in parallel using
GPU-accelerated simulation. Experimental results show that VT-Refine improves
assembly performance in both simulation and the real world by increasing data
diversity and enabling more effective policy fine-tuning. Our project page is

*Blake Werner,Lizhi Yang,Aaron D. Ames*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Layered control with fast stabilization and slow perception, trained in two stages, outperforms end-to-end policies for robust locomotion, demonstrated on hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust humanoid locomotion in unstructured environments requires balancing fast stabilization with perceptual decision-making. Monolithic end-to-end policies often struggle without large networks or rich perception, so architectural timescale separation may be key.

Method: Introduce a layered control architecture (LCA) with a high-rate proprioceptive stabilizer and a compact low-rate perceptual policy. Train with a two-stage curriculum: blind stabilizer pretraining followed by perceptual fine-tuning. Evaluate in simulation and on hardware (Unitree G1), comparing against one-stage end-to-end policies using minimal perception encoders.

Result: Layered policies consistently outperform one-stage alternatives in both simulation and hardware. Success extends to stair and ledge tasks where one-stage perceptual policies fail.

Conclusion: Architectural separation of timescales—not network scale or complexity—enables robust perception-conditioned locomotion.

Abstract: Robust humanoid locomotion in unstructured environments requires
architectures that balance fast low-level stabilization with slower perceptual
decision-making. We show that a simple layered control architecture (LCA), a
proprioceptive stabilizer running at high rate, coupled with a compact low-rate
perceptual policy, enables substantially more robust performance than
monolithic end-to-end designs, even when using minimal perception encoders.
Through a two-stage training curriculum (blind stabilizer pretraining followed
by perceptual fine-tuning), we demonstrate that layered policies consistently
outperform one-stage alternatives in both simulation and hardware. On a Unitree
G1 humanoid, our approach succeeds across stair and ledge tasks where one-stage
perceptual policies fail. These results highlight that architectural separation
of timescales, rather than network scale or complexity, is the key enabler for
robust perception-conditioned locomotion.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboGhost bypasses explicit motion decoding and retargeting, using a diffusion-based policy conditioned on language-grounded motion latents to directly generate executable actions for humanoids, enabling low-latency, semantically aligned control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing language-guided humanoid locomotion pipelines stack multiple stages (motion decoding, retargeting, physics-based control), which compound errors, introduce latency, and weaken the coupling between semantics and control. A direct language-to-action pathway is needed for robust, reactive humanoid control.

Method: A retargeting-free framework where a diffusion-based policy denoises executable actions directly from noise, conditioned on language-grounded motion latents. A hybrid causal transformer-diffusion motion generator provides long-horizon consistency while maintaining stability and diversity, yielding rich latent representations for precise humanoid behavior.

Result: Extensive experiments show reduced deployment latency, improved success rates and tracking accuracy, and smooth, semantically aligned locomotion on real humanoids.

Conclusion: RoboGhost provides a general foundation for vision-language-action humanoid systems, extending naturally to modalities beyond text (images, audio, music) and enabling faster, more semantically grounded control.

Abstract: Natural language offers a natural interface for humanoid robots, but existing
language-guided humanoid locomotion pipelines remain cumbersome and unreliable.
They typically decode human motion, retarget it to robot morphology, and then
track it with a physics-based controller. However, this multi-stage process is
prone to cumulative errors, introduces high latency, and yields weak coupling
between semantics and control. These limitations call for a more direct pathway
from language to action, one that eliminates fragile intermediate stages.
Therefore, we present RoboGhost, a retargeting-free framework that directly
conditions humanoid policies on language-grounded motion latents. By bypassing
explicit motion decoding and retargeting, RoboGhost enables a diffusion-based
policy to denoise executable actions directly from noise, preserving semantic
intent and supporting fast, reactive control. A hybrid causal
transformer-diffusion motion generator further ensures long-horizon consistency
while maintaining stability and diversity, yielding rich latent representations
for precise humanoid behavior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboGhost
substantially reduces deployment latency, improves success rates and tracking
accuracy, and produces smooth, semantically aligned locomotion on real
humanoids. Beyond text, the framework naturally extends to other modalities
such as images, audio, and music, providing a general foundation for
vision-language-action humanoid systems.

### [136] [CBF-RL: Safety Filtering Reinforcement Learning in Training with Control Barrier Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14959)
*Lizhi Yang,Blake Werner,Massimiliano de Sa Aaron D. Ames*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CBF-RL trains safe RL by embedding barrier-function constraints into the policy during training and by safely filtering rollouts offline; avoids runtime safety filters while improving safety and sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety violations in RL can have catastrophic consequences in real-world deployments. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) offer principled, dynamic safety constraints, but online safety filters can cause conservatism. The gap is to integrate safety into learning itself rather than rely on post-hoc filtering.

Method: Integrate CBF constraints into the nominal RL policy with a minimal modification via a CBF term; apply safety filtering to training rollouts; prove that continuous-time safety filters can be realized in discrete-time rollouts with closed-form expressions; validate through ablations on navigation tasks and a Unitree G1 humanoid robot, showing safer exploration, faster convergence, and robustness under uncertainty; enable safe deployment without an online safety filter.

Result: Theoretical contribution: a bridge enabling continuous-time CBF safety filters to be implemented in discrete-time training updates via closed-form expressions. Practical contribution: empirical evidence that the learned policy internalizes safety constraints, leading to safer actions and bias toward safer rewards, with improved convergence and real-world robustness; demonstrated on navigation tasks and a real humanoid robot, avoiding the need for a runtime safety filter.

Conclusion: CBF-RL effectively internalizes safety into the learned policy, enabling safe deployment without online safety filtering and improving safety and efficiency in learning for real-world robotics.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), while powerful and expressive, can often
prioritize performance at the expense of safety. Yet safety violations can lead
to catastrophic outcomes in real-world deployments. Control Barrier Functions
(CBFs) offer a principled method to enforce dynamic safety -- traditionally
deployed \emph{online} via safety filters. While the result is safe behavior,
the fact that the RL policy does not have knowledge of the CBF can lead to
conservative behaviors. This paper proposes CBF-RL, a framework for generating
safe behaviors with RL by enforcing CBFs \emph{in training}. CBF-RL has two key
attributes: (1) minimally modifying a nominal RL policy to encode safety
constraints via a CBF term, (2) and safety filtering of the policy rollouts in
training. Theoretically, we prove that continuous-time safety filters can be
deployed via closed-form expressions on discrete-time roll-outs. Practically,
we demonstrate that CBF-RL internalizes the safety constraints in the learned
policy -- both enforcing safer actions and biasing towards safer rewards --
enabling safe deployment without the need for an online safety filter. We
validate our framework through ablation studies on navigation tasks and on the
Unitree G1 humanoid robot, where CBF-RL enables safer exploration, faster
convergence, and robust performance under uncertainty, enabling the humanoid
robot to avoid obstacles and climb stairs safely in real-world settings without
a runtime safety filter.

*Mingxuan Yan,Yuping Wang,Zechun Liu,Jiachen Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Retrieval-based Demonstration Decomposer (RDD) automatically segments demonstrations into sub-tasks by aligning sub-interval visual features with the training data of low-level visuomotor policies, improving robustness and performance over heuristic or finetuned baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical vision-language-action (VLA) systems rely on sub-task decompositions, which are often provided by manual annotation or heuristic rules. Such decompositions can drift from the visuomotor policy's training distribution, harming performance on long-horizon tasks.

Method: RDD uses retrieval over visual features to identify sub-intervals whose representations align with the policy training data, automatically decomposing demonstrations into sub-tasks without task-specific finetuning.

Result: RDD outperforms state-of-the-art sub-task decomposers on both simulation and real-world tasks, showing robustness across diverse settings.

Conclusion: Retrieval-based decomposition reduces reliance on manual or heuristic sub-task annotations and better aligns sub-task boundaries with the low-level policy data, improving long-horizon manipulation performance; code and results are available at the project site.

Abstract: To tackle long-horizon tasks, recent hierarchical vision-language-action
(VLAs) frameworks employ vision-language model (VLM)-based planners to
decompose complex manipulation tasks into simpler sub-tasks that low-level
visuomotor policies can easily handle. Typically, the VLM planner is finetuned
to learn to decompose a target task. This finetuning requires target task
demonstrations segmented into sub-tasks by either human annotation or heuristic
rules. However, the heuristic subtasks can deviate significantly from the
training data of the visuomotor policy, which degrades task performance. To
address these issues, we propose a Retrieval-based Demonstration Decomposer
(RDD) that automatically decomposes demonstrations into sub-tasks by aligning
the visual features of the decomposed sub-task intervals with those from the
training data of the low-level visuomotor policies. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art sub-task decomposer on both simulation and real-world tasks,
demonstrating robustness across diverse settings. Code and more results are

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Real-time, cross-platform Gaussian avatar system that animates directly on the GPU with parallel splat processing, enabling fast on-device 3D avatar creation from smartphone scans and ready-to-use avatars for social/metaverse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian Splatting offers high fidelity but is hampered by camera requirements, long pre-processing, or heavy GPUs; prior mesh conversion reduces fidelity. There is a demand for fast, on-device, high-fidelity avatars that can be animated in real time across platforms.

Method: Develops Instant Skinned Gaussian Avatars by aligning and animating Gaussian splats to a underlying skinned mesh via parallel per-splat processing, enabling real-time follow of mesh deformations; end-to-end pipeline from smartphone capture to on-device preprocessing, resulting in ~5 minutes total and ~30 seconds for avatar generation.

Result: Demonstrates real-time animation fidelity and speed; on-device preprocessing; fast five-minute pipeline with avatar generation in ~30 seconds; cross-platform compatibility; suitable for social/metaverse usage.

Conclusion: The approach preserves high fidelity of Gaussian-based rendering while achieving real-time performance and accessibility via mobile scanning and on-device processing; broad impact for avatar creation workflows in social/metaverse.

Abstract: We present Instant Skinned Gaussian Avatars, a real-time and cross-platform
3D avatar system. Many approaches have been proposed to animate Gaussian
Splatting, but they often require camera arrays, long preprocessing times, or
high-end GPUs. Some methods attempt to convert Gaussian Splatting into
mesh-based representations, achieving lightweight performance but sacrificing

### [139] [Decision Oriented Technique (DOTechnique): Finding Model Validity Through Decision-Maker Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13858)
*Raheleh Biglari,Joachim Denil*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DOTechnique determines model validity by comparing decision outcomes of surrogate and high-fidelity models to identify validity regions, enabling efficient validity search without predefined validity boundaries and leveraging domain constraints and symbolic reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model validity is critical for decision-making, yet traditional validity frames can be unavailable or insufficient. A method that links validity to decision consistency—rather than output similarity—can be more robust and applicable across domains, improving efficiency.

Method: Compare surrogate-model decisions with high-fidelity model decisions to assess decision equivalence. Use domain constraints and symbolic reasoning to prune the search space, avoiding reliance on explicit validity boundaries. Demonstrated on a highway lane-change system as a motivating case.

Result: DOTechnique offers a path to identify validity regions and reduce search space by focusing on decision consistency. The highway lane-change example illustrates its potential to reveal model validity driven by the decision-maker context and constraints, with improved computational efficiency.

Conclusion: A decision-consistency based framework for model validity complements traditional output-based approaches. By integrating domain constraints and symbolic reasoning, DOTechnique can uncover validity regions without explicit boundaries and align validity with decision-maker context.

Abstract: Model validity is as critical as the model itself, especially when guiding
decision-making processes. Traditional approaches often rely on predefined
validity frames, which may not always be available or sufficient. This paper
introduces the Decision Oriented Technique (DOTechnique), a novel method for
determining model validity based on decision consistency rather than output
similarity. By evaluating whether surrogate models lead to equivalent decisions
compared to high-fidelity models, DOTechnique enables efficient identification
of validity regions, even in the absence of explicit validity boundaries. The
approach integrates domain constraints and symbolic reasoning to narrow the
search space, enhancing computational efficiency. A highway lane change system
serves as a motivating example, demonstrating how DOTechnique can uncover the
validity region of a simulation model. The results highlight the potential of
the technique to support finding model validity through decision-maker context.

### [140] [Do Slides Help? Multi-modal Context for Automatic Transcription of Conference Talks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13979)
*Supriti Sinhamahapatra,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multimodal ASR using presentation slides reduces WER by ~34% overall and ~35% on domain terms via a benchmark, dataset augmentation, and multi-modal model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR neglects visual/contextual cues; slides provide domain-specific cues and aid disambiguation and adaptation in scientific presentations; lack of slide-aligned datasets motivates augmentation.

Method: Create a benchmark dataset for multimodal presentation transcription; analyze domain terminology automatically; augment data to simulate slide information; train a multimodal ASR model using augmented data.

Result: Achieves ~34% relative WER reduction overall and ~35% for domain terms versus baseline.

Conclusion: Integrating slide-level multimodal context substantially improves ASR performance on scientific talks; data augmentation is an effective approach to overcome dataset limitations.

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems primarily
rely on acoustic information while disregarding additional multi-modal context.
However, visual information are essential in disambiguation and adaptation.
While most work focus on speaker images to handle noise conditions, this work
also focuses on integrating presentation slides for the use cases of scientific
presentation.
  In a first step, we create a benchmark for multi-modal presentation including
an automatic analysis of transcribing domain-specific terminology. Next, we
explore methods for augmenting speech models with multi-modal information. We
mitigate the lack of datasets with accompanying slides by a suitable approach
of data augmentation. Finally, we train a model using the augmented dataset,
resulting in a relative reduction in word error rate of approximately 34%,
across all words and 35%, for domain-specific terms compared to the baseline
model.

### [141] [Do Large Language Models Show Biases in Causal Learning? Insights from Contingency Judgment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13985)
*María Victoria Carro,Denise Alejandra Mester,Francisca Gauna Selasco,Giovanni Franco Gabriel Marraffini,Mario Alejandro Leiva,Gerardo I. Simari,María Vanina Martinez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show an illusion of causality in a medical contingency task, inferring causal links in null scenarios—suggesting they reproduce causal language rather than possess true causal understanding; raises safety concerns for domains requiring accurate causal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether large language models exhibit human-like causal illusions and whether their causal inferences reflect genuine understanding or merely language patterns, addressing debates on LLM causality and reliability.

Method: Construct a dataset of 1,000 null-contingency scenarios in medical contexts and prompt multiple LLMs to judge the effectiveness of potential causes, assessing whether models ascribe causal efficacy where evidence is insufficient.

Result: All evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal relationships in null scenarios, indicating a strong illusion of causality across models.

Conclusion: Supports the view that LLMs reproduce causal-language patterns rather than exhibit true causal understanding; highlights risks in deploying LLMs for domains requiring precise causal reasoning and calls for safeguards and further research.

Abstract: Causal learning is the cognitive process of developing the capability of
making causal inferences based on available information, often guided by
normative principles. This process is prone to errors and biases, such as the
illusion of causality, in which people perceive a causal relationship between
two variables despite lacking supporting evidence. This cognitive bias has been
proposed to underlie many societal problems, including social prejudice,
stereotype formation, misinformation, and superstitious thinking. In this work,
we examine whether large language models are prone to developing causal
illusions when faced with a classic cognitive science paradigm: the contingency
judgment task. To investigate this, we constructed a dataset of 1,000 null
contingency scenarios (in which the available information is not sufficient to
establish a causal relationship between variables) within medical contexts and
prompted LLMs to evaluate the effectiveness of potential causes. Our findings
show that all evaluated models systematically inferred unwarranted causal
relationships, revealing a strong susceptibility to the illusion of causality.
While there is ongoing debate about whether LLMs genuinely understand causality
or merely reproduce causal language without true comprehension, our findings
support the latter hypothesis and raise concerns about the use of language
models in domains where accurate causal reasoning is essential for informed
decision-making.

### [142] [GammaZero: Learning To Guide POMDP Belief Space Search With Graph Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14035)
*Rajesh Mangannavar,Prasad Tadepalli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GammaZero presents an action-centric graph representation for POMDP planning that generalizes across problem sizes by transforming belief states into graphs learned via a graph neural network. It learns heuristics from small problems and guides Monte Carlo tree search on larger ones, achieving similar performance to BetaZero on small problems and zero-shot generalization to 2–4x larger problems with reduced search needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scalability and lack of cross-size generalization in domain-specific neural architectures for POMDP planning by introducing a unified graph-based belief representation that can transfer structural patterns from small to larger problems.

Method: Construct action-centric graphs from belief states; train a graph neural network with a decoder on expert demonstrations from small, tractable POMDPs to learn value functions and policies; apply these learned heuristics to guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger POMDP instances.

Result: GammaZero achieves comparable performance to BetaZero on same-sized problems and enables zero-shot generalization to problems 2–4 times larger, while reducing the search effort required to find high-quality solutions.

Conclusion: A graph-based, action-centric belief representation enables transferable planning heuristics for POMDPs, offering scalable generalization and improved efficiency over size-constrained, domain-specific architectures.

Abstract: We introduce an action-centric graph representation framework for learning to
guide planning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs).
Unlike existing approaches that require domain-specific neural architectures
and struggle with scalability, GammaZero leverages a unified graph-based belief
representation that enables generalization across problem sizes within a
domain. Our key insight is that belief states can be systematically transformed
into action-centric graphs where structural patterns learned on small problems
transfer to larger instances. We employ a graph neural network with a decoder
architecture to learn value functions and policies from expert demonstrations
on computationally tractable problems, then apply these learned heuristics to
guide Monte Carlo tree search on larger problems. Experimental results on
standard POMDP benchmarks demonstrate that GammaZero achieves comparable
performance to BetaZero when trained and tested on the same-sized problems,
while uniquely enabling zero-shot generalization to problems 2-4 times larger
than those seen during training, maintaining solution quality with reduced
search requirements.

### [143] [Position: Require Frontier AI Labs To Release Small "Analog" Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14053)
*Shriyash Upadhyay,Chaithanya Bandi,Narmeen Oozeer,Philip Quirke*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Policy proposal: require large AI labs to release small, open analog models trained similarly and distilled from their top proprietary models, to enable safety verification, interpretability, and transparency research while reducing regulatory burden and promoting innovation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety regulations for frontier AI risk stifling innovation; analog-open proxies can broaden safety research participation and help safety methods generalize to larger models, reducing the safety-innovation tradeoff and benefiting the public good.

Method: Mandate the release of scaled-down, openly accessible analog models and distillation pipelines from the largest proprietary models; ensure these analogs are trained similarly and distilled from the frontier models; leverage existing data and infrastructure; facilitate research in safety, interpretability, and transparency without exposing full-scale models.

Result: Analog models enable safety and interpretability research with methods that generalize to frontier models; wider participation reduces regulatory burden and accelerates safety progress; costs are kept minimal by reusing resources.

Conclusion: Deeper understanding of models can relax the safety-innovation tradeoff, enabling more safety and more innovation; the proposed policy could guide fundamental ML research and policy to balance safety and progress.

Abstract: Recent proposals for regulating frontier AI models have sparked concerns
about the cost of safety regulation, and most such regulations have been
shelved due to the safety-innovation tradeoff. This paper argues for an
alternative regulatory approach that ensures AI safety while actively promoting
innovation: mandating that large AI laboratories release small, openly
accessible analog models (scaled-down versions) trained similarly to and
distilled from their largest proprietary models.
  Analog models serve as public proxies, allowing broad participation in safety
verification, interpretability research, and algorithmic transparency without
forcing labs to disclose their full-scale models. Recent research demonstrates
that safety and interpretability methods developed using these smaller models
generalize effectively to frontier-scale systems. By enabling the wider
research community to directly investigate and innovate upon accessible
analogs, our policy substantially reduces the regulatory burden and accelerates
safety advancements.
  This mandate promises minimal additional costs, leveraging reusable resources
like data and infrastructure, while significantly contributing to the public
good. Our hope is not only that this policy be adopted, but that it illustrates
a broader principle supporting fundamental research in machine learning: deeper
understanding of models relaxes the safety-innovation tradeoff and lets us have
more of both.

### [144] [Generating Fair Consensus Statements with Social Choice on Token-Level MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14106)
*Carter Blair,Kate Larson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Models consensus statement generation with LLMs as a multi-objective token-level MDP where each agent's preference is an objective; introduces social-choice-inspired methods: (1) an ex-ante core guaranteed stochastic policy maximizing Nash welfare for proportional fairness, and (2) an egalitarian-welfare-driven search for a single statement; empirical results show improved worst-case agent alignment vs baselines like Habermas Machine.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current consensus-generation frameworks with large language models lack a formal structure to guarantee fairness when aggregating diverse, free-form opinions. A principled, verifiable fairness framework is needed.

Method: Formulate the problem as a multi-objective, token-level MDP; assign token-level rewards derived from each agent's policy; leverage the implicit optimal Q-functions of policies to quantify rewards. Propose two social-choice-based approaches: (a) an ex-ante core stochastic generation policy over complete statements maximizing Nash welfare for proportional fairness; (b) a single-statement egalitarian-welfare objective optimized via search in the MDP. Uses Nash Welfare and egalitarian welfare concepts; empirically instantiate agent policies with language models and evaluate.

Result: Empirical experiments show that egalitarian-welfare-guided search yields consensus statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baselines, including the Habermas Machine (Tessler et al., 2024).

Conclusion: Provides a formal, fair-consensus framework integrating social choice with MDP for text generation. Demonstrates two viable approaches: an ex-ante core, Nash-welfare-based stochastic policy for proportional fairness and a single-statement egalitarian-welfare search method, with empirical gains in worst-case alignment against baselines.

Abstract: Current frameworks for consensus statement generation with large language
models lack the inherent structure needed to provide provable fairness
guarantees when aggregating diverse free-form opinions. We model the task as a
multi-objective, token-level Markov Decision Process (MDP), where each
objective corresponds to an agent's preference. Token-level rewards for each
agent are derived from their policy (e.g., a personalized language model). This
approach utilizes the finding that such policies implicitly define optimal
Q-functions, providing a principled way to quantify rewards at each generation
step without a value function (Rafailov et al., 2024). This MDP formulation
creates a formal structure amenable to analysis using principles from social
choice theory. We propose two approaches grounded in social choice theory.
First, we propose a stochastic generation policy guaranteed to be in the
ex-ante core, extending core stability concepts from voting theory to text
generation. This policy is derived from an underlying distribution over
complete statements that maximizes proportional fairness (Nash Welfare).
Second, for generating a single statement, we target the maximization of
egalitarian welfare using search algorithms within the MDP framework.
Empirically, experiments using language models to instantiate agent policies
show that search guided by the egalitarian objective generates consensus
statements with improved worst-case agent alignment compared to baseline
methods, including the Habermas Machine (Tessler et al., 2024).

### [145] [STEMS: Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe Multi-Agent Coordination for Building Energy Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14112)
*Huiliang Zhang,Di Wu,Arnaud Zinflou,Benoit Boulet*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STEMS: a safety-constrained, spatial-temporal multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management that combines a GCN-Transformer based representation with Control Barrier Functions to ensure safety, achieving notable cost and emission reductions and greatly reducing safety violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the core challenges in multi-building energy management: limited exploitation of spatial-temporal information, absence of formal safety guarantees, and high system complexity that can hinder safe, scalable control across buildings.

Method: STEMS introduces a spatial-temporal graph learning component using a GCN-Transformer fusion to model inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, coupled with a safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm that incorporates Control Barrier Functions to guarantee safety.

Result: On real-world building datasets, STEMS yields 21% lower cost, 18% lower emissions, reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6%, and maintains comfort with a 0.13 discomfort proportion. It also shows robustness to extreme weather and effectiveness across different building types.

Conclusion: STEMS offers a safe, scalable, and effective solution for coordinated multi-building energy management by uniting advanced spatial-temporal representation learning with formal safety guarantees, delivering significant energy and safety improvements.

Abstract: Building energy management is essential for achieving carbon reduction goals,
improving occupant comfort, and reducing energy costs. Coordinated building
energy management faces critical challenges in exploiting spatial-temporal
dependencies while ensuring operational safety across multi-building systems.
Current multi-building energy systems face three key challenges: insufficient
spatial-temporal information exploitation, lack of rigorous safety guarantees,
and system complexity. This paper proposes Spatial-Temporal Enhanced Safe
Multi-Agent Coordination (STEMS), a novel safety-constrained multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework for coordinated building energy management.
STEMS integrates two core components: (1) a spatial-temporal graph
representation learning framework using a GCN-Transformer fusion architecture
to capture inter-building relationships and temporal patterns, and (2) a
safety-constrained multi-agent RL algorithm incorporating Control Barrier
Functions to provide mathematical safety guarantees. Extensive experiments on
real-world building datasets demonstrate STEMS's superior performance over
existing methods, showing that STEMS achieves 21% cost reduction, 18% emission
reduction, and dramatically reduces safety violations from 35.1% to 5.6% while
maintaining optimal comfort with only 0.13 discomfort proportion. The framework
also demonstrates strong robustness during extreme weather conditions and
maintains effectiveness across different building types.

### [146] [Formalizing the Safety, Security, and Functional Properties of Agentic AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14133)
*Edoardo Allegrini,Ananth Shreekumar,Z. Berkay Celik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A domain-agnostic formal framework for agentic AI systems using two foundational models (host agent and task lifecycle) with 31 temporal-logic properties enabling formal verification and safer coordination, addressing fragmentation in MCP/A2A.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inter-agent protocols in agentic AI are fragmented, creating semantic gaps that hinder rigorous analysis, risking misalignment, deadlocks, and security vulnerabilities in high-stakes tasks.

Method: Introduce two foundational models: the host agent model and the task lifecycle model; define 17 host-agent properties and 14 task-lifecycle properties; express them in temporal logic to enable formal verification; provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about multi-AI systems.

Result: Proposes the first rigorously grounded, domain-agnostic framework for analysis, design, and deployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems by formalizing properties and providing a verifiable structure.

Conclusion: Bridges fragmentation between inter-agent protocols, enables formal verification and edge-case detection, reduces deadlocks and security risks, and lays a foundation for safe, scalable deployment of agentic AI across domains.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems, which leverage multiple autonomous agents and Large
Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly used to address complex, multi-step
tasks. The safety, security, and functionality of these systems are critical,
especially in high-stakes applications. However, the current ecosystem of
inter-agent communication is fragmented, with protocols such as the Model
Context Protocol (MCP) for tool access and the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol
for coordination being analyzed in isolation. This fragmentation creates a
semantic gap that prevents the rigorous analysis of system properties and
introduces risks such as architectural misalignment and exploitable
coordination issues. To address these challenges, we introduce a modeling
framework for agentic AI systems composed of two foundational models. The
first, the host agent model, formalizes the top-level entity that interacts
with the user, decomposes tasks, and orchestrates their execution by leveraging
external agents and tools. The second, the task lifecycle model, details the
states and transitions of individual sub-tasks from creation to completion,
providing a fine-grained view of task management and error handling. Together,
these models provide a unified semantic framework for reasoning about the
behavior of multi-AI agent systems. Grounded in this framework, we define 17
properties for the host agent and 14 for the task lifecycle, categorized into
liveness, safety, completeness, and fairness. Expressed in temporal logic,
these properties enable formal verification of system behavior, detection of
coordination edge cases, and prevention of deadlocks and security
vulnerabilities. Through this effort, we introduce the first rigorously
grounded, domain-agnostic framework for the systematic analysis, design, and
deployment of correct, reliable, and robust agentic AI systems.

### [147] [A Multimodal Approach to Heritage Preservation in the Context of Climate Change](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14136)
*David Roqui,Adèle Cormier,nistor Grozavu,Ann Bourges*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A lightweight, data-efficient multimodal model fuses sensor data (temperature, humidity) with visual imagery using a streamlined PerceiverIO variant. It employs 64D latent encoders and an Adaptive Barlow Twins loss to promote inter-modal complementarity. On Strasbourg Cathedral data, it achieves 76.9% accuracy, outperforming standard multimodal architectures by 43% and vanilla PerceiverIO by 25%. Sensor-only and image-only baselines drop to 61.5% and 46.2%, respectively, indicating strong multimodal synergy. A medium correlation target (tau=0.3) balances alignment and complementarity, reaching 69.2% versus other taus. Concludes that simple architectures with contrastive regularization enable effective learning in data-scarce heritage monitoring contexts, supporting AI-driven conservation decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cultural heritage sites degrade under climate change and traditional unimodal monitoring misses the interactions between environmental stressors and material deterioration. There is a need for data-efficient, multimodal AI that works well with small datasets to aid conservation decisions.

Method: A lightweight multimodal architecture based on PerceiverIO with (i) 64D latent encoders to reduce overfitting on small datasets (n=37 training samples) and (ii) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that reduces redundancy and encourages complementarity between sensor and image modalities. The approach includes ablation studies and a systematic hyperparameter search, particularly for the correlation target tau.

Result: Achieves 76.9% accuracy on Strasbourg Cathedral data, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal baselines (VisualBERT, Transformer) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO. Sensor-only 61.5% accuracy; image-only 46.2%. Moderate tau (0.3) yields 69.2% accuracy, outperforming other taus (0.1, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9) which range from 53.8% to 61.5%.

Conclusion: Architectural simplicity combined with contrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce heritage monitoring contexts and offers a foundation for AI-driven conservation decision support systems.

Abstract: Cultural heritage sites face accelerating degradation due to climate change,
yet tradi- tional monitoring relies on unimodal analysis (visual inspection or
environmental sen- sors alone) that fails to capture the complex interplay
between environmental stres- sors and material deterioration. We propose a
lightweight multimodal architecture that fuses sensor data (temperature,
humidity) with visual imagery to predict degradation severity at heritage
sites. Our approach adapts PerceiverIO with two key innovations: (1) simplified
encoders (64D latent space) that prevent overfitting on small datasets (n=37
training samples), and (2) Adaptive Barlow Twins loss that encourages modality
complementarity rather than redundancy. On data from Strasbourg Cathedral, our
model achieves 76.9% accu- racy, a 43% improvement over standard multimodal
architectures (VisualBERT, Trans- former) and 25% over vanilla PerceiverIO.
Ablation studies reveal that sensor-only achieves 61.5% while image-only
reaches 46.2%, confirming successful multimodal synergy. A systematic
hyperparameter study identifies an optimal moderate correlation target ({\tau}
=0.3) that balances align- ment and complementarity, achieving 69.2% accuracy
compared to other {\tau} values ({\tau} =0.1/0.5/0.7: 53.8%, {\tau} =0.9:
61.5%). This work demonstrates that architectural sim- plicity combined with
contrastive regularization enables effective multimodal learning in data-scarce
heritage monitoring contexts, providing a foundation for AI-driven con-
servation decision support systems.

### [148] [CodeEvolve: An open source evolutionary coding agent for algorithm discovery and optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14150)
*Henrique Assumpção,Diego Ferreira,Leandro Campos,Fabricio Murai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CodeEvolve is an open-source framework that combines LLMs with island-based genetic algorithms to solve complex computational problems, featuring an inspiration-based crossover using the LLM's context window and meta-prompting for dynamic exploration. It claims to outperform AlphaEvolve on several benchmarks and is released as open source.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce CodeEvolve, an open-source evolutionary coding
agent that unites Large Language Models (LLMs) with genetic algorithms to solve
complex computational problems. Our framework adapts powerful evolutionary
concepts to the LLM domain, building upon recent methods for generalized
scientific discovery. CodeEvolve employs an island-based genetic algorithm to
maintain population diversity and increase throughput, introduces a novel
inspiration-based crossover mechanism that leverages the LLMs context window to
combine features from successful solutions, and implements meta-prompting
strategies for dynamic exploration of the solution space. We conduct a rigorous
evaluation of CodeEvolve on a subset of the mathematical benchmarks used to
evaluate Google DeepMind's closed-source AlphaEvolve. Our findings show that
our method surpasses AlphaEvolve's performance on several challenging problems.
To foster collaboration and accelerate progress, we release our complete
framework as an open-source repository.

### [149] [Combining Reinforcement Learning and Behavior Trees for NPCs in Video Games with AMD Schola](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14154)
*Tian Liu,Alex Cann,Ian Colbert,Mehdi Saeedi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This paper proposes combining reinforcement learning with behavior trees (BTs) for game AI, demonstrates viability using AMD Schola in Unreal Engine to train multi-task NPCs in a Last of Us–like environment, and offers detailed joint-training methodologies and showcases skills.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL adoption in commercial games is slow; BTs are widely used by practitioners but lack seamless integration with learning-based methods. Bridging RL with traditional BTs can leverage the strengths of both paradigms and accelerate industry adoption.

Method: Using the AMD Schola plugin for Unreal Engine to train RL agents; constructing multi-task NPCs in a complex 3D environment inspired by The Last of Us; developing and presenting detailed methodologies for jointly training RL models with BTs and validating by showcasing multiple skills.

Result: The work demonstrates the viability of the BT+RL approach in a practical game-engine setting, showing that multi-task NPCs can be trained and executed within a BT-guided framework and expanding the skill repertoire demonstrated by the agents.

Conclusion: BT+RL intersection is a promising and under-explored area for game AI. The paper argues for more practical exploration and provides concrete methodologies and a demonstrable pipeline (via AMD Schola in Unreal) to bridge research and industry deployment.

Abstract: While the rapid advancements in the reinforcement learning (RL) research
community have been remarkable, the adoption in commercial video games remains
slow. In this paper, we outline common challenges the Game AI community faces
when using RL-driven NPCs in practice, and highlight the intersection of RL
with traditional behavior trees (BTs) as a crucial juncture to be explored
further. Although the BT+RL intersection has been suggested in several research
papers, its adoption is rare. We demonstrate the viability of this approach
using AMD Schola -- a plugin for training RL agents in Unreal Engine -- by
creating multi-task NPCs in a complex 3D environment inspired by the commercial
video game ``The Last of Us". We provide detailed methodologies for jointly
training RL models with BTs while showcasing various skills.

### [150] [JEDA: Query-Free Clinical Order Search from Ambient Dialogues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14169)
*Praphul Singh,Corey Barrett,Sumana Srivasta,Amitabh Saikia,Irfan Bulu,Sri Gadde,Krishnaram Kenthapadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JEDA is a domain-initialized bi-encoder that retrieves canonical clinical orders using both direct commands and ambient dialogue, featuring a query-free mode that encodes a short dialogue window. It outperforms baselines and enables real-time, interpretable retrieval without LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical conversations mix explicit directives with implicit reasoning; current LLM-rewriting approaches add latency, instability, and opacity, hindering real-time ordering. A fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval layer is needed to map intents to orders in real time while handling ASR/disfluencies.

Method: A domain-initialized bi-encoder (from PubMedBERT) that retrieves canonical orders. A query-free mode encodes a short rolling window of ambient dialogue to trigger retrieval. Fine-tuned with a duplicate-safe contrastive objective. Training uses constrained LLM guidance to tie each signed order to multiple formulations (command-only, context-only, command+context, context+reasoning) to improve inter-order separation and coupling. The approach yields noise-resilient, real-time retrieval.

Result: JEDA achieves large gains and substantially outperforms its base encoder and several open embedders (Linq Embed Mistral, SFR Embedding, GTE Qwen, BGE large, Embedding Gemma). It provides a fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval layer that links ambient context to actionable clinical orders in real time.

Conclusion: JEDA offers a fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval solution that directly links ambient clinical dialogue to actionable orders, reducing reliance on large language models while enabling real-time decision support.

Abstract: Clinical conversations mix explicit directives (order a chest X-ray) with
implicit reasoning (the cough worsened overnight, we should check for
pneumonia). Many systems rely on LLM rewriting, adding latency, instability,
and opacity that hinder real-time ordering. We present JEDA (Joint Embedding
for Direct and Ambient clinical orders), a domain-initialized bi-encoder that
retrieves canonical orders directly and, in a query-free mode, encodes a short
rolling window of ambient dialogue to trigger retrieval. Initialized from
PubMedBERT and fine-tuned with a duplicate-safe contrastive objective, JEDA
aligns heterogeneous expressions of intent to shared order concepts. Training
uses constrained LLM guidance to tie each signed order to complementary
formulations (command only, context only, command+context, context+reasoning),
producing clearer inter-order separation, tighter query extendash order
coupling, and stronger generalization. The query-free mode is noise-resilient,
reducing sensitivity to disfluencies and ASR errors by conditioning on a short
window rather than a single utterance. Deployed in practice, JEDA yields large
gains and substantially outperforms its base encoder and recent open embedders
(Linq Embed Mistral, SFR Embedding, GTE Qwen, BGE large, Embedding Gemma). The
result is a fast, interpretable, LLM-free retrieval layer that links ambient
context to actionable clinical orders in real time.

### [151] [ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation Models for Compositional Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14176)
*Roger Creus Castanyer,Faisal Mohamed,Pablo Samuel Castro,Cyrus Neary,Glen Berseth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARM-FM automates reward design for reinforcement learning by generating reward machines from natural language specifications using foundation models. It uses RM states with language embeddings for task-generalization and demonstrates zero-shot transfer across diverse environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward specification in RL is brittle and hard to do well across tasks. The authors aim to make reward design more robust, interpretable, and transferable by combining formal automata-based reward machines with the general reasoning capabilities of foundation models.

Method: Foundation models are prompted to produce reward machines (RMs) from natural language task descriptions. Each RM state is tied to a language embedding to enable cross-task generalization. The RM formalism provides a structured, compositional RL objective, and the framework integrates these RMs into RL training, enabling automated and natural-language-based reward design.

Result: Empirical evaluation across a diverse set of challenging environments shows ARM-FM improves performance and provides evidence of zero-shot generalization to new tasks without additional RM design.

Conclusion: Automating reward design with ARM-FM, via foundation models and reward machines, offers a scalable path to robust, interpretable, and transferable RL objectives that generalize across tasks and domains.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are highly sensitive to reward
function specification, which remains a central challenge limiting their broad
applicability. We present ARM-FM: Automated Reward Machines via Foundation
Models, a framework for automated, compositional reward design in RL that
leverages the high-level reasoning capabilities of foundation models (FMs).
Reward machines (RMs) -- an automata-based formalism for reward specification
-- are used as the mechanism for RL objective specification, and are
automatically constructed via the use of FMs. The structured formalism of RMs
yields effective task decompositions, while the use of FMs enables objective
specifications in natural language. Concretely, we (i) use FMs to automatically
generate RMs from natural language specifications; (ii) associate language
embeddings with each RM automata-state to enable generalization across tasks;
and (iii) provide empirical evidence of ARM-FM's effectiveness in a diverse
suite of challenging environments, including evidence of zero-shot
generalization.

### [153] [Echoes of Human Malice in Agents: Benchmarking LLMs for Multi-Turn Online Harassment Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14207)
*Trilok Padhi,Pinxian Lu,Abdulkadir Erol,Tanmay Sutar,Gauri Sharma,Mina Sonmez,Munmun De Choudhury,Ugur Kursuncu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The Online Harassment Agentic Benchmark provides a multi-turn, theory-grounded framework (synthetic dialogue, agent-based simulations, and jailbreak methods) to study LLM harassment, revealing high vulnerability to tuning and highlighting the need for stronger guardrails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior jailbreak work focused on single-turn prompts; real harassment evolves over multiple turns. This work aims to understand vulnerabilities in LLMs across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and to study the dynamics of harassment via multi-turn interactions.

Method: Four-part design: (i) synthetic multi-turn harassment dataset; (ii) multi-agent simulation (harasser/victim) guided by repeated game theory; (iii) three jailbreak methods attacking memory, planning, and fine-tuning; (iv) mixed-methods evaluation framework; experiments with LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed).

Result: Attack success rates rise dramatically with jailbreak tuning: LLaMA 95.78–96.89% vs 57.25–64.19% without tuning; Gemini 99.33% vs 98.46% without tuning. Refusal rate drops to 1–2% in both models. Toxic behaviors: Insult 84.9–87.8% (vs 44.2–50.8% without tuning); Flaming 81.2–85.1% (vs 31.5–38.8% without tuning); sexual/racial harassment less prominent (weaker guardrails for these). Qualitative findings show attacked agents adopting human-like aggression (Machiavellian/psychopathic planning; narcissism with memory). Escalation trajectories differ between open vs closed models, with closed-source models more vulnerable.

Conclusion: Multi-turn, theory-grounded attacks can achieve high success and reproduce human-like harassment dynamics, underscoring the need for robust safety guardrails that address memory, planning, and tuning vulnerabilities in online LLM deployments.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are powering a growing share of interactive
web applications, yet remain vulnerable to misuse and harm. Prior jailbreak
research has largely focused on single-turn prompts, whereas real harassment
often unfolds over multi-turn interactions. In this work, we present the Online
Harassment Agentic Benchmark consisting of: (i) a synthetic multi-turn
harassment conversation dataset, (ii) a multi-agent (e.g., harasser, victim)
simulation informed by repeated game theory, (iii) three jailbreak methods
attacking agents across memory, planning, and fine-tuning, and (iv) a
mixed-methods evaluation framework. We utilize two prominent LLMs,
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct (open-source) and Gemini-2.0-flash (closed-source). Our
results show that jailbreak tuning makes harassment nearly guaranteed with an
attack success rate of 95.78--96.89% vs. 57.25--64.19% without tuning in Llama,
and 99.33% vs. 98.46% without tuning in Gemini, while sharply reducing refusal
rate to 1-2% in both models. The most prevalent toxic behaviors are Insult with
84.9--87.8% vs. 44.2--50.8% without tuning, and Flaming with 81.2--85.1% vs.
31.5--38.8% without tuning, indicating weaker guardrails compared to sensitive
categories such as sexual or racial harassment. Qualitative evaluation further
reveals that attacked agents reproduce human-like aggression profiles, such as
Machiavellian/psychopathic patterns under planning, and narcissistic tendencies
with memory. Counterintuitively, closed-source and open-source models exhibit
distinct escalation trajectories across turns, with closed-source models
showing significant vulnerability. Overall, our findings show that multi-turn
and theory-grounded attacks not only succeed at high rates but also mimic
human-like harassment dynamics, motivating the development of robust safety
guardrails to ultimately keep online platforms safe and responsible.

*Jiayu Wang,Yifei Ming,Riya Dulepet,Qinglin Chen,Austin Xu,Zixuan Ke,Frederic Sala,Aws Albarghouthi,Caiming Xiong,Shafiq Joty*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LiveResearchBench and DeepEval provide a rigorous, up-to-date benchmark and evaluation suite for citation-grounded deep research, covering 100 tasks across domains and 17 frontier systems to enable fair, multi-source web-search synthesis evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks fail to capture user-centric, dynamic, unambiguous, and multi-source search realities needed to assess agentic deep-research capabilities that produce long-form, citation-grounded reports.

Method: Develop LiveResearchBench with 100 expert-curated tasks spanning daily life, enterprise, and academia, demanding extensive real-time web search and synthesis; accumulate 1,500+ hours of human labor; develop DeepEval—a four-protocol evaluation suite assessing content quality, report quality, coverage, presentation, citation accuracy/association, consistency, and depth; evaluate 17 frontier deep-research systems (single-agent web search, single-agent deep research, and multi-agent).

Result: Comprehensive evaluation reveals strengths, recurring failure modes, and key system components needed to advance reliable, insightful deep research.

Conclusion: LiveResearchBench and DeepEval establish a rigorous basis for systematic evaluation of frontier deep-research systems, enabling fair comparisons and guiding the design and improvement of reliable, insightful long-form, citation-grounded research.

Abstract: Deep research -- producing comprehensive, citation-grounded reports by
searching and synthesizing information from hundreds of live web sources --
marks an important frontier for agentic systems. To rigorously evaluate this
ability, four principles are essential: tasks should be (1) user-centric,
reflecting realistic information needs, (2) dynamic, requiring up-to-date
information beyond parametric knowledge, (3) unambiguous, ensuring consistent
interpretation across users, and (4) multi-faceted and search-intensive,
requiring search over numerous web sources and in-depth analysis. Existing
benchmarks fall short of these principles, often focusing on narrow domains or
posing ambiguous questions that hinder fair comparison. Guided by these
principles, we introduce LiveResearchBench, a benchmark of 100 expert-curated
tasks spanning daily life, enterprise, and academia, each requiring extensive,
dynamic, real-time web search and synthesis. Built with over 1,500 hours of
human labor, LiveResearchBench provides a rigorous basis for systematic
evaluation. To evaluate citation-grounded long-form reports, we introduce
DeepEval, a comprehensive suite covering both content- and report-level
quality, including coverage, presentation, citation accuracy and association,
consistency and depth of analysis. DeepEval integrates four complementary
evaluation protocols, each designed to ensure stable assessment and high
agreement with human judgments. Using LiveResearchBench and DeepEval, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier deep research systems,
including single-agent web search, single-agent deep research, and multi-agent
systems. Our analysis reveals current strengths, recurring failure modes, and
key system components needed to advance reliable, insightful deep research.

### [155] [Towards Agentic Self-Learning LLMs in Search Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14253)
*Wangtao Sun,Xiang Cheng,Jialin Fan,Yao Xu,Xing Yu,Shizhu He,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ASL (Agentic Self-Learning) is a fully closed-loop RL framework for open-domain agents that uses a Generative Reward Model and co-evolution of task data and rewards to achieve scalable self-improvement, outperforming RLVR baselines and showing robustness with zero-labeled data; highlights GRM verification as bottleneck and the benefits of continual GRM training and occasional real data injections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable scalable self-learning of LLM-based agents without human-curated datasets or hand-crafted rewards; address reliance on rigid rule-based signals and limited data in open-domain agent training.

Method: ASL unifies a Prompt Generator, a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model in a shared tool environment and LLM backbone, enabling multi-role reinforcement learning: task generation, policy execution, and evaluation. It features co-evolution of GRM with the policy, synthetic task data expansion, and controlled experiments comparing GRM rewards to rule-based signals, including zero-labeled-data conditions and analysis of verification bottlenecks.

Result: GRM-derived rewards outperform rigid rule-based signals; co-evolution with the policy boosts performance; increasing task data volume (even synthetic) substantially improves capabilities; ASL achieves steady round-over-round gains and outperforms strong RLVR baselines that plateau; robustness under zero-labeled-data; GRM verification capacity is the main bottleneck—freezing leads to reward hacking; continual GRM training mitigates this; adding real verification data late-stage raises performance ceiling.

Conclusion: Reward source (GRM) and data scale are critical levers for open-domain agent learning. Multi-role co-evolution is effective for scalable, self-improving agents. The study emphasizes continuous GRM training and targeted real-data injections to sustain progress and avoid reward hacking; data/code are released for reproducibility.

Abstract: We study whether self-learning can scale LLM-based agents without relying on
human-curated datasets or predefined rule-based rewards. Through controlled
experiments in a search-agent setting, we identify two key determinants of
scalable agent training: the source of reward signals and the scale of agent
task data. We find that rewards from a Generative Reward Model (GRM) outperform
rigid rule-based signals for open-domain learning, and that co-evolving the GRM
with the policy further boosts performance. Increasing the volume of agent task
data-even when synthetically generated-substantially enhances agentic
capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{Agentic
Self-Learning} (ASL), a fully closed-loop, multi-role reinforcement learning
framework that unifies task generation, policy execution, and evaluation within
a shared tool environment and LLM backbone. ASL coordinates a Prompt Generator,
a Policy Model, and a Generative Reward Model to form a virtuous cycle of
harder task setting, sharper verification, and stronger solving. Empirically,
ASL delivers steady, round-over-round gains, surpasses strong RLVR baselines
(e.g., Search-R1) that plateau or degrade, and continues improving under
zero-labeled-data conditions, indicating superior sample efficiency and
robustness. We further show that GRM verification capacity is the main
bottleneck: if frozen, it induces reward hacking and stalls progress; continual
GRM training on the evolving data distribution mitigates this, and a small
late-stage injection of real verification data raises the performance ceiling.
This work establishes reward source and data scale as critical levers for
open-domain agent learning and demonstrates the efficacy of multi-role
co-evolution for scalable, self-improving agents. The data and code of this
paper are released at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MorphoBench is an adaptive, multidisciplinary reasoning benchmark for large models that dynamically adjusts question difficulty via reasoning traces and simulation-generated items; it contains 1,300+ questions and releases code for reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reasoning benchmarks are static, narrow in scope, and fail to track model progress as reasoning capabilities evolve. There is a need for a flexible, comprehensive benchmark that can calibrate difficulty and guide robust improvement of large models.

Method: MorphoBench curates complex questions from existing benchmarks and Olympiad-level sources; it adaptively increases challenge using key statements produced during model reasoning; it includes simulations-based questions enabling dynamic difficulty with low resource use; iterative evaluation and adjustment were performed using models like o3 and GPT-5; the project releases code.

Result: A dynamic benchmark with 1,300+ test questions and an adaptive difficulty mechanism, offering more comprehensive and valid evaluation of model reasoning; it provides guidance for improving reasoning capabilities and scientific robustness of large models; code is publicly released.

Conclusion: MorphoBench advances the validity and comprehensiveness of reasoning evaluation for large models and serves as a practical tool for researchers to benchmark, diagnose, and improve reasoning abilities.

Abstract: With the advancement of powerful large-scale reasoning models, effectively
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of these models has become increasingly
important. However, existing benchmarks designed to assess the reasoning
abilities of large models tend to be limited in scope and lack the flexibility
to adapt their difficulty according to the evolving reasoning capacities of the
models. To address this, we propose MorphoBench, a benchmark that incorporates
multidisciplinary questions to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of large
models and can adjust and update question difficulty based on the reasoning
abilities of advanced models. Specifically, we curate the benchmark by
selecting and collecting complex reasoning questions from existing benchmarks
and sources such as Olympiad-level competitions. Additionally, MorphoBench
adaptively modifies the analytical challenge of questions by leveraging key
statements generated during the model's reasoning process. Furthermore, it
includes questions generated using simulation software, enabling dynamic
adjustment of benchmark difficulty with minimal resource consumption. We have
gathered over 1,300 test questions and iteratively adjusted the difficulty of
MorphoBench based on the reasoning capabilities of models such as o3 and GPT-5.
MorphoBench enhances the comprehensiveness and validity of model reasoning
evaluation, providing reliable guidance for improving both the reasoning
abilities and scientific robustness of large models. The code has been released
in https://github.com/OpenDCAI/MorphoBench.

### [157] [A Guardrail for Safety Preservation: When Safety-Sensitive Subspace Meets Harmful-Resistant Null-Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14301)
*Bingjie Zhang,Yibo Yang,Renzhe,Dandan Guo,Jindong Gu,Philip Torr,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GuardSpace preserves safety alignment during fine-tuning by separating safety-relevant and safety-irrelevant weight subspaces via covariance-preconditioned SVD, then initializes adapters from the safety-irrelevant subspace and freezes safety-relevant components, plus a null-space projector to prevent updates from producing harmful outputs. This yields better safety and accuracy, e.g., on Llama-2-7B-Chat fine-tuned with GSM8K, reducing harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6% and increasing accuracy from 26.0% to 28.0% (vs. AsFT).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety alignment of LLMs degrades during fine-tuning even with benign data or low-rank adaptations. A mechanism is needed to preserve safety mechanisms while adapting to downstream tasks.

Method: Decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and safety-irrelevant subspaces using covariance-preconditioned SVD. Initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant subspace and freeze safety-relevant components. Build a null-space projector to constrain adapter updates so they do not alter safe outputs on harmful prompts.

Result: GuardSpace achieves superior performance across models/tasks, notably reducing harmful outputs and improving task accuracy; in a cited case, harmful rate drops from 14.4% to 3.6%, while accuracy rises from 26.0% to 28.0% compared to a prior method (AsFT).

Conclusion: GuardSpace effectively preserves safety alignment during fine-tuning by preserving safety subspaces and constraining updates, offering measurable safety and accuracy gains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in diverse
tasks, yet their safety alignment remains fragile during adaptation. Even when
fine-tuning on benign data or with low-rank adaptation, pre-trained safety
behaviors are easily degraded, leading to harmful responses in the fine-tuned
models. To address this challenge, we propose GuardSpace, a guardrail framework
for preserving safety alignment throughout fine-tuning, composed of two key
components: a safety-sensitive subspace and a harmful-resistant null space.
First, we explicitly decompose pre-trained weights into safety-relevant and
safety-irrelevant components using covariance-preconditioned singular value
decomposition, and initialize low-rank adapters from the safety-irrelevant
ones, while freezing safety-relevant components to preserve their associated
safety mechanism. Second, we construct a null space projector that restricts
adapter updates from altering safe outputs on harmful prompts, thereby
maintaining the original refusal behavior. Experiments with various pre-trained
models on multiple downstream tasks demonstrate that GuardSpace achieves
superior performance over existing methods. Notably, for Llama-2-7B-Chat
fine-tuned on GSM8K, GuardSpace outperforms the state-of-the-art method AsFT,
reducing the average harmful score from 14.4% to 3.6%, while improving the
accuracy from from 26.0% to 28.0%.

*Mason Nakamura,Abhinav Kumar,Saaduddin Mahmud,Sahar Abdelnabi,Shlomo Zilberstein,Eugene Bagdasarian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Terrarium is a configurable blackboard-based testbed to study safety, privacy, and security in LLM-powered multi-agent systems, identifying key attack vectors and enabling rapid defense prototyping across multiple scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLM-powered MAS automate collaboration tasks, they introduce risks (misalignment, malicious agents, data leakage, data poisoning). A modular, testable platform is needed to study and defend these systems.

Method: Repurpose the blackboard design into a modular, configurable MAS testbed; identify attack vectors (misalignment, malicious agents, compromised communication, data poisoning); implement three collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks; provide tooling to prototype, evaluate, and iterate defenses and designs.

Result: Demonstrates framework flexibility and rapid prototype/evaluation capabilities; supports testing across three scenarios and four attacks; establishes a platform for developing defenses.

Conclusion: Terrarium accelerates progress toward trustworthy LLM-based MAS by enabling focused safety, privacy, and security research through a configurable testbed.

Abstract: A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs) can
automate tedious user tasks such as meeting scheduling that requires
inter-agent collaboration. LLMs enable nuanced protocols that account for
unstructured private data, user constraints, and preferences. However, this
design introduces new risks, including misalignment and attacks by malicious
parties that compromise agents or steal user data. In this paper, we propose
the Terrarium framework for fine-grained study on safety, privacy, and security
in LLM-based MAS. We repurpose the blackboard design, an early approach in
multi-agent systems, to create a modular, configurable testbed for multi-agent
collaboration. We identify key attack vectors such as misalignment, malicious
agents, compromised communication, and data poisoning. We implement three
collaborative MAS scenarios with four representative attacks to demonstrate the
framework's flexibility. By providing tools to rapidly prototype, evaluate, and
iterate on defenses and designs, Terrarium aims to accelerate progress toward
trustworthy multi-agent systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MASC is a metacognitive framework that detects and corrects step-level errors in multi-agent systems in real time, using history-conditioned anomaly scoring via next-step reconstruction and prototype-guided stabilization, with a correction agent to mitigate error propagation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAS excel at collaborative problem solving but are brittle to cascading errors; there is a need for unsupervised, real-time, step-level error detection and self-correction to improve robustness with low overhead.

Method: Two designs: (1) Next-Execution Reconstruction predicts the embedding of the next step from history to enforce causal consistency; (2) Prototype-Guided Enhancement learns a prototype prior over normal-step embeddings to stabilize reconstruction and anomaly scoring in sparse contexts; when an anomaly is detected, a correction agent revises the acting agent's output before downstream use.

Result: On the Who&When benchmark, MASC improves step-level error detection (AUC-ROC) by up to 8.47% over baselines; when integrated into diverse MAS frameworks, it yields consistent end-to-end gains with minimal overhead.

Conclusion: Metacognitive monitoring plus targeted correction can mitigate error propagation in MAS with limited computational overhead.

Abstract: Large Language Model based multi-agent systems (MAS) excel at collaborative
problem solving but remain brittle to cascading errors: a single faulty step
can propagate across agents and disrupt the trajectory. In this paper, we
present MASC, a metacognitive framework that endows MAS with real-time,
unsupervised, step-level error detection and self-correction. MASC rethinks
detection as history-conditioned anomaly scoring via two complementary designs:
(1) Next-Execution Reconstruction, which predicts the embedding of the next
step from the query and interaction history to capture causal consistency, and
(2) Prototype-Guided Enhancement, which learns a prototype prior over
normal-step embeddings and uses it to stabilize reconstruction and anomaly
scoring under sparse context (e.g., early steps). When an anomaly step is
flagged, MASC triggers a correction agent to revise the acting agent's output
before information flows downstream. On the Who&When benchmark, MASC
consistently outperforms all baselines, improving step-level error detection by
up to 8.47% AUC-ROC ; When plugged into diverse MAS frameworks, it delivers
consistent end-to-end gains across architectures, confirming that our
metacognitive monitoring and targeted correction can mitigate error propagation
with minimal overhead.

TL;DR: Proposes AI4Service and Alpha-Service: a proactive, real-time assistant framework for egocentric AI glasses that detects opportunities and provides personalized services, demonstrated via a multi-agent prototype across real-time scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI services are largely reactive and command-driven. A truly intelligent assistant should anticipate user needs, intervene proactively when appropriate, and operate seamlessly in daily life. The work aims to close the gap between perception, decision, and action with personalization.

Method: Introduce Alpha-Service, a five-component architecture (Input Unit, Central Processing Unit, Arithmetic Logic Unit, Memory Unit, Output Unit) inspired by von Neumann architecture; detect opportunities from egocentric video to know when to intervene; provide both generalized and personalized services; implement as a multi-agent system on AI glasses; validate via case studies (real-time Blackjack advisor, museum tour guide, shopping fit assistant).

Result: Demonstrates capable perception, intent inference, and timely assistance without explicit prompts; showcases feasibility of proactive, context-aware AI in daily life through a unified framework and practical instantiation.

Conclusion: Alpha-Service offers a unified solution to proactive AI in everyday settings by tackling when to intervene and how to provide services, enabling seamless human–AI collaboration. Future work should address scalability, safety, privacy, and broader deployment challenges.

Abstract: In an era where AI is evolving from a passive tool into an active and
adaptive companion, we introduce AI for Service (AI4Service), a new paradigm
that enables proactive and real-time assistance in daily life. Existing AI
services remain largely reactive, responding only to explicit user commands. We
argue that a truly intelligent and helpful assistant should be capable of
anticipating user needs and taking actions proactively when appropriate. To
realize this vision, we propose Alpha-Service, a unified framework that
addresses two fundamental challenges: Know When to intervene by detecting
service opportunities from egocentric video streams, and Know How to provide
both generalized and personalized services. Inspired by the von Neumann
computer architecture and based on AI glasses, Alpha-Service consists of five
key components: an Input Unit for perception, a Central Processing Unit for
task scheduling, an Arithmetic Logic Unit for tool utilization, a Memory Unit
for long-term personalization, and an Output Unit for natural human
interaction. As an initial exploration, we implement Alpha-Service through a
multi-agent system deployed on AI glasses. Case studies, including a real-time
Blackjack advisor, a museum tour guide, and a shopping fit assistant,
demonstrate its ability to seamlessly perceive the environment, infer user
intent, and provide timely and useful assistance without explicit prompts.

### [161] [Can MLLMs Absorb Math Reasoning Abilities from LLMs as Free Lunch?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14387)
*Yijie Hu,Zihao Zhou,Kaizhu Huang,Xiaowei Huang,Qiufeng Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A tuning-free IP-Merging method that transfers math reasoning from a Math LLM to a multi-modal LLM by locating reasoning-related parameters in both models, projecting into the MLLM subspace to preserve alignment, and merging there to boost math reasoning without hurting other capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Math reasoning in multi-modal LLMs lags behind pure LLMs. Prior model-merging approaches ignore alignment between the LLM and the vision-enabled MLLM, leading to poor transfer due to parameter-space gaps. The aim is to absorb math reasoning from off-the-shelf Math LLMs without fine-tuning.

Method: Identify reasoning-associated parameters in both the MLLM and the Math LLM, project these parameters into the MLLM's subspace to maintain alignment, and then merge them within that subspace. The method is tuning-free since it directly adjusts parameters rather than training.

Result: Extensive experiments show that IP-Merging can enhance the math reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising their other capabilities.

Conclusion: IP-Merging provides a tuning-free mechanism to transfer math reasoning from Math LLMs to MLLMs by aligning and constraining the parameter merge to the MLLM subspace, addressing cross-model alignment gaps and improving math reasoning without degrading other functions.

Abstract: Math reasoning has been one crucial ability of large language models (LLMs),
where significant advancements have been achieved in recent years. However,
most efforts focus on LLMs by curating high-quality annotation data and
intricate training (or inference) paradigms, while the math reasoning
performance of multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remains lagging behind. Since the MLLM
typically consists of an LLM and a vision block, we wonder: Can MLLMs directly
absorb math reasoning abilities from off-the-shelf math LLMs without tuning?
Recent model-merging approaches may offer insights into this question. However,
they overlook the alignment between the MLLM and LLM, where we find that there
is a large gap between their parameter spaces, resulting in lower performance.
Our empirical evidence reveals two key factors behind this issue: the
identification of crucial reasoning-associated layers in the model and the
mitigation of the gaps in parameter space. Based on the empirical insights, we
propose IP-Merging that first identifies the reasoning-associated parameters in
both MLLM and Math LLM, then projects them into the subspace of MLLM, aiming to
maintain the alignment, and finally merges parameters in this subspace.
IP-Merging is a tuning-free approach since parameters are directly adjusted.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our IP-Merging method can enhance the
math reasoning ability of MLLMs directly from Math LLMs without compromising
their other capabilities.

TL;DR: Hi-Agent: a hierarchical vision-language agent for mobile control with subgoal planning and foresight-guided training, achieving SOTA on Android-in-the-Wild and strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLM-based mobile control relies on direct state-to-action mappings, lacking structured reasoning and planning, hindering generalization to new tasks and unseen UI layouts.

Method: A two-level model (high-level reasoning + low-level action) trained jointly; reformulate multi-step decisions as single-step subgoals; introduce a foresight advantage using low-level feedback to guide high-level optimization; critic-free stable training; mitigates path explosion in GRPO.

Result: State-of-the-art 87.9% task success on Android-in-the-Wild (AitW), outperforming AppAgent (17.7%), Filtered BC (54.5%), and DigiRL (71.9%); competitive zero-shot on ScreenSpot-v2; scalable with larger backbones on AndroidWorld.

Conclusion: Hi-Agent demonstrates effective hierarchical planning for mobile control with improved stability and generalization, achieving strong results across benchmarks.

Abstract: Building agents that autonomously operate mobile devices has attracted
increasing attention. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise, most
existing approaches rely on direct state-to-action mappings, which lack
structured reasoning and planning, and thus generalize poorly to novel tasks or
unseen UI layouts. We introduce Hi-Agent, a trainable hierarchical
vision-language agent for mobile control, featuring a high-level reasoning
model and a low-level action model that are jointly optimized. For efficient
training, we reformulate multi-step decision-making as a sequence of
single-step subgoals and propose a foresight advantage function, which
leverages execution feedback from the low-level model to guide high-level
optimization. This design alleviates the path explosion issue encountered by
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in long-horizon tasks and enables
stable, critic-free joint training. Hi-Agent achieves a new State-Of-The-Art
(SOTA) 87.9% task success rate on the Android-in-the-Wild (AitW) benchmark,
significantly outperforming prior methods across three paradigms: prompt-based
(AppAgent: 17.7%), supervised (Filtered BC: 54.5%), and reinforcement
learning-based (DigiRL: 71.9%). It also demonstrates competitive zero-shot
generalization on the ScreenSpot-v2 benchmark. On the more challenging
AndroidWorld benchmark, Hi-Agent also scales effectively with larger backbones,
showing strong adaptability in high-complexity mobile control scenarios.

### [163] [IMAGINE: Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model for Complex Reasoning and Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14406)
*Xikai Zhang,Bo Wang,Likang Xiao,Yongzhi Li,Quan Chen,Wenju Wu,Liu Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IMAGINE embeds multi-agent system reasoning into a single small model, achieving 82.7% Final Pass on TravelPlanner with Qwen3-8B-Instruct, outperforming larger MAS baselines (DeepSeek-R1-671B) while reducing model size and training complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the significant reasoning and planning challenges of LLMs and the high costs/latency of multi-agent systems by consolidating MAS capabilities into one trainable model.

Method: Introduce IMAGINE (Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model), an end-to-end training framework that grafts MAS-style reasoning and planning into a compact single model. Uses Qwen3-8B-Instruct as base and evaluates on TravelPlanner, comparing to traditional MAS baselines.

Result: A single small-scale model trained with IMAGINE attains 82.7% Final Pass Rate on TravelPlanner, substantially higher than DeepSeek-R1-671B's 40%, indicating successful transfer of MAS capabilities into one model and improved efficiency.

Conclusion: IMAGINE offers a general, scalable path to embed MAS-like reasoning within a single model, achieving high performance with lower resource demands and potentially simplifying deployment compared to traditional MAS systems.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides across
various tasks, they still face significant challenges in complex reasoning and
planning. For example, even with carefully designed prompts and prior
information explicitly provided, GPT-4o achieves only a 7% Final Pass Rate on
the TravelPlanner dataset in the sole-planning mode. Similarly, even in the
thinking mode, Qwen3-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-671B, only achieve Final Pass
Rates of 5.9% and 40%, respectively. Although well-organized Multi-Agent
Systems (MAS) can offer improved collective reasoning, they often suffer from
high reasoning costs due to multi-round internal interactions, long
per-response latency, and difficulties in end-to-end training. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and scalable framework called IMAGINE, short
for Integrating Multi-Agent System into One Model. This framework not only
integrates the reasoning and planning capabilities of MAS into a single,
compact model, but also significantly surpass the capabilities of the MAS
through a simple end-to-end training. Through this pipeline, a single
small-scale model is not only able to acquire the structured reasoning and
planning capabilities of a well-organized MAS but can also significantly
outperform it. Experimental results demonstrate that, when using
Qwen3-8B-Instruct as the base model and training it with our method, the model
achieves an 82.7% Final Pass Rate on the TravelPlanner benchmark, far exceeding
the 40% of DeepSeek-R1-671B, while maintaining a much smaller model size.

### [164] [Eliminating Negative Occurrences of Derived Predicates from PDDL Axioms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14412)
*Claudia Grundke,Gabriele Röger*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Axioms in PDDL with negation can be transformed to an equivalent form that eliminates negated derived predicates, showing the expressiveness matches least fixed-point logic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clarify the expressive power of PDDL axioms, reconcile standard restrictions with stratifiable variants, and show all variants express queries equivalent to least fixed-point logic.

Method: Present a transformation that removes negative occurrences of derived predicates in axiom bodies, aligning both PDDL semantics variants with least fixed-point logic.

Result: Both the standard restricted and stratifiable variants express exactly the same queries as least fixed-point logic; the proposed transformation removes negative occurrences of derived predicates while preserving meaning.

Conclusion: The work provides a practical conversion that preserves semantics, clarifies axiom expressiveness in PDDL, and enables elimination of negated derived predicates by reducing to least fixed-point logic.

Abstract: Axioms are a feature of the Planning Domain Definition Language PDDL that can
be considered as a generalization of database query languages such as Datalog.
The PDDL standard restricts negative occurrences of predicates in axiom bodies
to predicates that are directly set by actions and not derived by axioms. In
the literature, authors often deviate from this limitation and only require
that the set of axioms is stratifiable. Both variants can express exactly the
same queries as least fixed-point logic, indicating that negative occurrences
of derived predicates can be eliminated. We present the corresponding
transformation.

### [165] [Helmsman: Autonomous Synthesis of Federated Learning Systems via Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14512)
*Haoyuan Li,Mathias Funk,Aaqib Saeed*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Helmsman automates end-to-end federated learning system synthesis using a three-phase multi-agent workflow (planning, code generation, evaluation), plus AgentFL-Bench for benchmarking; results are competitive with hand-crafted baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning system design is highly complex due to data heterogeneity, non-iid data, and system constraints, leading to brittle, bespoke implementations; automation is needed to scale development.

Method: Three collaborative phases: (1) interactive human-in-the-loop planning to formulate a research plan; (2) modular code generation by supervised agent teams; (3) closed-loop autonomous evaluation/refinement in a sandboxed simulation; introduced AgentFL-Bench with 16 tasks to assess system-level generation.

Result: Experiments show that generated solutions are competitive with, and often superior to, established hand-crafted baselines.

Conclusion: A significant step toward automated engineering of complex decentralized AI systems, enabling scalable and robust FL system synthesis.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a powerful paradigm for training models on
decentralized data, but its promise is often undermined by the immense
complexity of designing and deploying robust systems. The need to select,
combine, and tune strategies for multifaceted challenges like data
heterogeneity and system constraints has become a critical bottleneck,
resulting in brittle, bespoke solutions. To address this, we introduce
Helmsman, a novel multi-agent system that automates the end-to-end synthesis of
federated learning systems from high-level user specifications. It emulates a
principled research and development workflow through three collaborative
phases: (1) interactive human-in-the-loop planning to formulate a sound
research plan, (2) modular code generation by supervised agent teams, and (3) a
closed-loop of autonomous evaluation and refinement in a sandboxed simulation
environment. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we also introduce
AgentFL-Bench, a new benchmark comprising 16 diverse tasks designed to assess
the system-level generation capabilities of agentic systems in FL. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach generates solutions competitive with,
and often superior to, established hand-crafted baselines. Our work represents
a significant step towards the automated engineering of complex decentralized
AI systems.

### [166] [JSPLIT: A Taxonomy-based Solution for Prompt Bloating in Model Context Protocol](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14537)
*Emanuele Antonioni,Stefan Markovic,Anirudha Shankar,Jaime Bernardo,Lovro Markovic,Silvia Pareti,Benedetto Proietti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JSPLIT is a taxonomy-driven framework that prunes MCP tool prompts to only the most relevant tools, reducing prompt size while preserving or improving agent performance in large tool sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt bloating when using MCP tools grows with the number of tools, increasing token costs, latency, and the risk of selecting irrelevant tools; a scalable method is needed to manage tool prompts without sacrificing task success.

Method: Develop a hierarchical taxonomy of MCP tools, implement a tool selection algorithm that uses the user query and taxonomy structure to identify relevant tools, and evaluate on a dedicated dataset to measure prompt size, tool selection accuracy, and task success.

Result: JSPLIT significantly reduces prompt size without notably harming agent effectiveness; with larger tool repertoires, it improves tool selection accuracy, reducing costs and enhancing task success in high-complexity environments.

Conclusion: JSPLIT offers a scalable solution for managing large MCP tool sets by structuring tools taxonomically and selecting relevant ones, balancing prompt efficiency with agent performance.

Abstract: AI systems are continually evolving and advancing, and user expectations are
concurrently increasing, with a growing demand for interactions that go beyond
simple text-based interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs). Today's
applications often require LLMs to interact with external tools, marking a
shift toward more complex agentic systems. To support this, standards such as
the Model Context Protocol (MCP) have emerged, enabling agents to access tools
by including a specification of the capabilities of each tool within the
prompt. Although this approach expands what agents can do, it also introduces a
growing problem: prompt bloating. As the number of tools increases, the prompts
become longer, leading to high prompt token costs, increased latency, and
reduced task success resulting from the selection of tools irrelevant to the
prompt. To address this issue, we introduce JSPLIT, a taxonomy-driven framework
designed to help agents manage prompt size more effectively when using large
sets of MCP tools. JSPLIT organizes the tools into a hierarchical taxonomy and
uses the user's prompt to identify and include only the most relevant tools,
based on both the query and the taxonomy structure. In this paper, we describe
the design of the taxonomy, the tool selection algorithm, and the dataset used
to evaluate JSPLIT. Our results show that JSPLIT significantly reduces prompt
size without significantly compromising the agent's ability to respond
effectively. As the number of available tools for the agent grows
substantially, JSPLIT even improves the tool selection accuracy of the agent,
effectively reducing costs while simultaneously improving task success in
high-complexity agent environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reasoning Shortcuts (RSs) can causeNeSy models to ground concepts incorrectly when supervision is partial; this overview synthesizes causes, theory, and mitigation strategies to improve reliability and trust in neuro-symbolic AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RSs threaten interpretability and reliability of neuro-symbolic AI, especially when concepts lack supervision, and literature on RSs is scattered; a unifying overview can guide researchers and practitioners.

Method: Literature review and synthesis: clarifying causes and consequences of RSs, surveying theoretical characterizations, and detailing mitigation and awareness strategies; providing a unified perspective and entry point for tackling RSs.

Result: A cohesive framework and taxonomy for RSs in NeSy, including causes, theoretical insights, mitigation and awareness methods, and a consolidated map of benefits and limitations; no empirical experiments.

Conclusion: The overview advances reliable NeSy and trustworthy AI by clarifying RSs, offering mitigation strategies, and lowering barriers for researchers and practitioners to detect and address RSs even when concept supervision is unavailable.

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic (NeSy) AI aims to develop deep neural networks whose
predictions comply with prior knowledge encoding, e.g. safety or structural
constraints. As such, it represents one of the most promising avenues for
reliable and trustworthy AI. The core idea behind NeSy AI is to combine neural
and symbolic steps: neural networks are typically responsible for mapping
low-level inputs into high-level symbolic concepts, while symbolic reasoning
infers predictions compatible with the extracted concepts and the prior
knowledge. Despite their promise, it was recently shown that - whenever the
concepts are not supervised directly - NeSy models can be affected by Reasoning
Shortcuts (RSs). That is, they can achieve high label accuracy by grounding the
concepts incorrectly. RSs can compromise the interpretability of the model's
explanations, performance in out-of-distribution scenarios, and therefore
reliability. At the same time, RSs are difficult to detect and prevent unless
concept supervision is available, which is typically not the case. However, the
literature on RSs is scattered, making it difficult for researchers and
practitioners to understand and tackle this challenging problem. This overview
addresses this issue by providing a gentle introduction to RSs, discussing
their causes and consequences in intuitive terms. It also reviews and
elucidates existing theoretical characterizations of this phenomenon. Finally,
it details methods for dealing with RSs, including mitigation and awareness
strategies, and maps their benefits and limitations. By reformulating advanced
material in a digestible form, this overview aims to provide a unifying
perspective on RSs to lower the bar to entry for tackling them. Ultimately, we
hope this overview contributes to the development of reliable NeSy and
trustworthy AI models.

### [168] [LLM Agents Beyond Utility: An Open-Ended Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14548)
*Asen Nachkov,Xi Wang,Luc Van Gool*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Open-ended LLM agents can autonomously generate tasks, store/reuse knowledge, and interact with environments, but show sensitivity to prompts, risk repetitive task generation, and lack self-representation; promising but limited.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether pretrained LLMs can be extended from smart problem-solving tools to autonomous entities capable of planning, creating immediate tasks, and pursuing broader, long-term goals.

Method: Create an open-ended experimental setting by augmenting a pretrained LLM agent with the ability to generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and extensively interact with its environment; study the agent qualitatively to assess emergent autonomy.

Result: The agent can reliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information across runs, and propose/solve its own tasks, but remains sensitive to prompt design, tends to generate repetitive tasks, and does not form self-representations.

Conclusion: Demonstrates promise of moving toward open-ended LLM-driven agents while highlighting current limits; points to future work on memory management, productive exploration, and pursuing abstract long-term goals.

Abstract: Recent LLM agents have made great use of chain of thought reasoning and
function calling. As their capabilities grow, an important question arises: can
this software represent not only a smart problem-solving tool, but an entity in
its own right, that can plan, design immediate tasks, and reason toward
broader, more ambiguous goals? To study this question, we adopt an open-ended
experimental setting where we augment a pretrained LLM agent with the ability
to generate its own tasks, accumulate knowledge, and interact extensively with
its environment. We study the resulting open-ended agent qualitatively. It can
reliably follow complex multi-step instructions, store and reuse information
across runs, and propose and solve its own tasks, though it remains sensitive
to prompt design, prone to repetitive task generation, and unable to form
self-representations. These findings illustrate both the promise and current
limits of adapting pretrained LLMs toward open-endedness, and point to future
directions for training agents to manage memory, explore productively, and
pursue abstract long-term goals.

### [169] [ColorBench: Benchmarking Mobile Agents with Graph-Structured Framework for Complex Long-Horizon Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14621)
*Yuanyi Song,Heyuan Huang,Qiqiang Lin,Yin Zhao,Xiangmou Qu,Jun Wang,Xingyu Lou,Weiwen Liu,Zhuosheng Zhang,Jun Wang,Yong Yu,Weinan Zhang,Zhaoxiang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ColorBench introduces a graph-structured benchmarking framework and ColorBench benchmark to evaluate mobile agents on complex, long-horizon tasks with multiple valid solutions, bridging offline and online evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current mobile-agent evaluation is flawed: offline benchmarks fix a single golden path and online real-device tests are brittle, expensive, and non-reproducible. A stable, quasi-dynamic evaluation framework is needed to assess long-horizon capabilities.

Method: Build a finite-state, graph-based model to staticly simulate dynamic device interactions. Create ColorBench with 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app), each offering multiple correct paths and common error paths. Provide subtask completion-rate statistics and atomic-level capability analysis, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction.

Result: Evaluation across baselines reveals limitations of existing models and suggests concrete improvement directions and technical pathways to enhance performance on complex, long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: A graph-structured benchmark enables static simulation of dynamic behaviors and supports multiple valid solutions, offering richer evaluation metrics (subtask rates, error paths) and guiding improvements for mobile agents tackling long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of multimodal large language models has enabled agents
to operate mobile devices by directly interacting with graphical user
interfaces, opening new possibilities for mobile automation. However,
real-world mobile tasks are often complex and allow for multiple valid
solutions. This contradicts current mobile agent evaluation standards: offline
static benchmarks can only validate a single predefined "golden path", while
online dynamic testing is constrained by the complexity and non-reproducibility
of real devices, making both approaches inadequate for comprehensively
assessing agent capabilities. To bridge the gap between offline and online
evaluation and enhance testing stability, this paper introduces a novel
graph-structured benchmarking framework. By modeling the finite states observed
during real-device interactions, it achieves static simulation of dynamic
behaviors. Building on this, we develop ColorBench, a benchmark focused on
complex long-horizon tasks. It supports evaluation of multiple valid solutions,
subtask completion rate statistics, and atomic-level capability analysis.
ColorBench contains 175 tasks (74 single-app, 101 cross-app) with an average
length of over 13 steps. Each task includes at least two correct paths and
several typical error paths, enabling quasi-dynamic interaction. By evaluating
ColorBench across various baselines, we discover limitations of existing models
and propose improvement directions and feasible technical pathways to enhance
agents' performance on complex, long-horizon problems based on experimental
results. Code and data are available at:

*Rikard Rosenbacke,Carl Rosenbacke,Victor Rosenbacke,Martin McKee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The Rose-Frame is a conceptual three-axis diagnostic framework for identifying cognitive and epistemic drift in human–AI interaction, reframing alignment as cognitive governance rather than data- or rule-based fixes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs produce fluent, persuasive outputs that often reflect intuitive but non-grounded reasoning, leading to hallucinations and misalignment. There is a need for transparent, critical oversight that aligns machine fluency with human understanding.

Method: Introduce the Rose-Frame, a three-dimensional diagnostic tool for human–AI interaction: (i) Map vs. Territory (epistemology vs. ontology), (ii) Intuition vs. Reason (fast vs. slow thinking), (iii) Conflict vs. Confirmation (critical testing through disagreement vs. mutual validation). The framework is intended as a reflective governance instrument rather than a means to retrain or constrain models with more data or rules.

Result: Provides a structured lens to diagnose and discuss misalignment and cognitive drift, clarifying failure modes and user/model assumptions to enable more transparent AI deployment. It does not present empirical results or model improvements.

Conclusion: Alignment is cognitive governance: human reason should govern intuition, whether human or artificial. Only through reflective, falsifiable oversight can machine fluency be aligned with human understanding, using the Rose-Frame as a tool for transparent, critically aware deployment.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming deeply embedded in human
communication and decision-making, yet they inherit the ambiguity, bias, and
lack of direct access to truth inherent in language itself. While their outputs
are fluent, emotionally resonant, and coherent, they are generated through
statistical prediction rather than grounded reasoning. This creates the risk of
hallucination, responses that sound convincing but lack factual validity.
Building on Geoffrey Hinton's observation that AI mirrors human intuition
rather than reasoning, this paper argues that LLMs operationalize System 1
cognition at scale: fast, associative, and persuasive, but without reflection
or falsification. To address this, we introduce the Rose-Frame, a
three-dimensional framework for diagnosing cognitive and epistemic drift in
human-AI interaction. The three axes are: (i) Map vs. Territory, which
distinguishes representations of reality (epistemology) from reality itself
(ontology); (ii) Intuition vs. Reason, drawing on dual-process theory to
separate fast, emotional judgments from slow, reflective thinking; and (iii)
Conflict vs. Confirmation, which examines whether ideas are critically tested
through disagreement or simply reinforced through mutual validation. Each
dimension captures a distinct failure mode, and their combination amplifies
misalignment. Rose-Frame does not attempt to fix LLMs with more data or rules.
Instead, it offers a reflective tool that makes both the model's limitations
and the user's assumptions visible, enabling more transparent and critically
aware AI deployment. It reframes alignment as cognitive governance: intuition,
whether human or artificial, must remain governed by human reason. Only by
embedding reflective, falsifiable oversight can we align machine fluency with
human understanding.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Systematic review of Dutch public health ML research (2021–2025) reveals pervasive gaps in algorithmic bias reporting; introduces the RABAT assessment tool and the ACAR fairness framework; recommends improved fairness framing, subgroup analyses, and harm discussion to advance health equity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To prevent algorithmic bias from exacerbating health disparities in public health ML and to standardize identification, discussion, and reporting of bias.

Method: Conducted a systematic literature review of Dutch public health ML studies from 2021–2025; developed the Risk of Algorithmic Bias Assessment Tool (RABAT) by integrating Cochrane RoB, PROBAST, and Microsoft Responsible AI checklists; applied RABAT to 35 peer‑reviewed studies; proposed the four‑stage ACAR framework (Awareness, Conceptualization, Application, Reporting).

Result: Found pervasive gaps: data sampling and missing data practices are documented, but explicit fairness framing, subgroup analyses, and transparent harm discussions are often missing; RABAT identified these gaps; ACAR framework introduced to guide fairness across the ML lifecycle.

Conclusion: Researchers and public health practitioners should routinely consider algorithmic bias and transparency; adopt RABAT and ACAR to ensure ML innovations promote health equity rather than undermine it; provide actionable recommendations for public health ML practitioners.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) promises to revolutionize public health through
improved surveillance, risk stratification, and resource allocation. However,
without systematic attention to algorithmic bias, ML may inadvertently
reinforce existing health disparities. We present a systematic literature
review of algorithmic bias identification, discussion, and reporting in Dutch
public health ML research from 2021 to 2025. To this end, we developed the Risk
of Algorithmic Bias Assessment Tool (RABAT) by integrating elements from
established frameworks (Cochrane Risk of Bias, PROBAST, Microsoft Responsible
AI checklist) and applied it to 35 peer-reviewed studies. Our analysis reveals
pervasive gaps: although data sampling and missing data practices are well
documented, most studies omit explicit fairness framing, subgroup analyses, and
transparent discussion of potential harms. In response, we introduce a
four-stage fairness-oriented framework called ACAR (Awareness,
Conceptualization, Application, Reporting), with guiding questions derived from
our systematic literature review to help researchers address fairness across
the ML lifecycle. We conclude with actionable recommendations for public health
ML practitioners to consistently consider algorithmic bias and foster
transparency, ensuring that algorithmic innovations advance health equity
rather than undermine it.

*Marco Simoni,Aleksandar Fontana,Andrea Saracino,Paolo Mori*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TITAN is a framework that maps natural-language threat queries to executable, explainable reasoning over a MITRE-derived knowledge graph, using a path-planner and graph executor, trained on 88k NL-QA examples with step-by-step CoT explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable transparent, verifiable threat intelligence queries that go beyond retrieval by performing structured, reversible reasoning over a rich threat knowledge graph.

Method: A path planning model predicts chains of logical relations from text; a graph executor traverses the TITAN Ontology (typed, bidirectional, MITRE-derived) to retrieve facts and evidence; training/evaluation on TITAN Dataset (88,209 NL-question/Path/CoT pairs) with deterministic execution.

Result: Empirical evaluations show generated reasoning paths are syntactically valid and semantically coherent and executable on the graph, enabling retrieval of facts and supporting evidence.

Conclusion: TITAN demonstrates feasible end-to-end NL-to-executable graph reasoning for threat intelligence and provides a large dataset for training/evaluation of such systems.

Abstract: TITAN (Threat Intelligence Through Automated Navigation) is a framework that
connects natural-language cyber threat queries with executable reasoning over a
structured knowledge graph. It integrates a path planner model, which predicts
logical relation chains from text, and a graph executor that traverses the
TITAN Ontology to retrieve factual answers and supporting evidence. Unlike
traditional retrieval systems, TITAN operates on a typed, bidirectional graph
derived from MITRE, allowing reasoning to move clearly and reversibly between
threats, behaviors, and defenses. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce the TITAN Dataset, a corpus of 88209 examples (Train: 74258; Test:
13951) pairing natural language questions with executable reasoning paths and
step by step Chain of Thought explanations. Empirical evaluations show that
TITAN enables models to generate syntactically valid and semantically coherent
reasoning paths that can be deterministically executed on the underlying graph.

*Bianca Maria Lerma,Rafael Peñaloza*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces NAEL, a neuro-symbolic, non-anthropocentric ethical logic for AI agents that minimize global expected free energy in dynamic, multi-agent settings to yield context-sensitive, adaptive ethical behavior without anthropomorphic bias; includes a case study on resource distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses anthropocentric bias in AI ethics and limitations of prescriptive human-centered models by proposing a framework where ethics emerge from minimizing free energy in uncertain, multi-agent environments.

Method: Neuro-symbolic architecture integrating active inference (minimizing expected free energy) with symbolic reasoning to evaluate ethical consequences under uncertainty; operates in dynamic multi-agent settings; includes a case study on ethical resource distribution; analyzes balancing self-preservation, epistemic learning, and collective welfare.

Result: Ethical behavior emerges as an emergent property of free-energy minimization; produces context-sensitive, adaptive, relational ethics in agents; the resource-distribution case study demonstrates dynamic balancing of self-interest, knowledge gathering, and group welfare.

Conclusion: NAEL offers a non-anthropocentric, emergent ethical framework for AI suitable for dynamic environments, avoiding reliance on human-centered moral intuitions; empirical validation and broader testing are needed to confirm robustness and generality.

Abstract: We introduce NAEL (Non-Anthropocentric Ethical Logic), a novel ethical
framework for artificial agents grounded in active inference and symbolic
reasoning. Departing from conventional, human-centred approaches to AI ethics,
NAEL formalizes ethical behaviour as an emergent property of intelligent
systems minimizing global expected free energy in dynamic, multi-agent
environments. We propose a neuro-symbolic architecture to allow agents to
evaluate the ethical consequences of their actions in uncertain settings. The
proposed system addresses the limitations of existing ethical models by
allowing agents to develop context-sensitive, adaptive, and relational ethical
behaviour without presupposing anthropomorphic moral intuitions. A case study
involving ethical resource distribution illustrates NAEL's dynamic balancing of
self-preservation, epistemic learning, and collective welfare.

### [174] [Practical, Utilitarian Algorithm Configuration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14683)
*Devon Graham,Kevin Leyton-Brown*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Improving COUP: making utilitarian algorithm configuration empirically competitive with heuristic methods while preserving theoretical guarantees; adds practical enhancements, empirical validation, and robustness analysis to utility-function variations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for utilitarian algorithm configuration methods that are both theoretically sound and practically effective across diverse user utilities and runtimes.

Method: Propose a series of practical improvements to COUP that preserve its guarantees, conduct empirical experiments comparing against heuristic configuration procedures, and include a case study to study robustness to changes in the utility function.

Result: The enhancements improve COUP's empirical performance without sacrificing its theoretical guarantees, yielding performance competitive with widely used heuristic configurators; the case study demonstrates how solutions tolerate variations in the utility function.

Conclusion: Bringing utilitarian algorithm configuration into practical use by achieving strong theoretical guarantees and competitive empirical performance, and by illustrating robustness to utility variation.

Abstract: Utilitarian algorithm configuration identifies a parameter setting for a
given algorithm that maximizes a user's utility. Utility functions offer a
theoretically well-grounded approach to optimizing decision-making under
uncertainty and are flexible enough to capture a user's preferences over
algorithm runtimes (e.g., they can describe a sharp cutoff after which a
solution is no longer required, a per-hour cost for compute, or diminishing
returns from algorithms that take longer to run). COUP is a recently-introduced
utilitarian algorithm configuration procedure which was designed mainly to
offer strong theoretical guarantees about the quality of the configuration it
returns, with less attention paid to its practical performance. This paper
closes that gap, bringing theoretically-grounded, utilitarian algorithm
configuration to the point where it is competitive with widely used, heuristic
configuration procedures that offer no performance guarantees. We present a
series of improvements to COUP that improve its empirical performance without
degrading its theoretical guarantees and demonstrate their benefit
experimentally. Using a case study, we also illustrate ways of exploring the
robustness of a given solution to the algorithm selection problem to variations
in the utility function.

### [175] [Purifying Task Vectors in Knowledge-Aware Subspace for Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14697)
*Bang An,Yibo Yang,Philip Torr,Bernard Ghanem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PAVE purifies task vectors by exploiting knowledge-aware subspaces to remove redundancy, improving performance of model merging across methods, tasks, and architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Task vectors carry residual knowledge from fine-tuning but also task-irrelevant redundancy that harms merging; previous random pruning is not knowledge-aware.

Method: Sample training examples per task and obtain covariance matrices of pre-linear-layer weights from their fine-tuned models. Apply a context-oriented singular value decomposition to emphasize components relevant to the target knowledge. Split model weights into task-relevant and redundant parts in a knowledge-aware subspace and prune the redundant components. Introduce spectral rank allocation by optimizing a normalized activated pruning error to ensure fair pruning across models. The approach is plug-and-play with existing task-vector-based merging methods.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows PAVE improves performance across a variety of merging methods, tasks, and model architectures.

Conclusion: Knowledge-aware purification of task vectors via PAVE reduces redundancy and conflicts in merged models and can be integrated as a plug-and-play module to boost various merging strategies.

Abstract: Model merging aims to integrate task-specific abilities from individually
fine-tuned models into a single model without extra training. In recent model
merging methods, task vector has become a fundamental building block, as it can
encapsulate the residual information from finetuning. However, the merged model
often suffers from notable performance degradation due to the conflicts caused
by task-irrelevant redundancy in task vectors. Existing efforts in overcoming
redundancy by randomly dropping elements in the parameter space involves
randomness and lacks knowledge awareness. To address these challenges, in this
study, we propose Purifying TAsk Vectors (PAVE) in knowledge-aware subspace.
Concretely, we sample some training examples from each task, and feed them into
their corresponding fine-tuned models to acquire the covariance matrices before
linear layers. We then perform a context-oriented singular value decomposition,
which accentuates the weight components most relevant to the target knowledge.
As a result, we can split fine-tuned model weights into task-relevant and
redundant components in the knowledge-aware subspace, and purify the task
vector by pruning the redundant components. To induce fair pruning efforts
across models, we further introduce a spectral rank allocation strategy by
optimizing a normalized activated pruning error. The task vector purification
by our method as a plug-and-play scheme is applicable across various task
vector-based merging methods to improve their performance. In experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of PAVE across a diverse set of merging methods,
tasks, and model architectures.

### [176] [ExoPredicator: Learning Abstract Models of Dynamic Worlds for Robot Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26255)
*Yichao Liang,Dat Nguyen,Cambridge Yang,Tianyang Li,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Carl Edward Rasmussen,Adrian Weller,Zenna Tavares,Tom Silver,Kevin Ellis*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces an abstract world-model framework that jointly learns symbolic representations and causal dynamics for both actions and exogenous processes; uses variational Bayesian inference with LLM proposals; demonstrates faster planning and better generalization in five tabletop robotics simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon embodied planning is hard because the environment evolves due to both internal agent actions and external (exogenous) processes. A joint, symbolic, and causal representation is needed to plan effectively under such non-stationary dynamics with limited data.

Method: Proposes a framework that jointly learns symbolic state representations and causal processes governing both endogenous actions and exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a stochastic cause–effect relation. Learns via variational Bayesian inference augmented with LLM proposals. Evaluated on five simulated tabletop robotics environments.

Result: The learned abstract world models enable fast planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

Conclusion: The approach shows that combining symbolic state representations with causal, time-course models for both action-driven and exogenous dynamics enables scalable, generalizable long-horizon planning under limited data.

Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only
change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating,
dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a
framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state
representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and
exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a
stochastic cause-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited data
via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across five
simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast
planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex
goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

*Penglong Zhai,Jie Li,Fanyi Di,Yue Liu,Yifang Yuan,Jie Huang,Peng Wu,Sicong Wang,Mingyang Yin,Tingting Hu,Yao Xu,Xin Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoAST is a two-stage cognitive-aligned LLM framework for next POI recommendation that integrates world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectories, and user profiles via continued pretraining and supervised RL, validated offline and in a real app.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs lack native understanding of structured geographic entities and sequential mobility, and industrial POI tasks can benefit from world knowledge (seasons, weather, holidays) and user context to improve recommendations.

Method: Stage 1: Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued pretraining on enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data (desensitized users). Stage 2: Cognitive Alignment with Supervised Fine-Tuning and Reinforcement Learning to align model judgments with human preferences, using enriched training data and a natural language interface.

Result: Extensive offline experiments on real-world POI datasets and online experiments in the AMAP app’s 'Guess Where You Go' feature demonstrate effectiveness of CoAST.

Conclusion: CoAST effectively augments LLMs for next POI prediction by fusing spatial-temporal data, world knowledge, and user profiles through a two-stage training pipeline, showing promise for practical deployment.

Abstract: The next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict the
users' immediate next destinations based on their preferences and historical
check-ins, holding significant value in location-based services. Recently,
large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems,
which treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner. However, these
LLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the
native understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential
mobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in
industrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and
alignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays,
and users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance
the user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address
these issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a
framework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the
incorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns,
profiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of
2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued
pretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the
desensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with
human preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase. Extensive offline
experiments on various real-world datasets and online experiments deployed in
"Guess Where You Go" of AMAP App homepage demonstrate the effectiveness of
CoAST.

### [178] [ToolPRM: Fine-Grained Inference Scaling of Structured Outputs for Function Calling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14703)
*Jianghao Lin,Yuanyuan Shi,Xin Peng,Renjie Ding,Hairui Wang,Yuxuan Peng,Bizhe Bai,Weixi Song,Fengshuo Bai,Huacan Chai,Weinan Zhang,Fei Huang,Ying Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces ToolPRM, a fine-grained process reward model for inference scaling in function-calling of LLMs, achieving superior step-level guidance and performance over outcome-based rewards; a novel intra-call supervision dataset is automatically annotated; demonstrates gains across benchmarks and proposes 'explore more but retain less' for structured outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current inference scaling focuses on unstructured generation; structured outputs like function calling require step-level supervision during the single-call process to improve reliability and performance, due to unrecoverability and high cost of errors.

Method: Train a fine-grained process reward model (ToolPRM) that scores internal steps within each function call using a newly created intra-call supervision dataset with function-masking annotations; integrate ToolPRM with fine-grained beam search to guide function-calling inference; evaluate on multiple function calling tasks and benchmarks.

Result: ToolPRM outperforms coarse-grained and outcome-only reward models in predicting and guiding step-wise inference; the inference scaling framework with ToolPRM yields notable performance gains for the backbone LLM across diverse function-calling tasks; the dataset shows automatic annotation enabling step-level rewards.

Conclusion: Structured output tasks require reward signals at the process level; adopting the 'explore more but retain less' principle helps manage unrecoverability in function-calling generation, enabling more effective and safer exploration during inference.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly demonstrating strong
capabilities as autonomous agents, with function calling serving as a core
mechanism for interaction with the environment. Meanwhile, inference scaling
has become a cutting-edge technique to enhance LLM performance by allocating
more computational resources during the inference process. However, current
research on inference scaling primarily focuses on unstructured output
generation tasks, leaving its application in structured outputs, like function
calling, largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose an inference
scaling framework that combines fine-grained beam search with a process reward
model, ToolPRM, which scores the internal steps of each single function call.
To train ToolPRM, we construct the first fine-grained intra-call process
supervision dataset, automatically annotated with function-masking techniques
to provide step-level rewards for structured tool-use reasoning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ToolPRM beats the coarse-grained and outcome
reward models in terms of predictive accuracy, indicating its stronger
capability in supervising the function calling inference process. Inference
scaling technique equipped with ToolPRM also significantly improves the
backbone model performance across various function calling tasks and
benchmarks. More importantly, we reveal a key principle for applying inference
scaling techniques to structured outputs: "explore more but retain less" due to
the unrecoverability characteristics of structured function calling generation.

*Jinrui Liu,Bingyan Nie,Boyu Li,Yaran Chen,Yuze Wang,Shunsen He,Haoran Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Two-stage RoboGPT-R1: supervised fine-tuning on expert sequences plus RL with a rule-based reward to improve long-horizon planning and physical reasoning in embodied tasks; achieves strong results on EmbodiedBench, beating larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embodied agents in long-horizon manipulation struggle due to limited common sense/physical understanding; SFT/VLM approaches lack generalization to real robots; need task-aligned fine-tuning and objective functions that reward long-horizon consistency.

Method: Stage 1: supervised training on expert action sequences to encode foundational planning knowledge; Stage 2: reinforcement learning to fix visual-spatial reasoning gaps, using a rule-based reward that balances long-horizon performance and action constraints. The approach uses Qwen2.5-VL-3B as the base model; evaluated on EmbodiedBench, comparing to GPT-4o-mini and Qwen2.5-VL-7B baselines.

Result: RoboGPT-R1 significantly outperforms larger-scale models on EmbodiedBench: ~21.33% better than GPT-4o-mini and ~20.33% better than models trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B.

Conclusion: A two-stage fine-tuning pipeline with a rule-based reward improves embodied planning by enhancing physical understanding and long-horizon reasoning, showing that a smaller, task-aligned model can surpass larger, general-purpose models in embodied tasks.

Abstract: Improving the reasoning capabilities of embodied agents is crucial for robots
to complete complex human instructions in long-view manipulation tasks
successfully. Despite the success of large language models and vision language
models based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue
facing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex
real-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning
capabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models
to robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor
generalization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1,
a two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework,
supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences,
followed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial
understanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action
sequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based
reward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and
action constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on
Qwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini,
by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the
EmbodiedBench benchmark.

### [180] [SimKO: Simple Pass@K Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14807)
*Ruotian Peng,Yi Ren,Zhouliang Yu,Weiyang Liu,Yandong Wen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SimKO mitigates over-concentration in RLVR by asymmetric token-level adjustments, improving pass@K across math and logical-reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods show a bias toward exploitation (higher pass@1) at the expense of exploration (lower pass@K for K>1). Analyzing token-level distributions reveals a top-1 concentration that correlates with worse pass@K. A simple, targeted method is needed to encourage exploration.

Method: Track token-level probability distributions during RLVR training and identify concentration of probability on the top candidate. Propose Simple Pass@K Optimization (SimKO), which asymmetrically adjusts token probabilities: for verified-correct responses, boost the probabilities of the top-K candidates; for verified-incorrect responses, penalize the top-1 candidate. Apply these adjustments preferentially to high-entropy tokens to mitigate over-concentration and promote exploration.

Result: SimKO consistently improves pass@K across math and logical-reasoning benchmarks for a wide range of K, demonstrating enhanced exploration without sacrificing pass@1.

Conclusion: A simple, asymmetric token-level optimization can effectively mitigate over-concentration in RLVR, yielding better exploration and overall pass@K performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing
RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as
evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To
understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking
the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our
analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1
candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of
other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with
worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K
Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration
issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical
manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the
top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger
penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is
particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens
with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO
consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way
to improve RLVR's exploration.

### [181] [Agentic NL2SQL to Reduce Computational Costs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14808)
*Dominik Jehle,Lennart Purucker,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Datalake Agent, an interactive NL2SQL system that minimizes meta-information in prompts, achieving up to 87% token reduction with competitive performance on 23 databases / 100 table QA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NL2SQL with LLMs suffers from huge prompt sizes due to database metadata; reducing prompt length can cut costs while preserving accuracy.

Method: An agentic, interactive loop where the LLM selectively requests only the necessary information to answer table QA tasks; uses a reasoning framework rather than feeding all metadata at once.

Result: Token usage reduced by up to 87%; cost savings; performance remains competitive across 23 databases and 100 tasks.

Conclusion: Interactive, selective-information NL2SQL via a Datalake Agent is effective for scalable NL2SQL; offers substantial efficiency gains; future work could refine information retrieval strategies.

Abstract: Translating natural language queries into SQL queries (NL2SQL or Text-to-SQL)
has recently been empowered by large language models (LLMs). Using LLMs to
perform NL2SQL methods on a large collection of SQL databases necessitates
processing large quantities of meta-information about the databases, which in
turn results in lengthy prompts with many tokens and high processing costs. To
address this challenge, we introduce Datalake Agent, an agentic system designed
to enable an LLM to solve NL2SQL tasks more efficiently. Instead of utilizing
direct solvers for NL2SQL that call the LLM once with all meta-information in
the prompt, the Datalake Agent employs an interactive loop to reduce the
utilized meta-information. Within the loop, the LLM is used in a reasoning
framework that selectively requests only the necessary information to solve a
table question answering task. We evaluate the Datalake Agent on a collection
of 23 databases with 100 table question answering tasks. The Datalake Agent
reduces the tokens used by the LLM by up to 87\% and thus allows for
substantial cost reductions while maintaining competitive performance.

### [182] [Boosting Instruction Following at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14842)
*Ben Elder,Evelyn Duesterwald,Vinod Muthusamy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Instruction Boosting is a post-generation technique to make LLMs more reliably follow prompt instructions, shown to improve instruction-following by up to 7 points (two instructions) and up to 4 points (ten instructions) using a new benchmark SCALEDIF with up to ten instructions per sample; a conflict-score metric is proposed to explain degradation when adding more instructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers often inject many instructions to steer LLMs, but instruction overload yields unreliable compliance. The work seeks to improve adherence and diagnose why performance degrades as more instructions are added.

Method: Introduce Instruction Boosting as a post-generation step. Create SCALEDIF, a benchmark with up to ten instructions per data sample. Analyze how instruction count and instruction-tension affect performance. Develop a quantitative conflict scoring tool to quantify and explain conflicts between instructions and their impact on model behavior.

Result: Instruction following rates improve by up to 7 points for two instructions and up to 4 points for ten instructions. The study identifies tension and conflict as key drivers of performance degradation when more instructions are added, and provides a conflict scoring tool to guide prompt design.

Conclusion: Post-generation boosting plus a conflict-aware metric can mitigate instruction overload effects. SCALEDIF offers a scalable benchmark for studying instruction design, enabling developers to balance instruction volume against model reliability.

Abstract: A typical approach developers follow to influence an LLM's behavior in an
application is through careful manipulation of the prompt, such as by adding or
modifying instructions. However, merely adding more instructions provides
little assurance that they will actually be followed. We introduce Instruction
Boosting as a post-generation method to increase the reliability of LLM prompt
instructions. We show that Instruction Boosting improves the instruction
following rate by up to 7 points for two instructions and up to 4 points for
ten instructions. To demonstrate these results we introduce SCALEDIF, a
benchmark with a scaled instruction volume of up to ten instructions per data
sample. We also present an analysis of the commonly observed trend that
performance degrades as more instructions are added. We show that an important
factor contributing to this trend is the degree of tension and conflict that
arises as the number of instructions is increased. We contribute a quantitative
conflict scoring tool that explains the observed performance trends and
provides feedback to developers on the impact that additional prompt
instructions have on a model's performance.

### [183] [Where to Search: Measure the Prior-Structured Search Space of LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14846)
*Zhuo-Yang Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a compact formal theory for LLM-guided iterative search shaped by domain priors, modeling agents as fuzzy relation operators within a fixed safety envelope and using a coverage-generating function to quantify reachability across a weighted multi-step search; validated via simple inferences and a majority-vote instantiation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need to systematically encode domain priors into an operational hypothesis space for search with LLMs, and to quantify search difficulty and structure using a formal, testable framework.

Method: Develop a formal model where an agent is a fuzzy relation over inputs/outputs constrained by a safety envelope; describe multi-step reasoning as summing weighted reachable paths using a continuation parameter to obtain a coverage generating function; interpret the search process geometrically on the graph induced by the safety envelope; derive simplest testable inferences and validate via a majority-vote instantiation.

Result: A workable formal language and operational tools to measure agents and search spaces; a formal description of iterative search constructed by LLMs; testable inferences and a validation approach through majority-vote.

Conclusion: The framework offers a unified, quantifiable view of LLM-assisted iterative search guided by domain priors, enabling systematic analysis and design of search strategies; practical implementation would benefit from empirical validation, exploration of parameter sensitivity (e.g., the continuation parameter), and extensions to more dynamic priors and real-world tasks.

Abstract: The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language
models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program
discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where
to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally
structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal
theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by
domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and
outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a
fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all
reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a
coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability
difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph
induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable
inferences and validate them via a majority-vote instantiation. This theory
offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their
search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search
constructed by LLMs.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility of AI participation in laboratory activities and real-time collaboration, with applications spanning cancer immunotherapy target discovery and stem-cell engineering; AI can 'see' what scientists see and assist in execution.

Conclusion: LabOS envisions turning the lab into an intelligent collaborative environment where human and machine discovery evolve together, potentially accelerating science; further validation and detail are required.

Abstract: Modern science advances fastest when thought meets action. LabOS represents
the first AI co-scientist that unites computational reasoning with physical

Entended-Reality(XR)-enabled human-AI collaboration. By connecting multi-model

*Fikresilase Wondmeneh Abebayew*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Gatekeeper Protocol: a domain-agnostic framework that grounds LLM agents via a minimalist latent state and on-demand high-fidelity context, mediated through a unified JSON protocol. Demonstrated by Sage (software development) to improve reliability, efficiency, and scalability in interacting with complex knowledge systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs suffer from limited context windows and state desynchronization due to statelessness and inefficient context management, leading to unreliable outputs and wasted resources when interfacing with large, structured, and sensitive knowledge systems.

Method: Propose Gatekeeper Protocol that first uses a low-fidelity latent state representation for reasoning, then requests high-fidelity context on demand. All exchanges occur via a single JSON format acting as a declarative, state-synchronized protocol. Implemented a reference system called Sage for software development to illustrate the approach.

Result: The protocol increases agent reliability, reduces token consumption for context management, and enables scalable interaction with complex systems, improving efficiency and grounding.

Conclusion: Gatekeeper Protocol provides a foundational methodology for building robust, predictable, and grounded AI agents applicable across structured knowledge domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents,
yet their practical utility is fundamentally constrained by a limited context
window and state desynchronization resulting from the LLMs' stateless nature
and inefficient context management. These limitations lead to unreliable
output, unpredictable behavior, and inefficient resource usage, particularly
when interacting with large, structured, and sensitive knowledge systems such
as codebases and documents. To address these challenges, we introduce the
Gatekeeper Protocol, a novel, domain-agnostic framework that governs
agent-system interactions. Our protocol mandates that the agent first operate
and reason on a minimalist, low-fidelity "latent state" representation of the
system to strategically request high-fidelity context on demand. All
interactions are mediated through a unified JSON format that serves as a
declarative, state-synchronized protocol, ensuring the agent's model of the
system remains verifiably grounded in the system's reality. We demonstrate the
efficacy of this protocol with Sage, a reference implementation of the
Gatekeeper Protocol for software development. Our results show that this
approach significantly increases agent reliability, improves computational
efficiency by minimizing token consumption, and enables scalable interaction
with complex systems, creating a foundational methodology for building more
robust, predictable, and grounded AI agents for any structured knowledge
domain.

*Wen-Kwang Tsao,Yao-Ching Yu,Chien-Ming Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A self-improving RL agent for mapping vendor logs to a common schema via evidence gathering and confidence-based rewards, improving accuracy and reducing expert review.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vendor documentation is often unavailable, misplaced, or inconsistent, making schema mapping difficult. Traditional methods require labeled data or pre-trained weights; there is a need for autonomous, transparent, and scalable solutions.

Method: An RL agent that does not require labeled data or weight updates. During inference, it identifies ambiguous mappings, generates targeted web-search queries to gather external evidence, and applies a confidence-based reward to refine mappings. Demonstrated by converting Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs to a common schema, using GPT-4o and retrieval-augmented generation over 100 iterations.

Result: Mapping accuracy progressed from 56.4% (LLM-only) to 72.73% (RAG) to 93.94% over 100 iterations; low-confidence mappings requiring expert review decreased by 85%.

Conclusion: An evidence-driven, transparent approach that is robust, scalable, adaptable, and collaborative, enabling improved enterprise log schema mapping and signaling potential for solving future industry-scale data integration problems.

Abstract: The Enterprise Intelligence Platform must integrate logs from numerous
third-party vendors in order to perform various downstream tasks. However,
vendor documentation is often unavailable at test time. It is either misplaced,
mismatched, poorly formatted, or incomplete, which makes schema mapping
challenging. We introduce a reinforcement learning agent that can self-improve
without labeled examples or model weight updates. During inference, the agent:
1) Identifies ambiguous field-mapping attempts. 2) Generates targeted
web-search queries to gather external evidence. 3) Applies a confidence-based
reward to iteratively refine its mappings. To demonstrate this concept, we
converted Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs into a common schema. Our method
increased mapping accuracy from 56.4\%(LLM-only) to 72.73\%(RAG) to 93.94\%
over 100 iterations using GPT-4o. At the same time, it reduced the number of
low-confidence mappings requiring expert review by 85\%. This new approach
provides an evidence-driven, transparent method for solving future industry
problems, paving the way for more robust, accountable, scalable, efficient,
flexible, adaptable, and collaborative solutions.

*Kyle Montgomery,Sijun Tan,Yuqi Chen,Siyuan Zhuang,Tianjun Zhang,Raluca Ada Popa,Chenguang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Discriminative verification with self-consistency provides budget-aware test-time scaling that outperforms generative verification under fixed compute budgets, achieving large gains on AIME2025.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time verification for LLMs is costly when using generative verifiers; need a budget-aware alternative that maintains or improves accuracy.

Method: Empirical study showing that discriminative verifiers underperform alone but, when combined with self-consistency in a hybrid approach, yield a powerful, compute-efficient verification strategy. Compare under fixed compute budget to generative verification on AIME2025; provide code.

Result: Under the same compute budget, the hybrid approach outperforms state-of-the-art generative verification, achieving up to 15.3% higher accuracy on AIME2025.

Conclusion: Budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is a practical, efficient, and effective alternative to generative verification, suitable for real-world applications; code available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of
large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art
approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a
pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs,
limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more
budget-aware paradigm: discriminative verification. We conduct a thorough
empirical analysis and demonstrate that while discriminative verifiers may
underperform in isolation, combining them with self-consistency in a hybrid
approach creates a powerful and efficient test-time scaling mechanism. Notably,
under a fixed compute budget, this hybrid approach surpasses state-of-the-art
generative verification by a significant margin: achieving up to 15.3\% higher
accuracy on AIME2025. Our findings establish that for practical, real-world
applications, budget-aware scaling with discriminative verifiers is not only a
"free" upgrade over self-consistency, but also a more effective and efficient
alternative to costly generative techniques. Code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Systematic benchmarking of unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal depression detection across EEG, speech, and text; pretrained embeddings outperform handcrafted features; carefully designed trimodal models with attention achieve state-of-the-art under consistent subject-independent evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Depression is prevalent and hard to detect automatically; prior studies lack comprehensive comparisons across features, modalities, and evaluation protocols, hindering robust, reproducible progress.

Method: Systematically compare feature representations (handcrafted vs pretrained embeddings) across EEG, speech, and text; evaluate different neural encoders; compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal configurations; analyze fusion strategies with emphasis on EEG; use consistent subject-independent splits for benchmarking.

Result: Joint EEG, speech, and text improves detection; pretrained embeddings outperform handcrafted features; trimodal models with well-designed fusion attain state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Provides a groundwork for future multimodal depression detection research, offering standardized benchmarks and guidance on feature representations and fusion to advance the field.

Abstract: Depression is a widespread mental health disorder, yet its automatic
detection remains challenging. Prior work has explored unimodal and multimodal
approaches, with multimodal systems showing promise by leveraging complementary
signals. However, existing studies are limited in scope, lack systematic
comparisons of features, and suffer from inconsistent evaluation protocols. We
address these gaps by systematically exploring feature representations and
modelling strategies across EEG, together with speech and text. We evaluate
handcrafted features versus pre-trained embeddings, assess the effectiveness of
different neural encoders, compare unimodal, bimodal, and trimodal
configurations, and analyse fusion strategies with attention to the role of
EEG. Consistent subject-independent splits are applied to ensure robust,
reproducible benchmarking. Our results show that (i) the combination of EEG,
speech and text modalities enhances multimodal detection, (ii) pretrained
embeddings outperform handcrafted features, and (iii) carefully designed
trimodal models achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our work lays the
groundwork for future research in multimodal depression detection.

*Akira Okutomi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A Kant-inspired framing of reasoning as a stability problem, introducing H-Risk to quantify instability across spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity, and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian sims, higher H-Risk predicts overconfident errors despite nominal stability; in LLMs, fragile dynamics link to miscalibration and hallucination, with critique prompts yielding mixed effects. Proposes a diagnostic, reduce-overconfidence tool bridging Kantian self-limitation and feedback control; preliminary work with replication pending.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reframe reasoning and AI miscalibration as a control/stability problem by drawing on Kant’s notion of reason as regulating inference. Provide a quantitative, structural lens to diagnose and mitigate overconfidence and hallucination in AI systems.

Method: Define a composite instability index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity, and innovation amplification. Test in linear-Gaussian simulations to predict overconfident errors under nominal stability. Extend analysis to large language models, examining internal dynamics, calibration, and hallucination; explore the impact of critique-style prompts on calibration and hallucination.

Result: In simulations, higher H-Risk predicts overconfident errors even when formal stability holds, revealing a gap between nominal and epistemic stability. In LLMs, fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration and hallucination; critique-style prompts show mixed effects on calibration and hallucination. Overall, results suggest a structural bridge between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled lens to diagnose and selectively reduce overconfidence in reasoning systems.

Conclusion: Proposes a bridge between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control as a principled diagnostic lens for AI reasoning stability. The work is preliminary, with supplementary experiments and broader replication planned for a future revision.

Abstract: We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback
stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds
of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability
index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity,
and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk
predicts overconfident errors even under formal stability, revealing a gap
between nominal and epistemic stability. Extending to large language models
(LLMs), we find that fragile internal dynamics correlate with miscalibration
and hallucination, while critique-style prompts show mixed effects on
calibration and hallucination. These results suggest a structural bridge
between Kantian self-limitation and feedback control, offering a principled
lens for diagnosing -- and selectively reducing -- overconfidence in reasoning
systems. This is a preliminary version; supplementary experiments and broader
replication will be reported in a future revision.

### [190] [GroundedPRM: Tree-Guided and Fidelity-Aware Process Reward Modeling for Step-Level Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14942)
*Yao Zhang,Yu Wu,Haowei Zhang,Weiguo Li,Haokun Chen,Jingpei Wu,Guohao Li,Zhen Han,Volker Tresp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GroundedPRM introduces a fidelity-aware, tree-guided framework for automatic process supervision in reward models. It uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to construct structured reasoning paths, external tools to validate intermediate steps for execution-grounded correctness, and a hybrid reward that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS feedback. Trained on 40K auto-labeled samples, it achieves up to 26% relative improvement on ProcessBench and outperforms human-labeled PRMs in reward-guided greedy search, offering data-efficient, scalable, verifiable process-level reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PRMs for multi-step reasoning face noisy rewards, hallucination, and misalignment with step-level objectives. Existing approaches rely on costly labeling, self-evaluation, or MC estimation with misattribution. There is a need for scalable, high-fidelity supervision that preserves interpretability and aligns with step-wise reasoning goals.

Method: 1) Use Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to generate structured reasoning paths and credit assignment. 2) Validate each intermediate step with external tools to provide execution-grounded correctness signals and reduce hallucinations. 3) Combine step-level validation with global outcome signals via a hybrid reward aggregation that fuses tool-based verification and MCTS feedback. 4) Format rewards into a rationale-enhanced generative structure for compatibility with instruction-tuned LLMs. 5) Train on 40K automatically labeled samples (about 10% of the data used by the best auto-labeled PRM).

Result: GroundedPRM achieves up to 26% relative improvement in average performance on ProcessBench. In reward-guided greedy search, it outperforms PRMs trained with human-labeled supervision, demonstrating data efficiency, scalability, and verifiability.

Conclusion: A fidelity-aware, tree-guided supervision framework can substantially improve process-level reasoning while reducing labeling needs. GroundedPRM provides a scalable path to high-quality, interpretable PRMs by integrating structured search, execution-grounded validation, and a hybrid reward signal.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to improve multi-step reasoning in Large
Language Models (LLMs) by supervising intermediate steps and identifying
errors. However, building effective PRMs remains challenging due to the lack of
scalable, high-quality annotations. Existing approaches rely on costly human
labeling, LLM-based self-evaluation that is prone to hallucination, or Monte
Carlo (MC) estimation, which infers step quality solely from rollout outcomes
and often introduces noisy, misaligned supervision due to credit
misattribution. These issues result in three core limitations: noisy rewards,
low factual fidelity, and misalignment with step-level reasoning objectives. To
address these challenges, we introduce GroundedPRM, a tree-guided and
fidelity-aware framework for automatic process supervision. To reduce reward
noise and enable fine-grained credit assignment, we construct structured
reasoning paths via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). To eliminate hallucinated
supervision, we validate each intermediate step using an external tool,
providing execution-grounded correctness signals. To combine both step-level
validation and global outcome assessment, we design a hybrid reward aggregation
mechanism that fuses tool-based verification with MCTS-derived feedback.
Finally, we format the reward signal into a rationale-enhanced, generative
structure to promote interpretability and compatibility with instruction-tuned
LLMs. GroundedPRM is trained on only 40K automatically labeled samples,
amounting to just 10% of the data used by the best-performing PRM trained with
auto-labeled supervision. Nevertheless, it achieves up to a 26% relative
improvement in average performance on ProcessBench. When used for reward-guided
greedy search, GroundedPRM outperforms even PRMs trained with human-labeled
supervision, offering a scalable and verifiable path toward high-quality
process-level reasoning.

### [191] [Agentic Design of Compositional Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14980)
*Wenqian Zhang,Weiyang Liu,Zhen Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can learn to design by composing machines from standardized parts, introducing BesiegeField to benchmark such design tasks, benchmarking LLMs with agentic workflows, and exploring RL fine-tuning to bridge performance gaps and highlight remaining challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To push the boundaries of AI from language tasks to physical design, and to identify the capabilities (spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, instruction-following) needed for LLM-driven machine design.

Method: Introduce BesiegeField, a testbed based on the Besiege game that supports part-based construction, physics simulation, and reward-driven evaluation. Benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows. Curate a cold-start dataset. Conduct RL fine-tuning experiments. Discuss open challenges at the intersection of language, design, and physical reasoning.

Result: Current open-source models underperform on this task. RL fine-tuning shows potential for improvement, but there are still significant challenges to overcome in integrating language, assembly planning, and physical reasoning.

Conclusion: BesiegeField provides a concrete benchmark for evaluating LLM-driven machine design, identifies key capabilities required for success, and outlines a roadmap for future work combining language models, datasets, and RL techniques to advance compositional machine design.

Abstract: The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence
and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large
language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We
approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task
in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional
demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To
support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the
machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical
simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark
state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities
required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and
instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore
reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start
dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at
the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.

### [192] [Towards Unified Multimodal Misinformation Detection in Social Media: A Benchmark Dataset and Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25991)
*Haiyang Li,Yaxiong Wang,Shengeng Tang,Lianwei Wu,Lechao Cheng,Zhun Zhong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces OmniFake, a large benchmark for unified detection of both human misinformation and AI-generated multimodal deception, and UMFDet, a model that handles both via a category-aware MoE and an attribution reasoning mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In the wild, multimodal deception comes from two forms—human-written misinformation and AI-generated content—yet research and systems typically target only one type, hindering real-world effectiveness when the deception type is unknown.

Method: OmniFake combines existing human misinformation with newly synthesized AI-generated samples into 127K data points. UMFDet uses a vision-language model backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) adapter to capture category-specific cues, plus an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism to guide implicit locating of deceptive signals.

Result: UMFDet achieves robust and consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming specialized baselines, demonstrating the viability of a unified detector for real-world multimodal deception.

Conclusion: A unified detection framework and a comprehensive benchmark enable effective detection of both human misinformation and AI-generated multimodal deception, offering a practical solution for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: In recent years, detecting fake multimodal content on social media has drawn
increasing attention. Two major forms of deception dominate: human-crafted
misinformation (e.g., rumors and misleading posts) and AI-generated content
produced by image synthesis models or vision-language models (VLMs). Although
both share deceptive intent, they are typically studied in isolation. NLP
research focuses on human-written misinformation, while the CV community
targets AI-generated artifacts. As a result, existing models are often
specialized for only one type of fake content. In real-world scenarios,
however, the type of a multimodal post is usually unknown, limiting the
effectiveness of such specialized systems. To bridge this gap, we construct the
Omnibus Dataset for Multimodal News Deception (OmniFake), a comprehensive
benchmark of 127K samples that integrates human-curated misinformation from
existing resources with newly synthesized AI-generated examples. Based on this
dataset, we propose Unified Multimodal Fake Content Detection (UMFDet), a
framework designed to handle both forms of deception. UMFDet leverages a VLM
backbone augmented with a Category-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adapter to
capture category-specific cues, and an attribution chain-of-thought mechanism
that provides implicit reasoning guidance for locating salient deceptive
signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMFDet achieves robust and
consistent performance across both misinformation types, outperforming
specialized baselines and offering a practical solution for real-world
multimodal deception detection.

*Rameen Mahmood,Tousif Ahmed,Sai Teja Peddinti,Danny Yuxing Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A semantic inference pipeline reframes IoT device identification as language modeling over heterogeneous metadata; uses ensemble-guided LLM labeling and curriculum-tuned quantized LLaMA3.18B to achieve scalable, robust device identification across 2,015 vendors with high accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid IoT expansion and noisy/open-world traffic metadata pose significant security, privacy, and accountability risks. Traditional ID methods struggle with incomplete data and adversarial manipulation, necessitating scalable, interpretable identification approaches.

Method: Construct reliable supervision by generating high-fidelity vendor labels for IoT Inspector via an ensemble of large language models guided by mutual-information and entropy-based stability scores. Fine-tune a quantized LLaMA3.18B model with instruction tuning and curriculum learning to handle sparsity and long-tail vendor distributions, enabling robust identification from heterogeneous metadata. Evaluate on real-world IoT data and independent testbed, with explanations and adversarial stress tests.

Result: Achieves 98.25% top-1 accuracy and 90.73% macro accuracy across 2,015 vendors. Demonstrates resilience to missing fields, protocol drift, and adversarial manipulation. Independent IoT testbed evaluation with explanation quality and adversarial stress tests supports scalability and interpretability for real-world device identification at scale.

Conclusion: Instruction-tuned large language models provide a scalable and interpretable foundation for real-world device identification at scale, enabling reliable identification in open-world IoT environments.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of IoT devices has outpaced current identification
methods, creating significant risks for security, privacy, and network
accountability. These challenges are heightened in open-world environments,
where traffic metadata is often incomplete, noisy, or intentionally obfuscated.
We introduce a semantic inference pipeline that reframes device identification
as a language modeling task over heterogeneous network metadata. To construct
reliable supervision, we generate high-fidelity vendor labels for the IoT
Inspector dataset, the largest real-world IoT traffic corpus, using an ensemble
of large language models guided by mutual-information and entropy-based
stability scores. We then instruction-tune a quantized LLaMA3.18B model with
curriculum learning to support generalization under sparsity and long-tail
vendor distributions. Our model achieves 98.25% top-1 accuracy and 90.73% macro
accuracy across 2,015 vendors while maintaining resilience to missing fields,
protocol drift, and adversarial manipulation. Evaluation on an independent IoT
testbed, coupled with explanation quality and adversarial stress tests,
demonstrates that instruction-tuned LLMs provide a scalable and interpretable
foundation for real-world device identification at scale.

### [194] [Self-Training with Dynamic Weighting for Robust Gradual Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13864)
*Zixi Wang,Yushe Cao,Yubo Huang,Jinzhu Wei,Jingzehua Xu,Shuai Zhang,Xin Lai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Self-Training with Dynamic Weighting (STDW) for robust gradual domain adaptation by using a time-varying weight (rho) to balance source and target learning during self-training, improving knowledge migration across intermediate domains and outperforming baselines on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GDA aims to smoothly transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain via intermediate domains, but existing methods struggle with inefficient knowledge migration and incomplete intermediate data, leading to domain bias and poor generalization.

Method: Proposes STDW, a self-training framework with a dynamic weighting mechanism governed by a time-varying hyperparameter rho that progresses from 0 to 1. It alternates between computing pseudo-labels on target data and optimizing a weighted loss that balances source and target contributions, enabling stable progressive adaptation across intermediate domains.

Result: Empirical evaluation on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the Cover Type dataset shows that STDW outperforms existing baselines. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of rho's dynamic scheduling in achieving progressive adaptation and reducing domain bias.

Conclusion: STDW provides both theoretical insights and a practical framework for robust gradual domain adaptation, with potential applications in dynamic real-world settings; code is publicly available.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new method called Self-Training with Dynamic
Weighting (STDW), which aims to enhance robustness in Gradual Domain Adaptation
(GDA) by addressing the challenge of smooth knowledge migration from the source
to the target domain. Traditional GDA methods mitigate domain shift through
intermediate domains and self-training but often suffer from inefficient
knowledge migration or incomplete intermediate data. Our approach introduces a
dynamic weighting mechanism that adaptively balances the loss contributions of
the source and target domains during training. Specifically, we design an
optimization framework governed by a time-varying hyperparameter $\varrho$
(progressing from 0 to 1), which controls the strength of domain-specific
learning and ensures stable adaptation. The method leverages self-training to
generate pseudo-labels and optimizes a weighted objective function for
iterative model updates, maintaining robustness across intermediate domains.
Experiments on rotated MNIST, color-shifted MNIST, portrait datasets, and the
Cover Type dataset demonstrate that STDW outperforms existing baselines.
Ablation studies further validate the critical role of $\varrho$'s dynamic
scheduling in achieving progressive adaptation, confirming its effectiveness in
reducing domain bias and improving generalization. This work provides both
theoretical insights and a practical framework for robust gradual domain
adaptation, with potential applications in dynamic real-world scenarios. The

### [195] [Deep Edge Filter: Return of the Human-Crafted Layer in Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13865)
*Dongkwan Lee,Junhoo Lee,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Deep Edge Filter approach improves generalization by subtracting a low-pass filtered version of deep features from the original to isolate high-frequency, task-relevant information, yielding cross-domain gains across modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural nets encode task-relevant semantic information in high-frequency components while storing domain-specific biases in low-frequency components of deep features; filtering can separate these to enhance generalization.

Method: Compute a low-pass version of deep features (e.g., smoothing), subtract it from the original features to obtain a high-pass representation, then use it within the existing architecture without changes; validated across Vision, Text, 3D, and Audio; code released.

Result: Shows consistent performance improvements across diverse domains and architectures; induces feature sparsification and clean isolation of high-frequency components; supports the core hypothesis.

Conclusion: High-frequency isolation via Deep Edge Filter improves generalization in a modality- and architecture-agnostic way, with code available for replication.

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Edge Filter, a novel approach that applies high-pass
filtering to deep neural network features to improve model generalizability.
Our method is motivated by our hypothesis that neural networks encode
task-relevant semantic information in high-frequency components while storing
domain-specific biases in low-frequency components of deep features. By
subtracting low-pass filtered outputs from original features, our approach
isolates generalizable representations while preserving architectural
integrity. Experimental results across diverse domains such as Vision, Text,
3D, and Audio demonstrate consistent performance improvements regardless of
model architecture and data modality. Analysis reveals that our method induces
feature sparsification and effectively isolates high-frequency components,
providing empirical validation of our core hypothesis. The code is available at

### [196] [CoLoR-GAN: Continual Few-Shot Learning with Low-Rank Adaptation in Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13869)
*Munsif Ali,Leonardo Rossi,Massimo Bertozzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoLoR-GAN introduces a continual few-shot learning framework for GANs using low-rank adapters (LoRA) and a LoRA-in-LoRA (LLoRA) extension for convolutional layers to keep parameter growth small while achieving SOTA performance on CL and FS tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning with generative adversarial networks is challenging due to catastrophic forgetting and rapid parameter growth in state-of-the-art methods; there is a need for efficient, scalable adaptation that works well with few-shot samples.

Method: Proposes CoLoR-GAN, which leverages low-rank adapters (LoRA) throughout the GAN and introduces LoRA-in-LoRA (LLoRA) for convolutional layers to further reduce adapter size. The approach includes an empirical hyperparameter study for LoRA settings and is evaluated on benchmark continual learning and few-shot tasks; source code is released.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark CL and FS tasks while substantially reducing resource usage (parameters) compared to existing methods; includes an empirical study to guide hyperparameter choices.

Conclusion: CoLoR-GAN provides an efficient, scalable framework for continual learning in GANs under few-shot settings by employing low-rank adapters, enabling competitive performance with far fewer additional parameters; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) in the context of Generative Adversarial Networks
(GANs) remains a challenging problem, particularly when it comes to learn from
a few-shot (FS) samples without catastrophic forgetting. Current most effective
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, like LFS-GAN, introduce a non-negligible
quantity of new weights at each training iteration, which would become
significant when considering the long term. For this reason, this paper
introduces \textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{c}}}ontinual
few-sh\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{o}}}t learning with
\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{lo}}}w-\textcolor{red}{\textbf{\underline{r}}}ank
adaptation in GANs named CoLoR-GAN, a framework designed to handle both FS and
CL together, leveraging low-rank tensors to efficiently adapt the model to
target tasks while reducing even more the number of parameters required.
Applying a vanilla LoRA implementation already permitted us to obtain pretty
good results. In order to optimize even further the size of the adapters, we
challenged LoRA limits introducing a LoRA in LoRA (LLoRA) technique for
convolutional layers. Finally, aware of the criticality linked to the choice of
the hyperparameters of LoRA, we provide an empirical study to easily find the
best ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CoLoR-GAN through experiments on
several benchmark CL and FS tasks and show that our model is efficient,
reaching SOTA performance but with a number of resources enormously reduced.

### [197] [Joint Discriminative-Generative Modeling via Dual Adversarial Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13872)
*Xuwang Yin,Claire Zhang,Julie Steele,Nir Shavit,Tony T. Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An adversarial-training-based energy-based model for unified robust classification and high-fidelity generation, replacing SGLD with BCE-based energy optimization, achieving improved robustness and competitive/good generation on CIFAR and ImageNet, including high-quality generation approaching diffusion models on ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome instability and poor sample quality of SGLD-based JEM and achieve a single framework that can both classify robustly and generate high-fidelity images.

Method: Three innovations: (1) AT-based energy optimization via discriminating real vs PGD-generated contrastive samples using BCE loss; (2) synergistic adversarial training for the discriminative component eliminating explicit gradient penalties; (3) two-stage training to resolve batch normalization incompatibility with EBM training.

Result: Substantially improved adversarial robustness over existing hybrid models on CIFAR-10/100; competitive generative performance; on ImageNet, when optimized for generation, generative fidelity surpasses BigGAN and approaches diffusion models; first MCMC-based EBM to achieve high-quality generation on high-res datasets.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that adversarial training can underpin unified frameworks for generating and robustly classifying visual data; addresses stability issues limiting JEM scaling; shows promise for scalable EBM-based generative/classification hybrids.

Abstract: Simultaneously achieving robust classification and high-fidelity generative
modeling within a single framework presents a significant challenge. Hybrid
approaches, such as Joint Energy-Based Models (JEM), interpret classifiers as
EBMs but are often limited by the instability and poor sample quality inherent
in SGLD-based training. We address these limitations by proposing a novel
training framework that integrates adversarial training (AT) principles for
both discriminative robustness and stable generative learning. The proposed
method introduces three key innovations: (1) the replacement of SGLD-based JEM
learning with a stable, AT-based approach that optimizes the energy function by
discriminating between real data and PGD-generated contrastive samples using
the BCE loss; (2) synergistic adversarial training for the discriminative
component that enhances classification robustness while eliminating the need
for explicit gradient penalties; and (3) a two-stage training procedure to
resolve the incompatibility between batch normalization and EBM training.
Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet demonstrate that our method
substantially improves adversarial robustness over existing hybrid models while
maintaining competitive generative performance. On ImageNet, when optimized for
generative modeling, our model's generative fidelity surpasses that of BigGAN
and approaches diffusion models, representing the first MCMC-based EBM approach
to achieve high-quality generation on complex, high-resolution datasets. Our
approach addresses key stability issues that have limited JEM scaling and
demonstrates that adversarial training can serve as an effective foundation for
unified frameworks capable of generating and robustly classifying visual data.

### [198] [K-frames: Scene-Driven Any-k Keyframe Selection for long video understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13891)
*Yifeng Yao,Yike Yun,Jing Wang,Huishuai Zhang,Dongyan Zhao,Ke Tian,Zhihao Wang,Minghui Qiu,Tao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces K-frames, a scene-driven keyframe paradigm for long videos that outputs semantically coherent clips (any-k keyframes) instead of single frames, enabling flexible budgeted summaries. Builds PeakClips (200k query-conditioned highlights) and trains clip2frame selection via a three-stage curriculum (two supervised fine-tunes for temporal grounding and key-clip perception, then RL) for downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long videos challenge MLLMs due to limited context windows and high computation. Uniform frame sampling loses crucial information, and existing keyframe methods produce sparse, disjoint frames and fail to capture scene continuity or support multi-scale frame selection.

Method: Create PeakClips, a 200k video highlights dataset conditioned by a query. Develop K-frames that predicts coherent, query-relevant clips rather than individual frames. Train via a three-stage curriculum: 1) supervised fine-tuning for temporal grounding, 2) supervised fine-tuning for key-clip perception, 3) reinforcement learning to optimize a scene-driven policy for downstream tasks without additional annotations.

Result: Experiments on major long-video understanding benchmarks show K-frames is effective, interpretable, and plug-and-play for keyframe selection across scales. The authors provide dataset and model availability, demonstrating strong performance and practical utility.

Conclusion: K-frames offers a scalable, interpretable solution for long-video understanding by preserving temporal continuity through semantically coherent clips and enabling flexible keyframe budgets; PeakClips serves as a valuable training resource, and the framework is readily adoptable for real-world MLLM applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in image understanding, but long-video are constrained by context
windows and computational cost. Uniform frame sampling often leads to
substantial information loss. Meanwhile existing keyframe selection methods
such as text-frame retrieval or RL-based frame optimization typically yield
sparse and temporally disjointed frames, overlooking scene continuity and
lacking flexibility for multi-scale frame selection. To address these
limitations, we introduce K-frames, a novel paradigm for scene-driven keyframe
selection that preserves temporal continuity. Instead of selecting individual
frames, K-frames predicts semantically coherent, query-relevant clips, which
enables any-k keyframes selection to meet diverse user budgets. To achieve this
approach, we first introduce PeakClips, a dataset of 200K video highlights
conditioned by query. Building on this dataset, K-frames learns clip2frame
selection using a three-stage progressive curriculum. It involves two
Supervised Fine-Tuning stages for temporal grounding and key-clip perception,
followed by a Reinforcement Learning stage that directly optimizes the
scene-driven prediction policy for downstream task without further annotations.
Extensive experiments on major long-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate
that K-frames provides an effective, interpretable, and plug-and-play solution
for keyframe selection at various scales. Our dataset and model will be
available.

### [199] [Multi-View Semi-Supervised Label Distribution Learning with Local Structure Complementarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13917)
*Yanshan Xiao,Kaihong Wu,Bo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes MVSS-LDL, a multi-view semi-supervised label distribution learning method that uses local structure complementarity among views to improve LDL in both labeled and unlabeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LDL typically handles single-view labeled data; real-world data are often multi-view and semi-supervised, so leveraging cross-view local structure could improve label distribution learning.

Method: For each view, compute k-nearest neighbors to capture local structure, then complement each view's neighbor set with neighbors from other views. Build a graph-learning-based multi-view semi-supervised LDL model that exploits these complemented structures and view complementarity to learn label distributions.

Result: Empirical studies show MVSS-LDL achieves explicitly better performance than existing single-view LDL methods.

Conclusion: First attempt at multi-view LDL; leveraging local-structure complementarity across views yields improved LDL performance in semi-supervised settings.

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) is a paradigm that each sample is
associated with a label distribution. At present, the existing approaches are
proposed for the single-view LDL problem with labeled data, while the
multi-view LDL problem with labeled and unlabeled data has not been considered.
In this paper, we put forward the multi-view semi-supervised label distribution
learning with local structure complementarity (MVSS-LDL) approach, which
exploits the local nearest neighbor structure of each view and emphasizes the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures in multiple views.
Specifically speaking, we first explore the local structure of view $v$ by
computing the $k$-nearest neighbors. As a result, the $k$-nearest neighbor set
of each sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$ in view $v$ is attained. Nevertheless, this
$k$-nearest neighbor set describes only a part of the nearest neighbor
information of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$. In order to obtain a more
comprehensive description of sample $\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors, we
complement the nearest neighbor set in view $v$ by incorporating sample
$\boldsymbol{x}_i$'s nearest neighbors in other views. Lastly, based on the
complemented nearest neighbor set in each view, a graph learning-based
multi-view semi-supervised LDL model is constructed. By considering the
complementarity of local nearest neighbor structures, different views can
mutually provide the local structural information to complement each other. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at multi-view LDL.
Numerical studies have demonstrated that MVSS-LDL attains explicitly better
classification performance than the existing single-view LDL methods.

### [200] [Weight Weaving: Parameter Pooling for Data-Free Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13921)
*Levy Chaves,Eduardo Valle,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Weight Weaving is a data-free, plug-and-play weight-aggregation technique for model merging that pools across different lambda values using simple pooling functions, improving existing merging methods by up to 15.9 percentage points on ViT tasks without access to evaluation data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting scaling factors for model merging typically requires data or privileged evaluation info; data-free alternatives are scarce and often rely on eval data. A modular, data-free approach is needed to reliably combine expert models without retraining or data access.

Method: Generate multiple merged models by applying various lambda values, then pool their weights using a pooling function (e.g., average, random choice, or leveraging existing merge methods). The approach is orthogonal to base merging methods and does not use evaluation data.

Result: Empirically validated on three ViT variants and three tasks (vision multi-task, continual learning, domain generalization), Weight Weaving consistently boosts performance of several model merging methods, achieving average gains up to 15.9 percentage points in data-free settings.

Conclusion: Weight Weaving provides a modular, data-free route to improve model merging; it decouples lambda search from data usage, can be paired with existing methods across domains, and demonstrates robust gains across tasks and architectures.

Abstract: Model merging provides a cost-effective and data-efficient combination of
specialized deep neural networks through parameter integration. This technique
leverages expert models across downstream tasks without requiring retraining.
Most model merging approaches critically depend on scaling hyper-parameters
$\lambda$, which weight each model's contribution globally or individually.
Principled approaches for setting scaling factors without accessing any data
(data-free) are scarce, often leading researchers to tune $\lambda$ using
privileged data from the evaluation set, which is obviously unfeasible in
practice. To address this limitation, we introduce Weight Weaving, a
plug-and-play technique that pools model weights across $\lambda$ values search
space using user-defined pooling functions, such as averaging, random
selection, or even existing model merging methods. Our method demonstrates high
modularity, imposing minimal constraints on the search space. It operates
orthogonally to existing model merging methods and eliminates evaluation data
requirements. We validate Weight Weaving across three ViT variants in three
experimental setups: vision multi-task learning, vision continual learning, and
domain generalization. Our method consistently improves the performance of
several model merging methods, achieving average accuracy gains of up to 15.9
percentage points in a data-free setting.

### [201] [LTR-ICD: A Learning-to-Rank Approach for Automatic ICD Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13922)
*Mohammad Mansoori,Amira Soliman,Farzaneh Etminani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Treats ICD code assignment as retrieval/ranking rather than pure classification, improving prioritization of high-importance codes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods ignore code order; ordering of ICD codes matters for diagnosis and reimbursement; a retrieval-based framing aims to capture code precedence.

Method: Formulates ICD coding as a joint classification and ranking task; uses a retrieval-style framework to rank codes given clinical notes; compares to baseline classifier.

Result: Significant improvements: 47% accuracy for correctly ranking primary diagnosis codes (vs 20% baseline). Micro-F1 0.6065; Macro-F1 0.2904 (vs 0.597 and 0.2660).

Conclusion: Retrieval-based framing with ordered code consideration improves high-priority code identification; demonstrates potential for better reimbursement alignment and diagnostic usefulness; first attempt; further work needed on generalization and methodology details.

Abstract: Clinical notes contain unstructured text provided by clinicians during
patient encounters. These notes are usually accompanied by a sequence of
diagnostic codes following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
Correctly assigning and ordering ICD codes are essential for medical diagnosis
and reimbursement. However, automating this task remains challenging.
State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a classification task, leading
to ignoring the order of ICD codes that is essential for different purposes. In
this work, as a first attempt, we approach this task from a retrieval system
perspective to consider the order of codes, thus formulating this problem as a
classification and ranking task. Our results and analysis show that the
proposed framework has a superior ability to identify high-priority codes
compared to other methods. For instance, our model accuracy in correctly
ranking primary diagnosis codes is 47%, compared to 20% for the
state-of-the-art classifier. Additionally, in terms of classification metrics,
the proposed model achieves a micro- and macro-F1 scores of 0.6065 and 0.2904,
respectively, surpassing the previous best model with scores of 0.597 and
0.2660.

### [202] [Distributional Consistency Loss: Beyond Pointwise Data Terms in Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13972)
*George Webber,Andrew J. Reader*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DC loss replaces pointwise data fidelity with distribution-level calibration to test if measurements align with the noise distribution implied by the current estimate; it serves as a plug-in replacement for traditional losses and improves denoising and Poisson-image reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevent overfitting to noise by moving from pointwise discrepancies (e.g., MSE) to testing statistical consistency of observed data with the estimated noise distribution, leveraging known noise models and multiple independent measurements.

Method: Introduce distributional consistency (DC) loss that uses model-based probability scores for each measurement to assess distribution-level calibration; designed as a drop-in data-fidelity term compatible with modern regularizers and optimizers.

Result: Demonstrated in two settings: (i) image denoising with a deep image prior where DC achieves higher PSNR and removes the need for early stopping; (ii) medical image reconstruction from Poisson noise where DC reduces artifacts in heavily iterated reconstructions and boosts effectiveness of hand-crafted regularization.

Conclusion: DC loss provides a statistically grounded, practical alternative to conventional fidelity losses (MSE/NLL), avoiding overfitting to measurement noise and broadly applicable when the noise distribution is known and many independent measurements are available.

Abstract: Recovering true signals from noisy measurements is a central challenge in
inverse problems spanning medical imaging, geophysics, and signal processing.
Current solutions balance prior assumptions regarding the true signal
(regularization) with agreement to noisy measured data (data-fidelity).
Conventional data-fidelity loss functions, such as mean-squared error (MSE) or
negative log-likelihood, seek pointwise agreement with noisy measurements,
often leading to overfitting to noise. In this work, we instead evaluate
data-fidelity collectively by testing whether the observed measurements are
statistically consistent with the noise distributions implied by the current
estimate. We adopt this aggregated perspective and introduce distributional
consistency (DC) loss, a data-fidelity objective that replaces pointwise
matching with distribution-level calibration using model-based probability
scores for each measurement. DC loss acts as a direct and practical plug-in
replacement for standard data consistency terms: i) it is compatible with
modern regularizers, ii) it is optimized in the same way as traditional losses,
and iii) it avoids overfitting to measurement noise even without the use of
priors. Its scope naturally fits many practical inverse problems where the
measurement-noise distribution is known and where the measured dataset consists
of many independent noisy values. We demonstrate efficacy in two key example
application areas: i) in image denoising with deep image prior, using DC
instead of MSE loss removes the need for early stopping and achieves higher
PSNR; ii) in medical image reconstruction from Poisson-noisy data, DC loss
reduces artifacts in highly-iterated reconstructions and enhances the efficacy
of hand-crafted regularization. These results position DC loss as a
statistically grounded, performance-enhancing alternative to conventional
fidelity losses for inverse problems.

*Xun Wu,Shaohan Huang,Wenhui Wang,Ting Song,Li Dong,Yan Xia,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BitDistill introduces a lightweight distillation pipeline that fine-tunes full-precision LLMs into 1.58-bit (ternary: -1, 0, 1) weights for specific tasks, using SubLN, multi-head attention distillation (MiniLM), and continual pre-training to bridge the performance gap with FP models. It achieves comparable task performance to FP models while delivering up to 10x memory savings and 2.65x CPU inference speedups; code available at GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient deployment of large language models by drastically reducing precision and memory footprint without substantial loss in task-specific performance. The authors aim to address the scalability and gap in performance between finetuned full-precision models and their low-bit counterparts on targeted tasks.

Method: A three-component pipeline: (1) SubLN module from BitNet for sparse, low-precision representation; (2) multi-head attention distillation inspired by MiniLM to transfer task-relevant attention behavior; (3) continual pre-training as a warm-up to mitigate performance gaps when transitioning to 1.58-bit weights. The approach fine-tunes off-the-shelf full-precision LLMs (e.g., Qwen) to ternary weights (−1, 0, 1) for downstream tasks.

Result: Empirical results show BitDistill attains performance comparable to the full-precision counterparts across model sizes, while delivering up to 10x memory savings and 2.65x faster CPU inference.

Conclusion: BitDistill offers a practical, lightweight pathway to deploy near-full-performance LLMs in resource-constrained settings by combining SubLN, attention distillation, and continual pre-training to produce 1.58-bit weights with substantial efficiency gains.

Abstract: In this paper, we present BitNet Distillation (BitDistill), a lightweight
pipeline that fine-tunes off-the-shelf full-precision LLMs (e.g., Qwen) into
1.58-bit precision (i.e., ternary weights {-1, 0, 1}) for specific downstream
tasks, achieving strong task-specific performance with minimal computational
cost. Specifically, BitDistill incorporates three key techniques: the SubLN
module, as introduced in BitNet; multi-head attention distillation, based on
MiniLM; and continual pre-training, which serves as a crucial warm-up step to
mitigate the scalability issue of the performance gap between finetuned
full-precision and 1.58-bit LLMs on specific tasks. Experimental results show
that BitDistill achieves performance comparable to the full-precision
counterpart models across model size, while enabling up to 10x memory savings
and 2.65x faster inference on CPUs. Code is available at

### [204] [REAP the Experts: Why Pruning Prevails for One-Shot MoE compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13999)
*Mike Lasby,Ivan Lazarevich,Nish Sinnadurai,Sean Lie,Yani Ioannou,Vithursan Thangarasa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pruning experts outperforms merging for generative SMoEs; a Router-weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP) criterion preserves performance at 50% compression, achieving near-lossless code generation and tool-calling on very large models (20B–1T).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMoE models offer efficiency but incur large memory overhead due to many experts. While prior work favored merging on discriminative tasks, this leads to irreducible error in generative settings. A router-aware pruning strategy is needed to retain input-dependent control over experts.

Method: Introduce REAP, a pruning criterion that uses both router gate-values and expert activation norms to rank and prune experts. Compare REAP to merging and other pruning baselines across SMoE models from 20B to 1T parameters on generative benchmarks, including code generation and tool-calling (e.g., Qwen3-Coder-480B, Kimi-K2).

Result: REAP consistently outperforms expert merging and other pruning methods, especially at 50% compression, and achieves near-lossless compression on code generation and tool-calling tasks with large models after pruning half of the experts.

Conclusion: Expert pruning with router-aware criteria is superior to merging for generative SMoEs; merging causes a functional subspace collapse due to loss of input-dependent control. REAP offers robust, scalable compression across very large models and communicative tasks.

Abstract: Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) models offer efficient
pre-training and low latency but their large parameter counts create
significant memory overhead, motivating research into expert compression.
Contrary to recent findings favouring expert merging on discriminative
benchmarks, we demonstrate that expert pruning is a superior strategy for
generative tasks. We prove that merging introduces an irreducible error by
causing a "functional subspace collapse", due to the loss of the router's
independent, input-dependent control over experts. Leveraging this insight, we
propose Router-weighted Expert Activation Pruning (REAP), a novel pruning
criterion that considers both router gate-values and expert activation norms.
Across a diverse set of SMoE models ranging from 20B to 1T parameters, REAP
consistently outperforms merging and other pruning methods on generative
benchmarks, especially at 50% compression. Notably, our method achieves
near-lossless compression on code generation and tool-calling tasks with
Qwen3-Coder-480B and Kimi-K2, even after pruning 50% of experts.

*Bálint László Szarvas,Maksim Zhdanov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kernel basis in Clifford-Steerable CNNs is incomplete; introducing input-dependent, equivariant kernels augments expressivity and improves PDE forecasting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limited expressivity of CSCNNs due to an incomplete kernel basis while preserving equivariance to pseudo-Euclidean groups.

Method: Derive an equivariance constraint for input-dependent (conditional) kernels, and solve it efficiently via implicit parameterization. Augment standard CSCNN kernels with representations computed from the input feature field and integrate this into PDE forecasting architectures.

Result: Empirical results show improved expressivity and consistent performance gains over baselines on multiple PDE tasks, including fluid dynamics and relativistic electrodynamics.

Conclusion: Conditional Clifford-Steerable Kernels extend CSCNN expressivity without sacrificing symmetry properties, enabling better physics-informed learning; further work could explore broader groups and efficiency improvements.

Abstract: Clifford-Steerable CNNs (CSCNNs) provide a unified framework that allows
incorporating equivariance to arbitrary pseudo-Euclidean groups, including
isometries of Euclidean space and Minkowski spacetime. In this work, we
demonstrate that the kernel basis of CSCNNs is not complete, thus limiting the
model expressivity. To address this issue, we propose Conditional
Clifford-Steerable Kernels, which augment the kernels with equivariant
representations computed from the input feature field. We derive the
equivariance constraint for these input-dependent kernels and show how it can
be solved efficiently via implicit parameterization. We empirically demonstrate
an improved expressivity of the resulting framework on multiple PDE forecasting
tasks, including fluid dynamics and relativistic electrodynamics, where our
method consistently outperforms baseline methods.

### [206] [Noise-Adaptive Layerwise Learning Rates: Accelerating Geometry-Aware Optimization for Deep Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14009)
*Jie Hao,Xiaochuan Gong,Jie Xu,Zhengdao Wang,Mingrui Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Noise-adaptive layerwise learning rates for geometry-aware optimizers accelerate DNN training by adapting to curvature and gradient noise within each norm-group, enabling faster convergence on transformers like LLaMA and GPT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed learning rates within norm groups ignore heterogeneous curvature and sharpness across layers and over training, reducing efficiency of geometry-aware optimizers.

Method: Build on geometry-aware optimization by estimating gradient variance in the dual norm induced by the LMO in real time and using it to assign time-varying, noise-adaptive layerwise learning rates within each group; provide theoretical convergence analysis.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows a sharp convergence rate; empirical results on transformer architectures (e.g., LLaMA, GPT) demonstrate faster convergence than state-of-the-art optimizers.

Conclusion: Adaptive, geometry-aware optimization improves training efficiency by aligning layerwise learning rates with local curvature and gradient noise, enabling faster training of large transformer models.

Abstract: Geometry-aware optimization algorithms, such as Muon, have achieved
remarkable success in training deep neural networks (DNNs). These methods
leverage the underlying geometry of DNNs by selecting appropriate norms for
different layers and updating parameters via norm-constrained linear
minimization oracles (LMOs). However, even within a group of layers associated
with the same norm, the local curvature can be heterogeneous across layers and
vary dynamically over the course of training. For example, recent work shows
that sharpness varies substantially across transformer layers and throughout
training, yet standard geometry-aware optimizers impose fixed learning rates to
layers within the same group, which may be inefficient for DNN training.
  In this paper, we introduce a noise-adaptive layerwise learning rate scheme
on top of geometry-aware optimization algorithms and substantially accelerate
DNN training compared to methods that use fixed learning rates within each
group. Our method estimates gradient variance in the dual norm induced by the
chosen LMO on the fly, and uses it to assign time-varying noise-adaptive
layerwise learning rates within each group. We provide a theoretical analysis
showing that our algorithm achieves a sharp convergence rate. Empirical results
on transformer architectures such as LLaMA and GPT demonstrate that our
approach achieves faster convergence than state-of-the-art optimizers.

*Riccardo Zattra,Giacomo Baggio,Umberto Casti,Augusto Ferrante,Francesco Ticozzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COFFEE uses a time-varying state-space model with internal state feedback to enable context-dependent selectivity, achieving strong long-range modeling with ~100x fewer parameters than S6 and strong results on induction head and MNIST.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address transformer inefficiencies (quadratic complexity and weak long-range dependency handling) by leveraging state feedback in a time-varying SSM to improve context sensitivity and scalability.

Method: Introduce COFFEE, a time-varying state-space model where selectivity depends on the internal state (context history) rather than only the current input; apply an efficient parametrization to remove redundancies present in S6 while preserving parallelizable computation.

Result: On the induction head task, COFFEE reaches near-perfect accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters and training sequences than S6. On MNIST, COFFEE achieves 97% accuracy with only 3,585 parameters within the same architecture, outperforming S6.

Conclusion: State feedback is a key mechanism for building scalable, efficient sequence models; COFFEE demonstrates substantial efficiency gains and competitive performance compared to S6 on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Transformers, powered by the attention mechanism, are the backbone of most
foundation models, yet they suffer from quadratic complexity and difficulties
in dealing with long-range dependencies in the input sequence. Recent work has
shown that state space models (SSMs) provide an efficient alternative, with the
S6 module at the core of the Mamba architecture achieving state-of-the-art
results on long-sequence benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce the COFFEE
(COntext From FEEdback) model, a novel time-varying SSM that incorporates state
feedback to enable context-dependent selectivity, while still allowing for
parallel implementation. Whereas the selectivity mechanism of S6 only depends
on the current input, COFFEE computes it from the internal state, which serves
as a compact representation of the sequence history. This shift allows the
model to regulate its dynamics based on accumulated context, improving its
ability to capture long-range dependencies. In addition to state feedback, we
employ an efficient model parametrization that removes redundancies present in
S6 and leads to a more compact and trainable formulation. On the induction head
task, COFFEE achieves near-perfect accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer
parameters and training sequences compared to S6. On MNIST, COFFEE largely
outperforms S6 within the same architecture, reaching 97% accuracy with only
3585 parameters. These results showcase the role of state feedback as a key
mechanism for building scalable and efficient sequence models.

*Guangyi Chen,Yunlong Deng,Peiyuan Zhu,Yan Li,Yifan Sheng,Zijian Li,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A high-fidelity CRL benchmark with ground-truth causal processes across four domains, enabling realistic and configurable evaluation of CRL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CRL evaluation is hindered by the lack of realistic yet controllable data with known causal structure; a benchmark that provides ground-truth causal processes and configurable assumptions addresses this gap.

Method: Introduce a dataset of ~200k images and 3 million video frames across 24 sub-scenes in four domains (static image generation, dynamic physical simulations, robotic manipulations, traffic analysis), with access to underlying causal structures that can be modified to match assumed conditions (domain labels, temporal dependencies, intervention histories); evaluate representative CRL methods across diverse paradigms.

Result: Provided a new benchmark and demonstrated its utility by evaluating representative CRL methods, offering empirical insights and guidance for practitioners to select or extend CRL frameworks for real problems; dataset and project pages released.

Conclusion: The benchmark helps bridge realism and evaluative precision in CRL, facilitating rigorous assessment and broader applicability of CRL methods.

Abstract: Causal Representation Learning (CRL) aims to uncover the data-generating
process and identify the underlying causal variables and relations, whose
evaluation remains inherently challenging due to the requirement of known
ground-truth causal variables and causal structure. Existing evaluations often
rely on either simplistic synthetic datasets or downstream performance on
real-world tasks, generally suffering a dilemma between realism and evaluative
precision. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for CRL using
high-fidelity simulated visual data that retains both realistic visual
complexity and, more importantly, access to ground-truth causal generating
processes. The dataset comprises around 200 thousand images and 3 million video
frames across 24 sub-scenes in four domains: static image generation, dynamic
physical simulations, robotic manipulations, and traffic situation analysis.
These scenarios range from static to dynamic settings, simple to complex
structures, and single to multi-agent interactions, offering a comprehensive
testbed that hopefully bridges the gap between rigorous evaluation and
real-world applicability. In addition, we provide flexible access to the
underlying causal structures, allowing users to modify or configure them to
align with the required assumptions in CRL, such as available domain labels,
temporal dependencies, or intervention histories. Leveraging this benchmark, we
evaluated representative CRL methods across diverse paradigms and offered
empirical insights to assist practitioners and newcomers in choosing or
extending appropriate CRL frameworks to properly address specific types of real
problems that can benefit from the CRL perspective. Welcome to visit our:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedHFT proposes a federated fine-tuning framework for large language models that uses a mixture of masked adapters and bi-level optimization to cope with data privacy and heterogeneous compute resources across clients, achieving improved performance and efficiency under non-IID data and hardware constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The abstract targets two challenges in distributed personalization: (i) limited/heterogeneous data due to privacy and confidentiality, and (ii) variable computation resources across clients such as edge devices. The work aims to enable efficient, personalized LLM fine-tuning in a federated setting while keeping data local.

Method: Introduce a mixture of masked adapters to adapt LLMs to resource heterogeneity across clients, enabling distributed, privacy-preserving fine-tuning. Propose a bi-level optimization framework to handle non-IID data via masked personalization and client clustering.

Result: Extensive experiments show significant performance and efficiency improvements over several heterogeneous federated learning baselines on various NLU tasks under data and resource heterogeneity.

Conclusion: FedHFT addresses both data privacy and resource heterogeneity in federated LLM fine-tuning, achieving better performance and efficiency through architectural adapters and a bi-level optimization strategy, with strong empirical validation.

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has become a common
practice for personalized natural language understanding (NLU) applications on
downstream tasks and domain-specific datasets. However, there are two main
challenges: (i) limited and/or heterogeneous data for fine-tuning due to
proprietary data confidentiality or privacy requirements, and (ii) varying
computation resources available across participating clients such as edge
devices. This paper presents FedHFT - an efficient and personalized federated
fine-tuning framework to address both challenges. First, we introduce a mixture
of masked adapters to handle resource heterogeneity across participating
clients, enabling high-performance collaborative fine-tuning of pre-trained
language model(s) across multiple clients in a distributed setting, while
keeping proprietary data local. Second, we introduce a bi-level optimization
approach to handle non-iid data distribution based on masked personalization
and client clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
performance and efficiency improvements over various natural language
understanding tasks under data and resource heterogeneity compared to
representative heterogeneous federated learning methods.

### [210] [On the expressivity of sparse maxout networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14068)
*Moritz Grillo,Tobias Hofmann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse maxout networks with fixed indegree expressively tie to a dual class of virtual polytopes; a tight bound on the associated polytope dimension enables a depth-based hierarchy showing universality with sufficient depth, while width cannot compensate for sparsity at a fixed indegree.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how sparsity constraints (fixed indegree) affect neural network expressivity and the trade-off between depth and width, by embedding the problem in a geometric framework (virtual polytopes).

Method: Establish a duality between functions computable by sparse maxout networks and a class of virtual polytopes; derive a tight bound on the dimension of these polytopes; use this bound to construct depth hierarchies and prove universal approximation with enough depth under sparsity; show limitations of width when depth is insufficient.

Result: A tight bound on the polytope dimension is obtained and used as the central tool to derive depth hierarchies. It is shown that sufficiently deep sparse maxout networks are universal, whereas with insufficient depth, width alone cannot overcome the fixed indegree sparsity.

Conclusion: Expressivity of sparse maxout networks is governed by a geometric constraint captured by polytope dimensions; depth is essential for universality under sparsity, while width cannot compensate for a fixed indegree when depth is not large enough.

Abstract: We study the expressivity of sparse maxout networks, where each neuron takes
a fixed number of inputs from the previous layer and employs a, possibly
multi-argument, maxout activation. This setting captures key characteristics of
convolutional or graph neural networks. We establish a duality between
functions computable by such networks and a class of virtual polytopes, linking
their geometry to questions of network expressivity. In particular, we derive a
tight bound on the dimension of the associated polytopes, which serves as the
central tool for our analysis. Building on this, we construct a sequence of
depth hierarchies. While sufficiently deep sparse maxout networks are
universal, we prove that if the required depth is not reached, width alone
cannot compensate for the sparsity of a fixed indegree constraint.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural Effect Search introduces an unsupervised pipeline to discover treatment causal effects directly from trial data by encoding unstructured data with foundation models, interpreting representations with a sparse autoencoder, and using a recursive progressive-stratification procedure to tackle multiple-testing and entanglement; validated on semi-synthetic data and a real-world ecological trial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RCTs depend on hand-crafted hypotheses and costly analyses, hindering scalable causal inference and exploration of unknown effects. There is a need for unsupervised methods that can identify causal effects from rich, unstructured trial data.

Method: Encode unstructured trial data with pretrained foundation models, interpret representations via a sparse autoencoder, and apply Neural Effect Search—a recursive, progressive-stratification procedure—to identify causal effects while mitigating multiple-testing and entanglement.

Result: Robustness is demonstrated on semi-synthetic experiments; the approach achieves the first unsupervised causal effect identification in a real-world scientific trial within experimental ecology.

Conclusion: The proposed Neural Effect Search enables unsupervised discovery of causal effects from trial data, expanding beyond hand-crafted hypotheses and offering a scalable approach to causal estimation, with demonstrated feasibility and promising real-world applicability.

Abstract: Randomized Controlled Trials are one of the pillars of science; nevertheless,
they rely on hand-crafted hypotheses and expensive analysis. Such constraints
prevent causal effect estimation at scale, potentially anchoring on popular yet
incomplete hypotheses. We propose to discover the unknown effects of a
treatment directly from data. For this, we turn unstructured data from a trial
into meaningful representations via pretrained foundation models and interpret
them via a sparse autoencoder. However, discovering significant causal effects
at the neural level is not trivial due to multiple-testing issues and effects
entanglement. To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Effect Search, a
novel recursive procedure solving both issues by progressive stratification.
After assessing the robustness of our algorithm on semi-synthetic experiments,
we showcase, in the context of experimental ecology, the first successful
unsupervised causal effect identification on a real-world scientific trial.

TL;DR: Neural networks can approximate solutions to reaction-diffusion equations in 1D and 2D; two-layer nets suffice for 1D, three-layer nets for 2D, with potential extensions to elliptic and parabolic PDEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide a theoretical basis for using neural networks to solve PDEs by analyzing their approximation power, addressing why neural nets can effectively represent RD equation solutions.

Method: Leverage the universal approximation theorem to prove that shallow networks can approximate RD solutions in 1D and 2D; study homogeneous and heterogeneous media; discuss extensions to related elliptic and parabolic equations.

Result: Two-layer neural networks can approximate the 1D reaction-diffusion equation; three-layer neural networks can approximate the 2D reaction-diffusion equation; presents a framework extendable to other PDEs.

Conclusion: Neural networks possess substantial expressive power for solving PDEs, providing a theoretical foundation for neural network-based PDE solvers and suggesting a path to generalize to broader classes of elliptic and parabolic equations.

Abstract: Reaction-diffusion systems represent one of the most fundamental formulations
used to describe a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological processes.
With the increasing adoption of neural networks, recent research has focused on
solving differential equations using machine learning techniques. However, the
theoretical foundation explaining why neural networks can effectively
approximate such solutions remains insufficiently explored.
  This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the approximation power of
neural networks for one- and two-dimensional reaction-diffusion equations in
both homogeneous and heterogeneous media. Building upon the universal
approximation theorem, we demonstrate that a two-layer neural network can
approximate the one-dimensional reaction-diffusion equation, while a
three-layer neural network can approximate its two-dimensional counterpart. The
theoretical framework presented here can be further extended to elliptic and
parabolic equations.
  Overall, this work highlights the expressive power of neural networks in
approximating solutions to reaction-diffusion equations and related PDEs,
providing a theoretical foundation for neural network-based differential
equation solvers.

*Awni Altabaa,Siyu Chen,John Lafferty,Zhuoran Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Four architectural mechanisms improve OOD generalization and latent-space reasoning in Transformers on a modular arithmetic task, with mechanistic interpretability analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic, compositional generalization beyond training distribution remains a core challenge; the work seeks robust out-of-distribution generalization and scalable latent-space reasoning in Transformer-based models for algorithmic tasks.

Method: Introduce four architectural mechanisms: (i) input-adaptive recurrence; (ii) algorithmic supervision; (iii) anchored latent representations via a discrete bottleneck; and (iv) an explicit error-correction mechanism. Apply them to a GSM8K-style modular arithmetic on computational graphs task and perform mechanistic interpretability analyses to understand their role.

Result: Collectively, these mechanisms enable native, scalable latent-space reasoning in Transformers and yield robust algorithmic generalization, demonstrated on the testbed; interpretability analyses reveal how the mechanisms contribute to generalization and how errors are corrected.

Conclusion: The four mechanisms form an effective architectural approach for robust algorithmic generalization and latent-space reasoning in Transformers, with interpretability insights supporting the mechanistic basis of OOD generalization.

Abstract: Systematic, compositional generalization beyond the training distribution
remains a core challenge in machine learning -- and a critical bottleneck for
the emergent reasoning abilities of modern language models. This work
investigates out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in Transformer networks
using a GSM8K-style modular arithmetic on computational graphs task as a
testbed. We introduce and explore a set of four architectural mechanisms aimed
at enhancing OOD generalization: (i) input-adaptive recurrence; (ii)
algorithmic supervision; (iii) anchored latent representations via a discrete
bottleneck; and (iv) an explicit error-correction mechanism. Collectively,
these mechanisms yield an architectural approach for native and scalable latent
space reasoning in Transformer networks with robust algorithmic generalization
capabilities. We complement these empirical results with a detailed mechanistic
interpretability analysis that reveals how these mechanisms give rise to robust
OOD generalization abilities.

It is designed to be flexible and scalable, reducing reliance on strict distributional assumptions and large data. It shows improved accuracy and robustness over existing neural and state-of-the-art estimators on synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transfer entropy estimation suffers from the curse of dimensionality, restrictive distributional assumptions, and the need for very large datasets for reliable convergence. A flexible, scalable estimator with minimal assumptions is highly desirable for practical time-series analysis.

Method: TENDE leverages score-based diffusion models to learn score functions of the relevant conditional distributions, enabling estimation of transfer entropy through conditional mutual information. This approach reduces reliance on explicit density estimation and heavy parametric assumptions.

Result: TENDE achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural estimators and other state-of-the-art approaches across both synthetic benchmarks and real data.

Conclusion: TENDE provides a flexible, scalable framework for transfer entropy estimation with minimal data assumptions, addressing dimensionality challenges and improving reliability in practical applications.

Abstract: Transfer entropy measures directed information flow in time series, and it
has become a fundamental quantity in applications spanning neuroscience,
finance, and complex systems analysis. However, existing estimation methods
suffer from the curse of dimensionality, require restrictive distributional
assumptions, or need exponentially large datasets for reliable convergence. We
address these limitations in the literature by proposing TENDE (Transfer
Entropy Neural Diffusion Estimation), a novel approach that leverages
score-based diffusion models to estimate transfer entropy through conditional
mutual information. By learning score functions of the relevant conditional
distributions, TENDE provides flexible, scalable estimation while making
minimal assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. We
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing neural
estimators and other state-of-the-art approaches across synthetic benchmarks
and real data.

### [215] [Near-Optimal Regret-Queue Length Tradeoff in Online Learning for Two-Sided Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14097)
*Zixian Yang,Sushil Mahavir Varma,Lei Ying*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces an online-learning-based pricing policy for a two-sided market with price-sensitive, arriving customers and servers. The policy achieves a tunable trade-off between regret and queue lengths, is near-optimal, and improves over prior work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demand and supply curves governing price-dependent arrival rates are often unknown in practice. The platform aims to maximize profit while keeping queues short and stable, despite missing information about the market.

Method: An online-learning-based pricing policy with two key components: a dynamic part that adaptively balances regret and queue-lengths, and a probabilistic part that judiciously samples to improve learning without causing large queues. The analysis yields a three-way trade-off between regret and queue metrics parameterized by γ.

Result: For γ in (0,1/6], the policy attains a regret of ~O(T^{1-γ}), an average queue length of ~O(T^{γ/2}), and a maximum queue length of ~O(T^{γ}). These scales are shown to be near-optimal (up to logarithmic factors) among a broad class of policies, matching the known-curve optimum when demand/supply are assumed known.

Conclusion: The proposed policy demonstrates how dynamic adjustment and controlled sampling can jointly achieve fast learning and queue stability in online two-sided markets. The results quantify a clear trade-off between information gain (regret) and operational performance (queues) and improve upon existing bounds.

Abstract: We study a two-sided market, wherein, price-sensitive heterogeneous customers
and servers arrive and join their respective queues. A compatible
customer-server pair can then be matched by the platform, at which point, they
leave the system. Our objective is to design pricing and matching algorithms
that maximize the platform's profit, while maintaining reasonable queue
lengths. As the demand and supply curves governing the price-dependent arrival
rates may not be known in practice, we design a novel online-learning-based
pricing policy and establish its near-optimality. In particular, we prove a
tradeoff among three performance metrics: $\tilde{O}(T^{1-\gamma})$ regret,
$\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma/2})$ average queue length, and $\tilde{O}(T^{\gamma})$
maximum queue length for $\gamma \in (0, 1/6]$, significantly improving over
existing results [1]. Moreover, barring the permissible range of $\gamma$, we
show that this trade-off between regret and average queue length is optimal up
to logarithmic factors under a class of policies, matching the optimal one as
in [2] which assumes the demand and supply curves to be known. Our proposed
policy has two noteworthy features: a dynamic component that optimizes the
tradeoff between low regret and small queue lengths; and a probabilistic
component that resolves the tension between obtaining useful samples for fast
learning and maintaining small queue lengths.

*Yazid Janati,Alain Durmus,Jimmy Olsson,Eric Moulines*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A survey of methods that reuse pre-trained diffusion models with Monte Carlo sampling to solve Bayesian inverse problems by twisting intermediate diffusion distributions toward the posterior, without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce training burden and leverage powerful diffusion priors to perform Bayesian inversion; enable posterior sampling without retraining.

Method: Systematic review of twisting-based strategies that modify intermediate distributions in the diffusion process, and the Monte Carlo techniques used to sample from these twisted distributions.

Result: Provides a unified taxonomy and synthesis of current approaches; clarifies the central role of twisting and the combination with MC methods; discusses practical implications for posterior sampling using pre-trained diffusion priors.

Conclusion: Training-free Bayesian inversion via pre-trained diffusion priors and twisting/MC sampling is a promising direction, with future work on efficiency, theoretical guarantees, and broader applicability.

Abstract: Diffusion models enable the synthesis of highly accurate samples from complex
distributions and have become foundational in generative modeling. Recently,
they have demonstrated significant potential for solving Bayesian inverse
problems by serving as priors. This review offers a comprehensive overview of
current methods that leverage \emph{pre-trained} diffusion models alongside
Monte Carlo methods to address Bayesian inverse problems without requiring
additional training. We show that these methods primarily employ a
\emph{twisting} mechanism for the intermediate distributions within the
diffusion process, guiding the simulations toward the posterior distribution.
We describe how various Monte Carlo methods are then used to aid in sampling
from these twisted distributions.

*Waqar Muhammad Ashraf,Talha Ansar,Abdulelah S. Alshehri,Peipei Chen,Ramit Debnath,Vivek Dua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural-network-driven robust optimization with data-driven domain constraints improves energy efficiency and CO2 reduction potential in gas power plants.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle domain-inconsistent solutions arising from integrating parametrised neural networks with optimisation solvers; enable robust, domain-aware decision making for decarbonisation.

Method: Proposes a neural network-driven robust optimization framework that embeds data-driven domain constraints into nonlinear programming; validated on a 1180 MW combined-cycle gas plant to obtain domain-consistent robust optimal solutions.

Result: Achieves 0.76 percentage point mean improvement in energy efficiency; estimated global fleet potential of ~26 Mt CO2 reduction annually, distributed regionally (Asia 10.6 Mt, Americas 9.0 Mt, Europe 4.5 Mt).

Conclusion: Demonstrates a synergetic role for machine learning in delivering near-term, scalable decarbonisation pathways via robust optimization across the global gas power fleet.

Abstract: We introduce a neural network-driven robust optimisation framework that
integrates data-driven domain as a constraint into the nonlinear programming
technique, addressing the overlooked issue of domain-inconsistent solutions
arising from the interaction of parametrised neural network models with
optimisation solvers. Applied to a 1180 MW capacity combined cycle gas power
plant, our framework delivers domain-consistent robust optimal solutions that
achieve a verified 0.76 percentage point mean improvement in energy efficiency.
For the first time, scaling this efficiency gain to the global fleet of gas
power plants, we estimate an annual 26 Mt reduction potential in CO$_2$ (with
10.6 Mt in Asia, 9.0 Mt in the Americas, and 4.5 Mt in Europe). These results
underscore the synergetic role of machine learning in delivering near-term,
scalable decarbonisation pathways for global climate action.

### [218] [Demystifying the Mechanisms Behind Emergent Exploration in Goal-conditioned RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14129)
*Mahsa Bastankhah,Grace Liu,Dilip Arumugam,Thomas L. Griffiths,Benjamin Eysenbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SGCRL's exploration emerges from implicit rewards shaped by learned state representations; its objective induces a reward landscape that promotes exploration before reaching goals and exploitation afterward, with low-rank representations driving this dynamic rather than neural net capacity; findings enable safety-aware exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the mechanisms behind emergent exploration in unsupervised reinforcement learning and how SGCRL achieves long-horizon goal-reaching without external rewards or curricula; to identify the role of representation geometry in shaping exploration and potential safety implications.

Method: Theoretical analysis of SGCRL's objective function combined with controlled experiments that examine how learned representations shape exploration; investigation of representation rank (low-rank vs high-rank) as a driver of exploration dynamics; demonstration of adapting SGCRL for safety-aware exploration.

Result: SGCRL maximizes implicit rewards shaped by its representations, which modify the reward landscape to promote exploration before the goal and exploitation thereafter; exploration dynamics arise from learning low-rank representations of the state space rather than neural network function approximation; the insights enable adapting SGCRL to safety-aware exploration.

Conclusion: A deeper understanding of SGCRL's mechanism provides principled guidance for designing unsupervised RL with controllable exploration, highlighting the central role of representation geometry (low-rank structure) in shaping implicit reward landscapes and enabling safety-aware deployment.

Abstract: In this work, we take a first step toward elucidating the mechanisms behind
emergent exploration in unsupervised reinforcement learning. We study
Single-Goal Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (SGCRL), a self-supervised
algorithm capable of solving challenging long-horizon goal-reaching tasks
without external rewards or curricula. We combine theoretical analysis of the
algorithm's objective function with controlled experiments to understand what
drives its exploration. We show that SGCRL maximizes implicit rewards shaped by
its learned representations. These representations automatically modify the
reward landscape to promote exploration before reaching the goal and
exploitation thereafter. Our experiments also demonstrate that these
exploration dynamics arise from learning low-rank representations of the state
space rather than from neural network function approximation. Our improved
understanding enables us to adapt SGCRL to perform safety-aware exploration.

### [219] [Learning Wireless Interference Patterns: Decoupled GNN for Throughput Prediction in Heterogeneous Multi-Hop p-CSMA Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14137)
*Faezeh Dehghan Tarzjani,Bhaskar Krishnamachari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Decoupled Graph Convolutional Network (D-GCN) for scalable, accurate saturation throughput prediction in heterogeneous multi-hop networks; uses attention-based decoupled processing; achieves 3.3% NMAE and near-optimal network optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting saturation throughput in p-persistent CSMA for heterogeneous multi-hop wireless networks is challenging due to dynamic interference and high computational costs. Simplified single-domain models underpredict throughput; exact Markov-chain analyses scale exponentially and become impractical for large networks. A scalable, interpretable ML approach is needed to capture multihop interference.

Method: D-GCN architecture explicitly decouples processing of a node's own transmission probability from neighbor interference effects. It replaces mean aggregation with learnable attention, yielding per-neighbor contribution weights and capturing complex multihop interference patterns.

Result: D-GCN attains 3.3% NMAE, outperforming strong baselines (standard GCN reported 63.94% NMAE due to symmetric normalization conflating direct and higher-order interference). It remains tractable when exact analytical methods are infeasible and enables gradient-based network optimization that achieves within 1% of theoretical optima.

Conclusion: D-GCN provides an interpretable, scalable framework for throughput prediction and optimization in heterogeneous networks, overcoming key limitations of both simplified models and exact analyses.

Abstract: The p-persistent CSMA protocol is central to random-access MAC analysis, but
predicting saturation throughput in heterogeneous multi-hop wireless networks
remains a hard problem. Simplified models that assume a single, shared
interference domain can underestimate throughput by 48--62\% in sparse
topologies. Exact Markov-chain analyses are accurate but scale exponentially in
computation time, making them impractical for large networks. These
computational barriers motivate structural machine learning approaches like
GNNs for scalable throughput prediction in general network topologies. Yet
off-the-shelf GNNs struggle here: a standard GCN yields 63.94\% normalized mean
absolute error (NMAE) on heterogeneous networks because symmetric normalization
conflates a node's direct interference with higher-order, cascading effects
that pertain to how interference propagates over the network graph.
  Building on these insights, we propose the Decoupled Graph Convolutional
Network (D-GCN), a novel architecture that explicitly separates processing of a
node's own transmission probability from neighbor interference effects. D-GCN
replaces mean aggregation with learnable attention, yielding interpretable,
per-neighbor contribution weights while capturing complex multihop interference
patterns. D-GCN attains 3.3\% NMAE, outperforms strong baselines, remains
tractable even when exact analytical methods become computationally infeasible,
and enables gradient-based network optimization that achieves within 1\% of
theoretical optima.

### [220] [Inferred global dense residue transition graphs from primary structure sequences enable protein interaction prediction via directed graph convolutional neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14139)
*Islam Akef Ebeid,Haoteng Tang,Pengfei Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes ProtGram-DirectGCN, a two-stage graph framework for PPI prediction that combines a protein-level n-gram sequence graph (ProtGram) with a directed graph convolutional network (DirectGCN) to generate protein embeddings and perform link prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate PPI prediction typically relies on heavy sequence embeddings or 3D structure graphs; the authors seek a lightweight, data-efficient alternative that leverages primary sequence information through graph representations.

Method: ProtGram builds a hierarchical, globally inferred n-gram graph from protein sequences, with edge weights as residue transition probabilities learned from large sequence corpora. DirectGCN is a custom directed GCN that processes incoming, outgoing, and undirected paths via separate transformations plus a shared transformation, gated together. Protein embeddings are obtained via attention pooling of residue embeddings and used for PPI link prediction. The approach is first validated on standard node classification benchmarks, then applied to PPI prediction.

Result: DirectGCN matches or exceeds baseline methods on common node classification tasks and performs well on directed, dense, heterophilic graphs. When used within the ProtGram-DirectGCN framework, PPI prediction is robust, including under limited training data conditions.

Conclusion: The two-stage ProtGram-DirectGCN framework offers a data-efficient, graph-based approach for PPI prediction by leveraging sequence-informed ProtGram graphs and a specialized directed GCN, with strong performance on both node-level benchmarks and PPI link prediction under data constraints.

Abstract: Introduction Accurate prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is
crucial for understanding cellular functions and advancing drug development.
Existing in-silico methods use direct sequence embeddings from Protein Language
Models (PLMs). Others use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for 3D protein
structures. This study explores less computationally intensive alternatives. We
introduce a novel framework for downstream PPI prediction through link
prediction. Methods We introduce a two-stage graph representation learning
framework, ProtGram-DirectGCN. First, we developed ProtGram. This approach
models a protein's primary structure as a hierarchy of globally inferred n-gram
graphs. In these graphs, residue transition probabilities define edge weights.
Each edge connects a pair of residues in a directed graph. The probabilities
are aggregated from a large corpus of sequences. Second, we propose DirectGCN,
a custom directed graph convolutional neural network. This model features a
unique convolutional layer. It processes information through separate
path-specific transformations: incoming, outgoing, and undirected. A shared
transformation is also applied. These paths are combined via a learnable gating
mechanism. We apply DirectGCN to ProtGram graphs to learn residue-level
embeddings. These embeddings are pooled via attention to generate protein-level
embeddings for prediction. Results We first established the efficacy of
DirectGCN on standard node classification benchmarks. Its performance matches
established methods on general datasets. The model excels at complex, directed
graphs with dense, heterophilic structures. When applied to PPI prediction, the
full ProtGram-DirectGCN framework delivers robust predictive power. This strong
performance holds even with limited training data.

*Jan Kwiatkowski,Jarosław A. Chudziak*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematically benchmark how advanced loss functions (pointwise, pairwise, listwise) influence Transformer-based ranking of daily stock returns to improve cross-sectional asset ordering for S&P 500 portfolios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard prediction losses optimize accuracy but do not directly teach the model to rank assets. Ranking-based portfolio decisions require losses that encourage correct ordering; evaluation of IR-style ranking losses on financial time series with transformers is underexplored.

Method: Evaluate a diverse set of learning-to-rank losses (pointwise, pairwise, listwise) using Transformer models for daily stock return forecasting and rank-based portfolio selection on S&P 500 data; assess cross-sectional and temporal ranking capabilities.

Result: A comprehensive benchmark showing how different loss functions affect the model's ability to learn ranking-relevant patterns, informing how losses influence ranking accuracy and portfolio performance.

Conclusion: Offers practical guidance for choosing loss functions to optimize ranking-based trading strategies; standard predictive losses may be insufficient for profitable rank-based stock selection, and appropriate ranking losses can enhance cross-sectional ordering and temporal ranking signals.

Abstract: Quantitative trading strategies rely on accurately ranking stocks to identify
profitable investments. Effective portfolio management requires models that can
reliably order future stock returns. Transformer models are promising for
understanding financial time series, but how different training loss functions
affect their ability to rank stocks well is not yet fully understood. Financial
markets are challenging due to their changing nature and complex relationships
between stocks. Standard loss functions, which aim for simple prediction
accuracy, often aren't enough. They don't directly teach models to learn the
correct order of stock returns. While many advanced ranking losses exist from
fields such as information retrieval, there hasn't been a thorough comparison
to see how well they work for ranking financial returns, especially when used
with modern Transformer models for stock selection. This paper addresses this
gap by systematically evaluating a diverse set of advanced loss functions
including pointwise, pairwise, listwise for daily stock return forecasting to
facilitate rank-based portfolio selection on S&P 500 data. We focus on
assessing how each loss function influences the model's ability to discern
profitable relative orderings among assets. Our research contributes a
comprehensive benchmark revealing how different loss functions impact a model's
ability to learn cross-sectional and temporal patterns crucial for portfolio
selection, thereby offering practical guidance for optimizing ranking-based
trading strategies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tensor-based data characterization can overcome the limitations of traditional data analysis by leveraging multi-way data representations, improving interpretability and actionable insights; the paper surveys conventional methods, outlines tensor alternatives, and argues for adoption with illustrative examples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for deeper understanding and explainability in ML/Data Analytics. Conventional dataset characterization (statistical, structural, model-based) often lacks deep insights; tensor methods offer a more robust, interpretable characterization of complex data.

Method: Conduct a state-of-the-art survey of conventional data analytics techniques, analyze their limitations, discuss tensor-based methods (e.g., tensor decompositions and multi-way analysis), illustrate with examples, and advocate for adopting tensor-based characterization.

Conclusion: Adopting tensor-based characterization promises a leap forward in understanding complex datasets and enables more intelligent, explainable data-driven discoveries; the work advocates for broader adoption of tensor-based techniques.

Abstract: In the evolving domains of Machine Learning and Data Analytics, existing
dataset characterization methods such as statistical, structural, and
model-based analyses often fail to deliver the deep understanding and insights
essential for innovation and explainability. This work surveys the current
state-of-the-art conventional data analytic techniques and examines their
limitations, and discusses a variety of tensor-based methods and how these may
provide a more robust alternative to traditional statistical, structural, and
model-based dataset characterization techniques. Through examples, we
illustrate how tensor methods unveil nuanced data characteristics, offering
enhanced interpretability and actionable intelligence. We advocate for the

### [223] [Towards Reversible Model Merging For Low-rank Weights](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14163)
*Mohammadsajad Alipour,Mohammad Mohammadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RMM reframes model merging as building a reconstruction-capable, reversible model space using a compact basis, enabling exact recovery of each source model via linear coefficients; it is data-free, closed-form, and outperforms conventional merging on low-rank models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional merging degrades when source models are compressed into low-rank representations (e.g., LoRA, SVD). There is a need to preserve task-specific performance and retain the ability to revert to individual models.

Method: Construct a compact weight basis that can represent all task-specific models; derive a closed-form solution to select the optimal basis and per-task coefficients so that any source model can be reconstructed via linear combination of the basis.

Result: RMM consistently surpasses existing merging approaches across diverse datasets and model scales, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed models by a significant margin.

Conclusion: Model merging should be treated as building a reversible, reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model; RMM provides an efficient, data-free method to realize this goal with practical benefits.

Abstract: Model merging aims to combine multiple fine-tuned models into a single set of
weights that performs well across all source tasks. While prior work has shown
that merging can approximate the performance of individual fine-tuned models
for each task, it largely overlooks scenarios where models are compressed into
low-rank representations, either through low-rank adaptation (LoRA) or
post-training singular value decomposition (SVD). We first demonstrate that
applying conventional merging methods to low-rank weights leads to severe
performance degradation in the merged model. Motivated by this phenomenon, we
propose a fundamentally different approach: instead of collapsing all adapters
into one set of weights, we construct a compact basis (e.g., an equivalent of
holding two or more models) from which original task-specific models can be
recovered via linear combination. This reframes merging as generating a
reconstruction-capable model space rather than producing a single merged model.
Crucially, this allows us to ``revert'' to each individual model when needed,
recognizing that no merged model can consistently outperform one specialized
for its task. Building on this insight, we introduce our method, Reversible
Model Merging (RMM), an efficient, data-free, and flexible method that provides
a closed-form solution for selecting the optimal basis of model weights and
task-specific coefficients for linear combination. Extensive experiments across
diverse datasets and model scales demonstrate that RMM consistently outperforms
existing merging approaches, preserving the performance of low-rank compressed
models by a significant margin.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces the Optimal Control Theoretic Neural Optimizer (OCNOpt), a backpropagation-inspired optimizer derived from approximate dynamic programming, enabling higher-order DP expansions for training DNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge deep neural network optimization with optimal-control theory by viewing DNNs as dynamical systems, and leverage dynamic programming to derive principled, potentially higher-order optimization algorithms.

Method: Demonstrates that backpropagation has a variational structure aligned with dynamic programming; derives an optimizer by solving an approximate DP problem to first order, yielding OCNOpt with capabilities like layer‑wise feedback policies; discusses extensions to game-theoretic settings and continuous-time models (Neural ODEs).

Result: Empirical results show OCNOpt improves robustness and efficiency relative to existing methods while keeping computational complexity manageable.

Conclusion: Presents a principled algorithmic design framework grounded in dynamical systems and optimal control; opens avenues for higher-order training and broader applications across continuous-time models and multi-agent settings.

Abstract: Optimization of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been a driving force in the
advancement of modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. With DNNs
characterized by a prolonged sequence of nonlinear propagation, determining
their optimal parameters given an objective naturally fits within the framework
of Optimal Control Programming. Such an interpretation of DNNs as dynamical
systems has proven crucial in offering a theoretical foundation for principled
analysis from numerical equations to physics. In parallel to these theoretical
pursuits, this paper focuses on an algorithmic perspective. Our motivated
observation is the striking algorithmic resemblance between the Backpropagation
algorithm for computing gradients in DNNs and the optimality conditions for
dynamical systems, expressed through another backward process known as dynamic
programming. Consolidating this connection, where Backpropagation admits a
variational structure, solving an approximate dynamic programming up to the
first-order expansion leads to a new class of optimization methods exploring
higher-order expansions of the Bellman equation. The resulting optimizer,
termed Optimal Control Theoretic Neural Optimizer (OCNOpt), enables rich
algorithmic opportunities, including layer-wise feedback policies,
game-theoretic applications, and higher-order training of continuous-time
models such as Neural ODEs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCNOpt
improves upon existing methods in robustness and efficiency while maintaining
manageable computational complexity, paving new avenues for principled
algorithmic design grounded in dynamical systems and optimal control theory.

*Mahmood Hegazy,Aaron Rodrigues,Azzam Naeem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAFA is a configurable, production-grade multi-agent framework for enterprise annotation that eliminates large backlogs, achieves strong agreement with human annotators, and delivers significant accuracy gains over baselines, with dynamic task configuration without code changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address annotation backlogs in large-scale enterprise NLP tasks (notably financial services) by providing a scalable, configurable, human-in-the-loop annotation workflow that can be deployed in production.

Method: A multi-agent architecture with specialized agents, structured reasoning, and a judge-based consensus mechanism. Dynamic task adaptation via configuration enables different annotation types (FAQs, intents, entities, domain categories) without coding. Supports multiple languages and is deployed in a financial enterprise (JP Morgan Chase). Confidence-based routing: mostly high/medium/low to guide human review. Demonstrated across datasets with improved performance versus baselines.

Result: Backlog of 1 million utterances eliminated. Average agreement with human annotators ~86%. Annually saves >5,000 hours of manual annotation. Confidence distribution: ~85% high, 10% medium, 5% low across datasets. 13.8% higher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% higher Top-5 accuracy, 16.9% better F1 on internal dataset; similar gains on public benchmarks.

Conclusion: Shows practical viability of configurable, multi-agent annotation systems in enterprise settings, offering a blueprint for organizations facing similar annotation challenges and enabling scalable deployment without code changes.

Abstract: We present MAFA (Multi-Agent Framework for Annotation), a production-deployed
system that transforms enterprise-scale annotation workflows through
configurable multi-agent collaboration. Addressing the critical challenge of
annotation backlogs in financial services, where millions of customer
utterances require accurate categorization, MAFA combines specialized agents
with structured reasoning and a judge-based consensus mechanism. Our framework
uniquely supports dynamic task adaptation, allowing organizations to define
custom annotation types (FAQs, intents, entities, or domain-specific
categories) through configuration rather than code changes. Deployed at JP
Morgan Chase, MAFA has eliminated a 1 million utterance backlog while
achieving, on average, 86% agreement with human annotators, annually saving
over 5,000 hours of manual annotation work. The system processes utterances
with annotation confidence classifications, which are typically 85% high, 10%
medium, and 5% low across all datasets we tested. This enables human annotators
to focus exclusively on ambiguous and low-coverage cases. We demonstrate MAFA's
effectiveness across multiple datasets and languages, showing consistent
improvements over traditional and single-agent annotation baselines: 13.8%
higher Top-1 accuracy, 15.1% improvement in Top-5 accuracy, and 16.9% better F1
in our internal intent classification dataset and similar gains on public
benchmarks. This work bridges the gap between theoretical multi-agent systems
and practical enterprise deployment, providing a blueprint for organizations
facing similar annotation challenges.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ConDA introduces Contrastive Diffusion Alignment to organize diffusion latent spaces with contrastive learning, aligning latent geometry to system dynamics so nonlinear latent traversals yield faithful interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable generation across diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models lack explicitly structured latent spaces for interpretable control. Leveraging contrastive objectives may yield more disentangled, dynamics-aware representations that support controllable generation.

Method: Apply a contrastive learning objective within diffusion embeddings to shape latent geometry so traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors; enable nonlinear trajectory traversal in a diffusion latent manifold.

Result: ConDA produces interpretable latent representations with improved controllability over linear traversals and conditioning baselines across benchmarks in fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging, therapeutic neurostimulation, and facial expression.

Conclusion: Diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure, but effective control requires organizing the latent space and traversing along its manifold, which ConDA achieves through contrastive alignment.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generation, but their latent spaces are not
explicitly organized for interpretable control. We introduce ConDA (Contrastive
Diffusion Alignment), a framework that applies contrastive learning within
diffusion embeddings to align latent geometry with system dynamics. Motivated
by recent advances showing that contrastive objectives can recover more
disentangled and structured representations, ConDA organizes diffusion latents
such that traversal directions reflect underlying dynamical factors. Within
this contrastively structured space, ConDA enables nonlinear trajectory
traversal that supports faithful interpolation, extrapolation, and controllable
generation. Across benchmarks in fluid dynamics, neural calcium imaging,
therapeutic neurostimulation, and facial expression, ConDA produces
interpretable latent representations with improved controllability compared to
linear traversals and conditioning-based baselines. These results suggest that
diffusion latents encode dynamics-relevant structure, but exploiting this
structure requires latent organization and traversal along the latent manifold.

Motivation: To address the participation dilemma in FL—free-riding and under-contribution—and to unify theoretical and technical approaches to design practical, fair, and robust incentive mechanisms for real-world deployments.

Method: Literature synthesis and taxonomy construction; cross-disciplinary integration of economics/game-theory concepts, blockchain-based incentives, and deep reinforcement learning; consideration of centralized and decentralized architectures; application-oriented mapping to healthcare, smart infrastructure, vehicular networks, etc.

Result: Identifies promising incentive mechanisms and approaches (e.g., mechanism design, reputation/stake-based incentives, smart contracts, DRL-based allocation) and catalogs challenges (privacy, security, collusion, scalability, non-IID data, evaluation) and gaps in current research; provides a comprehensive taxonomy and insights into practical success factors.

Conclusion: Incentive design is essential for FL's practical success; while promising solutions exist, substantial work remains to realize sustainable, fair, and robust federated learning ecosystems.

Abstract: Federated learning promises to revolutionize machine learning by enabling
collaborative model training without compromising data privacy. However,
practical adaptability can be limited by critical factors, such as the
participation dilemma. Participating entities are often unwilling to contribute
to a learning system unless they receive some benefits, or they may pretend to
participate and free-ride on others. This chapter identifies the fundamental
challenges in designing incentive mechanisms for federated learning systems. It
examines how foundational concepts from economics and game theory can be
applied to federated learning, alongside technology-driven solutions such as
blockchain and deep reinforcement learning. This work presents a comprehensive
taxonomy that thoroughly covers both centralized and decentralized
architectures based on the aforementioned theoretical concepts. Furthermore,
the concepts described are presented from an application perspective, covering
emerging industrial applications, including healthcare, smart infrastructure,
vehicular networks, and blockchain-based decentralized systems. Through this
exploration, this chapter demonstrates that well-designed incentive mechanisms
are not merely optional features but essential components for the practical
success of federated learning. This analysis reveals both the promising
solutions that have emerged and the significant challenges that remain in
building truly sustainable, fair, and robust federated learning ecosystems.

### [228] [Spectral Analysis of Molecular Kernels: When Richer Features Do Not Guarantee Better Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14217)
*Asma Jamali,Tin Sum Cheng,Rodrigo A. Vargas-Hernández*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spectral richness of molecular kernels does not predict generalization; top eigenvalues often dominate predictive performance. In QM9 across multiple representations, richer spectra fail to consistently improve accuracy, and in some cases correlate negatively with performance. Retaining only the top ~2% of eigenvalues recovers nearly all performance, challenging the idea that richer spectra yield better generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how kernel spectral properties relate to generalization and representation quality in molecular tasks, addressing a gap in systematic spectral analyses of molecular kernels and informing evaluation of kernel/self-supervised methods in data-limited settings.

Method: Perform a comprehensive spectral analysis of kernel ridge regression on the QM9 dataset across seven molecular properties, using multiple representations (molecular fingerprint, pretrained transformer-based global and local 3D representations). Compute four spectral metrics to quantify richness, assess correlations with predictive performance via Pearson tests, and use truncated kernels (retaining top ~2% of eigenvalues) to probe spectrum-performance relationship.

Result: Across representations, richer spectral features do not consistently improve accuracy. For transformer-based and local 3D representations, spectral richness can correlate negatively with performance. Retaining only the top ~2% of eigenvalues recovers nearly all predictive performance in many kernels, implying leading eigenvalues capture most informative features.

Conclusion: The common heuristic that richer spectra yield better generalization is challenged. The leading eigenvalues appear to capture the most informative kernel features, with nuanced relationships between representation, spectrum, and performance. Findings inform evaluation of kernel and self-supervised learning in data-limited scientific tasks.

Abstract: Understanding the spectral properties of kernels offers a principled
perspective on generalization and representation quality. While deep models
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in molecular property prediction, kernel
methods remain widely used for their robustness in low-data regimes and
transparent theoretical grounding. Despite extensive studies of kernel spectra
in machine learning, systematic spectral analyses of molecular kernels are
scarce. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive spectral analysis of
kernel ridge regression on the QM9 dataset, molecular fingerprint, pretrained
transformer-based, global and local 3D representations across seven molecular
properties. Surprisingly, richer spectral features, measured by four different
spectral metrics, do not consistently improve accuracy. Pearson correlation
tests further reveal that for transformer-based and local 3D representations,
spectral richness can even have a negative correlation with performance. We
also implement truncated kernels to probe the relationship between spectrum and
predictive performance: in many kernels, retaining only the top 2% of
eigenvalues recovers nearly all performance, indicating that the leading
eigenvalues capture the most informative features. Our results challenge the
common heuristic that "richer spectra yield better generalization" and
highlight nuanced relationships between representation, kernel features, and
predictive performance. Beyond molecular property prediction, these findings
inform how kernel and self-supervised learning methods are evaluated in
data-limited scientific and real-world tasks.

### [229] [When Flatness Does (Not) Guarantee Adversarial Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14231)
*Nils Philipp Walter,Linara Adilova,Jilles Vreeken,Michael Kamp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flat minima correlate with local but not global adversarial robustness. To achieve nonlocal robustness, the loss must curve away from the data manifold. The paper derives a closed-form expression for relative flatness in the penultimate layer and uses it to bound loss variation in input space, supported by empirical validation across architectures and datasets. Flatness is linked to model confidence, with adversarial examples often in large, flat regions where the model is confidently wrong.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize and clarify the relationship between loss-landscape flatness and neural network robustness to adversarial perturbations, moving beyond informal intuition.

Method: Derive a closed-form expression for relative flatness in the penultimate layer; use it to constrain the loss variation in input space; analyze the adversarial robustness of the entire network; show that nonlocal robustness requires curvature away from the data manifold; validate predictions empirically across architectures and datasets; examine the geometric structure of adversarial vulnerability and link flatness to model confidence.

Result: Relative flatness implies local but not global adversarial robustness. To maintain robustness beyond a local neighborhood, the loss must curve away from the data manifold. Empirical results across architectures/datasets support the theory, revealing that adversarial examples often lie in large, flat regions where the model is confidently wrong; these findings challenge overly simplified views of flatness.

Conclusion: Flatness alone cannot guarantee global robustness; robustness requires curvature away from the data manifold and a nuanced understanding of the loss geometry. The work uncovers the geometric structure underpinning vulnerability and refines how we should think about flatness in robustness research.

Abstract: Despite their empirical success, neural networks remain vulnerable to small,
adversarial perturbations. A longstanding hypothesis suggests that flat minima,
regions of low curvature in the loss landscape, offer increased robustness.
While intuitive, this connection has remained largely informal and incomplete.
By rigorously formalizing the relationship, we show this intuition is only
partially correct: flatness implies local but not global adversarial
robustness. To arrive at this result, we first derive a closed-form expression
for relative flatness in the penultimate layer, and then show we can use this
to constrain the variation of the loss in input space. This allows us to
formally analyze the adversarial robustness of the entire network. We then show
that to maintain robustness beyond a local neighborhood, the loss needs to
curve sharply away from the data manifold. We validate our theoretical
predictions empirically across architectures and datasets, uncovering the
geometric structure that governs adversarial vulnerability, and linking
flatness to model confidence: adversarial examples often lie in large, flat
regions where the model is confidently wrong. Our results challenge simplified
views of flatness and provide a nuanced understanding of its role in
robustness.

*Mehrzad Samadi,Aleksander Ficek,Sean Narenthiran,Siddhartha Jain,Wasi Uddin Ahmad,Somshubra Majumdar,Vahid Noroozi,Boris Ginsburg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenCluster enables IOI gold-level performance with open-weight models through a scalable test-time compute pipeline that combines generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and round-robin submissions, aiming to close the gap with closed models and claim IOI 2025 gold using gpt-oss-120b.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Close the gap between open-weight LLMs and proprietary models on high-stakes programming benchmarks, while providing a transparent, reproducible evaluation framework for reasoning capabilities in LLMs.

Method: A pipeline of large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin submission strategy that explores diverse solution spaces under limited validation budgets, with performance that scales with compute.

Result: Empirical evidence that performance scales with compute and narrows the gap between open and closed systems; claims gold-level IOI performance for IOI 2025 using an open-weight model (gpt-oss-120b).

Conclusion: GenCluster demonstrates a feasible path to gold-level IOI performance using open models and offers a reproducible framework for evaluating reasoning in LLMs, setting a new benchmark for transparent evaluation.

Abstract: Competitive programming has become a rigorous benchmark for evaluating the
reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The
International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI) stands out as one of the most
prestigious annual competitions in competitive programming and has become a key
benchmark for comparing human and AI-level programming ability. While several
proprietary models have been claimed to achieve gold medal-level performance at
the IOI, often with undisclosed methods, achieving comparable results with
open-weight models remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we present
\gencluster, a scalable and reproducible test-time compute framework that
attains IOI gold-level performance using open-weight models. It combines
large-scale generation, behavioral clustering, ranking, and a round-robin
submission strategy to efficiently explore diverse solution spaces under
limited validation budgets. Our experiments show that the performance of our
proposed approach scales consistently with available compute, narrowing the gap
between open and closed systems. Notably, we will show that GenCluster can
achieve a gold medal at IOI 2025 for the first time with an open-weight model
gpt-oss-120b, setting a new benchmark for transparent and reproducible
evaluation of reasoning in LLMs.

*Jingwen Gu,Yiting He,Zhishuai Liu,Pan Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DR-RPO is a model-free online policy optimization method for robust RL in RMDPs, achieving sublinear regret with reference-policy regularization and scalability via d-rectangular linear MDPs, linear function approximation, and an optimistic exploration bonus; theory and experiments validate robustness and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distribution shift in reinforcement learning is a core challenge; robust MDPs offer worst-case guarantees. Policy optimization in robust RL is underexplored, especially in online, data-efficient settings.

Method: Propose Distributionally Robust Regularized Policy Optimization (DR-RPO). It adds reference-policy regularization to enable tractable optimization in softmax policy classes, yielding RMDP variants doubly constrained in transitions and policies. For scalability, adopts the d-rectangular linear MDP formulation, combines linear function approximation with an upper confidence bonus for optimistic exploration.

Result: Theoretical results establish polynomial suboptimality bounds and sample efficiency for policy optimization in robust RL, comparable to value-based approaches. Empirical experiments across diverse domains corroborate the theory and demonstrate DR-RPO's robustness.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that policy optimization can achieve strong performance in robust RL; DR-RPO provides a scalable, theoretically sound, and empirically effective approach for online robust RL, bridging theory and practice.

Abstract: Decision-making under distribution shift is a central challenge in
reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment environments differ.
We study this problem through the lens of robust Markov decision processes
(RMDPs), which optimize performance against adversarial transition dynamics.
Our focus is the online setting, where the agent has only limited interaction
with the environment, making sample efficiency and exploration especially
critical. Policy optimization, despite its success in standard RL, remains
theoretically and empirically underexplored in robust RL. To bridge this gap,
we propose \textbf{D}istributionally \textbf{R}obust \textbf{R}egularized
\textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization algorithm (DR-RPO), a model-free online
policy optimization method that learns robust policies with sublinear regret.
To enable tractable optimization within the softmax policy class, DR-RPO
incorporates reference-policy regularization, yielding RMDP variants that are
doubly constrained in both transitions and policies. To scale to large
state-action spaces, we adopt the $d$-rectangular linear MDP formulation and
combine linear function approximation with an upper confidence bonus for
optimistic exploration. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that policy
optimization can achieve polynomial suboptimality bounds and sample efficiency
in robust RL, matching the performance of value-based approaches. Finally,
empirical results across diverse domains corroborate our theory and demonstrate
the robustness of DR-RPO.

### [232] [A Physics Prior-Guided Dual-Stream Attention Network for Motion Prediction of Elastic Bragg Breakwaters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14250)
*Lianzi Jiang,Jianxin Zhang,Xinyu Han,Huanhe Dong,Xiangrong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-informed dual-stream attention network with decay-aware self-attention and phase-guided cross-attention, fused via a global context module and trained with a time-frequency loss, achieves superior generalization for predicting elastic Bragg breakwater motion under unseen sea states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional deep learning models struggle to generalize to unseen sea states due to neglecting natural decay phenomena in marine systems and inadequate modeling of wave-structure interaction (WSI), posing safety and reliability concerns for marine structures.

Method: Propose PhysAttnNet with: (1) decay bidirectional self-attention (DBSA) that uses a learnable temporal decay to emphasize recent states; (2) phase differences guided bidirectional cross-attention (PDG-BCA) with a cosine-based bias to capture bidirectional WSI phase relationships; (3) a global context fusion (GCF) module to integrate streams; and (4) a hybrid time-frequency loss that jointly minimizes time-domain errors and frequency-domain spectral discrepancies. Trained and evaluated on wave flume datasets with cross-scenario generalization tests.

Result: PhysAttnNet significantly outperforms mainstream models on wave flume datasets, and cross-scenario generalization tests demonstrate robustness and adaptability to unseen environments.

Conclusion: The proposed physics-prior-guided architecture offers a powerful framework for predictive modeling of complex ocean-structure interactions, with strong generalization to new sea states and potential applicability to other complex, physics-informed time-series tasks in ocean engineering.

Abstract: Accurate motion response prediction for elastic Bragg breakwaters is critical
for their structural safety and operational integrity in marine environments.
However, conventional deep learning models often exhibit limited generalization
capabilities when presented with unseen sea states. These deficiencies stem
from the neglect of natural decay observed in marine systems and inadequate
modeling of wave-structure interaction (WSI). To overcome these challenges,
this study proposes a novel Physics Prior-Guided Dual-Stream Attention Network
(PhysAttnNet). First, the decay bidirectional self-attention (DBSA) module
incorporates a learnable temporal decay to assign higher weights to recent
states, aiming to emulate the natural decay phenomenon. Meanwhile, the phase
differences guided bidirectional cross-attention (PDG-BCA) module explicitly
captures the bidirectional interaction and phase relationship between waves and
the structure using a cosine-based bias within a bidirectional
cross-computation paradigm. These streams are synergistically integrated
through a global context fusion (GCF) module. Finally, PhysAttnNet is trained
with a hybrid time-frequency loss that jointly minimizes time-domain prediction
errors and frequency-domain spectral discrepancies. Comprehensive experiments
on wave flume datasets demonstrate that PhysAttnNet significantly outperforms
mainstream models. Furthermore,cross-scenario generalization tests validate the
model's robustness and adaptability to unseen environments, highlighting its
potential as a framework to develop predictive models for complex systems in
ocean engineering.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A benchmarking study compares generalist and specialist time-series foundation models on 51 tasks related to PPG signals; specialist models outperform in full-tuning by 27% win score; study assesses multiple dimensions including robustness, transferability, fairness, and data choice.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether a generalist time-series foundation model can match domain-specific specialists for physiological sensing, focusing on PPG, and evaluate across practical metrics.

Method: Evaluate generalist and specialist models on 51 tasks (cardiac state assessment, lab value estimation, cross-modal inference) across seven metrics: win score, average performance, feature quality, tuning gain, performance variance, transferability, scalability; analyze generalization, fairness, attention visualizations; full-tuning scenario emphasized.

Result: Specialist model achieves 27% higher win score in full-tuning; broader insights on generalization and data choice; attention visualizations show interpretability; fair performance considerations discussed.

Conclusion: Specialist models currently dominate tuning-heavy performance in this setting; generalist models offer robustness and cross-domain transferability but may lag in specialized PPG tasks; effective deployment requires careful data curation and consideration of fairness and scalability.

Abstract: Foundation models are large-scale machine learning models that are
pre-trained on massive amounts of data and can be adapted for various
downstream tasks. They have been extensively applied to tasks in Natural
Language Processing and Computer Vision with models such as GPT, BERT, and
CLIP. They are now also increasingly gaining attention in time-series analysis,
particularly for physiological sensing. However, most time series foundation
models are specialist models - with data in pre-training and testing of the
same type, such as Electrocardiogram, Electroencephalogram, and
Photoplethysmogram (PPG). Recent works, such as MOMENT, train a generalist time
series foundation model with data from multiple domains, such as weather,
traffic, and electricity. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive
benchmarking study to compare the performance of generalist and specialist
models, with a focus on PPG signals. Through an extensive suite of total 51
tasks covering cardiac state assessment, laboratory value estimation, and
cross-modal inference, we comprehensively evaluate both models across seven
dimensions, including win score, average performance, feature quality, tuning
gain, performance variance, transferability, and scalability. These metrics
jointly capture not only the models' capability but also their adaptability,
robustness, and efficiency under different fine-tuning strategies, providing a
holistic understanding of their strengths and limitations for diverse
downstream scenarios. In a full-tuning scenario, we demonstrate that the
specialist model achieves a 27% higher win score. Finally, we provide further
analysis on generalization, fairness, attention visualizations, and the
importance of training data choice.

*Zihao Fu,Ming Liao,Chris Russell,Zhenguang G. Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAST estimates layer-wise transformation matrices and uses spectral metrics to interpret transformer behavior without probes, revealing distinct encoder/decoder dynamics and a three-phase structure across layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers remain largely opaque; while many interpretability methods exist, a probe-free, layer-focused spectral view offers complementary insights into how each layer transforms representations.

Method: For each transformer layer, CAST computes the realized transformation matrix via Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse, then conducts spectral analysis using six interpretable metrics. Kernel analysis with CKA is used to examine inter-layer relationships, revealing phase-like structure in layer processing.

Result: Encoder-only models maintain high-rank processing with stable transformations; decoder-only models exhibit compression-expansion cycles. CKA similarity matrices partition layers into three phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization; kernel analysis shows functional relationships between layers.

Conclusion: CAST provides a probe-free, complementary perspective on transformer layer functions, enriching existing interpretability methods by revealing phase structure and layer-wise transformation patterns.

Abstract: Large language models have achieved remarkable success but remain largely
black boxes with poorly understood internal mechanisms. To address this
limitation, many researchers have proposed various interpretability methods
including mechanistic analysis, probing classifiers, and activation
visualization, each providing valuable insights from different perspectives.
Building upon this rich landscape of complementary approaches, we introduce
CAST (Compositional Analysis via Spectral Tracking), a probe-free framework
that contributes a novel perspective by analyzing transformer layer functions
through direct transformation matrix estimation and comprehensive spectral
analysis. CAST offers complementary insights to existing methods by estimating
the realized transformation matrices for each layer using Moore-Penrose
pseudoinverse and applying spectral analysis with six interpretable metrics
characterizing layer behavior. Our analysis reveals distinct behaviors between
encoder-only and decoder-only models, with decoder models exhibiting
compression-expansion cycles while encoder models maintain consistent high-rank
processing. Kernel analysis further demonstrates functional relationship
patterns between layers, with CKA similarity matrices clearly partitioning
layers into three phases: feature extraction, compression, and specialization.

*Yutian Zhao,Chao Du,Xiaosen Zheng,Tianyu Pang,Min Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Nonparametric, data-centric attribution for diffusion models using patch-level image similarity; scalable with multiscale representations and convolution acceleration; yields spatial attributions and model-independent data-output insights; performance rivals gradient-based methods and surpasses other nonparametric baselines; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to attribute model outputs to training data without access to gradients or retraining, enabling practical analysis for proprietary/large-scale diffusion models.

Method: Define a nonparametric attribution based on patch-level similarity between generated images and training data, derived from the analytical form of the optimal score function; extend to multiscale representations; accelerate via convolution; produce spatial attributions and uncover intrinsic training-output relationships.

Result: Experiments show attribution performance close to gradient-based methods and significantly better than existing nonparametric baselines.

Conclusion: Provides a practical, scalable data attribution framework for diffusion models with model-agnostic insights; code released.

Abstract: Data attribution for generative models seeks to quantify the influence of
individual training examples on model outputs. Existing methods for diffusion
models typically require access to model gradients or retraining, limiting
their applicability in proprietary or large-scale settings. We propose a
nonparametric attribution method that operates entirely on data, measuring
influence via patch-level similarity between generated and training images. Our
approach is grounded in the analytical form of the optimal score function and
naturally extends to multiscale representations, while remaining
computationally efficient through convolution-based acceleration. In addition
to producing spatially interpretable attributions, our framework uncovers
patterns that reflect intrinsic relationships between training data and
outputs, independent of any specific model. Experiments demonstrate that our
method achieves strong attribution performance, closely matching gradient-based
approaches and substantially outperforming existing nonparametric baselines.

*Mayank Keoliya,Seewon Choi,Rajeev Alur,Mayur Naik,Eric Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAREBench provides a stability-aware, multi-modal benchmark for early event prediction (EEP) and shows that current methods—especially zero-shot LLMs—struggle to jointly optimize predictive accuracy and temporal stability of risk trajectories across six tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current EEP benchmarks neglect the stability and trajectory behavior of risk scores, which are crucial for clinician trust in continuous monitoring. The problem is compounded when evaluating only tabular inputs; real deployments involve multi-modal data (tabular EHR, ECG, text).

Method: Introduce CAREBench, a benchmark that assesses deployability by measuring temporal stability (via a local-Lipschitz-based metric) alongside accuracy on six prediction tasks (e.g., sepsis onset) using multi-modal inputs. Compare classical learners, deep sequence models, and zero-shot LLMs. Code available at the linked repository.

Result: Across tasks, existing methods—especially LLMs—struggle to jointly optimize accuracy and stability, showing notably poor recall at high-precision operating points. Stability-focused evaluation reveals trajectory behavior issues that undermine trust in continuous monitoring.

Conclusion: CAREBench underscores the need for models that produce evidence-aligned, stable risk trajectories to earn clinician trust in EEP deployment and provides a framework and baseline for future work in stability-aware, multi-modal predictive systems.

Abstract: Early event prediction (EEP) systems continuously estimate a patient's
imminent risk to support clinical decision-making. For bedside trust, risk
trajectories must be accurate and temporally stable, shifting only with new,
relevant evidence. However, current benchmarks (a) ignore stability of risk
scores and (b) evaluate mainly on tabular inputs, leaving trajectory behavior
untested. To address this gap, we introduce CAREBench, an EEP benchmark that
evaluates deployability using multi-modal inputs-tabular EHR, ECG waveforms,
and clinical text-and assesses temporal stability alongside predictive
accuracy. We propose a stability metric that quantifies short-term variability
in per-patient risk and penalizes abrupt oscillations based on local-Lipschitz
constants. CAREBench spans six prediction tasks such as sepsis onset and
compares classical learners, deep sequence models, and zero-shot LLMs. Across
tasks, existing methods, especially LLMs, struggle to jointly optimize accuracy
and stability, with notably poor recall at high-precision operating points.
These results highlight the need for models that produce evidence-aligned,
stable trajectories to earn clinician trust in continuous monitoring settings.

### [237] [Enhancing Time-Series Anomaly Detection by Integrating Spectral-Residual Bottom-Up Attention with Reservoir Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14287)
*Hayato Nihei,Sou Nobukawa,Yusuke Sakemi,Kazuyuki Aihara*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spectral Residual RC (SR-RC) combines spectral residual attention with reservoir computing to boost time-series anomaly detection on edge devices, achieving higher accuracy without increasing the reservoir size or learning complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RC on resource-constrained edge devices struggles to detect anomalies with small reservoirs; while attention mechanisms can help, they often incur heavy computation and reduce RC learning efficiency. A lightweight, hardware-friendly enhancement is sought.

Method: Integrate the spectral residual (SR) attention method with RC to form SR-RC; SR is learning-free and bottom-up; incorporate SR-derived features/attention into RC's output layer training (only the output weights are trained).

Result: SR-RC outperforms conventional RC and SR-based logistic regression baselines on benchmark tasks and real-world datasets; demonstrates superior anomaly detection performance and compatibility with edge hardware.

Conclusion: SR-RC provides a practical, efficient path to deploying RC for real-time time-series anomaly detection on Edge AI, leveraging a learning-free attention mechanism to boost performance without sacrificing RC learning efficiency.

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) establishes the basis for the processing of
time-series data by exploiting the high-dimensional spatiotemporal response of
a recurrent neural network to an input signal. In particular, RC trains only
the output layer weights. This simplicity has drawn attention especially in
Edge Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications. Edge AI enables time-series
anomaly detection in real time, which is important because detection delays can
lead to serious incidents. However, achieving adequate anomaly-detection
performance with RC alone may require an unacceptably large reservoir on
resource-constrained edge devices. Without enlarging the reservoir, attention
mechanisms can improve accuracy, although they may require substantial
computation and undermine the learning efficiency of RC. In this study, to
improve the anomaly detection performance of RC without sacrificing learning
efficiency, we propose a spectral residual RC (SR-RC) that integrates the
spectral residual (SR) method - a learning-free, bottom-up attention mechanism
- with RC. We demonstrated that SR-RC outperformed conventional RC and
logistic-regression models based on values extracted by the SR method across
benchmark tasks and real-world time-series datasets. Moreover, because the SR
method, similarly to RC, is well suited for hardware implementation, SR-RC
suggests a practical direction for deploying RC as Edge AI for time-series
anomaly detection.

### [238] [TED++: Submanifold-Aware Backdoor Detection via Layerwise Tubular-Neighbourhood Screening](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14299)
*Nam Le,Leo Yu Zhang,Kewen Liao,Shirui Pan,Wei Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TED++ detects backdoors by modeling class-specific hidden-feature manifolds as tubes and using Locally Adaptive Ranking across layers to flag inputs that drift off these tubes, achieving state-of-the-art detection with limited clean data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor attacks remain dangerous even when standard distance-based anomalies are exploited or clean data is scarce. There is a need for a detection method that leverages the geometry of feature spaces to robustly identify poisoned inputs.

Method: Construct tubular neighbourhoods around each class's hidden-feature manifold and estimate local thickness from clean activations. Apply Locally Adaptive Ranking (LAR) to detect activations drifting outside the tube. Aggregate LAR-adjusted ranks across layers to form a tube-constrained behavior signature and flag inputs with significant deviations.

Result: TED++ achieves state-of-the-art detection performance under adaptive attacks and limited-data scenarios. With as few as five held-out examples per class, it delivers near-perfect detection and up to 14 percentage points AUROC gains over the next-best method. Code is publicly available.

Conclusion: By exploiting the geometry of class manifolds in the hidden feature space, TED++ provides robust backdoor detection even under subtle, distance-based evasion and data scarcity, marking a substantial advance in defense against backdoor threats.

Abstract: As deep neural networks power increasingly critical applications, stealthy
backdoor attacks, where poisoned training inputs trigger malicious model
behaviour while appearing benign, pose a severe security risk. Many existing
defences are vulnerable when attackers exploit subtle distance-based anomalies
or when clean examples are scarce. To meet this challenge, we introduce TED++,
a submanifold-aware framework that effectively detects subtle backdoors that
evade existing defences. TED++ begins by constructing a tubular neighbourhood
around each class's hidden-feature manifold, estimating its local ``thickness''
from a handful of clean activations. It then applies Locally Adaptive Ranking
(LAR) to detect any activation that drifts outside the admissible tube. By
aggregating these LAR-adjusted ranks across all layers, TED++ captures how
faithfully an input remains on the evolving class submanifolds. Based on such
characteristic ``tube-constrained'' behaviour, TED++ flags inputs whose
LAR-based ranking sequences deviate significantly. Extensive experiments are
conducted on benchmark datasets and tasks, demonstrating that TED++ achieves
state-of-the-art detection performance under both adaptive-attack and
limited-data scenarios. Remarkably, even with only five held-out examples per
class, TED++ still delivers near-perfect detection, achieving gains of up to
14\% in AUROC over the next-best method. The code is publicly available at

### [239] [Active Measuring in Reinforcement Learning With Delayed Negative Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14315)
*Daiqi Gao,Ziping Xu,Aseel Rawashdeh,Predrag Klasnja,Susan A. Murphy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Actively Observable MDPs let agents choose when to measure latent states, trading measurement costs against reduced uncertainty. A belief-state online RL algorithm with Sequential Monte Carlo is proposed, proven to improve sample efficiency and policy value, and evaluated in digital health applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Measuring hidden states is costly and can affect future outcomes; enabling agents to decide when to observe can reduce uncertainty while accounting for observation costs, aiming to improve data efficiency and policy performance in real-world settings.

Method: Formulate Actively Observable MDP (AOMDP) as a periodic partially observable MDP. Develop an online RL algorithm that operates on belief states. Use Sequential Monte Carlo to jointly approximate the posterior over unknown static environment parameters and unobserved latent states.

Result: The approach provably improves sample efficiency and increases the value of the optimal policy despite observation costs. Empirical evaluation in a digital health task shows the agent learns when to deliver interventions and when to survey health status.

Conclusion: AOMDP extends POMDPs by adding controllable observations, and with belief-state RL and SMC inference it can achieve better data efficiency and policy quality in settings where measurements are costly or potentially disruptive.

Abstract: Measuring states in reinforcement learning (RL) can be costly in real-world
settings and may negatively influence future outcomes. We introduce the
Actively Observable Markov Decision Process (AOMDP), where an agent not only
selects control actions but also decides whether to measure the latent state.
The measurement action reveals the true latent state but may have a negative
delayed effect on the environment. We show that this reduced uncertainty may
provably improve sample efficiency and increase the value of the optimal policy
despite these costs. We formulate an AOMDP as a periodic partially observable
MDP and propose an online RL algorithm based on belief states. To approximate
the belief states, we further propose a sequential Monte Carlo method to
jointly approximate the posterior of unknown static environment parameters and
unobserved latent states. We evaluate the proposed algorithm in a digital
health application, where the agent decides when to deliver digital
interventions and when to assess users' health status through surveys.

### [240] [LLM-ERM: Sample-Efficient Program Learning via LLM-Guided Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14331)
*Shivam Singhal,Eran Malach,Tomaso Poggio,Tomer Galanti*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-ERM uses a reasoning-augmented LLM to propose k candidate short programs, verifies them on data without gradient-based training, and selects the best validated hypothesis. It achieves strong sample efficiency (as few as ~200 samples) and remains computationally tractable, outperforming SGD-based training on short-program families.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between the sample-efficient but computationally expensive length-first search for short programs and gradient-based training that is computationally lighter but can require many samples. The goal is a practical framework for learning succinct hypotheses.

Method: Propose-and-verify framework: sample k candidate programs with a pretrained reasoning-augmented LLM, compile and test each on the data, and return the best verified hypothesis with no feedback, adaptivity, or gradients. The framework preserves ERM-style selection on held-out data. The paper also provides a theoretical result showing that coordinate-wise online mini-batch SGD can require many samples for certain short programs.

Result: Empirically, LLM-ERM solves parity variants, pattern matching, and primality testing with as few as 200 samples; in contrast, SGD-trained transformers overfit even with 100,000 samples.

Conclusion: Language-guided program synthesis can recover much of the statistical efficiency of finite-class ERM while remaining computationally tractable, offering a practical route to learning succinct hypotheses beyond the reach of gradient-based training.

Abstract: We seek algorithms for program learning that are both sample-efficient and
computationally feasible. Classical results show that targets admitting short
program descriptions (e.g., with short ``python code'') can be learned with a
``small'' number of examples (scaling with the size of the code) via
length-first program enumeration, but the search is exponential in description
length. Consequently, Gradient-based training avoids this cost yet can require
exponentially many samples on certain short-program families.
  To address this gap, we introduce LLM-ERM, a propose-and-verify framework
that replaces exhaustive enumeration with an LLM-guided search over candidate
programs while retaining ERM-style selection on held-out data. Specifically, we
draw $k$ candidates with a pretrained reasoning-augmented LLM, compile and
check each on the data, and return the best verified hypothesis, with no
feedback, adaptivity, or gradients. Theoretically, we show that coordinate-wise
online mini-batch SGD requires many samples to learn certain short programs.
{\em Empirically, LLM-ERM solves tasks such as parity variants, pattern
matching, and primality testing with as few as 200 samples, while SGD-trained
transformers overfit even with 100,000 samples}. These results indicate that
language-guided program synthesis recovers much of the statistical efficiency
of finite-class ERM while remaining computationally tractable, offering a
practical route to learning succinct hypotheses beyond the reach of
gradient-based training.

### [241] [DARTS-GT: Differentiable Architecture Search for Graph Transformers with Quantifiable Instance-Specific Interpretability Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14336)
*Shruti Sarika Chakraborty,Peter Minary*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DARTS-GT introduces depth-wise heterogeneous Graph Transformers by decoupling structural encoding from feature representation and using differentiable architecture search to select per-layer GNN operators, enabling interpretability via causal ablations and achieving competitive SOTA performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Transformers are powerful but currently constrained by fixed, uniform GNN types across layers and opaque architectures. There is a need for depth-specific component selection and a quantitative interpretability framework for GTs.

Method: Decouple attention by deriving queries from node features while keys/values come from GNN transformations. Apply Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) to choose optimal GNN operators at each layer, enabling depth-wise heterogeneity inside attention. Develop a causal ablation-based interpretability framework with metrics (Head-deviation, Specialization, Focus) to identify influential heads and nodes.

Result: Empirically competitive: state-of-the-art on four datasets and competitive on others across eight benchmarks. Discovered architectures show dataset-specific patterns. Interpretability analysis finds visual salience and causal importance do not always align, and heterogeneous architectures are more interpretable than baselines.

Conclusion: Depth-wise heterogeneous Graph Transformers guided by architecture search can achieve strong performance while enhancing interpretability. The work provides the first quantitative GT interpretability framework and demonstrates that performance and interpretability need not be traded off.

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as powerful architectures for
graph-structured data, yet remain constrained by rigid designs and lack
quantifiable interpretability. Current state-of-the-art GTs commit to fixed GNN
types across all layers, missing potential benefits of depth-specific component
selection, while their complex architectures become opaque where performance
gains cannot be distinguished between meaningful patterns and spurious
correlations. We redesign GT attention through asymmetry, decoupling structural
encoding from feature representation: queries derive from node features while
keys and values come from GNN transformations. Within this framework, we use
Differentiable ARchiTecture Search (DARTS) to select optimal GNN operators at
each layer, enabling depth-wise heterogeneity inside transformer attention
itself (DARTS-GT). To understand discovered architectures, we develop the first
quantitative interpretability framework for GTs through causal ablation. Our
metrics (Head-deviation, Specialization, and Focus), identify which heads and
nodes drive predictions while enabling model comparison. Experiments across
eight benchmarks show DARTS-GT achieves state-of-the-art on four datasets while
remaining competitive on others, with discovered architectures revealing
dataset-specific patterns. Our interpretability analysis reveals that visual
attention salience and causal importance do not always correlate, indicating
widely used visualization approaches may miss components that actually matter.
Crucially, heterogeneous architectures found by DARTS-GT consistently produced
more interpretable models than baselines, establishing that Graph Transformers
need not choose between performance and interpretability.

*Jaewan Park,Solbee Cho,Jay-Yoon Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stop-RAG presents a value-based adaptive stopping controller for iterative RAG, modeling as finite-horizon MDP and training with Q(λ) targets, yielding better QA accuracy than fixed-depth or prompting-based stopping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce latency, cost, and risk of distracting evidence in iterative retrieval; existing stopping methods (fixed iterations or proxy confidences) are suboptimal at indicating when more retrieval helps.

Method: Model the iterative RAG process as a finite-horizon MDP. Train Stop-RAG with full-width forward-view Q(λ) targets from complete trajectories, enabling a value-based stopping policy compatible with black-box APIs and existing pipelines.

Result: On multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, Stop-RAG outperforms fixed-iteration baselines and prompting-based stopping with LLMs, showing adaptive stopping improves RAG accuracy.

Conclusion: Adaptive stopping is a key missing component in agentic systems; value-based control can enhance the accuracy of RAG systems.

Abstract: Iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models
to answer complex multi-hop questions, but each additional loop increases
latency, costs, and the risk of introducing distracting evidence, motivating
the need for an efficient stopping strategy. Existing methods either use a
predetermined number of iterations or rely on confidence proxies that poorly
reflect whether more retrieval will actually help. We cast iterative RAG as a
finite-horizon Markov decision process and introduce Stop-RAG, a value-based
controller that adaptively decides when to stop retrieving. Trained with
full-width forward-view Q($\lambda$) targets from complete trajectories,
Stop-RAG learns effective stopping policies while remaining compatible with
black-box APIs and existing pipelines. On multi-hop question-answering
benchmarks, Stop-RAG consistently outperforms both fixed-iteration baselines
and prompting-based stopping with LLMs. These results highlight adaptive
stopping as a key missing component in current agentic systems, and demonstrate
that value-based control can improve the accuracy of RAG systems.

*Amandip Sangha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A geometric formulation of automatic differentiation using jet bundles and Weil algebras; reverse-mode as cotangent pullback; Taylor-mode as Weil-algebra evaluation; establishes correctness, stability, and complexity results; enables one-pass mixed-derivative computation via tensorized Weil algebras; frames AD within differential geometry for structure-preserving differentiation in ML and scientific computing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unify and ground AD in differential geometry to reason about correctness, stability, and complexity; enable principled, higher-order derivatives and scalable mixed-derivative computation without combinatorial blow-up.

Method: Model differentiation with jet bundles and Weil algebras; interpret reverse-mode as cotangent pullback and Taylor-mode as evaluation in a Weil algebra; derive functorial identities for reverse-mode, algebraic exactness of higher-order derivatives, and explicit truncation-error bounds; introduce tensorized Weil algebras for one-pass computation of all mixed derivatives with linear cost in the algebra dimension.

Result: Formal statements on correctness and stability; algebraic exactness of higher-order derivatives; explicit truncation-error bounds; one-pass, linear-cost method for all mixed derivatives via tensorized Weil algebras; framework supports structure-preserving differentiation; accompanying code and examples provided.

Conclusion: Differential-geometric AD provides a principled foundation for robust, structure-preserving differentiation in deep learning and scientific computing and can guide the development of new differentiation methods; practical code available.

Abstract: We present a geometric formulation of automatic differentiation (AD) using
jet bundles and Weil algebras. Reverse-mode AD emerges as cotangent-pullback,
while Taylor-mode corresponds to evaluation in a Weil algebra. From these
principles, we derive concise statements on correctness, stability, and
complexity: a functorial identity for reverse-mode, algebraic exactness of
higher-order derivatives, and explicit bounds on truncation error. We further
show that tensorized Weil algebras permit one-pass computation of all mixed
derivatives with cost linear in the algebra dimension, avoiding the
combinatorial blow-up of nested JVP/VJP schedules. This framework interprets AD
theory through the lens of differential geometry and offers a foundation for
developing structure-preserving differentiation methods in deep learning and
scientific computing. Code and examples are available at

### [244] [Are My Optimized Prompts Compromised? Exploring Vulnerabilities of LLM-based Optimizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14381)
*Andrew Zhao,Reshmi Ghosh,Vitor Carvalho,Emily Lawton,Keegan Hines,Gao Huang,Jack W. Stokes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prompt optimization pipelines for LLMs are vulnerable to feedback-based poisoning, more than query injections. A fake-reward attack can escalate risk without reward-model access, and a lightweight highlighting defense can substantially reduce vulnerability while maintaining utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess security risks in the optimization loop of LLM prompting, an area previously underexplored compared to input-side attacks.

Method: Systematic empirical analysis using HarmBench to compare feedback-based vs. query-based poisoning; introduce a fake-reward attack that does not require reward-model access; propose a lightweight highlighting defense and evaluate its impact on attack effectiveness and utility.

Result: Feedback-based attacks significantly increase attack success rate (ASR) by up to 0.48. A fake-reward attack markedly elevates vulnerability without needing reward-model access. The proposed highlighting defense reduces the fake-reward ΔASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without harming utility.

Conclusion: Prompt optimization pipelines constitute a bona fide attack surface; safeguards for feedback channels and optimization frameworks are necessary to mitigate poisoning threats.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) systems now underpin everyday AI applications such
as chatbots, computer-use assistants, and autonomous robots, where performance
often depends on carefully designed prompts. LLM-based prompt optimizers reduce
that effort by iteratively refining prompts from scored feedback, yet the
security of this optimization stage remains underexamined. We present the first
systematic analysis of poisoning risks in LLM-based prompt optimization. Using
HarmBench, we find systems are substantially more vulnerable to manipulated
feedback than to injected queries: feedback-based attacks raise attack success
rate (ASR) by up to $\Delta$ASR = 0.48. We introduce a simple fake-reward
attack that requires no access to the reward model and significantly increases
vulnerability, and we propose a lightweight highlighting defense that reduces
the fake-reward $\Delta$ASR from 0.23 to 0.07 without degrading utility. These
results establish prompt optimization pipelines as a first-class attack surface
and motivate stronger safeguards for feedback channels and optimization
frameworks.

### [245] [SHaRe-SSM: An Oscillatory Spiking Neural Network for Target Variable Modeling in Long Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14386)
*Kartikay Agrawal,Abhijeet Vikram,Vedant Sharma,Vaishnavi N.,Ayon Borthakur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHaRe-SSM is a second-order spiking state-space model for very-long-range sequence modeling that outperforms first-order SSMs and transformers on average, with substantial energy savings and a kernel-based spiking regressor; learnability is achieved via parallel scans.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address energy-inefficient transformers and growing long-range dependencies by leveraging spike-based, multiplication-free dynamics and efficient state-space formulations.

Method: Introduce SHaRe-SSM, a second-order spiking SSM using resonate-and-fire neurons; employ parallel scan implementation to stabilize long-range learning; propose a kernel-based spiking regressor for very long sequences; evaluate energy and performance on sequences up to 50k.

Result: On average, second-order SHaRe-SSM outperforms transformers and first-order SSMs; energy consumption is 73x lower than second-order ANN-based SSMs for an 18k sequence; shows strong performance on 50k sequences; detailed analysis on heterogeneity, dissipation, conservation.

Conclusion: SHaRe-SSM is a promising energy-efficient architecture for long-range sequence modeling, balancing performance and resource constraints; parallel scans enable learnability; kernel regressor extends capability; further analysis on dynamical properties supports robust design.

Abstract: In recent years, with the emergence of large models, there has been a
significant interest in spiking neural networks (SNNs) primarily due to their
energy efficiency, multiplication-free, and sparse event-based deep learning.
Similarly, state space models (SSMs) in varying designs have evolved as a
powerful alternative to transformers for target modeling in long sequences,
thereby overcoming the quadratic dependence on sequence length of a
transformer. Inspired by this progress, we here design SHaRe-SSM (Spiking
Harmonic Resonate and Fire State Space Model), for target variable modeling
(including both classification and regression) for very-long-range sequences.
Our second-order spiking SSM, on average, performs better than transformers or
first-order SSMs while circumventing multiplication operations, making it ideal
for resource-constrained applications. The proposed block consumes $73 \times$
less energy than second-order ANN-based SSMs for an 18k sequence, while
retaining performance. To ensure learnability over the long-range sequences, we
propose exploiting the stable and efficient implementation of the dynamical
system using parallel scans. Moreover, for the first time, we propose a
kernel-based spiking regressor using resonate and fire neurons for very
long-range sequences. Our network shows superior performance on even a 50k
sequence while being significantly energy-efficient. In addition, we conducted
a systematic analysis of the impact of heterogeneity, dissipation, and
conservation in resonate-and-fire SSMs.

### [246] [Revisit Modality Imbalance at the Decision Layer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14411)
*Xiaoyu Ma,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Modality imbalance in multimodal learning persists at the decision layer, biasing results toward dominant modalities; balancing at fusion alone is insufficient; adaptive decision-layer weighting is needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate modality bias that harms joint optimization and performance in multimodal systems, especially at the decision stage.

Method: Empirical analysis on audio-visual datasets CREMAD and Kinetic-Sounds; examine pretraining, balanced optimization, feature-space disparities, and decision-weight distributions; evaluate impact of uncalibrated fusion on modality contributions.

Result: Identified systematic bias toward certain modalities (e.g., audio) even after extensive pretraining; bias arises from intrinsic feature-space and decision-weight disparities, not solely optimization dynamics; fusion-stage aggregation leads to biased weights that suppress weaker modalities.

Conclusion: Calls for adaptive, calibrated weight allocation mechanisms at the decision layer to balance modalities according to their capabilities, improving multimodal fusion performance.

Abstract: Multimodal learning integrates information from different modalities to
enhance model performance, yet it often suffers from modality imbalance, where
dominant modalities overshadow weaker ones during joint optimization. This
paper reveals that such an imbalance not only occurs during representation
learning but also manifests significantly at the decision layer. Experiments on
audio-visual datasets (CREMAD and Kinetic-Sounds) show that even after
extensive pretraining and balanced optimization, models still exhibit
systematic bias toward certain modalities, such as audio. Further analysis
demonstrates that this bias originates from intrinsic disparities in
feature-space and decision-weight distributions rather than from optimization
dynamics alone. We argue that aggregating uncalibrated modality outputs at the
fusion stage leads to biased decision-layer weighting, hindering weaker
modalities from contributing effectively. To address this, we propose that
future multimodal systems should focus more on incorporate adaptive weight
allocation mechanisms at the decision layer, enabling relative balanced
according to the capabilities of each modality.

### [247] [Interaction Concordance Index: Performance Evaluation for Interaction Prediction Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14419)
*Tapio Pahikkala,Riikka Numminen,Parisa Movahedi,Napsu Karmitsa,Antti Airola*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new metric, the IC-index, assesses how well models predict the direction of interaction effects in drug-target affinity (DTA) data, complementing traditional strength-based predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing DTA predictions focus on affinity strength but ignore whether models capture interaction directions between drug–target pairs. The IC-index provides a ratio-based measure of correctly predicted interaction directions and helps diagnose when models fail to learn interactions, especially due to permutation symmetry and data unseen scenarios.

Method: Define IC-index for fixed predictors and ML models; prove invariance for predictors that cannot capture interactions; show permutation equivariance in models (drug/target identity handling) prevents learning interactions when some entities are unseen; propose remedy by incorporating informative side information for drugs and targets; conduct comprehensive empirical evaluation across multiple biomedical interaction datasets with state-of-the-art ML models.

Result: IC-index serves as a complementary performance estimator to traditional DTA metrics, revealing differences in how various affinity prediction methods capture interaction directions; results indicate that models that include meaningful side information and break permutation equivariance perform better on IC-index, underscoring the importance of capturing interaction effects beyond mere affinity strength.

Conclusion: The IC-index is a valuable diagnostic and predictive tool for interaction-aware modeling in DTA problems, guiding model design (e.g., using side information) to better capture the directional nature of interactions.

Abstract: Consider two sets of entities and their members' mutual affinity values, say
drug-target affinities (DTA). Drugs and targets are said to interact in their
effects on DTAs if drug's effect on it depends on the target. Presence of
interaction implies that assigning a drug to a target and another drug to
another target does not provide the same aggregate DTA as the reversed
assignment would provide. Accordingly, correctly capturing interactions enables
better decision-making, for example, in allocation of limited numbers of drug
doses to their best matching targets. Learning to predict DTAs is popularly
done from either solely from known DTAs or together with side information on
the entities, such as chemical structures of drugs and targets. In this paper,
we introduce interaction directions' prediction performance estimator we call
interaction concordance index (IC-index), for both fixed predictors and machine
learning algorithms aimed for inferring them. IC-index complements the
popularly used DTA prediction performance estimators by evaluating the ratio of
correctly predicted directions of interaction effects in data. First, we show
the invariance of IC-index on predictors unable to capture interactions.
Secondly, we show that learning algorithm's permutation equivariance regarding
drug and target identities implies its inability to capture interactions when
either drug, target or both are unseen during training. In practical
applications, this equivariance is remedied via incorporation of appropriate
side information on drugs and targets. We make a comprehensive empirical
evaluation over several biomedical interaction data sets with various
state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. The experiments demonstrate how
different types of affinity strength prediction methods perform in terms of
IC-index complementing existing prediction performance estimators.

*Ruijie Miao,Yilun Yao,Zihan Wang,Zhiming Wang,Bairen Yi,LingJun Liu,Yikai Zhao,Tong Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Optimization-based compression for Mixture-of-Experts (MergeMoE) by merging experts’ outputs via extra forward-pass matrices, outperforming baselines at the same compression ratio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE models enable scalable capacity but incur high memory usage; there is a need for principled, effective compression methods.

Method: Reframe expert merging as inserting additional matrices into the forward computation; formulate an optimization problem to construct these compression matrices; propose MergeMoE to solve the optimization and generate compression matrices; evaluate on multiple MoE models and compare to baselines.

Result: MergeMoE consistently outperforms baselines at equal compression ratios across several MoE models.

Conclusion: Interpreting expert merging as output-level insertion with optimization yields a principled, effective compression method for MoE models; MergeMoE provides a practical approach to compress large MoE architectures.

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) technique has proven to be a promising solution
to efficiently scale the model size, which has been widely applied in recent
LLM advancements. However, the substantial memory overhead of MoE models has
made their compression an important research direction. In this work, we
provide a theoretical analysis of expert merging, a recently proposed technique
for compressing MoE models. Rather than interpreting expert merging from the
conventional perspective of parameter aggregation, we approach it from the
perspective of merging experts' outputs. Our key insight is that the merging
process can be interpreted as inserting additional matrices into the forward
computation, which naturally leads to an optimization formulation. Building on
this analysis, we introduce MergeMoE, a method that leverages mathematical
optimization to construct the compression matrices. We evaluate MergeMoE on
multiple MoE models and show that our algorithm consistently outperforms the
baselines with the same compression ratios.

### [249] [A Free Lunch in LLM Compression: Revisiting Retraining after Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14444)
*Moritz Wagner,Christophe Roux,Max Zimmer,Sebastian Pokutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Post-pruning reconstruction for LLMs can outperform full retraining. Reconstructing attention and MLP within each transformer block separately is nearly the most resource-efficient and yields best perplexity, often beating full retraining at a fraction of memory. Simple pruning criteria like Wanda can outperform more complex methods when reconstruction is done correctly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pruning large language models is computationally expensive to retrain. This work investigates whether coarse-grained reconstruction after pruning can recover or surpass performance, and what granularity and criteria yield Pareto-optimal results.

Method: Extensive computational study on state-of-the-art GPT architectures, comparing reconstruction granularity (per-attention/MLP within a block) vs broader block-level reconstruction, evaluating pruning criteria (e.g., Wanda) vs more complex methods, and comparing against full retraining in terms of perplexity and memory usage.

Result: Reconstructing attention and MLP components separately within each transformer block achieves near-optimal resource use and best perplexity. This Pareto-optimal setup can surpass full retraining while using only a fraction of memory. Simple pruning criteria like Wanda can outperform complex approaches when reconstruction is properly executed.

Conclusion: The notion that retraining must be avoided at all costs is challenged. With careful reconstruction design, post-pruning performance can match or exceed full retraining at much lower memory costs, highlighting the critical role of reconstruction strategy in LLM pruning.

Abstract: While Neural Network pruning typically requires retraining the model to
recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large
Language Models (LLMs) pruning methods instead solve a layer-wise mask
selection and reconstruction problem on a small set of calibration data to
avoid full retraining, as it is considered computationally infeasible for LLMs.
Reconstructing single matrices in isolation has favorable properties, such as
convexity of the objective and significantly reduced memory requirements
compared to full retraining. In practice, however, reconstruction is often
implemented at coarser granularities, e.g., reconstructing a whole transformer
block against its dense activations instead of a single matrix. In this work,
we study the key design choices when reconstructing or retraining the remaining
weights after pruning. We conduct an extensive computational study on
state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and report several surprising findings that
challenge common intuitions about retraining after pruning. In particular, we
observe a free lunch scenario: reconstructing attention and MLP components
separately within each transformer block is nearly the most resource-efficient
yet achieves the best perplexity. Most importantly, this Pareto-optimal setup
achieves better performance than full retraining, despite requiring only a
fraction of the memory. Furthermore, we demonstrate that simple and efficient
pruning criteria such as Wanda can outperform much more complex approaches when
the reconstruction step is properly executed, highlighting its importance. Our
findings challenge the narrative that retraining should be avoided at all costs
and provide important insights into post-pruning performance recovery for LLMs.

### [250] [Towards geological inference with process-based and deep generative modeling, part 1: training on fluvial deposits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14445)
*Guillaume Rongier,Luk Peeters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GANs can effectively generate 3D fluvial deposits from a process-based training set, maintaining non-stationarity and structural detail without mode collapse; suggests robustness and potential to embed geological laws like the law of superposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reproduce realistic, continuous geological structures (fluvial deposits) with generative models, address limitations of current methods in capturing continuity and non-stationarity, and leverage process-based data to embed physical principles and expand uncertainty quantification.

Method: Train a GAN on 3D images of fluvial deposits produced by a process-based simulator. Conduct an ablation study to transfer 2D image-generation advances to 3D, ensure stable training, and validate via non-stationarity and law-of-superposition checks. Use process-based data to include properties beyond standard physical properties.

Result: Training remains stable; generated samples reproduce non-stationarity and fine-grained details without mode collapse or memorization. Process-based training data enables including additional properties. Deposition time is used to validate that samples obey the law of superposition. Authors report robustness of GANs for targeted geological structures; scalability to larger 3D images and multimodal datasets remains an open question.

Conclusion: GANs show promise for generating realistic fluvial geology and can leverage geological principles, with robustness demonstrated on the studied dataset. Future work should test scalability to larger 3D volumes and incorporate multiple data modalities or broader geological processes.

Abstract: The distribution of resources in the subsurface is deeply linked to the
variations of its physical properties. Generative modeling has long been used
to predict those physical properties while quantifying the associated
uncertainty. But current approaches struggle to properly reproduce geological
structures, and fluvial deposits in particular, because of their continuity.
This study explores whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of
deep-learning algorithm for generative modeling - can be trained to reproduce
fluvial deposits simulated by a process-based model - a more expensive model
that mimics geological processes. An ablation study shows that developments
from the deep-learning community to generate large 2D images are directly
transferable to 3D images of fluvial deposits. Training remains stable, and the
generated samples reproduce the non-stationarity and details of the deposits
without mode collapse or pure memorization of the training data. Using a
process-based model to generate those training data allows us to include
valuable properties other than the usual physical properties. We show how the
deposition time let us monitor and validate the performance of a GAN by
checking that its samples honor the law of superposition. Our work joins a
series of previous studies suggesting that GANs are more robust that given
credit for, at least for training datasets targeting specific geological
structures. Whether this robustness transfers to larger 3D images and
multimodal datasets remains to be seen. Exploring how deep generative models
can leverage geological principles like the law of superposition shows a lot of
promise.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Empirical comparison of One-vs-Rest logistic regression on the UCI Wine dataset, contrasting from-scratch gradient descent with scikit-learn solvers, highlighting L1-induced sparsity and a 5-feature subset that preserves performance while greatly reducing complexity; supports real-time, cost-aware deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate accuracy, feature dimensionality, and interpretability trade-offs in production-ready analytical chemistry models; quantify gains from optimized solvers and L1 regularization for sparse, fast deployment.

Method: Train One-vs-Rest logistic regression on the Wine dataset using a from-scratch gradient descent implementation and scikit-learn solvers; evaluate L1 regularization impact on feature sparsity; perform class-specific analysis to identify chemical signatures; propose an optimal 5-feature subset and quantify complexity/cost/time benefits; assess generalization and latency.

Result: Manual gradient descent achieves 92.59% mean test accuracy with smooth convergence; scikit-learn provides 24x faster training and 98.15% accuracy; L1 regularization yields 54–69% feature reduction with ~4.63% accuracy loss; optimal 5-feature subset achieves 62% complexity reduction with 92–94% accuracy; estimated cost savings per sample and sub-2 ms prediction latency.

Conclusion: The study offers actionable guidelines for practitioners to balance comprehensive chemical analysis against targeted feature measurement in resource-constrained environments, demonstrating that sparse, fast models can achieve robust real-time quality control while maintaining acceptable accuracy.

Abstract: Multi-class wine classification presents fundamental trade-offs between model
accuracy, feature dimensionality, and interpretability - critical factors for
production deployment in analytical chemistry. This paper presents a
comprehensive empirical study of One-vs-Rest logistic regression on the UCI
Wine dataset (178 samples, 3 cultivars, 13 chemical features), comparing
from-scratch gradient descent implementation against scikit-learn's optimized
solvers and quantifying L1 regularization effects on feature sparsity. Manual
gradient descent achieves 92.59 percent mean test accuracy with smooth
convergence, validating theoretical foundations, though scikit-learn provides
24x training speedup and 98.15 percent accuracy. Class-specific analysis
reveals distinct chemical signatures with heterogeneous patterns where color
intensity varies dramatically (0.31 to 16.50) across cultivars. L1
regularization produces 54-69 percent feature reduction with only 4.63 percent
accuracy decrease, demonstrating favorable interpretability-performance
trade-offs. We propose an optimal 5-feature subset achieving 62 percent
complexity reduction with estimated 92-94 percent accuracy, enabling
cost-effective deployment with 80 dollars savings per sample and 56 percent
time reduction. Statistical validation confirms robust generalization with
sub-2ms prediction latency suitable for real-time quality control. Our findings
provide actionable guidelines for practitioners balancing comprehensive
chemical analysis against targeted feature measurement in resource-constrained
environments.

TL;DR: MECo links high-level editing intents with executable edits for molecular optimization by translating LLM-generated intentions into code, yielding high fidelity edits and improved downstream performance with interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs often generate editing goals but fail to faithfully execute modifications on complex, non-intuitive representations like SMILES; there is a need to bridge reasoning with actionable, verifiable edits to enable reliable, controllable molecular design and human-AI collaboration.

Method: A cascaded framework: (1) an LLM generates human-interpretable editing intentions from a molecule and a target property; (2) those intentions are translated into executable structural edits via code generation, producing precise edits that can be applied to the molecule.

Result: Achieves >98% accuracy in reproducing held-out realistic edits derived from reactions and target-specific pairs. On optimization benchmarks across physicochemical properties and activities, consistency improves by 38–86 percentage points to 90%+, and success rates surpass SMILES-based baselines while maintaining structural similarity.

Conclusion: Aligning intention with execution enables consistent, controllable, and interpretable molecular design, laying the groundwork for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative human-AI drug discovery workflows.

Abstract: Molecular optimization is a central task in drug discovery that requires
precise structural reasoning and domain knowledge. While large language models
(LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level editing intentions in
natural language, they often struggle to faithfully execute these
modifications-particularly when operating on non-intuitive representations like
SMILES. We introduce MECo, a framework that bridges reasoning and execution by
translating editing actions into executable code. MECo reformulates molecular
optimization for LLMs as a cascaded framework: generating human-interpretable
editing intentions from a molecule and property goal, followed by translating
those intentions into executable structural edits via code generation. Our
approach achieves over 98% accuracy in reproducing held-out realistic edits
derived from chemical reactions and target-specific compound pairs. On
downstream optimization benchmarks spanning physicochemical properties and
target activities, MECo substantially improves consistency by 38-86 percentage
points to 90%+ and achieves higher success rates over SMILES-based baselines
while preserving structural similarity. By aligning intention with execution,
MECo enables consistent, controllable and interpretable molecular design,
laying the foundation for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative
human-AI workflows in drug discovery.

*Ling Zhang,Xianliang Yang,Juwon Yu,Park Cheonyoung,Lei Song,Jiang Bian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ICA enables principled data value estimation and per-example reweighting for fine-tuning LMs, using in-context holdout conditioning to proxy holdout loss without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy or off-target data can dilute supervision in fine-tuning, and though small, curated datasets can match large ones, there is a need for principled, efficient data selection methods that avoid heuristics and retraining.

Method: Introduce In-Context Approximation (ICA) to estimate the holdout loss a model would incur after training on a candidate example by conditioning on a small, curated holdout set in context. Under local linearization, ICA approximates a first-order update toward the holdout optimum. Per-example weights are derived from ICA scores to dynamically reweight gradient updates as training evolves. The method is evaluated across SFT, DPO, and SimPO on diverse backbones and datasets, with analyses of score-update frequency and holdout-set size.

Result: ICA-based reweighting consistently improves alignment with minimal overhead across tasks and models. The paper analyzes sensitivity to update frequency and k, and notes limitations for rapidly drifting on-policy updates, suggesting directions for future work.

Conclusion: ICA provides a theoretically grounded, resource-efficient framework for data selection and reweighting in LM fine-tuning, enabling better alignment with reduced computational costs; future work includes addressing rapid on-policy drift and releasing code/prompts.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained language models is a common approach for
aligning them with human preferences, but noisy or off-target examples can
dilute supervision. While small, well-chosen datasets often match the
performance of much larger ones, systematic and efficient ways to identify
high-value training data remain underexplored. Many current methods rely on
heuristics or expensive retraining. We present a theoretically grounded,
resource-efficient framework for data selection and reweighting. At its core is
an In-Context Approximation (ICA) that estimates the holdout loss a model would
incur after training on a candidate example by conditioning on a small, curated
holdout set in context. ICA requires no reference model and no additional
finetuning. Under a local linearization, ICA is equivalent to a first-order
update toward the holdout optimum, motivating its use as a proxy for data
value. We derive per-example weights from ICA scores, dynamically reweighting
gradient updates as model parameters evolve. Across SFT, DPO, and SimPO, and
over diverse backbones and datasets, ICA-based reweighting consistently
improves model alignment with minimal overhead. We analyze sensitivity to score
update frequency and the choice of $k$ holdout examples for in-context
demonstrations, and note limitations for rapidly drifting on-policy updates,
highlighting directions for future work. Code and prompts will be released.

### [254] [From Guess2Graph: When and How Can Unreliable Experts Safely Boost Causal Discovery in Finite Samples?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14488)
*Sujai Hiremath,Dominik Janzing,Philipp Faller,Patrick Blöbaum,Elke Kirschbaum,Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan,Kyra Gan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Guess2Graph (G2G) uses expert guesses to guide the sequence of statistical tests in causal discovery, preserving statistical correctness while improving finite-sample performance. It has two instantiations: PC-Guess (augments PC) and gPC-Guess (learning-augmented). gPC-Guess particularly benefits from higher-quality expert input and outperforms non-augmented methods when experts are better than random; empirical results show monotone gains with expert accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal discovery struggles with limited samples. Expert knowledge (including from language models) could improve performance, but guarantees for existing constraint-based methods often require perfect predictions or uncertainty estimates, which are unrealistic. There is a need for a framework that leverages expert input without sacrificing statistical guarantees.

Method: Introduce the Guess2Graph (G2G) framework that uses expert guesses to guide the sequence of statistical tests rather than replacing them. Two instantiations: PC-Guess, which augments the PC algorithm; and gPC-Guess, a learning-augmented variant designed to better leverage high-quality expert input. Theoretical results show correctness is preserved regardless of expert error; in finite samples, gPC-Guess provably outperforms its non-augmented counterpart when experts are better than random. Empirical results show monotonic improvement with expert accuracy, with gPC-Guess achieving stronger gains.

Result: Theoretical guarantees: both PC-Guess and gPC-Guess preserve correctness regardless of expert error; gPC-Guess outperforms the non-augmented method in finite samples when experts are better than random. Empirically: both methods exhibit monotonic performance gains as expert accuracy increases; gPC-Guess yields significantly stronger gains than PC-Guess.

Conclusion: G2G provides a safe and practical framework to incorporate expert guidance into causal discovery, improving finite-sample performance without sacrificing correctness. It enables leveraging high-quality expert input (including from LLMs) in a principled way, with stronger gains when expert input is reliable.

Abstract: Causal discovery algorithms often perform poorly with limited samples. While
integrating expert knowledge (including from LLMs) as constraints promises to
improve performance, guarantees for existing methods require perfect
predictions or uncertainty estimates, making them unreliable for practical use.
We propose the Guess2Graph (G2G) framework, which uses expert guesses to guide
the sequence of statistical tests rather than replacing them. This maintains
statistical consistency while enabling performance improvements. We develop two
instantiations of G2G: PC-Guess, which augments the PC algorithm, and
gPC-Guess, a learning-augmented variant designed to better leverage
high-quality expert input. Theoretically, both preserve correctness regardless
of expert error, with gPC-Guess provably outperforming its non-augmented
counterpart in finite samples when experts are "better than random."
Empirically, both show monotonic improvement with expert accuracy, with
gPC-Guess achieving significantly stronger gains.

### [255] [Learning to Undo: Rollback-Augmented Reinforcement Learning with Reversibility Signals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14503)
*Andrejs Sorstkins,Omer Tariq,Muhammad Bilal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reversibility-aware, value-based RL framework combines an online state-action reversibility estimator Phi and a selective rollback operator to enhance safety, robustness, and efficiency. It penalizes irreversible or low-return trajectories and reverts to prior states to prevent catastrophic or suboptimal decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Value-based reinforcement learning often suffers from overestimation and instability, especially in environments with partial irreversibility. There is a need for mechanisms that improve safety and reliability without sacrificing performance.

Method: Introduce Phi(s,a) as an online estimate of the likelihood of returning to a prior state within horizon K; dynamically adjust TD penalties using reversibility. Implement a selective rollback operator that reverts to the previous state when an action yields a markedly lower expected return than its current value and crosses a threshold. Evaluate the approach on CliffWalking v0 and Taxi v3, with ablation studies to isolate rollback effects.

Result: Substantial safety and performance gains: in CliffWalking v0, catastrophic falls were reduced by >99.8% and mean episode return rose by 55%; in Taxi v3, illegal actions were suppressed by ≥99.9% and cumulative reward improved by 65.7%, with reduced reward variance. Ablation confirms the rollback mechanism as the key contributor to these gains.

Conclusion: A reversibility-aware evaluation paired with a targeted rollback yields safer, more reliable value-based RL with improved stability and performance; the rollback component is essential for achieving these improvements.

Abstract: This paper proposes a reversible learning framework to improve the robustness
and efficiency of value based Reinforcement Learning agents, addressing
vulnerability to value overestimation and instability in partially irreversible
environments. The framework has two complementary core mechanisms: an
empirically derived transition reversibility measure called Phi of s and a, and
a selective state rollback operation. We introduce an online per state action
estimator called Phi that quantifies the likelihood of returning to a prior
state within a fixed horizon K. This measure is used to adjust the penalty term
during temporal difference updates dynamically, integrating reversibility
awareness directly into the value function. The system also includes a
selective rollback operator. When an action yields an expected return markedly
lower than its instantaneous estimated value and violates a predefined
threshold, the agent is penalized and returns to the preceding state rather
than progressing. This interrupts sub optimal high risk trajectories and avoids
catastrophic steps. By combining reversibility aware evaluation with targeted
rollback, the method improves safety, performance, and stability. In the
CliffWalking v0 domain, the framework reduced catastrophic falls by over 99.8
percent and yielded a 55 percent increase in mean episode return. In the Taxi
v3 domain, it suppressed illegal actions by greater than or equal to 99.9
percent and achieved a 65.7 percent improvement in cumulative reward, while
also sharply reducing reward variance in both environments. Ablation studies
confirm that the rollback mechanism is the critical component underlying these
safety and performance gains, marking a robust step toward safe and reliable
sequential decision making.

### [256] [Enhancing Time Series Forecasting through Selective Representation Spaces: A Patch Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14510)
*Xingjian Wu,Xiangfei Qiu,Hanyin Cheng,Zhengyu Li,Jilin Hu,Chenjuan Guo,Bin Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Selective Representation Space (SRS) module for time series forecasting uses learnable selective patching and dynamic reassembly to flexibly select and shuffle informative patches, forming a selective representation space. It yields SRSNet (SRS + MLP head) with state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets and can serve as a plugin to existing patch-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional patching partitions time series into adjacent patches, producing a fixed representation space that may miss informative patches and hinder modeling long-term dependencies. A flexible, selective representation space could better exploit contextual information for forecasting.

Method: Introduce the Selective Representation Space (SRS) module with two components: learnable Selective Patching (choose informative patches) and Dynamic Reassembly (shuffle/compose patches) to construct a mutable representation space from contextual time series. Integrate SRS into patch-based models to form SRSNet (SRS + an MLP head). Demonstrate its plug-in potential by improving existing patch-based models.

Result: SRS achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains. SRS can serve as a plug-in module to enhance existing patch-based models, and code is provided for reproducibility.

Conclusion: Selective and dynamic construction of a representation space via SRS enables more expressive representations for time series forecasting and can be deployed as a plug-and-play enhancement for patch-based models.

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting has made significant progress with the help of
Patching technique, which partitions time series into multiple patches to
effectively retain contextual semantic information into a representation space
beneficial for modeling long-term dependencies. However, conventional patching
partitions a time series into adjacent patches, which causes a fixed
representation space, thus resulting in insufficiently expressful
representations. In this paper, we pioneer the exploration of constructing a
selective representation space to flexibly include the most informative patches
for forecasting. Specifically, we propose the Selective Representation Space
(SRS) module, which utilizes the learnable Selective Patching and Dynamic
Reassembly techniques to adaptively select and shuffle the patches from the
contextual time series, aiming at fully exploiting the information of
contextual time series to enhance the forecasting performance of patch-based
models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SRS module, we propose a simple yet
effective SRSNet consisting of SRS and an MLP head, which achieves
state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets from multiple domains.
Furthermore, as a novel plugin-and-play module, SRS can also enhance the
performance of existing patch-based models. The resources are available at

### [257] [On the Identifiability of Tensor Ranks via Prior Predictive Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14523)
*Eliezer da Silva,Arto Klami,Diego Mesquita,Iñigo Urteaga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A probabilistic framework for rank identifiability in tensor factorization via prior predictive moment matching; CP/TT/TR are identifiable; Tucker is not; provides closed-form estimators for identifiable models and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Selecting tensor ranks is ill-posed and heuristic; need principled identifiability criteria using probabilistic models and moments.

Method: Transform moment matching conditions into a log-linear system in marginal moments, priors, and ranks; analyze four tensor models (CP, Tensor Train, Tensor Ring, Tucker); derive solvability conditions; obtain closed-form estimators; test on data moments.

Result: Identifiable: CP, TT, TR; Unidentifiable: Tucker under this approach; closed-form rank estimators exist for identifiable models; empirical validation supports robustness and applicability.

Conclusion: This framework provides principled rank identifiability tests and estimators from data moments, clarifying when ranks are identifiable in common tensor models and guiding rank selection.

Abstract: Selecting the latent dimensions (ranks) in tensor factorization is a central
challenge that often relies on heuristic methods. This paper introduces a
rigorous approach to determine rank identifiability in probabilistic tensor
models, based on prior predictive moment matching. We transform a set of moment
matching conditions into a log-linear system of equations in terms of marginal
moments, prior hyperparameters, and ranks; establishing an equivalence between
rank identifiability and the solvability of such system. We apply this
framework to four foundational tensor-models, demonstrating that the linear
structure of the PARAFAC/CP model, the chain structure of the Tensor Train
model, and the closed-loop structure of the Tensor Ring model yield solvable
systems, making their ranks identifiable. In contrast, we prove that the
symmetric topology of the Tucker model leads to an underdetermined system,
rendering the ranks unidentifiable by this method. For the identifiable models,
we derive explicit closed-form rank estimators based on the moments of observed
data only. We empirically validate these estimators and evaluate the robustness
of the proposal.

TL;DR: AEPO introduces an entropy-balanced agentic RL framework to stabilize training and improve long-horizon web-agent tool use by balancing entropy during rollout and updates, achieving strong few-shot performance across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Entropy-driven exploration in agentic RL can cause training collapse or over-constraining behavior. There is a need to balance entropy signals during rollout and policy updates to better learn from high-uncertainty tokens and maintain diverse exploration.

Method: Two core components: (1) dynamic entropy-balanced rollout that adaptively allocates sampling budget (global and branch) with entropy pre-monitoring and a branch penalty to curb excessive branching; (2) entropy-balanced policy optimization that inserts a stop-gradient into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve gradients, plus entropy-aware advantage estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens.

Result: AEPO outperforms 7 mainstream RL algorithms across 14 challenging datasets. With only 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B+AEPO achieves notable Pass@1/Pass@5 scores on GAIA, Humanity's Last Exam, and WebWalker, indicating improved rollout sampling diversity and stable policy entropy, enabling scalable web agent training.

Conclusion: Entropy-balanced agentic RL can mitigate entropy-induced training issues, promote diverse exploration, and support scalable, high-quality web-agent training.

Abstract: Recently, Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has made significant
progress in incentivizing the multi-turn, long-horizon tool-use capabilities of
web agents. While mainstream agentic RL algorithms autonomously explore
high-uncertainty tool-call steps under the guidance of entropy, excessive
reliance on entropy signals can impose further constraints, leading to the
training collapse. In this paper, we delve into the challenges caused by
entropy and propose the Agentic Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization (AEPO), an
agentic RL algorithm designed to balance entropy in both the rollout and policy
update phases. AEPO comprises two core components: (1) a dynamic
entropy-balanced rollout mechanism that adaptively allocate global and branch
sampling budget through entropy pre-monitoring, while imposing a branch penalty
on consecutive high-entropy tool-call steps to prevent over-branching issues;
and (2) Entropy-Balanced Policy Optimization that inserts a stop-gradient
operation into the high-entropy clipping term to preserve and properly rescale
gradients on high-entropy tokens, while incorporating entropy-aware advantage
estimation to prioritize learning on high-uncertainty tokens. Results across 14
challenging datasets show that AEPO consistently outperforms 7 mainstream RL
algorithms. With just 1K RL samples, Qwen3-14B with AEPO achieves impressive
results: 47.6% on GAIA, 11.2% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 43.0% on WebWalker
for Pass@1; 65.0% on GAIA, 26.0% on Humanity's Last Exam, and 70.0% on
WebWalker for Pass@5. Further analysis reveals that AEPO improves rollout
sampling diversity while maintaining stable policy entropy, facilitating
scalable web agent training.

*Jungi Lee,Junyong Park,Soohyun Cha,Jaehoon Cho,Jaewoong Sim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MX+ extends MX block-floating-point formats to handle outliers by repurposing the exponent field as an extended mantissa, improving LLM performance with negligible overhead over MXFP4/6.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce precision requirements for cost-effective LLM serving while avoiding intrusive software/hardware changes; address outliers in ultra low-bit BFPs within industry-driven MX formats.

Method: Introduce MX+, an extension to microscaling (MX) formats that reuses the exponent field as an extended mantissa for the outlier element, enabling higher precision without data-type changes across the rest of the block.

Result: MX+ yields significantly higher language model performance than 4-bit MX (MXFP4) with negligible storage overhead and slowdown, making it a strong alternative to MXFP4/6 for efficient LLM inference.

Conclusion: MX+ provides a non-intrusive, cost-effective path to better LLM inference performance using MX-format blocks by addressing outliers with an extended mantissa, suitable for deployment across hardware vendors.

Abstract: Reduced-precision data formats are crucial for cost-effective serving of
large language models (LLMs). While numerous reduced-precision formats have
been introduced thus far, they often require intrusive modifications to the
software frameworks or are rather unconventional for widespread adoption across
hardware vendors. In this paper, we instead focus on recent industry-driven
variants of block floating-point (BFP) formats and conduct a comprehensive
analysis to push their limits for efficient LLM serving. Our analysis shows
that existing ultra low-bit BFP variants struggle to provide reasonable
language model performance due to outlier values in blocks. To address the
outliers with BFPs, we propose MX+, a cost-effective and non-intrusive
extension designed for seamless integration into the microscaling (MX) formats.
MX+ builds on the key insight that the outlier does not need to use its
exponent field in the element data type, which allows us to repurpose the
exponent field as an extended mantissa to increase the precision of the outlier
element. Our evaluation shows that MX+ achieves significantly higher model
performance compared to the 4-bit MX format (MXFP4) with negligible storage
overhead and slowdown, thus offering a compelling alternative to MXFP4 or MXFP6
for efficient LLM inference.

*Yue Hou,He Zhu,Ruomei Liu,Yingke Su,Junran Wu,Ke Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RedOUT is an unsupervised framework for graph OOD detection that uses a redundancy-aware information bottleneck and structural entropy to prune redundant structure, yielding better OOD detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distributional shifts between training and test data cause OOD samples in graph classification. Structural redundancy can induce semantic shifts, limiting data-centric OOD methods. A test-time, unsupervised approach leveraging structural entropy can mitigate this.

Method: Introduce ReGIB (Redundancy-aware Graph Information Bottleneck) to decompose information into essential content and redundant parts. Minimize structural entropy to reduce redundancy and derive theoretical upper and lower bounds to guide optimization.

Result: Experiments on real-world graphs show strong OOD detection performance, with an average improvement of 6.7% over baselines and a 17.3% advantage on the ClinTox/LIPO dataset pair.

Conclusion: RedOUT effectively addresses redundancy-driven semantic shifts in graph OOD detection via an unsupervised, theory-grounded framework, delivering notable empirical gains and a principled optimization objective.

Abstract: Distributional discrepancy between training and test data can lead models to
make inaccurate predictions when encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) samples
in real-world applications. Although existing graph OOD detection methods
leverage data-centric techniques to extract effective representations, their
performance remains compromised by structural redundancy that induces semantic
shifts. To address this dilemma, we propose RedOUT, an unsupervised framework
that integrates structural entropy into test-time OOD detection for graph
classification. Concretely, we introduce the Redundancy-aware Graph Information
Bottleneck (ReGIB) and decompose the objective into essential information and
irrelevant redundancy. By minimizing structural entropy, the decoupled
redundancy is reduced, and theoretically grounded upper and lower bounds are
proposed for optimization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of RedOUT on OOD detection. Specifically,
our method achieves an average improvement of 6.7%, significantly surpassing
the best competitor by 17.3% on the ClinTox/LIPO dataset pair.

### [261] [State-Space Models for Tabular Prior-Data Fitted Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14573)
*Felix Koch,Marcel Wever,Fabian Raisch,Benjamin Tischler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates using Hydra, a bidirectional, linear-time structured state space model (SSM), as an efficient alternative to Transformers in TabPFN for tabular data. It addresses the order-sensitivity of SSMs by adopting a bidirectional approach and demonstrates that this reduces order dependence while achieving predictive performance competitive with the original TabPFN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers achieve strong Bayesian-like inference for tabular data (as in TabPFN) but have quadratic complexity in sequence length. SSMs like Hydra offer linear-time inference but are inherently order-sensitive, which is undesirable for tabular data where row order is semantically meaningless. The work aims to reconcile efficiency with permutation invariance in tabular tasks.

Method: Introduce a bidirectional Hydra (SSM) architecture to enable symmetric context aggregation over tabular inputs. Evaluate its order-dependence and predictive performance on tabular tasks, comparing against the original TabPFN Transformer-based approach to determine if the efficient SSM can match the Transformer’s performance while reducing order sensitivity.

Result: The bidirectional Hydra approach reduces the order-dependence of the model and achieves predictive performance competitive with the original TabPFN Transformer-based model on tabular tasks.

Conclusion: A bidirectional, linear-time SSM like Hydra can preserve computational efficiency while mitigating order sensitivity, making it a viable alternative to Transformers for foundation models in tabular data. Further work could explore broader datasets, robustness, and integration with Bayesian inference pipelines.

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models for tabular data, such as TabPFN,
demonstrated that pretrained Transformer architectures can approximate Bayesian
inference with high predictive performance. However, Transformers suffer from
quadratic complexity with respect to sequence length, motivating the
exploration of more efficient sequence models. In this work, we investigate the
potential of using Hydra, a bidirectional linear-time structured state space
model (SSM), as an alternative to Transformers in TabPFN. A key challenge lies
in SSM's inherent sensitivity to the order of input tokens - an undesirable
property for tabular datasets where the row order is semantically meaningless.
We investigate to what extent a bidirectional approach can preserve efficiency
and enable symmetric context aggregation. Our experiments show that this
approach reduces the order-dependence, achieving predictive performance
competitive to the original TabPFN model.

*Huipeng Huang,Wenbo Liao,Huajun Xi,Hao Zeng,Mengchen Zhao,Hongxin Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A conformal-labeling framework to certify AI-provided labels by controlling false discovery rate (FDR), enabling a provably trustworthy subset of predictions with strong empirical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeling large datasets with human experts is costly; AI-generated labels reduce costs but introduce errors. Existing selective-labeling lacks theoretical guarantees on AI-label quality, risking high error rates in AI-labeled subsets.

Method: Construct conformal p-values for each instance by comparing the AI model's predicted confidence to calibration data (instances mislabeled by AI). Select instances with p-values below a data-dependent threshold to certify AI predictions as trustworthy, thereby controlling FDR.

Result: The method achieves FDR control at the nominal level with high power across tasks, showing tight FDR control and strong performance in image and text labeling as well as LLM QA.

Conclusion: Conformal Labeling provides a principled, theory-backed approach to trusted AI labeling, enabling cost-effective labeling with certified accuracy guarantees.

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality labels for large datasets is expensive, requiring
massive annotations from human experts. While AI models offer a cost-effective
alternative by predicting labels, their label quality is compromised by the
unavoidable labeling errors. Existing methods mitigate this issue through
selective labeling, where AI labels a subset and human labels the remainder.
However, these methods lack theoretical guarantees on the quality of
AI-assigned labels, often resulting in unacceptably high labeling error within
the AI-labeled subset. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Conformal
Labeling}, a novel method to identify instances where AI predictions can be
provably trusted. This is achieved by controlling the false discovery rate
(FDR), the proportion of incorrect labels within the selected subset. In
particular, we construct a conformal $p$-value for each test instance by
comparing AI models' predicted confidence to those of calibration instances
mislabeled by AI models. Then, we select test instances whose $p$-values are
below a data-dependent threshold, certifying AI models' predictions as
trustworthy. We provide theoretical guarantees that Conformal Labeling controls
the FDR below the nominal level, ensuring that a predefined fraction of
AI-assigned labels is correct on average. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves tight FDR control with high power across various
tasks, including image and text labeling, and LLM QA.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Matcha is a three-stage molecular docking pipeline that uses flow matching across geometric spaces (R^3, SO(3), SO(2)), with a learned scoring model and unsupervised physical validity filters. It achieves faster, more physically plausible docking than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a persistent trade-off among speed, accuracy, and physical plausibility in protein–ligand docking. Existing methods struggle to balance these aspects; Matcha aims to improve docking success and realism while maintaining efficiency.

Method: Three sequential flow-matching stages applied in R^3, SO(3), and SO(2), respectively, coupled with a dedicated scoring model and unsupervised physical validity filters to prune unrealistic poses.

Result: Matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance on Astex and PDBbind in docking success rate and physical plausibility, and runs roughly 25x faster than modern large-scale co-folding models.

Conclusion: The integrated pipeline achieves a favorable balance among speed, accuracy, and physical validity, with open-source code available for reproduction.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding poses is crucial for
structure-based drug design, yet existing methods struggle to balance speed,
accuracy, and physical plausibility. We introduce Matcha, a novel molecular
docking pipeline that combines multi-stage flow matching with learned scoring
and physical validity filtering. Our approach consists of three sequential
stages applied consecutively to refine docking predictions, each implemented as
a flow matching model operating on appropriate geometric spaces
($\mathbb{R}^3$, $\mathrm{SO}(3)$, and $\mathrm{SO}(2)$). We enhance the
prediction quality through a dedicated scoring model and apply unsupervised
physical validity filters to eliminate unrealistic poses. Compared to various
approaches, Matcha demonstrates superior performance on Astex and PDBbind test
sets in terms of docking success rate and physical plausibility. Moreover, our
method works approximately 25 times faster than modern large-scale co-folding
models. The model weights and inference code to reproduce our results are

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAHA—a modality-aware hybrid retrieval architecture for multimodal QA that fuses dense vector retrieval with a cross-modal knowledge graph, enabling modality-sensitive reasoning and outperforming baselines on multiple benchmarks (ROUGE-L 0.486).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems are largely unimodal (text-only) and struggle with unstructured multimodal documents that combine text, images, tables, equations, and graphs; there is a need for retrieval that respects modality boundaries and cross-modal relationships.

Method: Introduce Modality-Aware Hybrid retrieval Architecture (MAHA) that integrates dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal. The knowledge graph encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships to enable principled, modality-aware retrieval across diverse modalities.

Result: Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets show MAHA substantially outperforms baselines, achieving ROUGE-L 0.486 and complete modality coverage, demonstrating effective multimodal retrieval.

Conclusion: MAHA provides a scalable, interpretable retrieval framework that advances RAG by enabling modality-aware reasoning over unstructured multimodal data.

Abstract: Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems primarily operate on
unimodal textual data, limiting their effectiveness on unstructured multimodal
documents. Such documents often combine text, images, tables, equations, and
graphs, each contributing unique information. In this work, we present a
Modality-Aware Hybrid retrieval Architecture (MAHA), designed specifically for
multimodal question answering with reasoning through a modality-aware knowledge
graph. MAHA integrates dense vector retrieval with structured graph traversal,
where the knowledge graph encodes cross-modal semantics and relationships. This
design enables both semantically rich and context-aware retrieval across
diverse modalities. Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MAHA substantially outperforms baseline methods, achieving a ROUGE-L score of
0.486, providing complete modality coverage. These results highlight MAHA's
ability to combine embeddings with explicit document structure, enabling
effective multimodal retrieval. Our work establishes a scalable and
interpretable retrieval framework that advances RAG systems by enabling
modality-aware reasoning over unstructured multimodal data.

### [265] [First Attentions Last: Better Exploiting First Attentions for Efficient Transformer Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14614)
*Gyudong Kim,Hyukju Na,Jin Hyeon Kim,Hyunsung Jang,Jaemin Park,Jaegi Hwang,Namkoo Ha,Seungryong Kim,Young Geun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAL rethinks transformer parallelism by skipping per-block MHA-MLP cross-block communications and routing the first MHA output to MLP inputs in the next layer. This reduces communication overhead in multi-GPU TP setups and improves throughput and perplexity; FAL+ further boosts model quality by augmenting MLP inputs with normalized first-attention signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In large-scale, multi-GPU training of transformers, TP-based architectures incur significant communication overhead from MHA-MLP cross-block connections (all-reduce). Reducing inter-block signaling can unlock parallelism and speed without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Propose FAL (First Attentions Last): redirect the first layer's MHA output to the MLP inputs of the following layers, removing per-block MHA-MLP connections so MHA and MLP can run in parallel on a single GPU. Introduce FAL+ by adding the normalized first-attention output to subsequent MHA outputs to enrich the MLP input. Evaluate on multi-GPU training against baseline GPT, measuring training time, single-GPU throughput, and perplexity.

Result: FAL reduces multi-GPU training time by up to 44% and increases single-GPU throughput by up to 1.18x, with better perplexity than baseline GPT. FAL+ achieves even lower perplexity without increasing training time compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: By bypassing inter-block MHA-MLP connections and using first-attention signals, FAL achieves substantial communication savings and enables parallel MHA/MLP execution, improving both efficiency and model quality. FAL+ provides an additional accuracy boost by augmenting MLP inputs with normalized first-attention information, without incurring extra training time.

Abstract: As training billion-scale transformers becomes increasingly common, employing
multiple distributed GPUs along with parallel training methods has become a
standard practice. However, existing transformer designs suffer from
significant communication overhead, especially in Tensor Parallelism (TP),
where each block's MHA-MLP connection requires an all-reduce communication.
Through our investigation, we show that the MHA-MLP connections can be bypassed
for efficiency, while the attention output of the first layer can serve as an
alternative signal for the bypassed connection. Motivated by the observations,
we propose FAL (First Attentions Last), an efficient transformer architecture
that redirects the first MHA output to the MLP inputs of the following layers,
eliminating the per-block MHA-MLP connections. This removes the all-reduce
communication and enables parallel execution of MHA and MLP on a single GPU. We
also introduce FAL+, which adds the normalized first attention output to the
MHA outputs of the following layers to augment the MLP input for the model
quality. Our evaluation shows that FAL reduces multi-GPU training time by up to
44%, improves single-GPU throughput by up to 1.18x, and achieves better
perplexity compared to the baseline GPT. FAL+ achieves even lower perplexity
without increasing the training time than the baseline.

### [266] [LeapFactual: Reliable Visual Counterfactual Explanation Using Conditional Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14623)
*Zhuo Cao,Xuan Zhao,Lena Krieger,Hanno Scharr,Ira Assent*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LeapFactual is a model-agnostic counterfactual explanation method based on conditional flow matching that addresses gradient vanishing, latent space discontinuities, and boundary misalignment, producing reliable, in-distribution counterfactuals usable even with human-in-the-loop systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for interpretable ML in high-stakes domains; existing counterfactual methods struggle with gradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and reliance on true-vs-learned boundary alignment.

Method: Introduce LeapFactual, a conditional flow matching-based counterfactual generator that is model-agnostic and capable of handling non-differentiable loss and human-in-the-loop annotation; focuses on generating reliable, in-distribution counterfactuals.

Result: Experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets show LeapFactual produces accurate, in-distribution counterfactuals; such counterfactuals with ground-truth-aligned labels can be used to augment training data and improve models.

Conclusion: LeapFactual is broadly applicable, improving both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert interpretability, and enabling reliable counterfactual explanations even when decision boundaries diverge; supports human-in-the-loop domains.

Abstract: The growing integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence
(AI) models into high-stakes domains such as healthcare and scientific research
calls for models that are not only accurate but also interpretable. Among the
existing explainable methods, counterfactual explanations offer
interpretability by identifying minimal changes to inputs that would alter a
model's prediction, thus providing deeper insights. However, current
counterfactual generation methods suffer from critical limitations, including
gradient vanishing, discontinuous latent spaces, and an overreliance on the
alignment between learned and true decision boundaries. To overcome these
limitations, we propose LeapFactual, a novel counterfactual explanation
algorithm based on conditional flow matching. LeapFactual generates reliable
and informative counterfactuals, even when true and learned decision boundaries
diverge. Following a model-agnostic approach, LeapFactual is not limited to
models with differentiable loss functions. It can even handle human-in-the-loop
systems, expanding the scope of counterfactual explanations to domains that
require the participation of human annotators, such as citizen science. We
provide extensive experiments on benchmark and real-world datasets showing that
LeapFactual generates accurate and in-distribution counterfactual explanations
that offer actionable insights. We observe, for instance, that our reliable
counterfactual samples with labels aligning to ground truth can be beneficially
used as new training data to enhance the model. The proposed method is broadly
applicable and enhances both scientific knowledge discovery and non-expert
interpretability.

*Zhuo Cao,Lena Krieger,Hanno Scharr,Ira Assent*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extend encoder-decoder with invertible flow for interpretable galaxy morphology classification, yielding predictive accuracy plus counterfactual explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Galaxy morphology classification is data-heavy; existing ML models are often black-box; need interpretable insights into decisions.

Method: Augment a classical encoder-decoder with a flow-based invertible module to enable counterfactual explanations while preserving predictive performance.

Result: Achieves good predictive performance and provides counterfactual explanations to illuminate the decision process.

Conclusion: The approach offers both accuracy and interpretability in galaxy morphology analysis, improving trust and insight into model decisions.

Abstract: Galaxy morphologies play an essential role in the study of the evolution of
galaxies. The determination of morphologies is laborious for a large amount of
data giving rise to machine learning-based approaches. Unfortunately, most of
these approaches offer no insight into how the model works and make the results
difficult to understand and explain. We here propose to extend a classical
encoder-decoder architecture with invertible flow, allowing us to not only
obtain a good predictive performance but also provide additional information
about the decision process with counterfactual explanations.

### [268] [Geometric Moment Alignment for Domain Adaptation via Siegel Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14666)
*Shayan Gharib,Marcelo Hartmann,Arto Klami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Geometry-aware moment matching for unsupervised domain adaptation using Siegel embeddings to turn first- and second-order moments into a single SPD matrix, optimized with the Riemannian distance on the SPD manifold; preserves mean/covariance and links to target-domain error bounds; validated on image denoising and classification; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address distribution shift in unsupervised domain adaptation while avoiding ad-hoc low-order moment alignment. Existing methods align moments with simple similarity measures and may neglect the intrinsic geometry; a principled metric on the SPD manifold could preserve structure and improve cross-domain comparison.

Method: Represent the combined first- and second-order moments as a single symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix via Siegel embeddings, enabling simultaneous adaptation of mean and covariance. Align source and target by the Riemannian distance on the SPD manifold. The approach is connected to the target-domain error bound and validated on image denoising and classification benchmarks; code is released.

Result: Demonstrates that the proposed geometry-aware alignment yields a more faithful metric for cross-domain comparison and preserves mean/covariance structure, with empirical validation on image denoising and image classification tasks.

Conclusion: A geometry-aware SPD-based moment alignment improves unsupervised domain adaptation by leveraging the intrinsic manifold of SPD matrices, with theoretical linkage to error bounds and practical release of code.

Abstract: We address the problem of distribution shift in unsupervised domain
adaptation with a moment-matching approach. Existing methods typically align
low-order statistical moments of the source and target distributions in an
embedding space using ad-hoc similarity measures. We propose a principled
alternative that instead leverages the intrinsic geometry of these
distributions by adopting a Riemannian distance for this alignment. Our key
novelty lies in expressing the first- and second-order moments as a single
symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix through Siegel embeddings. This
enables simultaneous adaptation of both moments using the natural geometric
distance on the shared manifold of SPD matrices, preserving the mean and
covariance structure of the source and target distributions and yielding a more
faithful metric for cross-domain comparison. We connect the Riemannian manifold
distance to the target-domain error bound, and validate the method on image
denoising and image classification benchmarks. Our code is publicly available
at https://github.com/shayangharib/GeoAdapt.

### [269] [Online Reliable Anomaly Detection via Neuromorphic Sensing and Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14688)
*Junya Shiraishi,Jiechen Chen,Osvaldo Simeone,Petar Popovski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An online, FDR-controlled anomaly detection framework for neuromorphic sensor networks that uses e-value-based testing and multi-armed bandit querying to achieve low latency and energy-efficient operation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for low-power, real-time anomaly detection in event-driven neuromorphic WSNs where anomaly rate is unknown and communication is costly.

Method: Online hypothesis testing with e-values to control FDR without knowing anomaly rate; adaptive sensor querying treated as best-arm identification in a multi-armed bandit; reader collects impulse-radio encoded events from queried neuro-SNs.

Result: Extensive performance evaluation shows reliable anomaly detection under strict FDR, efficient scheduling of sensor communications, and low detection latency.

Conclusion: The proposed framework balances statistical error control with energy efficiency and responsiveness, making it suitable for brain-machine interfaces and remote environmental monitoring; approach is adaptable to similar event-driven WSN settings.

Abstract: This paper proposes a low-power online anomaly detection framework based on
neuromorphic wireless sensor networks, encompassing possible use cases such as
brain-machine interfaces and remote environmental monitoring. In the considered
system, a central reader node actively queries a subset of neuromorphic sensor
nodes (neuro-SNs) at each time frame. The neuromorphic sensors are
event-driven, producing spikes in correspondence to relevant changes in the
monitored system. The queried neuro-SNs respond to the reader with impulse
radio (IR) transmissions that directly encode the sensed local events. The
reader processes these event-driven signals to determine whether the monitored
environment is in a normal or anomalous state, while rigorously controlling the
false discovery rate (FDR) of detections below a predefined threshold. The
proposed approach employs an online hypothesis testing method with e-values to
maintain FDR control without requiring knowledge of the anomaly rate, and it
dynamically optimizes the sensor querying strategy by casting it as a best-arm
identification problem in a multi-armed bandit framework. Extensive performance
evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method can reliably detect anomalies
under stringent FDR requirements, while efficiently scheduling sensor
communications and achieving low detection latency.

### [270] [FedPPA: Progressive Parameter Alignment for Personalized Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14698)
*Maulidi Adi Prasetia,Muhamad Risqi U. Saputra,Guntur Dharma Putra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedPPA introduces progressive parameter alignment and entropy-weighted averaging to tackle model and data heterogeneity in personalized federated learning, achieving superior personalization on MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The coexistence of non-IID data and heterogeneous client resources in federated learning degrades personalization and generalization; existing PFL methods largely ignore joint model-data heterogeneity.

Method: Progressively align weights of shared (common) layers across clients with the global model; preserve local knowledge; integrate entropy-based weighted averaging into aggregation within the FedPPA framework.

Result: FedPPA consistently outperforms existing FL algorithms, delivering stronger personalized adaptation in non-IID settings across MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets.

Conclusion: FedPPA improves both personalization robustness and global model quality under model and data heterogeneity, with entropy weighting further enhancing performance; applicable to real-world resource-heterogeneous PFL scenarios.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is designed as a decentralized, privacy-preserving
machine learning paradigm that enables multiple clients to collaboratively
train a model without sharing their data. In real-world scenarios, however,
clients often have heterogeneous computational resources and hold
non-independent and identically distributed data (non-IID), which poses
significant challenges during training. Personalized Federated Learning (PFL)
has emerged to address these issues by customizing models for each client based
on their unique data distribution. Despite its potential, existing PFL
approaches typically overlook the coexistence of model and data heterogeneity
arising from clients with diverse computational capabilities. To overcome this
limitation, we propose a novel method, called Progressive Parameter Alignment
(FedPPA), which progressively aligns the weights of common layers across
clients with the global model's weights. Our approach not only mitigates
inconsistencies between global and local models during client updates, but also
preserves client's local knowledge, thereby enhancing personalization
robustness in non-IID settings. To further enhance the global model performance
while retaining strong personalization, we also integrate entropy-based
weighted averaging into the FedPPA framework. Experiments on three image
classification datasets, including MNIST, FMNIST, and CIFAR-10, demonstrate
that FedPPA consistently outperforms existing FL algorithms, achieving superior
performance in personalized adaptation.

### [271] [Seesaw: Accelerating Training by Balancing Learning Rate and Batch Size Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14717)
*Alexandru Meterez,Depen Morwani,Jingfeng Wu,Costin-Andrei Oncescu,Cengiz Pehlevan,Sham Kakade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Seesaw ties learning-rate decay to batch-size ramp-up to preserve loss dynamics; when a scheduler would halve the learning rate, Seesaw multiplies it by 1/√2 and doubles the batch size, reducing wall-clock time while maintaining performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Batch-size ramping accelerates pretraining but for adaptive optimizers like Adam there is no principled scheduling. Existing batch ramps are heuristic; a principled framework is needed to preserve training dynamics and improve efficiency.

Method: Introduce Seesaw scheduling rule that substitutes LR halving with LR scaling by 1/√2 plus batch-size doubling. The paper proves, for SGD on noisy linear regression, a finite-sample equivalence between LR decay and batch-size ramp-up, and extends this to normalized SGD (a proxy for Adam) in a variance-dominated regime. Empirically evaluate on 150M/300M/600M-parameter models at Chinchilla scale with a constant (critical) batch size, comparing Seesaw to cosine decay.

Result: Seesaw matches cosine-decay performance at equal FLOPs while reducing wall-clock time by about 36%, approaching the theoretical limit suggested by the analysis.

Conclusion: Seesaw provides a principled, practically effective batch-size ramp strategy that preserves loss dynamics, reduces wall-clock time, and aligns with finite-sample equivalence theory for SGD and normalized SGD, offering a scalable alternative to heuristic scheduling for large-language-model pretraining.

Abstract: Increasing the batch size during training -- a ''batch ramp'' -- is a
promising strategy to accelerate large language model pretraining. While for
SGD, doubling the batch size can be equivalent to halving the learning rate,
the optimal strategy for adaptive optimizers like Adam is less clear. As a
result, any batch-ramp scheduling, if used at all, is typically tuned
heuristically. This work develops a principled framework for batch-size
scheduling and introduces Seesaw: whenever a standard scheduler would halve the
learning rate, Seesaw instead multiplies it by $1/\sqrt{2}$ and doubles the
batch size, preserving loss dynamics while reducing serial steps.
Theoretically, we provide, to our knowledge, the first finite-sample proof of
equivalence between learning-rate decay and batch-size ramp-up for SGD on noisy
linear regression, and we extend this equivalence to normalized SGD, a
tractable proxy for Adam, under a variance-dominated regime observed in
practice. Empirically, on 150M/300M/600M-parameter models trained at Chinchilla
scale using a constant (critical) batch size, Seesaw matches cosine decay at
equal FLOPs while reducing wall-clock time by $\approx 36\%$, approaching the
theoretical limit implied by our analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An automated compiler Tawa generates warp-specialized GPU code from high-level tile-based programs using asynchronous references to manage warp-level dataflow, achieving notable speedups on H100 with reduced programming effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The SIMT programming model misaligns with task-parallel, warp-level hardware; manual warp specialization is labor-intensive and error-prone, creating a programmability gap.

Method: Introduce asynchronous references (aref) as an IR to express warp-level communication; automatically partition programs into producer-consumer roles; manage the dataflow pipeline; generate warp-specialized code from high-level tiles.

Result: Evaluation on NVIDIA H100 across representative LLM kernels shows up to 1.1x speedup over cuBLAS GEMM; 1.2x speedup over Triton for attention; matches performance of hand-optimized CUTLASS FlashAttention-3 with far less programming effort.

Conclusion: Automated warp specialization via Tawa can close the performance gap with hand-optimized kernels while reducing developer effort; effective across LLM and attention workloads; validates the feasibility of high-level tile-based compilation with aref-based dataflow.

Abstract: Modern GPUs feature specialized hardware units that enable high-performance,
asynchronous dataflow execution. However, the conventional SIMT programming
model is fundamentally misaligned with this task-parallel hardware, creating a
significant programmability gap. While hardware-level warp specialization is
the key to unlocking peak performance, it forces developers to manually
orchestrate complex, low-level communication and software pipelines--a process
that is labor-intensive, error-prone, and unsustainable. To address this
challenge, we present Tawa, an automated compiler that systematically generates
high-performance, warp-specialized code from a high-level, tile-based program.
Central to our approach is a novel IR abstraction, asynchronous references
(aref), which expresses warp-level communication without exposing low-level
hardware details. Using this abstraction, Tawa automatically partitions
programs into producer-consumer roles and manages the intricate dataflow
pipeline, relieving developers of invasive kernel rewriting. Evaluation on
NVIDIA H100 GPUs across representative LLM kernels shows that Tawa delivers
high hardware utilization, achieving up to 1.1$\times$ speedup over highly
optimized cuBLAS GEMM kernels. For attention workloads, Tawa attains
1.2$\times$ speedup over Triton and matches the performance of the
hand-optimized CUTLASS C++ FlashAttention-3 kernel with far less programming
effort.

### [273] [The Pursuit of Diversity: Multi-Objective Testing of Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14727)
*Antony Bartlett,Cynthia Liem,Annibale Panichella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-objective search framework (INDAGO-Nexus) for testing DRL safety-critical agents by optimizing both failure likelihood and scenario diversity via multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, achieving more diverse failures faster than the single-objective INDAGO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-objective optimization focusing only on maximizing failure counts can miss diverse or distinct error types. For safety-critical DRL, discovering diverse failure scenarios is essential to robustly evaluate and improve agents.

Method: INDAGO-Nexus employs multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with multiple diversity metrics and Pareto front selection to jointly optimize failure likelihood and test scenario diversity. It uses several diversity metrics and Pareto-front strategies to balance failure occurrence with scenario variety across test cases.

Result: Compared to INDAGO, INDAGO-Nexus found up to 83% more unique failures in the self-driving car (SDC) scenario and 40% more in the Parking scenario, on average, and reduced time-to-failure by up to 67% across all evaluated DRL agents (humanoid walker, SDC, and parking agent).

Conclusion: A multi-objective, diversity-aware search significantly improves failure discovery and efficiency for safety-critical DRL testing, highlighting the importance of considering diversity in test-case generation.

Abstract: Testing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents in safety-critical domains
requires discovering diverse failure scenarios. Existing tools such as INDAGO
rely on single-objective optimization focused solely on maximizing failure
counts, but this does not ensure discovered scenarios are diverse or reveal
distinct error types. We introduce INDAGO-Nexus, a multi-objective search
approach that jointly optimizes for failure likelihood and test scenario
diversity using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms with multiple diversity
metrics and Pareto front selection strategies. We evaluated INDAGO-Nexus on
three DRL agents: humanoid walker, self-driving car, and parking agent. On
average, INDAGO-Nexus discovers up to 83% and 40% more unique failures (test
effectiveness) than INDAGO in the SDC and Parking scenarios, respectively,
while reducing time-to-failure by up to 67% across all agents.

*Divyat Mahajan,Sachin Goyal,Badr Youbi Idrissi,Mohammad Pezeshki,Ioannis Mitliagkas,David Lopez-Paz,Kartik Ahuja*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Future Summary Prediction (FSP) augments next-token and multi-token predictions by training an auxiliary head to predict a compact representation of the far future, improving long-horizon generation; achieves gains on math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks in 3B and 8B models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address long-horizon reasoning, planning, and creative writing limitations of NTP and teacher-forced training. While MTP captures some short-range dependencies, it does not adequately represent long-range future information; a compact future representation could guide generation more effectively.

Method: Introduce an auxiliary head that predicts a compact representation of the long-term future. Two variants: (1) handcrafted summaries (e.g., bag-of-words) and (2) learned summaries using embeddings from a reverse language model trained from right to left. Train with large-scale pretraining (3B and 8B parameter models), optimizing both the standard next-token objective and the future-summary objective.

Result: FSP yields improvements over both NTP and MTP across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks on 3B and 8B models, indicating the value of incorporating long-term future representations for long-form generation.

Conclusion: Incorporating a future-summary objective via an auxiliary head is a promising approach to mitigate long-horizon limitations of NTP/teacher-forced training. Both handcrafted and learned summaries are viable, with demonstrated benefits in large-scale pretraining. Further work could explore other summary forms and integration into various model architectures.

Abstract: Next-token prediction (NTP) has driven the success of large language models
(LLMs), but it struggles with long-horizon reasoning, planning, and creative
writing, with these limitations largely attributed to teacher-forced training.
Multi-token prediction (MTP) partially mitigates these issues by predicting
several future tokens at once, but it mostly captures short-range dependencies
and offers limited improvement. We propose future summary prediction (FSP),
which trains an auxiliary head to predict a compact representation of the
long-term future, preserving information relevant for long-form generations. We
explore two variants of FSP: handcrafted summaries, for example, a bag of words
summary of the future of the sequence, and learned summaries, which use
embeddings produced by a reverse language model trained from right to left.
Large-scale pretraining experiments (3B and 8B-parameter models) demonstrate
that FSP provides improvements over both NTP and MTP across math, reasoning,
and coding benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LvLiNGAM methods assume mutually independent latent confounders or cannot handle causal links among observed variables; there is a need to recover causal structure under general latent/observed dependencies.

Method: Proposes an algorithm that infers causal DAGs in LvLiNGAM with latent variables having causal relations among themselves and with observed variables, exploiting higher-order cumulants of observed data to reveal causal structure.

Result: Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate the method's validity and practical utility in recovering correct causal graphs under challenging LvLiNGAM settings.

Conclusion: The approach broadens LvLiNGAM applicability by accommodating broader latent/observed causal interdependencies and shows empirical effectiveness; provides a practical tool for causal discovery in linear non-Gaussian acyclic models with latent confounders.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of estimating causal directed acyclic graphs
in linear non-Gaussian acyclic models with latent confounders (LvLiNGAM).
Existing methods assume mutually independent latent confounders or cannot
properly handle models with causal relationships among observed variables.
  We propose a novel algorithm that identifies causal DAGs in LvLiNGAM,
allowing causal structures among latent variables, among observed variables,
and between the two. The proposed method leverages higher-order cumulants of
observed data to identify the causal structure. Extensive simulations and
experiments with real-world data demonstrate the validity and practical utility
of the proposed algorithm.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An active jammer localization framework uses Bayesian optimization with acquisition-aware path planning (A-UCB*) to steer a mobile agent for high-value RSS measurements in urban environments, achieving accurate localization with fewer samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Passive crowdsourced methods are inefficient and often unreliable in complex urban settings due to sparse data, obstacles, and mobility constraints. An active guidance approach can improve measurement efficiency and localization accuracy.

Method: Integrates Bayesian optimization with an acquisition-aware A*-like planner. The A* search is modified to A-UCB*, incorporating acquisition values into trajectory costs to produce paths that maximize information gain per move while accounting for obstacles and mobility limits.

Result: In simulations on realistic urban scenarios, the method achieves accurate jammer localization with fewer measurements than uninformed baselines, and shows robust performance across varying environments.

Conclusion: Acquisition-aware path planning combined with Bayesian optimization is effective for active jammer localization, reducing measurement requirements while maintaining accuracy in urban settings.

Abstract: We propose an active jammer localization framework that combines Bayesian
optimization with acquisition-aware path planning. Unlike passive crowdsourced
methods, our approach adaptively guides a mobile agent to collect high-utility
Received Signal Strength measurements while accounting for urban obstacles and
mobility constraints. For this, we modified the A* algorithm, A-UCB*, by
incorporating acquisition values into trajectory costs, leading to
high-acquisition planned paths. Simulations on realistic urban scenarios show
that the proposed method achieves accurate localization with fewer measurements
compared to uninformed baselines, demonstrating consistent performance under
different environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPHeRe is an unsupervised Hebbian-inspired method that combines a local nonlinear block, orthogonality constraints, and a lightweight auxiliary projection to preserve structure and provide feedback mediation, enabling scalable, biologically plausible learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional Hebbian learning suffers from unconstrained updates and lack of feedback mediation, hindering scaling to modern deep architectures and complex tasks; a biologically inspired, scalable unsupervised approach is needed.

Method: Introduce Structural Projection Hebbian Representation (SPHeRe) with an auxiliary nonlinear block and orthogonality constraints. A loss enforcing structural information preservation backpropagates to the input via a lightweight projection that acts as feedback mediation; orthogonality bounds update magnitudes. The framework integrates into deep learning pipelines for unsupervised learning, continual learning, and transfer learning.

Result: SPHeRe achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised synaptic plasticity methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet; demonstrates strong continual and transfer learning capabilities; supports robust image reconstruction with generalizable features; code is released. 

Conclusion: The work shows that Hebbian unsupervised learning can be competitive within modern DL, offering an efficient, biologically inspired alternative to backpropagation without sacrificing performance; SPHeRe broadens the practicality of synaptic plasticity-inspired learning.

Abstract: Hebbian learning is a biological principle that intuitively describes how
neurons adapt their connections through repeated stimuli. However, when applied
to machine learning, it suffers serious issues due to the unconstrained updates
of the connections and the lack of accounting for feedback mediation. Such
shortcomings limit its effective scaling to complex network architectures and
tasks. To this end, here we introduce the Structural Projection Hebbian
Representation (SPHeRe), a novel unsupervised learning method that integrates
orthogonality and structural information preservation through a local auxiliary
nonlinear block. The loss for structural information preservation
backpropagates to the input through an auxiliary lightweight projection that
conceptually serves as feedback mediation while the orthogonality constraints
account for the boundedness of updating magnitude. Extensive experimental
results show that SPHeRe achieves SOTA performance among unsupervised synaptic
plasticity approaches on standard image classification benchmarks, including
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet. Furthermore, the method exhibits strong
effectiveness in continual learning and transfer learning scenarios, and image
reconstruction tasks show the robustness and generalizability of the extracted
features. This work demonstrates the competitiveness and potential of Hebbian
unsupervised learning rules within modern deep learning frameworks,
demonstrating the possibility of efficient and biologically inspired learning
algorithms without the strong dependence on strict backpropagation. Our code is

Motivation: To bridge the accuracy gap between structured sparsity and unstructured dynamic sparse training by expanding mask expressivity through learned per-layer permutations, while preserving structure-based efficiency.

Method: Introduce permutation-augmented DST (PA-DST): per-layer learnable permutation matrices are trained jointly with the structured weight matrices. Applied to block, N:M, and diagonal sparsity, evaluated on ImageNet-1K (ViT-B/16) and WikiText-103 (GPT-2).

Result: PA-DST matches unstructured baselines (RigL, SET) at 90–95% sparsity; achieves training speedups up to 1.21x and inference speedups up to 2.9x.

Conclusion: Structure plus a learned permutation is a practical sweet spot between accuracy and efficiency, enabling high-sparsity structured models to approach unstructured sparsity performance with substantial speedups.

Abstract: Structured sparsity accelerates training and inference on modern GPUs, yet it
still trails unstructured dynamic sparse training (DST) in accuracy. The
shortfall stems from a loss of expressivity: whereas a dense layer can realize
every possible mask obtained by choosing any $w$ active weights out of $n$, a
fixed block or N:M layout explores only a subset of those possibilities. We
propose to close this gap by learning, for each layer, a single permutation
matrix jointly with the structured weight matrix. Applied to three canonical
structures -- block, N:M, and diagonals -- we show that permutation-augmented
DST (PA-DST) matches unstructured baselines (RigL, SET) at 90--95\% sparsity on
ImageNet-1K (ViT-B/16) and WikiText-103 (GPT-2), yet trains up to $1.21\times$
and infers up to $2.9\times$ faster. The results position structure + learned
permutation as a sweet spot between accuracy and efficiency.

### [279] [Tackling Time-Series Forecasting Generalization via Mitigating Concept Drift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14814)
*Zhiyuan Zhao,Haoxin Liu,B. Aditya Prakash*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified, method-agnostic ShifTS framework addresses both temporal shift and concept drift in time-series forecasting, using a soft attention mechanism to extract invariant patterns from lookback and horizon data, and showing consistent improvements over baselines across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series data exhibit distribution shifts that can degrade forecasting performance. The authors distinguish two shift types—concept drift and temporal shift—and note that prior work mostly tackles temporal shift while concept drift in forecasting remains underexplored. A unified approach to mitigate both shifts is desirable for robust forecasts.

Method: Propose a soft attention mechanism that finds invariant patterns from both lookback (past) and horizon (future) series. Introduce ShifTS, a method-agnostic framework that first addresses temporal shift and then concepts drift, integrated in a single approach. The framework is designed to be compatible with various forecasting models (agnostic) and emphasizes a two-stage shift mitigation strategy.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that ShifTS consistently improves forecasting accuracy for agnostic models across multiple datasets and outperforms baselines that address temporal shift, concept drift, or both.

Conclusion: Mitigating temporal shifts first within a unified, method-agnostic framework enables more effective handling of both temporal shift and concept drift in time-series forecasting, with the soft-attention mechanism capturing invariant patterns to enhance forecast accuracy.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting finds broad applications in real-world scenarios. Due
to the dynamic nature of time series data, it is important for time-series
forecasting models to handle potential distribution shifts over time. In this
paper, we initially identify two types of distribution shifts in time series:
concept drift and temporal shift. We acknowledge that while existing studies
primarily focus on addressing temporal shift issues in time series forecasting,
designing proper concept drift methods for time series forecasting has received
comparatively less attention.
  Motivated by the need to address potential concept drift, while conventional
concept drift methods via invariant learning face certain challenges in
time-series forecasting, we propose a soft attention mechanism that finds
invariant patterns from both lookback and horizon time series. Additionally, we
emphasize the critical importance of mitigating temporal shifts as a
preliminary to addressing concept drift. In this context, we introduce ShifTS,
a method-agnostic framework designed to tackle temporal shift first and then
concept drift within a unified approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
efficacy of ShifTS in consistently enhancing the forecasting accuracy of
agnostic models across multiple datasets, and outperforming existing concept
drift, temporal shift, and combined baselines.

### [280] [Programmatic Representation Learning with Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14825)
*Gabriel Poesia,Georgia Gabriela Sampaio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A neural-network-free framework LeaPR that stacks LLM-synthesized, code-based features with decision trees and learns them via a FunSearch adaptation and an on-demand feature-generating ID3 variant; shows competitive performance with neural networks on chess, image, and text tasks while enabling interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical decision trees are efficient and interpretable but rely heavily on feature choice; neural networks learn representations yet are opaque and hardware-intensive. LeaPR seeks expressive, interpretable representations by combining programmatic features with tree predictors, guided by LLMs.

Method: Propose Learned Programmatic Representations (LeaPR): features are code/functions from data to scalars. Use LLMs to synthesize these features. Two learning algorithms: (i) adapt FunSearch to learn features rather than predictors; (ii) a new variant of ID3 that generates new features on-demand when splitting leaf nodes. Experiments across chess position evaluation, image, and text classification.

Result: LeaPR produces high-quality, neural-network-free predictors; competitive with neural networks across diverse domains; demonstrates interpretable end-to-end representations with inspectable features and predictions.

Conclusion: LeaPR offers a flexible, interpretable paradigm for end-to-end learning of representations, leveraging LLMs for feature synthesis and enabling inspection of both features and predictions, with broad applicability.

Abstract: Classical models for supervised machine learning, such as decision trees, are
efficient and interpretable predictors, but their quality is highly dependent
on the particular choice of input features. Although neural networks can learn
useful representations directly from raw data (e.g., images or text), this
comes at the expense of interpretability and the need for specialized hardware
to run them efficiently. In this paper, we explore a hypothesis class we call
Learned Programmatic Representations (LeaPR) models, which stack arbitrary
features represented as code (functions from data points to scalars) and
decision tree predictors. We synthesize feature functions using Large Language
Models (LLMs), which have rich prior knowledge in a wide range of domains and a
remarkable ability to write code using existing domain-specific libraries. We
propose two algorithms to learn LeaPR models from supervised data. First, we
design an adaptation of FunSearch to learn features rather than directly
generate predictors. Then, we develop a novel variant of the classical ID3
algorithm for decision tree learning, where new features are generated on
demand when splitting leaf nodes. In experiments from chess position evaluation
to image and text classification, our methods learn high-quality, neural
network-free predictors often competitive with neural networks. Our work
suggests a flexible paradigm for learning interpretable representations
end-to-end where features and predictions can be readily inspected and
understood.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SSMs are efficient for long sequences but face a theoretical limit on truly long-form generation; with external tool access and task-specific training, tool-augmented SSMs can generalize length and solve tractable problems, offering an efficient Transformer-like alternative in interactive settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate whether State Space Models (SSMs) can compete with Transformers for long-form sequence modeling and whether interactive tool access can overcome inherent limitations.

Method: 1) Prove a simple theoretical result showing SSMs cannot accurately solve any 'truly long-form' generation problem. 2) Propose tool-augmented SSMs with external tool access. 3) Train these models on problem-dependent data. 4) Empirically test length generalization on arithmetic, reasoning, and coding tasks.

Result: Tool-augmented SSMs, with appropriate tool access and training data, demonstrate strong length generalization and can solve tractable problems across a range of tasks, suggesting SSMs can match Transformers in interactive settings under tool-based constraints.

Conclusion: Tool-augmented SSMs are a promising, efficient alternative to Transformers in interactive, agentic contexts, highlighting the potential of external tools to extend model capabilities for long-form reasoning and computation.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have become the leading alternative to Transformers
for sequence modeling. Their primary advantage is efficiency in long-context
and long-form generation, enabled by fixed-size memory and linear scaling of
computational complexity. We begin this work by showing a simple theoretical
result stating that SSMs cannot accurately solve any ``truly long-form''
generation problem (in a sense we formally define), undermining their main
competitive advantage. However, we show that this limitation can be mitigated
by allowing SSMs interactive access to external tools. In fact, we show that
given the right choice of tool access and problem-dependent training data, SSMs
can learn to solve any tractable problem and generalize to arbitrary problem
length/complexity (i.e., achieve length generalization). Following our
theoretical finding, we demonstrate that tool-augmented SSMs achieve remarkable
length generalization on a variety of arithmetic, reasoning, and coding tasks.
These findings highlight SSMs as a potential efficient alternative to
Transformers in interactive tool-based and agentic settings.

*Maria Lamprini A. Bartsioka,Anastasios Giannopoulos,Sotirios Spantideas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A machine learning-driven predictive handover framework (P-CHO) for 6G multi-RAT that forecasts signal quality with LSTM to enable proactive handovers, reducing failures and ping-pongs via hysteresis and a RAT Steering Controller.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handover in multi-RAT networks remains reactive and event-based; fast channel dynamics and interference demand proactive, low-latency decisions. A unified, model-driven prediction+control approach can improve reliability and user experience in 6G.

Method: Proposed P-CHO: a generalized sequence workflow orchestrated by a RAT Steering Controller; data collection, per-RAT LSTM forecasts of signal quality along user trajectories; training under cellular and IEEE 802.11 WiFi coverage; hyperparameter study; comparison of direct multi-step vs recursive predictions; baseline predictors; evaluation under soft/hard handover with hysteresis.

Result: P-CHO with hysteresis reduces handover failures and ping-pong events; predictive, low-latency handovers achievable in a realistic multi-RAT environment; performance depends on hyperparameters and channel model; outperforms baselines.

Conclusion: The P-CHO framework enables accurate, low-latency, proactive handovers for 6G multi-RAT deployments, leveraging ML-based forecasts to guide handover decisions and improve reliability.

Abstract: The emerging paradigm of 6G multiple Radio Access Technology (multi-RAT)
networks, where cellular and Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) transmitters coexist,
requires mobility decisions that remain reliable under fast channel dynamics,
interference, and heterogeneous coverage. Handover in multi-RAT deployments is
still highly reactive and event-triggered, relying on instantaneous
measurements and threshold events. This work proposes a Machine Learning
(ML)-assisted Predictive Conditional Handover (P-CHO) framework based on a
model-driven and short-horizon signal quality forecasts. We present a
generalized P-CHO sequence workflow orchestrated by a RAT Steering Controller,
which standardizes data collection, parallel per-RAT predictions, decision
logic with hysteresis-based conditions, and CHO execution. Considering a
realistic multi-RAT environment, we train RAT-aware Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) networks to forecast the signal quality indicators of mobile users along
randomized trajectories. The proposed P-CHO models are trained and evaluated
under different channel models for cellular and IEEE 802.11 WiFi integrated
coverage. We study the impact of hyperparameter tuning of LSTM models under
different system settings, and compare direct multi-step versus recursive P-CHO
variants. Comparisons against baseline predictors are also carried out.
Finally, the proposed P-CHO is tested under soft and hard handover settings,
showing that hysteresis-enabled P-CHO scheme is able to reduce handover
failures and ping-pong events. Overall, the proposed P-CHO framework can enable
accurate, low-latency, and proactive handovers suitable for ML-assisted
handover steering in 6G multi-RAT deployments.

### [283] [Reinforcement Learning with Stochastic Reward Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14837)
*Jan Corazza,Ivan Gavran,Daniel Neider*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces stochastic reward machines and a constraint-solving learner that handles noisy rewards, learning minimal machines from exploration and guaranteeing convergence to optimal policies, with two case studies showing superiority over existing methods and naive noise handling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rewards in reinforcement learning are often noisy and can depend on long sequences of actions; existing reward-machine learning assumes noise-free rewards, which is impractical.

Method: Define stochastic reward machines and propose a constraint-solving algorithm to learn the minimal SRMs from agent explorations; integrate with standard RL algorithms and prove convergence to an optimal policy in the limit.

Result: Two case studies show the method outperforms existing reward-machine learning approaches and a naive noisy-reward baseline.

Conclusion: Stochastic reward machines learned via constraint solving provide robust handling of noise in reward signals and guarantee asymptotic optimal policy, with demonstrated practical viability.

Abstract: Reward machines are an established tool for dealing with reinforcement
learning problems in which rewards are sparse and depend on complex sequences
of actions. However, existing algorithms for learning reward machines assume an
overly idealized setting where rewards have to be free of noise. To overcome
this practical limitation, we introduce a novel type of reward machines, called
stochastic reward machines, and an algorithm for learning them. Our algorithm,
based on constraint solving, learns minimal stochastic reward machines from the
explorations of a reinforcement learning agent. This algorithm can easily be
paired with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for reward machines and
guarantees to converge to an optimal policy in the limit. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm in two case studies and show that it outperforms
both existing methods and a naive approach for handling noisy reward functions.

### [284] [Provable Unlearning with Gradient Ascent on Two-Layer ReLU Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14844)
*Odelia Melamed,Gilad Yehudai,Gal Vardi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gradient ascent-based unlearning can approximate retraining on retained data by aligning with KKT conditions, under a new (ε, δ, τ)-successful criterion. The approach is theoretically validated for linear models and two-layer neural networks in high dimensions and preserves generalization in synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy/ethical concerns by removing the influence of a specific data point from trained models without retraining from scratch; provide theoretical guarantees and a new success criterion for unlearning.

Method: The authors analyze gradient ascent as a method to reverse a data point's influence by exploiting the implicit bias of gradient descent toward KKT-satisfying margin-maximizing solutions. They formalize an (ε, δ, τ)-successful unlearning criterion and prove that, for linear models and two-layer neural networks with high-dimensional data, a properly scaled gradient-ascent step achieves this criterion, yielding a model close to the retrained solution on the retained data.

Result: Gradient ascent can achieve successful unlearning under the proposed criterion, producing a model that closely matches the retrained solution on the retained data. They also show that unlearning with gradient ascent preserves generalization in a synthetic Gaussian-mixture setting.

Conclusion: Gradient ascent-based unlearning is theoretically sound for linear models and two-layer networks under the new (ε, δ, τ)-successful criterion, offering a practical approach to unlearning without full retraining; extension to more complex architectures and empirical validation could be explored.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning aims to remove specific data from trained models,
addressing growing privacy and ethical concerns. We provide a theoretical
analysis of a simple and widely used method - gradient ascent - used to reverse
the influence of a specific data point without retraining from scratch.
Leveraging the implicit bias of gradient descent towards solutions that satisfy
the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a margin maximization problem, we
quantify the quality of the unlearned model by evaluating how well it satisfies
these conditions w.r.t. the retained data. To formalize this idea, we propose a
new success criterion, termed \textbf{$(\epsilon, \delta, \tau)$-successful}
unlearning, and show that, for both linear models and two-layer neural networks
with high dimensional data, a properly scaled gradient-ascent step satisfies
this criterion and yields a model that closely approximates the retrained
solution on the retained data. We also show that gradient ascent performs
successful unlearning while still preserving generalization in a synthetic
Gaussian-mixture setting.

### [285] [Backdoor Unlearning by Linear Task Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14845)
*Amel Abdelraheem,Alessandro Favero,Gerome Bovet,Pascal Frossard*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Backdoors in foundation models can be disentangled in weight space, enabling a simple unlearning method that removes backdoor influence with minimal impact on clean accuracy, and outperforms existing defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large foundation models are vulnerable to backdoors and adversarial triggers; retraining is costly and can degrade performance; need a way to erase backdoors without sacrificing general capabilities.

Method: Identify that backdoors are disentangled from benign tasks in the model's weight space and design a lightweight unlearning procedure that erases backdoor effects while preserving clean performance. The approach uses known attack triggers (or reverse-engineered estimates when unknown) and is evaluated on CLIP-based models with common triggers, comparing against state-of-the-art defenses.

Result: Near-perfect unlearning with ~96% retention of clean accuracy on average; the method is effective even when the attack is unknown via reverse-engineered triggers; consistently outperforms existing defenses in unlearning and accuracy tradeoffs.

Conclusion: Backdoors can be removed from foundation models by exploiting disentanglement in weight space, enabling safe deployment with minimal retraining. The proposed unlearning approach demonstrates strong performance and generalizes to unknown attacks.

Abstract: Foundation models have revolutionized computer vision by enabling broad
generalization across diverse tasks. Yet, they remain highly susceptible to
adversarial perturbations and targeted backdoor attacks. Mitigating such
vulnerabilities remains an open challenge, especially given that the
large-scale nature of the models prohibits retraining to ensure safety.
Existing backdoor removal approaches rely on costly fine-tuning to override the
harmful behavior, and can often degrade performance on other unrelated tasks.
This raises the question of whether backdoors can be removed without
compromising the general capabilities of the models. In this work, we address
this question and study how backdoors are encoded in the model weight space,
finding that they are disentangled from other benign tasks. Specifically, this
separation enables the isolation and erasure of the backdoor's influence on the
model with minimal impact on clean performance. Building on this insight, we
introduce a simple unlearning method that leverages such disentanglement.
Through extensive experiments with CLIP-based models and common adversarial
triggers, we show that, given the knowledge of the attack, our method achieves
approximately perfect unlearning, while retaining, on average, 96% of clean
accuracy. Additionally, we demonstrate that even when the attack and its
presence are unknown, our method successfully unlearns backdoors by proper
estimation using reverse-engineered triggers. Overall, our method consistently
yields better unlearning and clean accuracy tradeoffs when compared to present
state-of-the-art defenses.

*Dhruva Karkada,Joseph Turnbull,Yuxi Liu,James B. Simon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces the Hermite eigenstructure ansatz (HEA) to predict kernel regression learning curves by approximating kernel eigenstructure under anisotropic data; validates on real image datasets and shows MLPs learn Hermite polynomials in HEA-predicted order, suggesting an end-to-end theory from data to performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge dataset geometry and model performance by deriving a data-driven, predictive framework for learning curves that relies on just two measurements, enabling principled understanding of nontrivial learning algorithms on real data.

Method: Develop HEA to approximate kernel eigenvalues/eigenfunctions for rotation-invariant kernels under anisotropic data; prove HEA for Gaussian data; empirically assess when real image data are Gaussian-like; predict test risk using kernel-eigenstructure results; extend observations to MLPs in the feature-learning regime learning Hermite polynomials.

Result: A practical framework that predicts test risk versus sample size for kernel regression using the empirical covariance and target-function decomposition; HEA closely matches observed learning curves on real data and explains a regime where MLPs learn Hermite polynomials in the HEA-predicted order.

Conclusion: HEA constitutes a proof-of-concept toward an end-to-end theory mapping dataset structure to model performance, valid for nontrivial learning algorithms on real datasets; while grounded in Gaussian analysis, it remains effective in practice for real-world data and suggests avenues for generalization.

Abstract: We study kernel regression with common rotation-invariant kernels on real
datasets including CIFAR-5m, SVHN, and ImageNet. We give a theoretical
framework that predicts learning curves (test risk vs. sample size) from only
two measurements: the empirical data covariance matrix and an empirical
polynomial decomposition of the target function $f_*$. The key new idea is an
analytical approximation of a kernel's eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with
respect to an anisotropic data distribution. The eigenfunctions resemble
Hermite polynomials of the data, so we call this approximation the Hermite
eigenstructure ansatz (HEA). We prove the HEA for Gaussian data, but we find
that real image data is often "Gaussian enough" for the HEA to hold well in
practice, enabling us to predict learning curves by applying prior results
relating kernel eigenstructure to test risk. Extending beyond kernel
regression, we empirically find that MLPs in the feature-learning regime learn
Hermite polynomials in the order predicted by the HEA. Our HEA framework is a
proof of concept that an end-to-end theory of learning which maps dataset
structure all the way to model performance is possible for nontrivial learning
algorithms on real datasets.

### [287] [Learning When Not to Learn: Risk-Sensitive Abstention in Bandits with Unbounded Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14884)
*Sarah Liaw,Benjamin Plaut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A cautious two-action contextual bandit with an abstain option is proposed to learn safely in high-stakes settings with unbounded or arbitrarily negative rewards; the algorithm abstains in uncertain regions and commits only where evidence does not indicate harm, achieving sublinear regret under i.i.d inputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In high-stakes AI, a single wrong action can cause irreparable damage; standard bandit exploration is unsafe and often assumes bounded rewards or mentor guidance. There is a need for learning without a mentor that can operate safely even when rewards can be unbounded or harmful.

Method: Two-action contextual bandit with abstain option: abstain yields zero reward; commit uses a preexisting policy; commit rewards are Lipschitz in the input and upper-bounded but can be arbitrarily negative. The proposed caution-based algorithm selects a trusted region and commits only where available evidence does not certify harm; analysis is conducted under i.i.d inputs.

Result: The paper provides sublinear regret guarantees for the proposed caution-based algorithm, demonstrating theoretically that cautious exploration can safely facilitate learning in high-stakes environments without a mentor.

Conclusion: Cautious exploration with an abstain option offers a viable safety mechanism for learning under unbounded/negative rewards in high-stakes sequential decision problems, enabling safe deployment without mentor oversight.

Abstract: In high-stakes AI applications, even a single action can cause irreparable
damage. However, nearly all of sequential decision-making theory assumes that
all errors are recoverable (e.g., by bounding rewards). Standard bandit
algorithms that explore aggressively may cause irreparable damage when this
assumption fails. Some prior work avoids irreparable errors by asking for help
from a mentor, but a mentor may not always be available. In this work, we
formalize a model of learning with unbounded rewards without a mentor as a
two-action contextual bandit with an abstain option: at each round the agent
observes an input and chooses either to abstain (always 0 reward) or to commit
(execute a preexisting task policy). Committing yields rewards that are
upper-bounded but can be arbitrarily negative, and the commit reward is assumed
Lipschitz in the input. We propose a caution-based algorithm that learns when
not to learn: it chooses a trusted region and commits only where the available
evidence does not already certify harm. Under these conditions and i.i.d.
inputs, we establish sublinear regret guarantees, theoretically demonstrating
the effectiveness of cautious exploration for deploying learning agents safely
in high-stakes environments.

*Aayush Karan,Yilun Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training-free, MCMC-inspired iterative sampling method uses base LLM likelihoods to elicit high-level reasoning from base models at inference time, matching or surpassing RL-finetuned models on several benchmarks, while preserving diversity and not requiring training or verifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether base models can achieve frontier reasoning capabilities without RL-finetuning, addressing the dependency on training data and verifiers in RL approaches, and understanding if latent reasoning abilities can be accessed purely through inference-time sampling.

Method: Propose an iterative sampling algorithm inspired by MCMC that leverages the base model's own likelihoods to sample from sharpened distributions. No training, datasets, or verifier required; tested across multiple base models on tasks like MATH500, HumanEval, GPQA.

Result: The algorithm yields substantial reasoning improvements across base models, close to or exceeding RL posttraining performance on the tested tasks; maintains diversity across multiple samples, avoiding mode collapse seen in RL; demonstrates broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.

Conclusion: Inference-time, training-free sampling can unlock powerful reasoning in base LLMs, offering a practical alternative to RL posttraining with broader applicability and better sample diversity.

Abstract: Frontier reasoning models have exhibited incredible capabilities across a
wide array of disciplines, driven by posttraining large language models (LLMs)
with reinforcement learning (RL). However, despite the widespread success of
this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly
novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models.
In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking
whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at
inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened
distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the
base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our
algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even
outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including
MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in
diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining.
Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a
verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.

TL;DR: WeightLens and CircuitLens offer weight- and circuit-based interpretability for neural nets, enabling scalable, dataset-free, activation-independent mechanistic analysis beyond traditional explainer models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current explainability approaches rely on manual inspection, toy tasks, or activation-based methods that miss feature interactions and depend on external datasets or large language models. There is a need for robust, scalable, mechanistic analysis that captures interactions within circuits.

Method: WeightLens interprets features directly from learned weights, removing the need for explainer models or datasets. CircuitLens analyzes how feature activations arise from interactions between components to reveal circuit-level dynamics. Both are complementary and go beyond activation-based analysis.

Result: WeightLens achieves or surpasses performance of existing methods on context-independent features without using datasets or explainer models. CircuitLens uncovers interaction-driven activation dynamics that activation-only methods miss. Together, they improve interpretability robustness, scalability, and efficiency of circuit analysis.

Conclusion: The combination of WeightLens and CircuitLens advances robust, scalable mechanistic interpretability by leveraging weight- and interaction-based analyses, reducing reliance on external data/tools while enhancing insights into neural circuit computations.

Abstract: The fields of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability aim to uncover
the internal structure of neural networks, with circuit discovery as a central
tool for understanding model computations. Existing approaches, however, rely
on manual inspection and remain limited to toy tasks. Automated
interpretability offers scalability by analyzing isolated features and their
activations, but it often misses interactions between features and depends
strongly on external LLMs and dataset quality. Transcoders have recently made
it possible to separate feature attributions into input-dependent and
input-invariant components, providing a foundation for more systematic circuit
analysis. Building on this, we propose WeightLens and CircuitLens, two
complementary methods that go beyond activation-based analysis. WeightLens
interprets features directly from their learned weights, removing the need for
explainer models or datasets while matching or exceeding the performance of
existing methods on context-independent features. CircuitLens captures how
feature activations arise from interactions between components, revealing
circuit-level dynamics that activation-only approaches cannot identify.
Together, these methods increase interpretability robustness and enhance
scalable mechanistic analysis of circuits while maintaining efficiency and
quality.

*Jonas Geiping,Xinyu Yang,Guinan Su*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion-inspired sampler for recurrent-depth transformers accelerates generation by decoding new tokens each forward pass while refining latent states via recurrence, yielding up to 5x speedup on 3.5B models and reframing recurrent-depth LMs as continuous diffusion LMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce inference latency and boost generation speed and reasoning capabilities by leveraging the combination of recurrent depth and diffusion-like processes, enabling parallel refinement of token states while maintaining causal generation.

Method: Introduce a diffusion forcing sampler that decodes a new token at every forward pass and refines latent states in parallel through recurrence. The sampler is designed to be strictly more expressive than standard autoregressive generation with the same time budget and can be applied directly to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth transformers without any tuning.

Result: Empirically delivers up to ~5× speedup on 3.5B recurrent-depth transformers. The sampler is strictly more expressive than autoregressive generation under the same time budget. The approach also enables viewing recurrent-depth LMs as continuous, causal diffusion language models and can be applied without model tuning.

Conclusion: The work provides a practical mechanism to parallelize extra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference and supports the view that these models function as continuous diffusion LMs, offering both speedups and theoretical expressivity benefits.

Abstract: Language models with recurrent depth, also referred to as universal or looped
when considering transformers, are defined by the capacity to increase their
computation through the repetition of layers. Recent efforts in pretraining
have demonstrated that these architectures can scale to modern language
modeling tasks while exhibiting advantages in reasoning tasks. In this work, we
examine the relationship between recurrent-depth models and diffusion language
models. Building on their similarities, we develop a new diffusion forcing
sampler for these models to accelerate generation. The sampler advances by
decoding new tokens at every forward pass of the model, while the latent states
of these tokens can be further refined in parallel through recurrence.
Theoretically, generation with our sampler is strictly more expressive than the
baseline autoregressive generation using the same time budget on modern
hardware. Moreover, this sampler, based on principles from diffusion
literature, can be directly applied to existing 3.5B recurrent-depth
transformers without any tuning, leading to up to a 5x speedup. Consequently,
our findings not only provide an efficient mechanism for parallelizing the
extra computation in recurrent-depth models at inference, but also suggest that
such models can be naturally viewed as strong continuous, though causal,
diffusion language models.

*Zachary Robertson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TVD-MI-based binary pairwise comparisons of LLMs can be aggregated into centered-probability scores that preserve additivity for IRT without nonlinear links; identity link outperforms logistic/probit in reducing curvature. A clipped-linear model from Gini entropy yields a robust, box-constrained LS solution. With 33% coverage, holdout RMSE is 0.117 and ranking (Spearman ~0.97) is preserved, using far fewer evaluations; robustness across models remains strong (ρ ~0.87). Identity mapping best preserves TVD-MI geometry for efficient, bounded-response evaluation and may generalize to other domains.

Motivation: Develop an efficient, interpretable evaluation framework for pairwise LLM comparisons that avoids nonlinear link-induced distortions in IRT and reduces evaluation cost while preserving agent rankings across diverse models and tasks.

Method: Compute TVD-MI-based binary trials per LLM pair, average to obtain centered-probability scores suitable for additive IRT structure without links. Compare identity, probit, and logit links; quantify curvature (curl) in raw data under each. Derive a clipped-linear model via Gini-entropy maximization, leading to a box-constrained LS formulation that handles boundary saturation. Evaluate on three domains with holdout RMSE and Spearman correlations; perform robustness tests across models (GPT-4o-mini vs Llama3-70b).

Result: Identity link substantially reduces curvature than probit/logit (median curl 0.080-0.150 vs 0.245-0.588; P95 bounds). Holdout RMSE 0.117±0.008 at 33% coverage; Spearman ranking 0.972±0.015. Robust rankings across judge models (ρ=0.872). Achieves ~3x fewer evaluations than full dense while preserving agent rankings. TVD-MI geometry is best preserved by identity mapping, suggesting broader applicability to bounded-response domains.

Conclusion: A clipped-linear, box-constrained IRT approach with identity link best preserves the geometry of TVD-MI based pairwise comparisons, enabling efficient, additive evaluation of LLMs and likely other bounded responses. The method reduces data requirements while maintaining accurate rankings and demonstrates robustness across model judges.

Abstract: Pairwise comparisons of large language models using total variation distance
mutual information (TVD-MI) produce binary critic decisions per pair. We show
that averaging TVD-MI's binary trials yields centered-probability scores with
additive structure suitable for item-response theory (IRT) without nonlinear
link functions. Maximum-likelihood approaches to IRT use logistic links, but we
find empirically that these transformations introduce curvature that breaks
additivity: across three domains, the identity link yields median curl on raw
data of 0.080-0.150 (P95 = [0.474, 0.580]), whereas probit/logit introduce
substantially higher violations (median [0.245, 0.588], P95 [0.825, 2.252]). We
derive this clipped-linear model from Gini entropy maximization, yielding a
box-constrained least-squares formulation that handles boundary saturation. At
33% coverage, we achieve holdout RMSE $0.117 \pm 0.008$ while preserving agent
rankings (Spearman $\rho = 0.972 \pm 0.015$), three times fewer evaluations
than full dense. Judge robustness analysis (GPT-4o-mini vs. Llama3-70b) shows
strong agreement in agent rankings ($\rho = 0.872$) and consistent
identity-link advantage. TVD-MI's geometry is best preserved by identity
mapping for efficient LLM evaluation, applicable to other bounded-response
domains.

TL;DR: BINNs that integrate SNPs with multi-omics during training improve genomic prediction/selection, using genotype-only data at inference; large accuracy gains and uncover nonlinear biology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome modest accuracy of traditional G2P/GS models and reduce costly field trials by leveraging intermediate molecular phenotypes and pathway-informed inductive biases; enable training-time use of multi-omics with deployment-time genotype data only.

Method: Extend biologically-informed neural networks (BINNs) to GP/GS by encoding pathway-level inductive biases and integrating thousands of SNPs with multi-omics during training; perform inference using genotype data alone; evaluated on maize gene-expression and multi-environment field trials; includes a synthetic metabolomics benchmark.

Result: In maize data, BINNs yield up to 56% higher rank-correlation within/across subpopulations under sparse data; under a synthetic benchmark, reduce prediction error by 75% compared with conventional neural nets; BINN latent variables correlate with measured quantities; identify nonlinear genes GWAS/TWAS miss.

Conclusion: BINNs offer a biologically grounded framework to improve genomic prediction and reveal nonlinear relationships, guiding genomic selection, candidate gene prioritization, pathway enrichment, and gene editing.

Abstract: We extend biologically-informed neural networks (BINNs) for genomic
prediction (GP) and selection (GS) in crops by integrating thousands of
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with multi-omics measurements and prior
biological knowledge. Traditional genotype-to-phenotype (G2P) models depend
heavily on direct mappings that achieve only modest accuracy, forcing breeders
to conduct large, costly field trials to maintain or marginally improve genetic
gain. Models that incorporate intermediate molecular phenotypes such as gene
expression can achieve higher predictive fit, but they remain impractical for
GS since such data are unavailable at deployment or design time. BINNs overcome
this limitation by encoding pathway-level inductive biases and leveraging
multi-omics data only during training, while using genotype data alone during
inference. Applied to maize gene-expression and multi-environment field-trial
data, BINN improves rank-correlation accuracy by up to 56% within and across
subpopulations under sparse-data conditions and nonlinearly identifies genes
that GWAS/TWAS fail to uncover. With complete domain knowledge for a synthetic
metabolomics benchmark, BINN reduces prediction error by 75% relative to
conventional neural nets and correctly identifies the most important nonlinear
pathway. Importantly, both cases show highly sensitive BINN latent variables
correlate with the experimental quantities they represent, despite not being
trained on them. This suggests BINNs learn biologically-relevant
representations, nonlinear or linear, from genotype to phenotype. Together,
BINNs establish a framework that leverages intermediate domain information to
improve genomic prediction accuracy and reveal nonlinear biological
relationships that can guide genomic selection, candidate gene selection,
pathway enrichment, and gene-editing prioritization.

### [293] [pi-Flow: Policy-Based Few-Step Generation via Imitation Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14974)
*Hansheng Chen,Kai Zhang,Hao Tan,Leonidas Guibas,Gordon Wetzstein,Sai Bi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Policy-based flow models (pi-Flow) replace velocity-based teacher-student distillation with a network-free policy that emits substep velocities, enabling fast ODE integration; paired with imitation distillation to align the policy-driven trajectory with the teacher, yielding stable training and improved quality-diversity without extra networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the format mismatch and quality-diversity trade-off in few-step diffusion/flow distillation; traditional distillation uses a velocity predictor as teacher, leading to complex procedures and trade-offs.

Method: Modify the student flow's output to predict a policy at one timestep; policy computes dynamic velocities at future substeps with negligible overhead; avoid extra network evaluations; use imitation distillation by matching policy velocities to the teacher's along the policy trajectory via an L2 flow-matching loss.

Result: Achieves 1-NFE FID 2.85 on ImageNet 256^2, outperforming MeanFlow for the same architecture; on FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, achieves substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods while maintaining teacher-level quality.

Conclusion: pi-Flow enables stable, scalable training and eliminates the quality-diversity trade-off by mimicking teacher behavior, enabling fast, accurate substep integration with superior quality and diversity.

Abstract: Few-step diffusion or flow-based generative models typically distill a
velocity-predicting teacher into a student that predicts a shortcut towards
denoised data. This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures
that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we
propose policy-based flow models ($\pi$-Flow). $\pi$-Flow modifies the output
layer of a student flow model to predict a network-free policy at one timestep.
The policy then produces dynamic flow velocities at future substeps with
negligible overhead, enabling fast and accurate ODE integration on these
substeps without extra network evaluations. To match the policy's ODE
trajectory to the teacher's, we introduce a novel imitation distillation
approach, which matches the policy's velocity to the teacher's along the
policy's trajectory using a standard $\ell_2$ flow matching loss. By simply
mimicking the teacher's behavior, $\pi$-Flow enables stable and scalable
training and avoids the quality-diversity trade-off. On ImageNet 256$^2$, it
attains a 1-NFE FID of 2.85, outperforming MeanFlow of the same DiT
architecture. On FLUX.1-12B and Qwen-Image-20B at 4 NFEs, $\pi$-Flow achieves
substantially better diversity than state-of-the-art few-step methods, while
maintaining teacher-level quality.
