In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a\nrandomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for\nboth diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates\nstrong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion\nmodel reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75\nnumber of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a\nlarge margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading\nVAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our\nconsistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step,\nsignificantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart.

For\na single decision maker, designing an optimal predictor is equivalent to\nminimizing a proper loss function corresponding to the negative utility of that\nindividual. For multiple decision makers, our problem can be viewed as a\nvariant of omniprediction in which the goal is to design a single predictor\nthat simultaneously minimizes multiple losses. Existing algorithms for\nachieving omniprediction broadly fall into two categories: 1) boosting methods\nthat optimize other auxiliary targets such as multicalibration and obtain\nomniprediction as a corollary, and 2) adversarial two-player game based\napproaches that estimate and respond to the ``worst-case\" loss in an online\nfashion. We give lower bounds demonstrating that multicalibration is a strictly\nmore difficult problem than omniprediction and thus the former approach must\nincur suboptimal sample complexity. For the latter approach, we discuss how\nthese ideas can be used to obtain a sample-efficient algorithm through an\nonline-to-batch conversion. This conversion has the downside of returning a\ncomplex, randomized predictor. We improve on this method by designing a more\ndirect, unrandomized algorithm that exploits structural elements of the set of\nproper losses.", "AI": {"tldr": "The paper studies omniprediction vs multicalibration for multiple decision makers: it proves multicalibration requires more samples than omniprediction, analyzes boosting and adversarial approaches, and presents a direct unrandomized algorithm that uses the structure of proper losses to achieve sample-efficient omniprediction.", "motivation": "To build a single probabilistic predictor that supports multiple downstream decisions with low losses, and to understand the sample-efficiency trade-offs between boosting-based multicalibration and adversarial online methods for omniprediction.", "method": "Provide lower bounds comparing multicalibration and omniprediction; analyze two algorithm families: boosting methods that yield omniprediction as a corollary, and adversarial two-player online approaches that target worst-case loss.
