### [1] [Hybrid Deep Learning for Hyperspectral Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00033)
*Usman Muhammad,Jorma Laaksonen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a plug-in module for 2D CNNs to improve hyperspectral SISR by combining spectral unmixing with spectral–spatial feature extraction, plus a Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss; shows competitive accuracy with lower model complexity on three public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral SISR is hard because preserving spectral fidelity across many bands while recovering fine spatial details is difficult for standard deep models; a dedicated fusion module and loss guiding both spatial and spectral reconstruction are needed.

Method: Incorporates SSUF into a ResNet-based CNN to fuse spectral unmixing with spectral–spatial feature extraction; introduces a Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss that blends mean squared error with spatial and spectral gradient terms; trained and evaluated on three public hyperspectral datasets.

Result: The hybrid model achieves competitive performance while reducing model complexity, demonstrating effective reconstruction of both spatial and spectral features across datasets.

Conclusion: SSUF provides a practical, plug-and-play approach to enhance hyperspectral SISR in standard architectures, and the spatial-spectral gradient loss further improves fidelity; the framework shows promise for deployment with limited resources and broader applications.

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task due
to the difficulty of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral
fidelity across a wide range of wavelengths, which limits the performance of
conventional deep learning models. To address this challenge, we introduce
Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a novel module that can be seamlessly
integrated into standard 2D convolutional architectures to enhance both spatial
resolution and spectral integrity. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with
spectral--spatial feature extraction and guides a ResNet-based convolutional
neural network for improved reconstruction. In addition, we propose a custom
Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function that integrates mean squared error with
spatial and spectral gradient components, encouraging accurate reconstruction
of both spatial and spectral features. Experiments on three public remote
sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid deep
learning model achieves competitive performance while reducing model
complexity.

### [2] [Review of Hallucination Understanding in Large Language and Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00034)
*Zhengyi Ho,Siyuan Liang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A survey paper proposing a unified, multi-level framework to characterize text and image hallucinations across applications, linking them to lifecycle mechanisms via a task–modality interleaved approach. It identifies predictable data-patterns and inherited biases as root causes and aims to guide robust, generalizable solutions for real-world generative AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in large language and vision models pose real-world risks (misinformation, harm, financial/operational costs) and lack a coherent, integrated understanding. A unified framework is needed to reduce fragmentation and improve robustness.

Method: Develop a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing text and image hallucinations across diverse tasks and modalities; employ a task–modality interleaved approach to map hallucinations to model lifecycle mechanisms; synthesize existing literature into a coherent taxonomy and cross-modal analysis.

Result: Identification of data-distribution patterns and inherited biases as common roots of hallucinations; establishment of a foundational, integrated framework to guide development of more robust and generalizable mitigation strategies in real-world AI systems.

Conclusion: A coherent, cross-modal, lifecycle-aware framework reduces fragmentation in the study of hallucinations and supports the design of more effective, generalizable defenses in real-world generative AI deployments.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language and vision models in real-world
applications has made urgent the need to address hallucinations -- instances
where models produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs. These errors can
propagate misinformation during deployment, leading to both financial and
operational harm. Although much research has been devoted to mitigating
hallucinations, our understanding of it is still incomplete and fragmented.
Without a coherent understanding of hallucinations, proposed solutions risk
mitigating surface symptoms rather than underlying causes, limiting their
effectiveness and generalizability in deployment. To tackle this gap, we first
present a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing both image and text
hallucinations across diverse applications, aiming to reduce conceptual
fragmentation. We then link these hallucinations to specific mechanisms within
a model's lifecycle, using a task-modality interleaved approach to promote a
more integrated understanding. Our investigations reveal that hallucinations
often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited
biases. By deepening our understanding, this survey provides a foundation for
developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world
generative AI systems.

### [3] [On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00037)
*Jianing Guo,Zhenhong Wu,Chang Tu,Yiyao Ma,Xiangqi Kong,Zhiqian Liu,Jiaming Ji,Shuning Zhang,Yuanpei Chen,Kai Chen,Xianglong Liu,Qi Dou,Yaodong Yang,Huijie Zhao,Weifeng Lv,Simin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobustVLA enhances multi-modal robustness in Vision-Language-Action models by combining offline worst-case optimization, input-consistency enforcement, and a bandit-driven perturbation search, yielding strong gains and faster inference on 17 perturbations across four modalities, especially with diffusion-based action heads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address real-world, multi-modal perturbations in VLA systems, where current methods mostly target simple visual perturbations and do not generalize across actions, instructions, environments, and observations.

Method: 1) Baseline evaluation of 17 perturbations across four modalities to identify weaknesses (actions found to be most fragile; existing visual-robust VLAs lack cross-modality robustness; pi0 diffusion-based action head shows strength).
2) Propose RobustVLA framework: a) Output robustness via offline robust optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in the flow matching objective, incorporating adversarial training-like elements (label smoothing and outlier penalization).
3) Input robustness via enforcing consistent actions across input variations preserving task semantics.
4) Multi-perturbation handling by modeling robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and using Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) to identify the most harmful noise.
5) Empirical evaluation on LIBERO dataset and real-world FR5 robot demonstrations; comparison across pi0 and OpenVLA backbones.

Result: RobustVLA achieves substantial improvements across perturbations: 12.6 percentage points absolute gain on the pi0 backbone and 10.4 points on OpenVLA across 17 perturbations; 50.6x faster inference than prior visual-robust VLAs; 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations; particularly strong performance (65.6% absolute gains) on a real FR5 robot with limited demonstrations across four modalities.

Conclusion: Multi-modal robustness in VLA systems benefits significantly from combining input-consistency strategies, worst-case output optimization, and principled perturbation identification via bandits. The diffusion-based pi0 action head contributes to robustness, and RobustVLA offers strong, scalable improvements with efficiency gains, enabling better deployment in real-world robotic and interactive settings.

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

### [4] [Uncovering Intrinsic Capabilities: A Paradigm for Data Curation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00040)
*Junjie Li,Ziao Wang,Jianghong Ma,Xiaofeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADC uncovers intrinsic capabilities from gradient trajectories, attributes data by influence to these capabilities, and curates a capability-aware curriculum, achieving state-of-the-art performance with only 5% of the original instruction data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing the instruction-tuning data budget for large vision-language models often leads to performance regressions. Heuristic, black-box data selection overlooks latent capabilities that govern learning.

Method: Unsupervised discovery of intrinsic capabilities from gradient-based learning trajectories; attribute training data to these capabilities via influence estimation; curate capability-aware curricula through balanced data selection and staged sequencing.

Result: With as little as 5% of the original data, CADC surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks.

Conclusion: Intrinsic capabilities are the fundamental building blocks of model learning, and CADC provides a principled, capability-driven paradigm for instruction data curation.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, but
controlling their behavior through instruction tuning remains difficult.
Reducing the budget of instruction tuning dataset often causes regressions, as
heuristic strategies treat models as black boxes and overlook the latent
capabilities that govern learning. We introduce Capability-Attributed Data
Curation (CADC), a framework that shifts curation from task-specific heuristics
to intrinsic capability analysis. CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities in an
unsupervised manner from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes
training data to these capabilities via influence estimation, and curates
capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing.
This transforms black-box instruction tuning into a controllable,
capability-driven process. With as little as 5% of the original data, CADC
surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks. These results validate
intrinsic capabilities as the fundamental building blocks of model learning and
establish CADC as a principle paradigm for instruction data curation.

### [5] [Culture In a Frame: C$^3$B as a Comic-Based Benchmark for Multimodal Culturally Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00041)
*Yuchen Song,Andong Chen,Wenxin Zhu,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Muyun Yang,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces C3B, a multicultural, multitask, multilingual benchmark for cultural awareness in MLLMs, with 2000+ images and 18k+ QA pairs across escalating tasks; shows current MLLMs underperform humans and face challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks are too easy due to real-world images containing typically a single culture, lack cross-lingual tasks, and have shallow task design. There is a need for tougher, multilingual, cross-cultural evaluation to advance MLLMs' cultural awareness capabilities.

Method: Proposes C3B (C omics Cross-Cultural Benchmark) comprising over 2000 images and over 18000 QA pairs across three tasks with progressed difficulties: basic visual recognition, higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and cultural content generation; evaluated on 11 open-source MLLMs.

Result: The benchmark reveals a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human performance, demonstrating C3B's difficulty and its potential to drive progress in cultural awareness capabilities of MLLMs.

Conclusion: C3B poses substantial challenges for current MLLMs and is expected to spur future research to advance cultural awareness capabilities in multimodal language models.

Abstract: Cultural awareness capabilities has emerged as a critical capability for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, current benchmarks lack
progressed difficulty in their task design and are deficient in cross-lingual
tasks. Moreover, current benchmarks often use real-world images. Each
real-world image typically contains one culture, making these benchmarks
relatively easy for MLLMs. Based on this, we propose C$^3$B ($\textbf{C}$omics
$\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{C}$ultural $\textbf{B}$enchmark), a novel
multicultural, multitask and multilingual cultural awareness capabilities
benchmark. C$^3$B comprises over 2000 images and over 18000 QA pairs,
constructed on three tasks with progressed difficulties, from basic visual
recognition to higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and finally to
cultural content generation. We conducted evaluations on 11 open-source MLLMs,
revealing a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human performance.
The gap demonstrates that C$^3$B poses substantial challenges for current
MLLMs, encouraging future research to advance the cultural awareness
capabilities of MLLMs.

### [6] [Beyond the Prompt: Gender Bias in Text-to-Image Models, with a Case Study on Hospital Professions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00045)
*Franck Vandewiele,Remi Synave,Samuel Delepoulle,Remi Cozot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Six open-weight text-to-image models show gender bias that is both systematic and model-specific. Nurses are depicted as women and surgeons as men across models, but the strength and sensitivity to prompts vary; portrait qualifiers modulate gender balance. Bias is influenced by prompt wording, requiring bias-aware design and guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To audit and understand how state-of-the-art TTI models encode and reproduce gender stereotypes in professional contexts, with emphasis on potential real-world impact in professional, educational, and creative use.

Method: Generate 100 images for each combination of five hospital professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse, paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers (empty, corporate, neutral, aesthetic, beautiful) across six open-weight models (HunyuanImage 2.1, HiDream-I1-dev, Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large, Stable-Diffusion-XL). Analyze gender representation and compare patterns across models and prompts.

Result: Findings show: nurses depicted as women across all models; surgeons predominantly men. Model-specific differences: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male dominance; HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes; FLUX.1-dev skews female in most roles; HunyuanImage 2.1 and SD3.5 Large reproduce stereotypes but with varying prompt sensitivity. Portrait qualifiers modulate gender balance (e.g., corporate reinforces male depictions; beautiful favors female). Sensitivity to prompts varies: Qwen-Image nearly invariant; FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.

Conclusion: Gender bias in TTI models is both systematic and model-specific. Prompt wording meaningfully shapes demographic outcomes. To mitigate harm, bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance are needed to prevent reinforcing occupational stereotypes in generative AI.

Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) models are increasingly used in professional,
educational, and creative contexts, yet their outputs often embed and amplify
social biases. This paper investigates gender representation in six
state-of-the-art open-weight models: HunyuanImage 2.1, HiDream-I1-dev,
Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable-Diffusion-XL.
Using carefully designed prompts, we generated 100 images for each combination
of five hospital-related professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse,
paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers ("", corporate, neutral,
aesthetic, beautiful).
  Our analysis reveals systematic occupational stereotypes: all models produced
nurses exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men. However,
differences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male
dominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in
most roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce
gender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt
formulation. Portrait qualifiers further modulate gender balance, with terms
like corporate reinforcing male depictions and beautiful favoring female ones.
Sensitivity varies widely: Qwen-Image remains nearly unaffected, while
FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.
  These findings demonstrate that gender bias in TTI models is both systematic
and model-specific. Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt
wording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results
underscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance
to prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI.

### [7] [Reinforcement Learning-Based Prompt Template Stealing for Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00046)
*Xiaotian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RLStealer is a reinforcement-learning based prompt inversion system that reconstructs prompt templates from few example images, achieving state-of-the-art results and reducing attack costs to under 13% of prior baselines, exposing a security risk in MLLM prompt trading.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt trading in multimodal LLMs enables rapid style prompts but raises security concerns: stolen prompts can be used to imitate styles; there is a need to understand and quantify this risk and push for defenses.

Method: Formulates prompt stealing as sequential decision making; uses reinforcement learning with multiple similarity-based reward signals to explore and recover templates from limited examples; evaluates on public benchmarks; demonstrates generalization to unseen styles.

Result: State-of-the-art performance in prompt inversion with attack cost < 13% of existing baselines; generalizes to unseen prompt templates across different image styles; comprehensive experiments validate effectiveness.

Conclusion: Highlights urgent security threat in prompt trading, motivating protective standards and defenses in the emerging MLLMs marketplace; RLStealer provides a framework and baseline for evaluating and mitigating prompt theft risks.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed text-to-image
workflows, allowing designers to create novel visual concepts with
unprecedented speed. This progress has given rise to a thriving prompt trading
market, where curated prompts that induce trademark styles are bought and sold.
Although commercially attractive, prompt trading also introduces a largely
unexamined security risk: the prompts themselves can be stolen.
  In this paper, we expose this vulnerability and present RLStealer, a
reinforcement learning based prompt inversion framework that recovers its
template from only a small set of example images. RLStealer treats template
stealing as a sequential decision making problem and employs multiple
similarity based feedback signals as reward functions to effectively explore
the prompt space. Comprehensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate that RLStealer gets state-of-the-art performance while reducing the
total attack cost to under 13% of that required by existing baselines. Our
further analysis confirms that RLStealer can effectively generalize across
different image styles to efficiently steal unseen prompt templates. Our study
highlights an urgent security threat inherent in prompt trading and lays the
groundwork for developing protective standards in the emerging MLLMs
marketplace.

### [8] [Explanation-Driven Counterfactual Testing for Faithfulness in Vision-Language Model Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00047)
*Sihao Ding,Santosh Vasa,Aditi Ramadwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDCT is an automated verification pipeline that treats a vision-language model's natural-language explanations as falsifiable hypotheses. It parses explanations into visual concepts, generates counterfactual edits via inpainting, and computes a Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) with LLM-assisted analysis, revealing faithfulness gaps and producing regulator-aligned audit artifacts across OK-VQA tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a persistent gap between the plausibility of generated explanations and the true causal factors behind model predictions. This mismatch poses technical and governance risks, motivating scalable, automated methods to assess faithfulness of explanations and provide audit-ready artifacts.

Method: 1) Run the target VLM to obtain an answer and its natural-language explanation (NLE) for an image-question pair. 2) Parse the NLE into testable visual concepts. 3) Create targeted counterfactual edits using generative inpainting to alter these concepts. 4) Use LLM-assisted analysis to compare changes in answers and explanations, yielding a Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS).

Result: Empirically evaluated on 120 curated OK-VQA examples across multiple VLMs. The method reveals substantial faithfulness gaps and delivers regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal tests.

Conclusion: EDCT provides a fully automated, audit-friendly verification procedure to assess the faithfulness of VLM explanations. It helps identify when explanations reflect genuine causal factors and offers artifacts useful for governance, oversight, and model debugging.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often produce fluent Natural Language
Explanations (NLEs) that sound convincing but may not reflect the causal
factors driving predictions. This mismatch of plausibility and faithfulness
poses technical and governance risks. We introduce Explanation-Driven
Counterfactual Testing (EDCT), a fully automated verification procedure for a
target VLM that treats the model's own explanation as a falsifiable hypothesis.
Given an image-question pair, EDCT: (1) obtains the model's answer and NLE, (2)
parses the NLE into testable visual concepts, (3) generates targeted
counterfactual edits via generative inpainting, and (4) computes a
Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) using LLM-assisted analysis of changes
in both answers and explanations. Across 120 curated OK-VQA examples and
multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovers substantial faithfulness gaps and provides
regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal
tests.

### [9] [HiDe: Rethinking The Zoom-IN method in High Resolution MLLMs via Hierarchical Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00054)
*Xianjie Liu,Yiman Hu,Yixiong Zou,Liang Wu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiDe is a training-free hierarchical decoupling framework that tackles high-resolution multimodal visual understanding by suppressing background interference. It decouples question tokens via Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to locate key visual tokens and uses Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to separate these regions from background, reconstructing a compact representation while preserving spatial layout. It achieves state-of-the-art results on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K and reduces memory usage by ~75% compared to prior training-free methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevailing belief attributes high-res MLLM gaps to perceptual limits and small-object recognition, leading to zoom-in strategies. The authors argue the core bottleneck is background interference that misleads attention, not object size, and posit a training-free decoupling approach to isolate relevant visual tokens for accurate alignment with questions.

Method: Introduce HiDe, a two-stage hierarchical decoupling: (1) Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) selects information-rich tokens by analyzing cross-attention or similar weights to identify key visual tokens corresponding to the query; (2) Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) separates these regions from the background while preserving spatial layout; reconstructs a compact, background-free representation for downstream multimodal reasoning. The framework is training-free and emphasizes attention-guided token selection and spatially-aware background removal.

Result: Empirical results show HiDe achieves new SOTA on V*Bench, HRBench4K, HRBench8K and boosts models like Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B to SOTA levels (e.g., 92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench). Optimizations reduce memory by ~75% relative to prior training-free methods. Code release provided.

Conclusion: Background interference, not object size, is the main challenge in high-res MLLMs. A training-free, hierarchical decoupling approach can substantially improve high-resolution visual understanding while being resource-efficient. The method offers a practical route to state-of-the-art performance without task-specific training.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in
visual understanding tasks. However, their performance on high-resolution
images remains suboptimal. While existing approaches often attribute this
limitation to perceptual constraints and argue that MLLMs struggle to recognize
small objects, leading them to use "zoom in" strategies for better detail, our
analysis reveals a different cause: the main issue is not object size, but
rather caused by complex background interference. We systematically analyze
this "zoom in" operation through a series of decoupling experiments and propose
the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe), a training-free framework that
uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to decouple the question tokens and
identify the key information tokens, then leverages their attention weights to
achieve precise alignment with the target visual regions. Subsequently, it
employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple these regions from the
background and reconstructs a compact representation that preserves essential
spatial layouts while eliminating background interference. HiDe sets a new SOTA
on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B
to SOTA (92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench), even surpassing RL methods. After
optimization, HiDe uses 75% less memory than the previous training-free
approach. Code is provided in https://github.com/Tennine2077/HiDe.

### [10] [FSDENet: A Frequency and Spatial Domains based Detail Enhancement Network for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00059)
*Jiahao Fu,Yinfeng Yu,Liejun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSDENet fuses spatial-domain features with FFT-based global representations and Haar-wavelet edge refinement to boost remote-sensing segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results on four datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (e.g., shadows, low contrast) and fully leverage spatial information for improved segmentation.

Method: Extracts multi-scale spatial features; integrates global information via FFT in global mappings; uses Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency components for boundary refinement; achieves dual-domain synergy by combining spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity.

Result: State-of-the-art performance achieved on LoveDA, Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID datasets.

Conclusion: Dual-domain fusion of spatial and frequency information enhances boundary accuracy and robustness to grayscale variations, offering substantial gains in remote-sensing segmentation.

Abstract: To fully leverage spatial information for remote sensing image segmentation
and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (e.g.,
shadows and low-contrast regions), we propose the Frequency and Spatial Domains
based Detail Enhancement Network (FSDENet). Our framework employs spatial
processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and
fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and
frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global
mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under
grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize
Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency
components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine
boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating
spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially
improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition
zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA,
Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

### [11] [Less is More: Lean yet Powerful Vision-Language Model for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00060)
*Sheng Yang,Tong Zhan,Guancheng Chen,Yanfeng Lu,Jian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This paper reimagines autonomous driving as next waypoint prediction using a one-stage, end-to-end framework (Max-V1) that leverages a Vision-Language Model to generate trajectories directly from front-view input, trained via imitation learning. It achieves state-of-the-art results on nuScenes and shows strong cross-domain generalization across vehicles, suggesting potential for cross-vehicle robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify perception and planning under a generative, language-like formulation, improving data efficiency and cross-domain robustness while simplifying the pipeline by avoiding modular hand-engineered components.

Method: Introduce Max-V1, a one-stage end-to-end framework that predicts future waypoints in a single pass from front-view images using a Vision-Language Model. Employ principled supervision derived from statistical modeling and train via imitation learning on large-scale expert demonstrations. Evaluate on nuScenes and cross-domain datasets across diverse vehicles; provide code upon publication.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes with an overall improvement of over 30% relative to prior baselines; demonstrates superior cross-domain generalization across vehicles, indicating robustness and adaptability for different platforms.

Conclusion: The approach lays a foundation for more capable self-driving agents by leveraging generative, language-like trajectory planning and end-to-end learning, highlighting the feasibility of cross-vehicle robustness and proposing a new direction for autonomous driving research.

Abstract: In this work, we reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language
and formulate the trajectory planning task as next waypoint prediction. We
introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous
driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns
with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the
generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end
trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of
this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from
statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which
makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through
imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset,
delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines.
Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain
datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for
cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths,
this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the
foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents. Code will
be available upon publication.

### [12] [Efficient CNN Compression via Multi-method Low Rank Factorization and Feature Map Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00062)
*M. Kokhazadeh,G. Keramidas,V. Kelefouras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An end-to-end design space exploration framework for CNN compression via low-rank factorization (LRF). It uses a feature-map similarity-based rank selection, one-shot fine-tuning, per-layer selection of six LRF techniques (three for Conv, three for FC), and TensorFlow 2.x integration. Demonstrates substantial compression with minimal accuracy loss across 14 models and 8 datasets, outperforming several SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRF-based compression faces challenges in optimal rank selection, vast design space, long fine-tuning times, and limited compatibility across layer types and decomposition methods. There is a need for an end-to-end framework that jointly handles rank selection, method selection, and efficient fine-tuning while remaining broadly compatible.

Method: Proposes a rank selection strategy based on feature map similarity to capture non-linear interactions between layer outputs. Introduces a one-shot fine-tuning process to reduce overall fine-tuning time. Ensures compatibility with Conv and FC layers and integrates three LRF techniques for Conv layers and three for FC layers, applied selectively per layer. Demonstrates that combining multiple LRF methods within a single model yields better compression than using a single method uniformly. Integrates the approach into TensorFlow 2.x and performs a comprehensive evaluation on 14 CNN models across eight datasets to compare six LRF techniques.

Result: Substantial compression with minimal accuracy loss and superior performance relative to several state-of-the-art techniques. The study provides practical insights into the effectiveness of different LRF techniques and validates the benefit of mixing methods and the new rank-selection strategy.

Conclusion: The proposed end-to-end DSE framework effectively addresses key LRF challenges, enabling flexible, efficient compression across diverse CNN architectures. The combination of feature-map-based rank selection, one-shot fine-tuning, and per-layer multi-method LRF yields improved compression performance, and the TensorFlow 2.x integration facilitates practical adoption.

Abstract: Low-Rank Factorization (LRF) is a widely adopted technique for compressing
deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it faces several challenges, including
optimal rank selection, a vast design space, long fine-tuning times, and
limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods.
This paper presents an end-to-end Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodology
and framework for compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that
addresses all these issues. We introduce a novel rank selection strategy based
on feature map similarity, which captures non-linear interactions between layer
outputs more effectively than traditional weight-based approaches. Unlike prior
works, our method uses a one-shot fine-tuning process, significantly reducing
the overall fine-tuning time. The proposed framework is fully compatible with
all types of convolutional (Conv) and fully connected (FC) layers. To further
improve compression, the framework integrates three different LRF techniques
for Conv layers and three for FC layers, applying them selectively on a
per-layer basis. We demonstrate that combining multiple LRF methods within a
single model yields better compression results than using a single method
uniformly across all layers. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation and
comparison of the six LRF techniques, offering practical insights into their
effectiveness across different scenarios. The proposed work is integrated into
TensorFlow 2.x, ensuring compatibility with widely used deep learning
workflows. Experimental results on 14 CNN models across eight datasets
demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves substantial compression with
minimal accuracy loss, outperforming several state-of-the-art techniques.

*Jiancong Xie,Wenjin Wang,Zhuomeng Zhang,Zihan Liu,Qi Liu,Ke Feng,Zixun Sun,Yuedong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OIG-Bench introduces a benchmark for One-Image Guide understanding in multimodal LLMs, featuring a semi-automated, multi-agent annotation pipeline for image-text pairs and evaluating 29 MLLMs. Qwen2.5-VL-72B tops with 77% accuracy; all models show gaps in semantic reasoning and complex visual-text relations; the annotation system itself outperforms MLLMs in image captioning; dataset available at the project URL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of evaluation for human-like understanding in One-Image Guides (OIGs) for Multimodal LLMs and to reduce annotation costs in constructing image-text datasets.

Method: Develop OIG-Bench spanning diverse domains; implement a semi-automated annotation pipeline where multiple intelligent agents collaboratively generate preliminary captions/descriptions to aid humans in creating image-text pairs; evaluate 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs (proprietary and open-source) on the benchmark; compare with the proposed annotation system on image captioning.

Result: Qwen2.5-VL-72B achieves the best overall performance with 77% accuracy; all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding and logical reasoning for OIG tasks; the multi-agent annotation system outperforms all MLLMs in image captioning, suggesting strong potential for high-quality image descriptions and dataset construction.

Conclusion: OIG-Bench provides a comprehensive, challenging benchmark for evaluating human-like One-Image Guide understanding in MLLMs and reveals current models’ limits in complex visual-text reasoning; the multi-agent annotation approach is effective for generating high-quality image descriptions and valuable for future dataset creation; the dataset is publicly available for community use.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, evaluating their capacity for human-like
understanding in One-Image Guides remains insufficiently explored. One-Image
Guides are a visual format combining text, imagery, and symbols to present
reorganized and structured information for easier comprehension, which are
specifically designed for human viewing and inherently embody the
characteristics of human perception and understanding. Here, we present
OIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark focused on One-Image Guide understanding
across diverse domains. To reduce the cost of manual annotation, we developed a
semi-automated annotation pipeline in which multiple intelligent agents
collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in
constructing image-text pairs. With OIG-Bench, we have conducted a
comprehensive evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
proprietary and open-source models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B
performs the best among the evaluated models, with an overall accuracy of 77%.
Nevertheless, all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding
and logical reasoning, indicating that current MLLMs still struggle to
accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships. In addition, we also
demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent annotation system outperforms all
MLLMs in image captioning, highlighting its potential as both a high-quality
image description generator and a valuable tool for future dataset
construction. Datasets are available at https://github.com/XiejcSYSU/OIG-Bench.

TL;DR: Geo-R1 is a two-stage post-training framework that enables geospatial reasoning in vision-language models: scaffolding with synthetic chain-of-thought to teach geospatial thinking, followed by GRPO-based reinforcement learning on a weak cross-view proxy to align multimodal features, achieving state-of-the-art results on geospatial reasoning benchmarks; available at HuggingFace.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to unlock geospatial reasoning in vision-language models without relying on costly human reasoning annotations, by first teaching a geospatial thinking paradigm and then reinforcing cross-modal reasoning to improve predictive accuracy.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Scaffolding: supervised fine-tuning on synthetic chain-of-thought exemplars to instill a geospatial thinking paradigm, connecting visual cues with geographic priors. (2) Elevating: GRPO-based reinforcement learning using a weakly-supervised cross-view pairing proxy to provide a verifiable reward signal and align features across modalities.

Result: Geo-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various geospatial reasoning benchmarks, outperforming previous approaches.

Conclusion: Geo-R1 shifts geospatial modeling from domain pretraining/supervised fine-tuning to reasoning-first post-training, offering a scalable, verifiable reward-driven method and providing a publicly available model.

Abstract: We introduce Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric post-training framework that unlocks
geospatial reasoning in vision-language models by combining thinking
scaffolding and elevating. In the scaffolding stage, Geo-R1 instills a
``geospatial thinking paradigm" via supervised fine-tuning on synthetic
chain-of-thought exemplars, enabling models to connect visual cues with
geographic priors without costly human reasoning annotations. In the elevating
stage, it uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on a weakly-supervised
cross-view pairing proxy. This design supplies a verifiable and scalable reward
signal: teaching models to capture and reconcile features across modalities,
and harnessing reasoning for accurate prediction. Geo-R1 extends geospatial
modeling from domain pretraining / supervised finetuning to reasoning-first
post-training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
geospatial reasoning benchmarks. Our model is available at

*Hanjiang Hu,Bowei Li,Ziwei Wang,Tianhao Wei,Casidhe Hutchison,Eric Sample,Changliu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes USN-based pruning to combat over-parameterization in robustness certification under brightness/contrast perturbations, using a Unbiased and Smooth Neuron (USN) metric and a Wasserstein loss to concentrate pruning across layers, yielding improved robustness certification and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Certified training and robustness certification struggle with over-parameterized networks, which hurts tightness and scalability when defending against semantic perturbations like brightness and contrast changes.

Method: Analyze layer/neuron stability and variance under input perturbations; define a fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron (USN) metric to indicate certifiable robustness; prune neurons with low USN and retain high USN to preserve expressiveness; introduce a Wasserstein distance loss to encourage pruned neurons to be concentrated across layers; validate on robust keypoint detection with realistic brightness/contrast perturbations.

Result: Our approach achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared with baselines on robust keypoint detection under brightness/contrast perturbations.

Conclusion: USN-based pruning combined with Wasserstein loss effectively reduces over-parameterization while preserving or enhancing certifiable robustness for vision/robotics tasks under semantic perturbations.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics
applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness
against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast.
However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face
the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and
scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first
analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input
perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a
fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce
a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and
retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without
over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a
new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more
concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves
realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method
achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared
to baselines.

*Abu Hasnat Mohammad Rubaiyat,Jordan Vincent,Colin Olson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A transport-based HAD method that models hyperspectral pixels as deformations of a template in the SCDT domain, using unsupervised subspace modeling to detect anomalies; evaluated on five datasets with reported state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address HAD challenges under complex real-world environments and limited prior knowledge; leverage transport-based representations and the SCDT to capture deformations of spectral signatures; employ unsupervised background modeling.

Method: Treat pixels as samples of a template pattern undergoing unknown deformations and map them to the signed cumulative distribution transform (SCDT) domain. Build an unsupervised subspace model of background signals in this domain and detect anomalies as deviations from the learned model.

Result: Extensive experiments across five datasets show superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Proposes a novel transport-based framework for HAD using SCDT and unsupervised background modeling; robust to deformation of spectral signatures and effective for anomaly detection in hyperspectral imagery; demonstrates broad applicability.

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian
and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures
that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures.
Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges
arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior
knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel
HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the
pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral
pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown
deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative
distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling
technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in
this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the
learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets
illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

*Samar Fares,Nurbek Tastan,Noor Hussein,Karthik Nandakumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Watermarking framework for diffusion-based generative models using key-dependent perturbations; introduces MOLM with LoRA adapters; robust, imperceptible watermarking without re-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address rise of synthetic images and challenges in attributing sources; existing watermarking methods are fragile, vulnerable to distortions, and hard to update with new keys.

Method: Formulate encoding as key-dependent perturbation of model parameters; MOLM uses routing-based mixture of LoRA adapters activated by binary keys inside residual and attention blocks; no re-training required; robust extractor.

Result: Preserves image quality; robust key recovery under distortions, compression, regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial extractor attacks; validated on Stable Diffusion and FLUX.

Conclusion: MOLM provides a practical, robust, and update-friendly watermarking scheme for generative models, enabling source attribution and verifiability with high imperceptibility.

Abstract: Generative models can generate photorealistic images at scale. This raises
urgent concerns about the ability to detect synthetically generated images and
attribute these images to specific sources. While watermarking has emerged as a
possible solution, existing methods remain fragile to realistic distortions,
susceptible to adaptive removal, and expensive to update when the underlying
watermarking key changes. We propose a general watermarking framework that
formulates the encoding problem as key-dependent perturbation of the parameters
of a generative model. Within this framework, we introduce Mixture of LoRA
Markers (MOLM), a routing-based instantiation in which binary keys activate
lightweight LoRA adapters inside residual and attention blocks. This design
avoids key-specific re-training and achieves the desired properties such as
imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experiments on
Stable Diffusion and FLUX show that MOLM preserves image quality while
achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression and
regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the
extractor.

TL;DR: A unified combinatorial framework (CROWD) for Open-World Object Detection that interleaves discovering unknowns with learning representations, reducing confusion and forgetting, and boosting known accuracy and unknown recall.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OWOD methods struggle with semantic confusion between known/unknown and catastrophic forgetting, hindering both unknown recall and known-class accuracy.

Method: Proposes CROWD with two interwoven tasks: CROWD-Discover selects informative unknown instances via Submodular Conditional Gain to diversify unknowns; CROWD-Learn uses combinatorial objectives to disentangle known/unknown representations while preserving discriminative coherence among known classes.

Result: On M-OWODB and S-OWODB benchmarks, CROWD improves known-class accuracy by 2.83% and 2.05% respectively and yields ~2.4x unknown recall over leading baselines.

Conclusion: CROWD effectively mitigates confusion and forgetting in OWOD, validating the efficacy of combinatorial data-discovery and representation learning for continual unknown discovery and integration.

Abstract: Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) enriches traditional object detectors by
enabling continual discovery and integration of unknown objects via human
guidance. However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic
confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting,
leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection
(CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and
adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery
(CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover
strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain
(SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from
known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives
that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining
discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and
forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD
achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and
S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading
baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ExpDWT-VAE enhances the latent space of latent diffusion models for satellite imagery by integrating discrete wavelet transform (DWT) into a dual-branch VAE, combining spatial and frequency-domain features to produce a richer latent representation, validated on TerraFly satellite data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of work focusing on improving latent representations within latent diffusion models for remote sensing. The paper aims to leverage frequency-domain information via DWT to enrich the VAE latent space and thereby improve downstream diffusion modeling for satellite imagery.

Method: Propose ExpDWT-VAE with two branches: (1) spatial-domain processing via convolutional layers; (2) frequency-domain processing using 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, followed by convolution and inverse DWT to reconstruct frequency-aware features. Merge branches into a unified spatial-frequency latent representation, then apply convolutional layers and diagonal Gaussian mapping to obtain a latent representation.

Result: Validation on a TerraFly satellite imagery dataset shows improved performance across multiple metrics, indicating that the latent-space representation is enhanced by the proposed latent-space DWT approach.

Conclusion: Incorporating DWT-based frequency information into the VAE latent space for LDMs yields a more robust latent representation for satellite imagery, offering a viable path to improved RS diffusion models.

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), a subclass of diffusion models, mitigate the
computational complexity of pixel-space diffusion by operating within a
compressed latent space constructed by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),
demonstrating significant advantages in Remote Sensing (RS) applications.
Though numerous studies enhancing LDMs have been conducted, investigations
explicitly targeting improvements within the intrinsic latent space remain
scarce. This paper proposes an innovative perspective, utilizing the Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enhance the VAE's latent space representation,
designed for satellite imagery. The proposed method, ExpDWT-VAE, introduces
dual branches: one processes spatial domain input through convolutional
operations, while the other extracts and processes frequency-domain features
via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolutional operation, and inverse DWT
reconstruction. These branches merge to create an integrated spatial-frequency
representation, further refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian
mapping into a robust latent representation. We utilize a new satellite imagery
dataset housed by the TerraFly mapping system to validate our method.
Experimental results across several performance metrics highlight the efficacy
of the proposed method at enhancing latent space representation.

TL;DR: Introduces EgoTraj-Bench and BiFlow for robust ego-centric trajectory prediction under noisy first-person perception; achieves 10-15% improvements in minADE/minFDE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world ego-centric vision introduces perceptual artifacts (occlusions, ID switches, tracking drift) not captured by idealized training histories. The gap harms robustness of trajectory forecasting in human-centric environments; this work offers a real-world benchmark and a model designed to operate under these perceptual constraints.

Method: BiFlow is a dual-stream flow-matching model that denoises historical observations while forecasting future motion via a shared latent representation. It includes EgoAnchor, which conditions the decoder on distilled historical features through feature modulation. The approach is evaluated on EgoTraj-Bench, a real-world benchmark grounding noisy first-person histories to clean bird’s-eye-view futures.

Result: BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, with minADE and minFDE reduced by about 10–15% on average and improved robustness across experiments.

Conclusion: The benchmark and model provide a critical foundation for developing trajectory forecasting systems that are truly robust to the challenges of real-world, ego-centric perception.

Abstract: Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for
robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods
typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the
perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID
switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and
deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we
introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy,
first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories,
enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on
this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that
concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by
leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow
incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder
on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments
show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and
minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We
anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for
developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of
real-world, ego-centric perception.

TL;DR: Calibrating decision thresholds significantly improves zero-shot BiomedCLIP for chest radiograph diagnostics, matching or nearing a supervised CNN across pneumonia and TB tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare a lightweight supervised CNN with a zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (BiomedCLIP) for chest X-ray interpretation and to assess whether simple calibration can unlock zero-shot performance in medical imaging.

Method: Experiment across two tasks: pneumonia detection on PneumoniaMNIST and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset; compare a supervised CNN baseline vs a zero-shot BiomedCLIP; apply threshold calibration using a validation set to optimize the classification threshold and measure F1 scores.

Result: Pneumonia: F1 of 0.8841 for calibrated BiomedCLIP versus 0.8803 for the supervised CNN. Tuberculosis: F1 improves from 0.4812 to 0.7684 with calibration, approaching the supervised baseline of 0.7834.

Conclusion: Calibration is essential to unlock the diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs in medical imaging; with proper threshold tuning, zero-shot models can match or even outperform task-specific supervised models on these chest radiograph tasks.

Abstract: The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a
critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis
between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a
state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP,
across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST
benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our
experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in
both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we
demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy:
decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a
validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across
both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM
to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's
0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the
F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's
0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for
leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match
or even outperform efficient, task-specific supervised models.

TL;DR: PAL-UI enables GUI agents to actively retrieve past observations for long-horizon planning by using a dual-level summarizer and a dedicated memory retrieval tool, improving mobile GUI navigation and cross-domain web navigation without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon GUI tasks suffer from memory limits; truncating history or using shallow summaries risks losing crucial past visual details needed for future decisions.

Method: Introduce PAL-UI with a dual-level summarization agent (observation-level cues and action-level outcomes) and a retrieval tool to recall specific historical screenshots. Create a step-level mobile GUI navigation dataset (8.6K samples) and train PAL-UI-3B and PAL-UI-7B models based on Qwen2.5-VL. Evaluate on mobile GUI navigation and cross-domain web navigation, including data-efficient settings.

Result: PAL-UI significantly outperforms baselines and prior methods in mobile GUI navigation, even with limited data. It also generalizes well across domains, achieving notable improvements in web navigation without additional training.

Conclusion: Active memory retrieval is a promising approach to endow vision-based GUI agents with long-horizon planning capabilities, enabling adaptive recall of past observations to support future decisions.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) promise human-like interaction with software applications, yet
long-horizon tasks remain challenging due to memory limitations. Existing
approaches either truncate history or rely on simple textual summaries, which
risk losing critical information when past visual details become necessary for
future decisions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PAL-UI} (\textbf{P}lanning
with \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}ook-back), a novel framework that enables GUI
agents to adaptively retrieve past observations when required. PAL-UI combines
a dual-level summarization agent, capturing both observation-level cues and
action-level outcomes, with a dedicated retrieval tool that allows the agent to
recall specific historical screenshots during planning. We curate a step-level
instruction dataset of 8.6K samples from mobile GUI navigation trajectories and
train \textbf{PAL-UI-3B} and \textbf{PAL-UI-7B} models based on Qwen2.5-VL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAL-UI significantly outperforms
baseline models and prior methods in mobile GUI navigation tasks, even under
data-efficient settings. Moreover, PAL-UI exhibits strong cross-domain
generalization, achieving notable improvements in web navigation without
additional training. Our work highlights the potential of active memory

Motivation: Accurate meningioma delineation is crucial for radiotherapy planning and tissue preservation; generic segmentation tools struggle with tumor heterogeneity, necessitating disease-specific interactive solutions.

Method: Develop Interactive-MEN-RT integrating point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and scribbles for clinician-guided 3D segmentation in RT workflows; evaluated on 500 contrast-enhanced T1 MRI scans from BraTS 2025 Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge.

Result: Demonstrated substantial improvement over other segmentation methods with Dice up to 77.6% and IoU 64.8%, highlighting the value of clinically tailored segmentation in RT planning; code is publicly available.

Conclusion: Clinically tailored IMIS tools are essential for high-stakes tasks like meningioma RT planning; multi-modal interaction enhances precision and usability; broader validation and generalization remain areas for future work.

Abstract: Precise delineation of meningiomas is crucial for effective radiotherapy (RT)
planning, directly influencing treatment efficacy and preservation of adjacent
healthy tissues. While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated
considerable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation
remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image
Segmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI
techniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite
widespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically
critical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool
specifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT
workflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction
methods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and
scribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation
involving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025
Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated
substantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice
similarity coefficients of up to 77.6\% and Intersection over Union scores of

TL;DR: A unified BindWeave framework enables subject-consistent video generation by grounding complex prompts via an MLLM-DiT model that reasons across modalities to produce subject-aware conditioning for a diffusion transformer; demonstrated on OpenS2V with superior subject consistency and relevance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based video generators struggle to produce subject-consistent videos when prompts specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and multi-subject interactions.

Method: Proposes BindWeave; uses MLLM-DiT: multimodal large language model performs cross-modal reasoning to ground entities, disentangle roles/attributes/interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden states that condition the diffusion transformer.

Result: On OpenS2V benchmark, achieves superior performance in subject consistency, naturalness, and text relevance, outperforming existing open-source and commercial models.

Conclusion: BindWeave effectively handles single- to multi-subject video generation with heterogeneous entities, enabling faithful, coherent videos under complex prompts.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer has shown remarkable abilities in generating
high-fidelity videos, delivering visually coherent frames and rich details over
extended durations. However, existing video generation models still fall short
in subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing
prompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and
interactions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose
BindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video
scenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with
heterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual
subjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal
large language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and
disentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden
states that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity
subject-consistent video generation. Experiments on the OpenS2V benchmark
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across subject
consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos, outperforming
existing open-source and commercial models.

### [26] [Measuring and Controlling the Spectral Bias for Self-Supervised Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00454)
*Wang Zhang,Huaqiu Li,Xiaowan Hu,Tao Jiang,Zikang Chen,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCNet for self-supervised denoising with spectral control on paired noisy images; uses frequency-band selection, Lipschitz-based kernel constraints, and an SSR module to preserve high-frequency structure while suppressing noise, improving convergence and denoising quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods mapping one noisy image to another suffer from spectral bias: poor high-frequency preservation and leakage of high-frequency noise when fitting frequencies. There is a need for a spectral-control approach that improves denoising without changing network architecture.

Method: Proposed three components: (1) a frequency-band selection strategy to choose informative bands and accelerate convergence; (2) a Lipschitz-based parameter optimization to constrain convolutional kernels to high-frequency noise without changing network structure; (3) an SSR module that performs frequency-domain separation and low-rank reconstruction to separate noise from high-frequency details and recover HF content.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SCNet improves preservation of high-frequency structural details while suppressing high-frequency noise, outperforming baseline self-supervised paired-image denoising methods.

Conclusion: SCNet provides effective spectral control for self-supervised denoising on paired noisy images, addressing spectral-bias limitations and improving denoising quality; the approach could be extended to other spectral learning tasks and paired-image denoising paradigms.

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images typically
involve mapping one noisy image through the network to the other noisy image.
However, after measuring the spectral bias of such methods using our proposed
Image Pair Frequency-Band Similarity, it suffers from two practical
limitations. Firstly, the high-frequency structural details in images are not
preserved well enough. Secondly, during the process of fitting high
frequencies, the network learns high-frequency noise from the mapped noisy
images. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spectral Controlling
network (SCNet) to optimize self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images.
First, we propose a selection strategy to choose frequency band components for
noisy images, to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Next, we present
a parameter optimization method that restricts the learning ability of
convolutional kernels to high-frequency noise using the Lipschitz constant,
without changing the network structure. Finally, we introduce the Spectral
Separation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module), which separates
noise and high-frequency details through frequency domain separation and
low-rank space reconstruction, to retain the high-frequency structural details
of images. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world datasets verify
the effectiveness of SCNet.

*Atif Belal,Heitor R. Medeiros,Marco Pedersoli,Eric Granger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A test-time adaptation framework (VLOD-TTA) improves vision-language object detectors under domain shift by using an IoU-weighted entropy objective to cluster spatial proposals and an image-conditioned, prompt-selection mechanism to fuse informative prompts with detector logits; it achieves consistent gains over zero-shot and standard TTA baselines on YOLO-World and Grounding DINO across diverse shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language object detectors suffer performance degradation under domain shift due to misalignment between region proposals and language/text representations. A lightweight, test-time adaptation approach can align proposals with text during inference by exploiting proposal geometry and image-level cue from prompts.

Method: 1) IoU-weighted entropy objective: concentrates adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters by weighting entropy with IoU overlap, reducing confirmation bias from isolated boxes. 2) Image-conditioned prompt selection: ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses the most informative prompts with the detector logits to improve text alignment.

Result: Benchmarking across diverse distribution shifts (stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light, common corruptions) shows consistent improvements over both zero-shot and conventional TTA baselines for two state-of-the-art VLODs, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO.

Conclusion: VLOD-TTA provides effective and generalizable test-time adaptation for vision-language detectors under distribution shifts, using proposal-density aware entropy objectives and image-conditioned prompt fusion; code is available for replication.

Abstract: Vision-language object detectors (VLODs) such as YOLO-World and Grounding
DINO achieve impressive zero-shot recognition by aligning region proposals with
text representations. However, their performance often degrades under domain
shift. We introduce VLOD-TTA, a test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for VLODs
that leverages dense proposal overlap and image-conditioned prompt scores.
First, an IoU-weighted entropy objective is proposed that concentrates
adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters and reduces confirmation
bias from isolated boxes. Second, image-conditioned prompt selection is
introduced, which ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses the most
informative prompts with the detector logits. Our benchmarking across diverse
distribution shifts -- including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light
conditions, and common corruptions -- shows the effectiveness of our method on
two state-of-the-art VLODs, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, with consistent
improvements over the zero-shot and TTA baselines. Code :

*Yuheng Ji,Huajie Tan,Cheng Chi,Yijie Xu,Yuting Zhao,Enshen Zhou,Huaihai Lyu,Pengwei Wang,Zhongyuan Wang,Shanghang Zhang,Xiaolong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: New benchmark MathSticks for Visual Symbolic Compositional Reasoning (VSCR) integrates visual perception, symbolic manipulation, and arithmetic consistency; uses matchstick puzzles with 1–2 moves under conservation rules; large-scale data (1.4M instances) and test set; reveals limitations of vision-language models and shows humans >90% accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a strong need to advance compositional reasoning across vision and symbols. Existing models struggle with tasks requiring accurate symbolic manipulation under strict constraints, such as conservation rules in matchstick puzzles. MathSticks unifies perception and symbolic reasoning to probe this capability, with both text-guided and pure-vision settings.

Method: Generate incorrect matchstick equations and require correcting them by moving one or two sticks under strict conservation rules. Include text-guided and purely visual settings. Systematically vary digit scale, move complexity, solution multiplicity, and operator variation. Assemble 1.4 million generated instances plus a curated test set. Evaluate 14 vision–language models, analyzing performance gaps between closed-source vs open-source models, in visual vs non-visual regimes, and compare against human performance.

Result: Vision–language models show substantial limitations: closed-source models succeed only on simple cases; open-source models fail in the visual regime; humans achieve >90% accuracy. MathSticks provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating cross-modal compositional reasoning. Code and dataset are publicly available.

Conclusion: MathSticks provides a robust, scalable benchmark to push progress in VSCR, highlighting current model gaps and offering a resource for developing methods that integrate visual understanding with symbolic/arithmetic reasoning; its public release enables broad adoption and replication.

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{MathSticks}, a benchmark for Visual Symbolic
Compositional Reasoning (VSCR), which unifies visual perception, symbolic
manipulation, and arithmetic consistency. Each task presents an incorrect
matchstick equation that must be corrected by moving one or two sticks under
strict conservation rules. The benchmark includes both text-guided and purely
visual settings, systematically covering digit scale, move complexity, solution
multiplicity, and operator variation, with 1.4M generated instances and a
curated test set. Evaluations of 14 vision--language models reveal substantial
limitations: closed-source models succeed only on simple cases, open-source
models fail in the visual regime, while humans exceed 90\% accuracy. These
findings establish \textsc{MathSticks} as a rigorous testbed for advancing
compositional reasoning across vision and symbols. Our code and dataset are

### [29] [Normal-Abnormal Guided Generalist Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00495)
*Yuexin Wang,Xiaolei Wang,Yizheng Gong,Jimin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning (NAGL) for Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) that uses both normal and anomalous references; proposes Residual Mining (RM) and Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL); demonstrates strong cross-domain performance and provides code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world cross-domain anomaly detection, anomalous samples contain valuable information that is often ignored when methods rely solely on normal data; leveraging both normal and abnormal references can yield more transferable and robust anomaly representations across domains.

Method: NAGL comprises two components: (1) Residual Mining (RM), which extracts abnormal patterns from normal-abnormal reference residuals to build transferable anomaly representations; (2) Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL), which adaptively learns anomaly features in query images via residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies across domains.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that NAGL significantly outperforms existing GAD methods. The approach is the first to use a mixture of normal and abnormal references for GAD, and code/datasets are released at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: Normal-abnormal guided learning enables more accurate, efficient cross-domain anomaly detection by exploiting anomalous references and residual-based representation learning, advancing practical generalist anomaly detection.

Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an
original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD
methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the
valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in
real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical
approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages
both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection
across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning
(NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and
Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from
normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly
representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images
through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach
effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and
efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD
approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and
abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.

*Kaiqi Zhang,Mingguan Yang,Dali Chang,Chun Chen,Yuxiang Zhang,Kexun He,Jing Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAF blends relative (image) features with absolute (numeric) features to enrich matrix representations for image-based method selection in sparse linear systems, reducing feature ambiguity and boosting accuracy and speed; validated on SuiteSparse and BMCMat with SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Iterative method selection for sparse linear systems is not robust. Image-based feature extraction can map distinct matrices to identical representations, leading to suboptimal method choices.

Method: Introduce Relative-Absolute Fusion (RAF): jointly extract and fuse image representations (relative features) with their corresponding numerical values (absolute features) to produce comprehensive matrix representations and improve selection accuracy.

Result: BMCMat and SuiteSparse evaluations show solution-time reductions of 0.08s–0.29s, 5.86%–11.50% faster than conventional image-based approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: RAF enhances image-based selection by reducing feature ambiguity and improving both accuracy and efficiency; BMCMat dataset is available at the referenced GitHub repository.

Abstract: Iterative method selection is crucial for solving sparse linear systems
because these methods inherently lack robustness. Though image-based selection
approaches have shown promise, their feature extraction techniques might encode
distinct matrices into identical image representations, leading to the same
selection and suboptimal method. In this paper, we introduce RAF
(Relative-Absolute Fusion), an efficient feature extraction technique to
enhance image-based selection approaches. By simultaneously extracting and
fusing image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical
values as absolute features, RAF achieves comprehensive matrix representations
that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, thus improving
selection accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based selection
approaches. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of RAF on SuiteSparse and
our developed BMCMat (Balanced Multi-Classification Matrix dataset),
demonstrating solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear
systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection
approaches and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BMCMat is

### [31] [Affordance-Guided Diffusion Prior for 3D Hand Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00506)
*Naru Suzuki,Takehiko Ohkawa,Tatsuro Banno,Jihyun Lee,Ryosuke Furuta,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based hand pose refinement method guided by affordance-aware textual descriptions of hand-object interactions, inferred from a vision-language model, to resolve severe occlusions and produce functionally coherent 3D hand poses; evaluated on HOGraspNet with significant improvements over regression and context-free diffusion baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occluded 3D hand pose estimation is ill-posed; humans use contextual knowledge like object affordances to infer hand configuration. Prior methods often lack semantic context or rely on regression or context-free generation; there is a need to integrate affordance reasoning into pose refinement.

Method: Train a diffusion-based generative prior for hand pose conditioned on affordance descriptions. Infer affordances from a large vision-language model for each HOI scenario. Refine occluded hand regions to plausible, functionally coherent poses. Evaluate on HOGraspNet dataset with severe occlusions.

Result: Affordance-guided refinement yields notable improvements over state-of-the-art regression-based methods and diffusion refinement without contextual reasoning on HOGraspNet; models generate more realistic, functionally coherent hand poses under occlusion.

Conclusion: Incorporating affordance-aware textual priors via a diffusion model and VLM-based affordance inference enables robust, contextually grounded hand pose refinement under heavy occlusion, advancing 3D hand pose estimation in practical HOI scenarios.

Abstract: How can we reconstruct 3D hand poses when large portions of the hand are
heavily occluded by itself or by objects? Humans often resolve such ambiguities
by leveraging contextual knowledge -- such as affordances, where an object's
shape and function suggest how the object is typically grasped. Inspired by
this observation, we propose a generative prior for hand pose refinement guided
by affordance-aware textual descriptions of hand-object interactions (HOI). Our
method employs a diffusion-based generative model that learns the distribution
of plausible hand poses conditioned on affordance descriptions, which are
inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM). This enables the refinement
of occluded regions into more accurate and functionally coherent hand poses.
Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet, a 3D hand-affordance dataset with severe
occlusions, demonstrate that our affordance-guided refinement significantly
improves hand pose estimation over both recent regression methods and
diffusion-based refinement lacking contextual reasoning.

*Zichen Wen,Shaobo Wang,Yufa Zhou,Junyuan Zhang,Qintong Zhang,Yifeng Gao,Zhaorun Chen,Bin Wang,Weijia Li,Conghui He,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Efficient MLLMs via Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC) to tackle computationally heavy visual tokens by progressively guiding learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual tokens in multi-modal large models are costly, and existing token-compression methods worsen training difficulty by creating large perturbations in feature space that the model must adapt to quickly.

Method: Introduces Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC) which decomposes perturbations into token-wise and layer-wise components. It uses token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation with a teacher model to guide learning along a progressive trajectory.

Result: Extensive experiments show that EPIC achieves superior effectiveness, robustness, and generalization compared to baselines.

Conclusion: EPIC provides an efficient training paradigm for compressed visual tokens in MLLMs by reducing learning difficulty through progressive, consistency-guided distillation.

Abstract: Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in multi-modal
large models (MLLMs), significantly compromising their efficiency. Recent works
have attempted to improve efficiency by compressing visual tokens during
training, either through modifications to model components or by introducing
additional parameters. However, they often overlook the increased learning
difficulty caused by such compression, as the model's parameter space struggles
to quickly adapt to the substantial perturbations in the feature space induced
by token compression. In this work, we propose to develop Efficient MLLMs via
Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC), a progressive learning framework.
Specifically, by decomposing the feature space perturbations introduced by
token compression along the token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, we introduce
token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation,
respectively, aiming to reduce the training difficulty by leveraging guidance
from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and
generalization capabilities of our proposed framework.

*Abdelrhman Werby,Dennis Rotondi,Fabio Scaparro,Kai O. Arras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hierarchical, keyframe-driven 3D scene graph (KeySG) integrates floors/rooms/objects/elements with multi-modal information, using vision-language models and retrieval-augmented generation to enable scalable, task-agnostic reasoning and planning in complex environments; it outperforms baselines on object segmentation and complex query retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene graphs are semantically limited to predefined relations and struggle with large environments due to LLM context window limits. There is a need for a scalable, generalizable representation that supports reasoning and planning in human-centered environments.

Method: Build a hierarchical graph with floors, rooms, objects, and functional elements. Augment nodes with multi-modal data from keyframes selected to maximize geometric and visual coverage. Use keyframes with vision-language models to extract scene information. Avoid enumerating explicit object-edge relationships; rely on the graph plus VLM outputs. Employ a hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation pipeline to fetch relevant context from the graph for queries.

Result: KeySG achieves superior performance on most metrics across four benchmarks, including 3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval, indicating greater semantic richness and efficiency than prior approaches.

Conclusion: A scalable, semantically rich 3D scene representation enabling general reasoning and planning in human-centered environments, mitigating edge complexity and context-window issues via hierarchical RAG and keyframe-driven multi-modal information.

Abstract: In recent years, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful world
representation, offering both geometric accuracy and semantic richness.
Combining 3D scene graphs with large language models enables robots to reason,
plan, and navigate in complex human-centered environments. However, current
approaches for constructing 3D scene graphs are semantically limited to a
predefined set of relationships, and their serialization in large environments
can easily exceed an LLM's context window. We introduce KeySG, a framework that
represents 3D scenes as a hierarchical graph consisting of floors, rooms,
objects, and functional elements, where nodes are augmented with multi-modal
information extracted from keyframes selected to optimize geometric and visual
coverage. The keyframes allow us to efficiently leverage VLM to extract scene
information, alleviating the need to explicitly model relationship edges
between objects, enabling more general, task-agnostic reasoning and planning.
Our approach can process complex and ambiguous queries while mitigating the
scalability issues associated with large scene graphs by utilizing a
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant
context from the graph. Evaluated across four distinct benchmarks -- including
3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval -- KeySG outperforms prior
approaches on most metrics, demonstrating its superior semantic richness and
efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CardioBench offers a standardized, public benchmark for echocardiography foundation models by aggregating eight public datasets into four regression and five classification tasks, enabling zero-shot, probing, and alignment evaluations; reveals complementary strengths across model families and provides reproducible pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no standard benchmark for echocardiography foundation models. Echocardiography presents challenges (noise, frame redundancy, limited public datasets) and most evaluations are on private data, hindering comparability. A unified benchmark across functional, structural, diagnostic, and view tasks is needed.

Method: Unifies eight public echocardiography datasets into a standardized suite with four regression and five classification tasks covering functional, structural, diagnostic, and view endpoints. Evaluates multiple encoders (temporal models, biomedical, and general-purpose) under zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Provides preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines for reproducible comparisons.

Result: Temporal modeling is critical for functional regression; retrieval provides robustness under distribution shift; domain-specific text encoders capture physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly but struggle with fine-grained distinctions like view classification and subtle pathology recognition.

Conclusion: CardioBench provides a reproducible reference point and actionable insights to guide future echocardiography foundation-model design; releases preprocessing, dataset splits, and evaluation pipelines to foster community benchmarking.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are reshaping medical imaging, yet their application
in echocardiography remains limited. While several echocardiography-specific
FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate
them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions,
high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions
evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we
introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs.
CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite
spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional,
structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several
leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose
encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our
results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal
modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness
under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture
physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and
often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions
like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing
preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes
a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the
design of future echocardiography foundation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Shapley-credited, context-aware Dawid-Skene fusion framework for multi-label ego-view dashcam understanding that calibrates posteriors via per-model, per-label reliabilities, improving AV perception by fusing multiple VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination in large VLMs undermines safety in autonomous driving; need calibrated, robust fusion to leverage multiple models and context.

Method: Learns contextual reliabilities per model/label; converts reports into agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratios; combines with contextual prior and Shapley-based reputation; uses dataset of 1,000 dashcam clips with structured annotations; fine-tunes three VLMs with LoRA; uses HDD ground truth, YOLOv11 + BoT-SORT; evaluation metrics.

Result: 23% reduction in Hamming distance; 55% Macro-F1 improvement; 47% Micro-F1 improvement vs best single model; calibrated posteriors; interpretable and drift-adaptive fusion.

Conclusion: VLM fusion with Shapley-based credibility becomes calibrated, interpretable, robust for AV pipelines; preserves strong single-model signals while amplifying agreement among reliable models and adapting to drift.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in
autonomous-vehicle (AV) stacks, but hallucination limits their reliability in
safety-critical pipelines. We present Shapley-credited Context-Aware
Dawid-Skene with Agreement, a game-theoretic fusion method for multi-label
understanding of ego-view dashcam video. It learns per-model, per-label,
context-conditioned reliabilities from labelled history and, at inference,
converts each model's report into an agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratio
that is combined with a contextual prior and a public reputation state updated
via Shapley-based team credit. The result is calibrated, thresholdable
posteriors that (i) amplify agreement among reliable models, (ii) preserve
uniquely correct single-model signals, and (iii) adapt to drift. To specialise
general VLMs, we curate 1,000 real-world dashcam clips with structured
annotations (scene description, manoeuvre recommendation, rationale) via an
automatic pipeline that fuses HDD ground truth, vehicle kinematics, and YOLOv11
+ BoT-SORT tracking, guided by a three-step chain-of-thought prompt; three
heterogeneous VLMs are then fine-tuned with LoRA. We evaluate with Hamming
distance, Micro-Macro-F1, and average per-video latency. Empirically, the
proposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement
in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 when comparing with the best
single model, supporting VLM fusion as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust
decision-support component for AV pipelines.

### [36] [Cascaded Diffusion Framework for Probabilistic Coarse-to-Fine Hand Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00527)
*Taeyun Woo,Jinah Park,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based coarse-to-fine cascaded framework for 3D hand reconstruction that models pose uncertainty and achieves state-of-the-art results on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 by combining a joint diffusion stage with a Mesh Latent Diffusion Model (Mesh-LDM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic cascaded methods struggle with pose ambiguities from self-occlusions and complex articulations; single-stage probabilistic models lack refinement. The goal is to model distribution over poses and outputs via a cascaded, refinement-driven approach to improve accuracy and uncertainty handling.

Method: A two-stage diffusion framework: (1) a joint diffusion model that samples diverse 3D hand joint hypotheses, (2) a Mesh Latent Diffusion Model conditioned on a chosen joint sample to reconstruct a 3D hand mesh. Mesh-LDM is trained in a learned latent space using diverse joint hypotheses to capture distribution-aware joint–mesh relationships and robust hand priors. The cascaded design facilitates learning from 2D-to-3D mappings through sequential refinement.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 and effectively models pose distributions.

Conclusion: Integrating probabilistic modeling with cascaded refinement yields distribution-aware joint–mesh relationships and robust hand priors, improving accuracy while handling pose uncertainties in 3D hand reconstruction.

Abstract: Deterministic models for 3D hand pose reconstruction, whether single-staged
or cascaded, struggle with pose ambiguities caused by self-occlusions and
complex hand articulations. Existing cascaded approaches refine predictions in
a coarse-to-fine manner but remain deterministic and cannot capture pose
uncertainties. Recent probabilistic methods model pose distributions yet are
restricted to single-stage estimation, which often fails to produce accurate 3D
reconstructions without refinement. To address these limitations, we propose a
coarse-to-fine cascaded diffusion framework that combines probabilistic
modeling with cascaded refinement. The first stage is a joint diffusion model
that samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, and the second stage is a Mesh Latent
Diffusion Model (Mesh LDM) that reconstructs a 3D hand mesh conditioned on a
joint sample. By training Mesh LDM with diverse joint hypotheses in a learned
latent space, our framework learns distribution-aware joint-mesh relationships
and robust hand priors. Furthermore, the cascaded design mitigates the
difficulty of directly mapping 2D images to dense 3D poses, enhancing accuracy
through sequential refinement. Experiments on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively
modeling pose distributions.

*Aoduo Li,Peikai Lin,Jiancheng Li,Zhen Zhang,Shiting Wu,Zexiao Liang,Zhifa Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Forestpest-YOLO is a YOLOv8-based detector tailored for forestry pest detection that uses SPD-Conv, CSPOK, and VarifocalLoss to achieve state-of-the-art results on a self-collected ForestPest dataset, especially for small and occluded pests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detect pests in complex forestry remote sensing imagery where targets are tiny, occluded, and in cluttered backgrounds with severe class imbalance; existing detectors lose fine-grained features and struggle with extreme data imbalance.

Method: Extend YOLOv8 with (1) SPD-Conv lossless downsampling to preserve high-resolution details, (2) CSPOK cross-stage feature fusion to boost multi-scale representation and suppress background noise, (3) VarifocalLoss to emphasize high-quality and hard-to-classify samples; evaluate on a self-constructed ForestPest dataset.

Result: Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, with notable gains in detecting small and occluded pests and substantial improvements over established baselines.

Conclusion: The integrated SPD-Conv, CSPOK, and VarifocalLoss effectively address small-target detection and data imbalance in forestry remote sensing, providing a practical tool for ecological monitoring.

Abstract: Detecting agricultural pests in complex forestry environments using remote
sensing imagery is fundamental for ecological preservation, yet it is severely
hampered by practical challenges. Targets are often minuscule, heavily
occluded, and visually similar to the cluttered background, causing
conventional object detection models to falter due to the loss of fine-grained
features and an inability to handle extreme data imbalance. To overcome these
obstacles, this paper introduces Forestpest-YOLO, a detection framework
meticulously optimized for the nuances of forestry remote sensing. Building
upon the YOLOv8 architecture, our framework introduces a synergistic trio of
innovations. We first integrate a lossless downsampling module, SPD-Conv, to
ensure that critical high-resolution details of small targets are preserved
throughout the network. This is complemented by a novel cross-stage feature
fusion block, CSPOK, which dynamically enhances multi-scale feature
representation while suppressing background noise. Finally, we employ
VarifocalLoss to refine the training objective, compelling the model to focus
on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples. Extensive experiments on our
challenging, self-constructed ForestPest dataset demonstrate that
Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing marked
improvements in detecting small, occluded pests and significantly outperforming
established baseline models.

### [38] [Assessing Foundation Models for Mold Colony Detection with Limited Training Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00561)
*Henrik Pichler,Janis Keuper,Matthew Copping*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation models can nearly match fully supervised detectors for mold colony counting with far less labeled data, enabling data-efficient microbiological vision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce reliance on exhaustive manual annotation in microbiology and accelerate development of automated mold colony counting systems for indoor air quality assessment.

Method: Assemble a 5000-image dataset of Petri dish images with bounding boxes and masks, compare three vision foundation models to traditional baselines on task-specific metrics, and evaluate few-shot/low-shot performance by finetuning with 150 or even 25 labeled images.

Result: MaskDINO achieves near-parity with a fully trained YoloV9 when fine-tuned on 150 images and remains competitive with as few as 25 images, reliably performing on about 70% of samples.

Conclusion: Data-efficient foundation models can match traditional approaches with far less annotated data, enabling faster iteration and potentially higher upper-bound performance in automated microbiological systems.

Abstract: The process of quantifying mold colonies on Petri dish samples is of critical
importance for the assessment of indoor air quality, as high colony counts can
indicate potential health risks and deficiencies in ventilation systems.
Conventionally the automation of such a labor-intensive process, as well as
other tasks in microbiology, relies on the manual annotation of large datasets
and the subsequent extensive training of models like YoloV9. To demonstrate
that exhaustive annotation is not a prerequisite anymore when tackling a new
vision task, we compile a representative dataset of 5000 Petri dish images
annotated with bounding boxes, simulating both a traditional data collection
approach as well as few-shot and low-shot scenarios with well curated subsets
with instance level masks. We benchmark three vision foundation models against
traditional baselines on task specific metrics, reflecting realistic real-world
requirements. Notably, MaskDINO attains near-parity with an extensively trained
YoloV9 model while finetuned only on 150 images, retaining competitive
performance with as few as 25 images, still being reliable on $\approx$ 70% of
the samples. Our results show that data-efficient foundation models can match
traditional approaches with only a fraction of the required data, enabling
earlier development and faster iterative improvement of automated
microbiological systems with a superior upper-bound performance than
traditional models would achieve.

*Minghao Yang,Ren Togo,Guang Li,Takahiro Ogawa,Miki Haseyama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adaptive shared experts (ASE) in a LoRA-based Mixture-of-Experts for multi-task learning improves the STL-to-MTL transition and knowledge sharing; uses router-guided gating with shared and sparse experts; includes fine-grained LoRA experts by increasing count while reducing rank; validated on PASCAL-Context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE-MTL often relies on single-task pretrained backbones and suffers from redundant adaptation and inefficient knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning; there is a need for a flexible, parameter-efficient mechanism to improve cross-task sharing and specialization.

Method: Introduce ASE within a LoRA-based MoE. Shared experts receive router-computed gating weights that are jointly normalized with sparse experts. Additionally, implement fine-grained experts by increasing the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank to enhance knowledge sharing under a fixed parameter budget. Train and evaluate under unified settings on the PASCAL-Context benchmark.

Result: ASE consistently improves performance across diverse configurations and demonstrates the effectiveness of fine-grained LoRA designs for MTL.

Conclusion: ASE with a LoRA-based MoE enables better STL-to-MTL transitions, enhances expert specialization and cooperation, and supports efficient knowledge sharing within a parameter budget; fine-grained expert design is beneficial for MTL.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful framework for multi-task
learning (MTL). However, existing MoE-MTL methods often rely on single-task
pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient
knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning
(STL to MTL). To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts
(ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are
assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts.
This design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization,
and cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing
the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling
more effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget. Extensive
experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark, under unified training settings,
demonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse
configurations and validates the effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.

### [40] [Arbitrary Generative Video Interpolation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00578)
*Guozhen Zhang,Haiguang Wang,Chunyu Wang,Yuan Zhou,Qinglin Lu,Limin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArbInterp enables any-timestamp and any-length video frame interpolation by introducing TaRoPE for precise timestamp control and a segment-wise, appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy, achieving higher fidelity and seamless continuity across 2x–32x interpolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative VFI methods are limited to fixed interpolation factors, restricting flexibly adjusting frame rates or total sequence duration. There is a need for a flexible, scalable VFI approach that can interpolate at arbitrary timestamps and generate variable-length sequences while preserving appearance and motion consistency.

Method: TaRoPE (Timestamp-aware Rotary Position Embedding) modulates temporal positions to align generated frames with target timestamps. For any-length interpolation, long sequences are decomposed into segment-wise frame synthesis. An appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy uses prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and temporal semantics to maintain motion coherence across segments, enabling seamless transitions.

Result: Experimental benchmarks show ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across multiple interpolation scales (2x to 32x), delivering higher fidelity and stronger spatiotemporal continuity and better generalization to arbitrary interpolation factors.

Conclusion: ArbInterp provides a flexible, efficient VFI framework capable of interpolating at any timestamp and any length, with strong fidelity and smooth transitions, as evidenced by comprehensive multi-scale benchmarks.

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI), which generates intermediate frames from
given start and end frames, has become a fundamental function in video
generation applications. However, existing generative VFI methods are
constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking the
flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration. In this
work, we present ArbInterp, a novel generative VFI framework that enables
efficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length. Specifically, to
support interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary
Position Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to
align generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables
fine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of
fixed-position paradigms in prior work. For any-length interpolation, we
decompose long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis. We
further design a novel appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy: it
leverages prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and
temporal semantics to maintain motion coherence, ensuring seamless
spatiotemporal transitions across segments. Experimentally, we build
comprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to
assess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors. Results show
that ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher
fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity. Project website:

*Zesheng Li,Shuaibo Li,Wei Ma,Jianwei Guo,Hongbin Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces MDS-NeRF, a NeRF-based 3D style transfer framework that uses a multi-level feature adaptor and a dynamic style injection module to preserve content and enable omni-view stylization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing NeRF style transfer methods embed style into the original NeRF pipeline, often degrading content preservation and multi-scale structures; a reengineered, dynamic, multi-level approach is needed.

Method: Proposes (1) a multi-level feature adaptor to build multi-scale feature grids from the content radiance field; (2) a dynamic style injection module to extract style features and adaptively inject them into content; (3) a multi-level cascade decoder to produce stylized views; and (4) extension to omni-view style transfer with 3D style references.

Result: Extensive experiments show strong performance in 3D style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structure while effectively transferring stylistic features.

Conclusion: MDS-NeRF effectively reengineers the NeRF pipeline for stylization, enabling dynamic, multi-level style transfer with omni-view capabilities.

Abstract: As the application of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in various 3D vision
tasks continues to expand, numerous NeRF-based style transfer techniques have
been developed. However, existing methods typically integrate style statistics
into the original NeRF pipeline, often leading to suboptimal results in both
content preservation and artistic stylization. In this paper, we present
multi-level dynamic style transfer for NeRFs (MDS-NeRF), a novel approach that
reengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization and incorporates an
innovative dynamic style injection module. Particularly, we propose a
multi-level feature adaptor that helps generate a multi-level feature grid
representation from the content radiance field, effectively capturing the
multi-scale spatial structure of the scene. In addition, we present a dynamic
style injection module that learns to extract relevant style features and
adaptively integrates them into the content patterns. The stylized multi-level
features are then transformed into the final stylized view through our proposed
multi-level cascade decoder. Furthermore, we extend our 3D style transfer
method to support omni-view style transfer using 3D style references. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MDS-NeRF achieves outstanding performance for 3D
style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively
transferring stylistic characteristics.

TL;DR: ADPT automates defect annotation by combining LVLMs with semantic matching and iterative self-questioning, achieving high accuracy and enabling scalable, unsupervised dataset construction for structural damage assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual labeling of structural defects is costly and time-consuming; automating annotation with agentic, self-refining capabilities can improve safety and efficiency.

Method: Agent-based Defect Pattern Tagger (ADPT) integrates Large Vision-Language Models, a semantic pattern matching module, and an iterative self-questioning refinement loop; uses domain-optimized prompts and recursive verification to generate semantically labeled defect datasets without manual supervision.

Result: Achieves up to 98% accuracy distinguishing defective vs non-defective images; 85-98% annotation accuracy across four defect categories in balanced data; 80-92% in imbalanced datasets; demonstrates scalability and cost-effectiveness for downstream transfer learning and domain adaptation.

Conclusion: ADPT provides a scalable, high-fidelity automatic labeling framework for structural damage datasets, enabling efficient dataset construction and improved performance in transfer learning tasks.

Abstract: Automated structural defect annotation is essential for ensuring
infrastructure safety while minimizing the high costs and inefficiencies of
manual labeling. A novel agentic annotation framework, Agent-based Defect
Pattern Tagger (ADPT), is introduced that integrates Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with a semantic pattern matching module and an iterative
self-questioning refinement mechanism. By leveraging optimized domain-specific
prompting and a recursive verification process, ADPT transforms raw visual data
into high-quality, semantically labeled defect datasets without any manual
supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that ADPT achieves up to 98%
accuracy in distinguishing defective from non-defective images, and 85%-98%
annotation accuracy across four defect categories under class-balanced
settings, with 80%-92% accuracy on class-imbalanced datasets. The framework
offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for high-fidelity dataset
construction, providing strong support for downstream tasks such as transfer
learning and domain adaptation in structural damage assessment.

*Yunbo Xu,Xuesong Zhang,Jia Li,Zhenzhen Hu,Richang Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes COFA, a consensus-driven online feature augmentation for vision-language navigation that separates foreground and background features via semantic landmarks and uses two-stage voting to select features, improving generalization on unseen environments (REVERIE, R2R).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foreground vs background cues in visual observations are underexplored in VLN; foreground provides semantic cues while background encodes spatial connectivity. Enhancing their complementary use could improve generalization to unseen environments.

Method: Identify semantically-enhanced landmarks to disentangle foreground and background as candidate augmented features. Apply a consensus-driven online augmentation with two-stage voting to determine feature preferences based on instructions and navigational locations.

Result: Experiments on REVERIE and R2R show that online foreground-background augmentation improves baseline generalization and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Foreground-background feature augmentation guided by consensus improves VLN generalization to unseen environments.

Abstract: Following language instructions, vision-language navigation (VLN) agents are
tasked with navigating unseen environments. While augmenting multifaceted
visual representations has propelled advancements in VLN, the significance of
foreground and background in visual observations remains underexplored.
Intuitively, foreground regions provide semantic cues, whereas the background
encompasses spatial connectivity information. Inspired on this insight, we
propose a Consensus-driven Online Feature Augmentation strategy (COFA) with
alternative foreground and background features to facilitate the navigable
generalization. Specifically, we first leverage semantically-enhanced landmark
identification to disentangle foreground and background as candidate augmented
features. Subsequently, a consensus-driven online augmentation strategy
encourages the agent to consolidate two-stage voting results on feature
preferences according to diverse instructions and navigational locations.
Experiments on REVERIE and R2R demonstrate that our online
foreground-background augmentation boosts the generalization of baseline and
attains state-of-the-art performance.

### [45] [Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00618)
*Klara Janouskova,Cristian Gavrus,Jiri Matas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RCOR proposes a robust, context-aware object recognition framework that decouples localization from recognition and fuses FG and BG information non-parametrically to combat shortcut learning, improving robustness for supervised models and vision-language models on both in-domain and out-of-domain backgrounds, without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard supervised learning often relies on background cues (shortcuts) rather than object identity, causing poor robustness to domain shifts. Previous work suppresses background to gain generalization but loses contextual information; a joint approach preserving both FG and BG is needed.

Method: Introduce RCOR: treat localization as integral to recognition, separate object-centric and context-aware modeling, and perform a robust non-parametric fusion of outputs. Localization-before-recognition enables handling complex scenes (e.g., ImageNet-1k) and improves robustness without requiring fine-tuning on BG variations.

Result: RCOR improves performance for both supervised models and vision-language models on datasets with both in-domain and out-of-domain BG, even without fine-tuning; localization-before-recognition demonstrated in complex scenes like ImageNet-1k.

Conclusion: RCOR is the first approach to jointly achieve robustness and context-awareness without sacrificing either; by decoupling localization and recognition and robustly fusing FG/BG information, it enhances generalization in the presence of diverse BGs.

Abstract: In visual recognition, both the object of interest (referred to as
foreground, FG, for simplicity) and its surrounding context (background, BG)
play an important role. However, standard supervised learning often leads to
unintended over-reliance on the BG, known as shortcut learning of spurious
correlations, limiting model robustness in real-world deployment settings. In
the literature, the problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG,
sacrificing context information for improved generalization.
  We propose RCOR -- Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition -- the first
approach that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness without
compromising either. RCOR treats localization as an integral part of
recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modelling, followed by
a robust, non-parametric fusion. It improves the performance of both supervised
models and VLM on datasets with both in-domain and out-of-domain BG, even
without fine-tuning. The results confirm that localization before recognition
is now possible even in complex scenes as in ImageNet-1k.

### [46] [UCD: Unconditional Discriminator Promotes Nash Equilibrium in GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00624)
*Mengfei Xia,Nan Xue,Jiapeng Zhu,Yujun Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unconditional discriminator (UCD) improves GAN training by removing conditioning on D, reducing shortcut biases and enabling D to extract more robust features, which better supervise G and promote Nash equilibrium. It’s a plug-in improvement with strong results, notably 1.47 FID on ImageNet-64, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and some diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address instability and mode collapse in GAN training, which the authors attribute to redundant shortcuts created by conditioning inputs into the discriminator. The goal is to force D to learn richer, more robust representations that can better guide G.

Method: Replace the conditioned discriminator with an unconditional one (D) that does not receive conditioning information. This unconditional D is claimed to extract more comprehensive features and supervise G more effectively. The authors provide theoretical compatibility with vanilla GAN theory to show plug-in viability and perform extensive experiments to validate the approach.

Result: Significant performance gains and improved efficiency. Reported FID of 1.47 on ImageNet-64, beating StyleGAN-XL and several state-of-the-art one-step diffusion models.

Conclusion: Unconditional discriminator facilitates better knowledge extraction and supervision, helping achieve a stronger Nash equilibrium in GAN training. The approach is compatible with existing GAN frameworks as a plug-in and will be released with code.

Abstract: Adversarial training turns out to be the key to one-step generation,
especially for Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and diffusion model
distillation. Yet in practice, GAN training hardly converges properly and
struggles in mode collapse. In this work, we quantitatively analyze the extent
of Nash equilibrium in GAN training, and conclude that redundant shortcuts by
inputting condition in $D$ disables meaningful knowledge extraction. We thereby
propose to employ an unconditional discriminator (UCD), in which $D$ is
enforced to extract more comprehensive and robust features with no condition
injection. In this way, $D$ is able to leverage better knowledge to supervise
$G$, which promotes Nash equilibrium in GAN literature. Theoretical guarantee
on compatibility with vanilla GAN theory indicates that UCD can be implemented
in a plug-in manner. Extensive experiments confirm the significant performance
improvements with high efficiency. For instance, we achieved \textbf{1.47 FID}
on the ImageNet-64 dataset, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and several state-of-the-art
one-step diffusion models. The code will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces virtual fashion photo-shoot and a large-scale garment-lookbook dataset via an automated cross-domain retrieval pipeline to generate editorial fashion imagery beyond catalog-like outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridging the gap between narrow generation tasks (like virtual try-on) and editorial fashion needs; addressing the lack of cross-domain data that links garments with fashion lookbooks, enabling creative, narrative imagery.

Method: An automated retrieval pipeline that combines visual-language reasoning with object-level localization to align garments across domains, constructing a garment-lookbook pair dataset with three quality tiers (high:10k, medium:50k, low:300k).

Result: Created the first large-scale garment-lookbook pairs dataset and a cross-domain retrieval framework, establishing a foundation for models that generate contextually grounded editorial fashion imagery rather than catalog-style outputs.

Conclusion: The dataset and method pave the way for editorial, narrative fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling, bridging e-commerce garments with fashion media.

Abstract: Fashion image generation has so far focused on narrow tasks such as virtual
try-on, where garments appear in clean studio environments. In contrast,
editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations,
and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual
fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming
standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To
enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of
garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media.
Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval
pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language
reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three
garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium
quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a
foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward
fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.

*Jiayao Jiang,Siran Peng,Bin Liu,Qi Chu,Nenghai Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) detector with learnable spline activations and a Landmark-assisted LAKAN module, guiding learning with facial landmarks to focus on artifact-rich regions, achieving superior deepfake detection across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs and Transformers struggle to model highly non-linear forgery artifacts; there is a need for richer nonlinear modeling and explicit geometric priors (facial landmarks) to guide attention to informative regions.

Method: Replace fixed activations in KAN with learnable spline activations. Introduce a Landmark-assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (LAKAN) module that uses facial landmarks as a structural prior to dynamically generate KAN's internal parameters, steering a general-purpose image encoder toward facial regions with artifacts.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show superior performance compared to baselines.

Conclusion: The approach effectively combines geometric priors with a learnable Kolmogorov-Arnold framework, yielding improved deepfake detection performance.

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake generation techniques necessitates robust
face forgery detection algorithms. While methods based on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers are effective, there is still room for
improvement in modeling the highly complex and non-linear nature of forgery
artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a novel detection method based on
the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). By replacing fixed activation functions
with learnable splines, our KAN-based approach is better suited to this
challenge. Furthermore, to guide the network's focus towards critical facial
areas, we introduce a Landmark-assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
(LAKAN) module. This module uses facial landmarks as a structural prior to
dynamically generate the internal parameters of the KAN, creating an
instance-specific signal that steers a general-purpose image encoder towards
the most informative facial regions with artifacts. This core innovation
creates a powerful combination between geometric priors and the network's
learning process. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that
our proposed method achieves superior performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces ReFlux, a reverse-attention attack on concept erasure for Flux T2I models, achieving robust reactivation of erased concepts via velocity-guided dynamics and a consistency objective, with strong experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety concerns in text-to-image generation; existing concept erasure methods are largely tuned to Stable Diffusion and do not transfer well to newer rectified-flow transformers like Flux, necessitating a robust evaluation framework.

Method: Reverse-attention optimization that reactivates suppressed signals while stabilizing attention, combined with velocity-guided dynamics to steer the flow-matching process, and a consistency-preserving objective to maintain global layout and unrelated content.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the attack, establishing a reliable benchmark for evaluating the robustness of concept erasure strategies in rectified flow transformers.

Conclusion: ReFlux provides a practical tool to evaluate and stress-test concept erasure in Flux, highlights vulnerabilities of attention-localization-based erasure in rectified-flow models, and calls for stronger defenses and broader benchmarking.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled
impressive generative capabilities, but they also raise significant safety
concerns due to the potential to produce harmful or undesirable content. While
concept erasure has been explored as a mitigation strategy, most existing
approaches and corresponding attack evaluations are tailored to Stable
Diffusion (SD) and exhibit limited effectiveness when transferred to
next-generation rectified flow transformers such as Flux. In this work, we
present ReFlux, the first concept attack method specifically designed to assess
the robustness of concept erasure in the latest rectified flow-based T2I
framework. Our approach is motivated by the observation that existing concept
erasure techniques, when applied to Flux, fundamentally rely on a phenomenon
known as attention localization. Building on this insight, we propose a simple
yet effective attack strategy that specifically targets this property. At its
core, a reverse-attention optimization strategy is introduced to effectively
reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention. This is further
reinforced by a velocity-guided dynamic that enhances the robustness of concept
reactivation by steering the flow matching process, and a
consistency-preserving objective that maintains the global layout and preserves
unrelated content. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a
reliable benchmark for evaluating the robustness of concept erasure strategies
in rectified flow transformers.

TL;DR: A real-time BEV map segmentation model that fuses cameras and radar for accurate, fast perception, achieving 53.5 mIoU with significantly faster inference than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Map segmentation is essential for autonomous driving and must balance high accuracy with real-time performance; camera–radar fusion provides rich semantics and accurate depth at a lower cost.

Method: A novel, lightweight BEV architecture using camera and radar inputs, a new lightweight head, and an advanced loss set with per-class balancing to improve perception results and inference speed.

Result: Achieves 53.5 mIoU, comparable to large models, while delivering a new benchmark in inference speed with a 260% speedup over the strongest baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed camera–radar BEV map segmentation framework delivers high accuracy and real-time performance, validating the usefulness of multi-sensor fusion and a compact design for perception tasks.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles is becoming more common to offer a
more robust alternative for several perception tasks. This need arises from the
unique contribution of each sensor in collecting data: camera-radar fusion
offers a cost-effective solution by combining rich semantic information from
cameras with accurate distance measurements from radar, without incurring
excessive financial costs or overwhelming data processing requirements. Map
segmentation is a critical task for enabling effective vehicle behaviour in its
environment, yet it continues to face significant challenges in achieving high
accuracy and meeting real-time performance requirements. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient map segmentation architecture, using cameras and
radars, in the \acrfull{bev} space. Our model introduces a real-time map
segmentation architecture considering aspects such as high accuracy, per-class
balancing, and inference time. To accomplish this, we use an advanced loss set
together with a new lightweight head to improve the perception results. Our
results show that, with these modifications, our approach achieves results
comparable to large models, reaching 53.5 mIoU, while also setting a new
benchmark for inference time, improving it by 260\% over the strongest baseline
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OTTER introduces a unified open-set multi-label tagging framework that blends fixed predefined categories with open-set tags using a multi-head attention model over a large hierarchical multi-modal dataset, achieving strong closed-set and near-perfect open-set results on two benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconcile the stability of predefined label vocabularies with the flexibility of open-set tagging in multi-modal scenarios, addressing limitations of purely closed or open vocabulary approaches.

Method: OTTER uses a hierarchical, large-scale multimodal dataset annotated by automated vision-language labeling with human refinement; a multi-head attention architecture jointly aligns visual and textual features with both fixed and open-set label embeddings to enable dynamic, semantically consistent tagging.

Result: Outperforms competitive baselines on Otter (F1 0.81) and Favorite (F1 0.75; margins 0.10 and 0.02). Open-set F1 near-perfect (0.99 on Otter, 0.97 on Favorite). Maintains competitive accuracy on predefined labels.

Conclusion: OTTER demonstrates that it is possible to bridge closed-set consistency with open-vocabulary flexibility in multi-modal tagging, enabling robust open-set tagging applications.

Abstract: We introduce OTTER, a unified open-set multi-label tagging framework that
harmonizes the stability of a curated, predefined category set with the
adaptability of user-driven open tags. OTTER is built upon a large-scale,
hierarchically organized multi-modal dataset, collected from diverse online
repositories and annotated through a hybrid pipeline combining automated
vision-language labeling with human refinement. By leveraging a multi-head
attention architecture, OTTER jointly aligns visual and textual representations
with both fixed and open-set label embeddings, enabling dynamic and
semantically consistent tagging. OTTER consistently outperforms competitive
baselines on two benchmark datasets: it achieves an overall F1 score of 0.81 on
Otter and 0.75 on Favorite, surpassing the next-best results by margins of 0.10
and 0.02, respectively. OTTER attains near-perfect performance on open-set
labels, with F1 of 0.99 on Otter and 0.97 on Favorite, while maintaining
competitive accuracy on predefined labels. These results demonstrate OTTER's
effectiveness in bridging closed-set consistency with open-vocabulary
flexibility for multi-modal tagging applications.

### [52] [Weakly Supervised Cloud Detection Combining Spectral Features and Multi-Scale Deep Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00654)
*Shaocong Zhu,Zhiwei Li,Xinghua Li,Huanfeng Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised, multi-scale scene-level cloud detection network (SpecMCD) detects pixel-level clouds by fusing spectral features, multi-scale probability maps, and cloud-thickness cues with adaptive thresholds and distance-weighted optimization, outperforming baselines (WDCD/WSFNet) by ~7.8% F1 on WDCD and GF1MS-WHU datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cloud contamination degrades optical satellite imagery; thin clouds lack distinctive spectral cues and high-quality labeled data is scarce. A weakly supervised, multi-scale approach leveraging scene-level context could improve cloud detection accuracy.

Method: A progressive training framework for a multi-scale scene-level cloud detection network. Pixel-level cloud probability maps are created by combining multi-scale probability maps with a cloud thickness map. Adaptive thresholds are generated per region and scale, then fused with distance-weighted optimization to yield binary cloud masks. Evaluated on two datasets (WDCD and GF1MS-WHU) comprising 60 GF1-MS images.

Result: The SpecMCD method achieves higher accuracy than other weakly supervised methods such as WDCD and WSFNet, with an F1-score improvement of over 7.82%.

Conclusion: SpecMCD demonstrates strong performance for cloud detection under varying cloud coverage and showcases the potential of weakly supervised, multi-scale approaches for improving pixel-level cloud masks.

Abstract: Clouds significantly affect the quality of optical satellite images, which
seriously limits their precise application. Recently, deep learning has been
widely applied to cloud detection and has achieved satisfactory results.
However, the lack of distinctive features in thin clouds and the low quality of
training samples limit the cloud detection accuracy of deep learning methods,
leaving space for further improvements. In this paper, we propose a weakly
supervised cloud detection method that combines spectral features and
multi-scale scene-level deep network (SpecMCD) to obtain highly accurate
pixel-level cloud masks. The method first utilizes a progressive training
framework with a multi-scale scene-level dataset to train the multi-scale
scene-level cloud detection network. Pixel-level cloud probability maps are
then obtained by combining the multi-scale probability maps and cloud thickness
map based on the characteristics of clouds in dense cloud coverage and large
cloud-area coverage images. Finally, adaptive thresholds are generated based on
the differentiated regions of the scene-level cloud masks at different scales
and combined with distance-weighted optimization to obtain binary cloud masks.
Two datasets, WDCD and GF1MS-WHU, comprising a total of 60 Gaofen-1
multispectral (GF1-MS) images, were used to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Compared to the other weakly supervised cloud detection
methods such as WDCD and WSFNet, the F1-score of the proposed SpecMCD method
shows an improvement of over 7.82%, highlighting the superiority and potential
of the SpecMCD method for cloud detection under different cloud coverage
conditions.

### [53] [Align Your Tangent: Training Better Consistency Models via Manifold-Aligned Tangents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00658)
*Beomsu Kim,Byunghee Cha,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Align Your Tangent (AYT) with a manifold feature distance (MFD) loss to correct oscillatory CM tangents, accelerating training by orders of magnitude and enabling tiny-batch training, while achieving competitive or better sample quality than LPIPS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Consistence Models (CMs) require long training and large batches for high-quality samples; CM tangents near convergence are oscillatory and parallel to the data manifold rather than pointing toward it, hindering efficient optimization.

Method: Introduce the manifold feature distance (MFD) loss to align CM tangents with the data manifold and train CMs with the AYT framework, enabling 1–2-step sampling with faster convergence and small-batch training.

Result: Training accelerates by orders of magnitude; achieved competitive or superior sample quality compared to LPIPS; capable of effective learning with extremely small batch sizes.

Conclusion: MFD-based tangent alignment in AYT substantially improves CM training efficiency and sample quality, reducing data/batch requirements and enabling faster diffusion-model training.

Abstract: With diffusion and flow matching models achieving state-of-the-art generating
performance, the interest of the community now turned to reducing the inference
time without sacrificing sample quality. Consistency Models (CMs), which are
trained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential
equation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion
sampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch
sizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the
training dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM
output update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move
parallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate
oscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold
feature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point
toward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent
(AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform
the learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we
find that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without
compromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT

### [54] [Unsupervised Unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA): Deep Interpretable Clutter Filtering for Ultrasound Microvascular Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00660)
*Huaying Li,Liansheng Wang,Yinran Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An unsupervised unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA) for ultrasound clutter filtering is proposed. It preserves interpretability while removing the need for ground-truth labels by unfolding an IRLS-based rPCA, adding a sparse-enhancement unit, and training on partial sequences. It outperforms SVD, traditional rPCA, and a DL-based filter, boosting CNR by 2–10 dB in in-silico and in-vivo datasets, with ablation studies validating module contributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-sensitivity clutter filtering is essential for ultrasound microvascular imaging. SVD and rPCA are limited in feature modeling and tissue–blood separation. Deep learning offers promise but struggles with interpretability and lack of ground truths. An interpretable, unsupervised approach is needed to leverage the benefits of unfolding while avoiding labeled data.

Method: Unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA) derived from an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) rPCA baseline, incorporating intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization. A sparse-enhancement unit strengthens capture of sparse micro-flow signals. The model acts as an adaptive filter trained on part of the image sequence and applied to subsequent frames, enabling unsupervised training without explicit labels.

Result: U2-rPCA outperforms the SVD-based method, the rPCA baseline, and another deep learning-based filter in both in-silico and public in-vivo datasets. It achieves notable improvements in contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for power Doppler imaging, ranging from 2 dB to 10 dB over competing methods. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each module.

Conclusion: An interpretable, unsupervised unfolded network (U2-rPCA) provides effective clutter filtering for ultrasound microvascular imaging, bridging traditional priors with deep learning benefits. It delivers significant CNR gains and validates the utility of the proposed modules via ablation.

Abstract: High-sensitivity clutter filtering is a fundamental step in ultrasound
microvascular imaging. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and robust principal
component analysis (rPCA) are the main clutter filtering strategies. However,
both strategies are limited in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow
separation for high-quality microvascular imaging. Recently, deep
learning-based clutter filtering has shown potential in more thoroughly
separating tissue and blood flow signals. However, the existing supervised
filters face the challenges of interpretability and lack of in-vitro and
in-vivo ground truths. While the interpretability issue can be addressed by
algorithm deep unfolding, the training ground truth remains unsolved. To this
end, this paper proposes an unsupervised unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA) method that
preserves mathematical interpretability and is insusceptible to learning
labels. Specifically, U2-rPCA is unfolded from an iteratively reweighted least
squares (IRLS) rPCA baseline with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization.
A sparse-enhancement unit is added to the network to strengthen its capability
to capture the sparse micro-flow signals. U2-rPCA is like an adaptive filter
that is trained with part of the image sequence and then used for the following
frames. Experimental validations on a in-silico dataset and public in-vivo
datasets demonstrated the outperformance of U2-rPCA when compared with the
SVD-based method, the rPCA baseline, and another deep learning-based filter.
Particularly, the proposed method improved the contrastto-noise ratio (CNR) of
the power Doppler image by 2 dB to 10 dB when compared with other methods.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of the building modules of U2-rPCA was validated
through ablation studies.

### [55] [Multi-Domain Brain Vessel Segmentation Through Feature Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00665)
*Francesco Galati,Daniele Falcetta,Rosa Cortese,Ferran Prados,Ninon Burgos,Maria A. Zuluaga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain-adaptive image-to-image translation framework using disentanglement to segment brain arteries and veins across modalities without domain-specific models, preserving spatial structure while altering vessel appearance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Segmentation of brain vasculature is challenging due to complex morphology and variability across imaging modalities and centers; existing models are often modality-specific, requiring harmonization or retraining.

Method: Disentanglement-based image-to-image translation that independently manipulates image properties (vessel appearance) while preserving spatial information (shapes/locations) to move data across domains in a label-preserving, modality-agnostic way; no domain-specific design or data harmonization; ablation studies on annotations and architectural choices.

Result: Effective segmentation across large and varied domain gaps (centers, modalities, vessel types); robust and versatile performance demonstrated; code released for reproducibility.

Conclusion: Shows the potential of domain adaptation approaches for cerebrovascular segmentation across multiple scenarios and modalities, highlighting robustness and versatility.

Abstract: The intricate morphology of brain vessels poses significant challenges for
automatic segmentation models, which usually focus on a single imaging
modality. However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a
comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the
specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain
arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while
avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source
and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement
techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing
them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner.
Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation
while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are
crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and
varied domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types.
Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required
annotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our
framework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain
adaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in
multiple scenarios accurately. Our code is available at

### [56] [A Geometric Unification of Generative AI with Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00666)
*Leah Bar,Liron Mor Yosef,Shai Zucker,Neta Shoham,Inbar Seroussi,Nir Sochen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper unifies geometry and probabilistic modeling for image generation with the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM); introduces a Latent variant (LMPPM) and shows it outperforms Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) in restoration and generation by viewing diffusion as projection onto the manifold of good images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative image methods often ignore the underlying geometric structure of data (manifolds) and treat distributions probabilistically without geometry. There is a need to unify geometry with probabilistic approaches, reinterpret diffusion as a projection onto a manifold of good images, and develop deterministic yet probabilistic-capable models to improve performance.

Method: Develop a geometric framework combined with a kernel-based probabilistic method and construct the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM) that operates in both pixel and latent spaces. Interpret diffusion models as projection operators onto the manifold of good images and derive a Latent MPPM (LMPPM).

Result: Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in image restoration and generation.

Conclusion: The proposed MPPM framework successfully unifies geometric and probabilistic perspectives in generative imaging, offering a deterministic projection-based model that enhances performance and provides a new interpretation of diffusion models.

Abstract: The foundational premise of generative AI for images is the assumption that
images are inherently low-dimensional objects embedded within a
high-dimensional space. Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that
thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common
approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic
methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal
approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models,
the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a
lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent
or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined
or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic
perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based
probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies
diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the
manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a
new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM),
which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space.
We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion
Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of
image restoration and generation.

### [57] [Beyond one-hot encoding? Journey into compact encoding for large multi-class segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00667)
*Aaron Kujawa,Thomas Booth,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Binary encoding approaches can reduce complexity from linear to logarithmic in the number of classes for large-class medical image segmentation, but they underperform compared to one-hot encoding on a 108-class brain MRI parcellation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To curb computational and memory demands of large-class segmentation by replacing one-hot with binary encodings and exploring ECOCs and related strategies, motivated by strong results in extreme classification.

Method: Investigates vanilla binary encoding, ECOCs, class weighting, hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees; applies these to 108-class whole-brain MRI parcellation; evaluates using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).

Result: All binary-encoding approaches underperform relative to one-hot, with DSCs ranging from 39.3 to 73.8 compared to 82.4 (with std 2.8) for one-hot; reveals informative negative results, indicating challenges in achieving state-of-the-art segmentation with binary encodings.

Conclusion: Binary encodings reduce computational/memory demands but struggle to reach top-tier segmentation accuracy in large-class medical segmentation; suggests further research is needed to bridge the gap and refine compact encoding strategies for such tasks.

Abstract: This work presents novel methods to reduce computational and memory
requirements for medical image segmentation with a large number of classes. We
curiously observe challenges in maintaining state-of-the-art segmentation
performance with all of the explored options. Standard learning-based methods
typically employ one-hot encoding of class labels. The computational complexity
and memory requirements thus increase linearly with the number of classes. We
propose a family of binary encoding approaches instead of one-hot encoding to
reduce the computational complexity and memory requirements to logarithmic in
the number of classes. In addition to vanilla binary encoding, we investigate
the effects of error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting,
hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees. We
apply the methods to the use case of whole brain parcellation with 108 classes
based on 3D MRI images. While binary encodings have proven efficient in
so-called extreme classification problems in computer vision, we faced
challenges in reaching state-of-the-art segmentation quality with binary
encodings. Compared to one-hot encoding (Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) =
82.4 (2.8)), we report reduced segmentation performance with the binary
segmentation approaches, achieving DSCs in the range from 39.3 to 73.8.
Informative negative results all too often go unpublished. We hope that this
work inspires future research of compact encoding strategies for large
multi-class segmentation tasks.

### [58] [Adaptive Event Stream Slicing for Open-Vocabulary Event-Based Object Detection via Vision-Language Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00681)
*Jinchang Zhang,Zijun Li,Jiakai Lin,Guoyu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A distillation framework uses CLIP knowledge from image frames to teach an event-based student model for open-vocabulary object detection, aided by a hybrid SNN-CNN that adaptively segments events to preserve temporal information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras lack texture and color, hindering open-vocabulary detection. Leveraging vision-language models like CLIP on RGB images and transferring their semantics to event data can enhance generalization to novel objects.

Method: Train a teacher model on image frames with CLIP semantics. Use spatial attention-based distillation to guide an event-based student network learning CLIP-like visual features from raw events. Employ a hybrid SNN-CNN architecture where SNN adaptively selects optimal event segmentation moments to preserve temporal information, followed by CNNs for object detection.

Result: Demonstrates open-vocabulary object detection on event data by transferring CLIP-derived semantics to the event domain; adaptive event segmentation preserves temporal features and improves feature learning for detection on novel objects.

Conclusion: Bridges the gap between event streams and image-based VLMs, enabling open-vocabulary detection on event data. The adaptive SNN-CNN framework preserves temporal information during segmentation, improving detection performance on unseen objects.

Abstract: Event cameras offer advantages in object detection tasks due to high-speed
response, low latency, and robustness to motion blur. However, event cameras
lack texture and color information, making open-vocabulary detection
particularly challenging. Current event-based detection methods are typically
trained on predefined categories, limiting their ability to generalize to novel
objects, where encountering previously unseen objects is common.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary object detection in
RGB images. However, the modality gap between images and event streams makes it
ineffective to directly transfer CLIP to event data, as CLIP was not designed
for event streams. To bridge this gap, we propose an event-image knowledge
distillation framework that leverages CLIP's semantic understanding to achieve
open-vocabulary object detection on event data. Instead of training CLIP
directly on event streams, we use image frames as inputs to a teacher model,
guiding the event-based student model to learn CLIP's rich visual
representations. Through spatial attention-based distillation, the student
network learns meaningful visual features directly from raw event inputs while
inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge. Furthermore, to prevent information
loss due to event data segmentation, we design a hybrid spiking neural network
(SNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Unlike fixed-group
event segmentation methods, which often discard crucial temporal information,
our SNN adaptively determines the optimal event segmentation moments, ensuring
that key temporal features are extracted. The extracted event features are then
processed by CNNs for object detection.

*Steffen Meinert,Philipp Schlinge,Nils Strodthoff,Martin Atzmueller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProtoMask grounds prototypes in semantically bounded image patches using segmentation masks, reducing saliency uncertainty and improving explainability while maintaining competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address reliability concerns with post-hoc saliency in prototype-based XAI by enforcing a truthful mapping from embeddings to inputs via semantic segmentation, limiting explanations to meaningful image regions.

Method: Use segmentation foundation models to generate masks; crop images by mask bounding boxes; create an input per mask; train ProtoMask architecture on three fine-grained datasets; evaluate with diverse explainability metrics and compare to other models.

Result: ProtoMask achieves competitive classification performance and offers unique explainability features through semantically grounded, restricted saliency maps that better reflect the input–embedding relationship.

Conclusion: Restricting saliency to semantic patches via segmentation masks improves truthfulness of explanations in prototype-based XAI without sacrificing performance, highlighting a promising direction for reliable, interpretable models.

Abstract: XAI gained considerable importance in recent years. Methods based on
prototypical case-based reasoning have shown a promising improvement in
explainability. However, these methods typically rely on additional post-hoc
saliency techniques to explain the semantics of learned prototypes. Multiple
critiques have been raised about the reliability and quality of such
techniques. For this reason, we study the use of prominent image segmentation
foundation models to improve the truthfulness of the mapping between embedding
and input space. We aim to restrict the computation area of the saliency map to
a predefined semantic image patch to reduce the uncertainty of such
visualizations. To perceive the information of an entire image, we use the
bounding box from each generated segmentation mask to crop the image. Each mask
results in an individual input in our novel model architecture named ProtoMask.
We conduct experiments on three popular fine-grained classification datasets
with a wide set of metrics, providing a detailed overview on explainability
characteristics. The comparison with other popular models demonstrates
competitive performance and unique explainability features of our model.

*Jiakai Lin,Jinchang Zhang,Guoyu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoE-SGT augments Concept Bottleneck Models with Graph Transformer and Mixture of Experts to model structured concept relationships in multimodal inputs, replacing FF layers with MoE to improve adaptability and accuracy across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBMs improve interpretability but are single-modal and neglect concept relationships; need to capture structured relationships and enhance reasoning capacity in high-stakes domains.

Method: Construct answer-concept and answer-question graphs for multimodal inputs; apply Graph Transformer to model multi-level dependencies among concepts; replace feed-forward layers with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module to increase capacity and dynamic task routing; train end-to-end within CBM framework.

Result: Outperforms existing concept bottleneck networks on multiple datasets in accuracy by leveraging structured relationships and dynamic expert routing.

Conclusion: Incorporating Graph Transformer and MoE into CBMs yields more accurate and adaptable concept-based reasoning, overcoming single-modality and limited interaction limitations.

Abstract: With growing demand for interpretability in deep learning, especially in high
stakes domains, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address this by inserting
human understandable concepts into the prediction pipeline, but they are
generally single modal and ignore structured concept relationships. To overcome
these limitations, we present MoE-SGT, a reasoning driven framework that
augments CBMs with a structure injecting Graph Transformer and a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) module. We construct answer-concept and answer-question graphs
for multimodal inputs to explicitly model the structured relationships among
concepts. Subsequently, we integrate Graph Transformer to capture multi level
dependencies, addressing the limitations of traditional Concept Bottleneck
Models in modeling concept interactions. However, it still encounters
bottlenecks in adapting to complex concept patterns. Therefore, we replace the
feed forward layers with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module, enabling the model
to have greater capacity in learning diverse concept relationships while
dynamically allocating reasoning tasks to different sub experts, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to complex concept reasoning.
MoE-SGT achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on
multiple datasets by modeling structured relationships among concepts and
utilizing a dynamic expert selection mechanism.

### [61] [Training-free Uncertainty Guidance for Complex Visual Tasks with MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00705)
*Sanghwan Kim,Rui Xiao,Stephan Alaniz,Yongqin Xian,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free approach that leverages a multimodal LLM's own output uncertainty to guide attention to the most informative visual inputs, enabling off-the-shelf models to match fine-tuned baselines on fine-grained multimodal tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with fine-grained perception and typically rely on task-specific fine-tuning, which hampers generalization and increases model complexity. A general, training-free mechanism could unlock better performance without fine-tuning.

Method: Introduce a unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by the model's response uncertainty (entropy). The model autonomously focuses on the data most likely to reduce uncertainty, applied to Visual Search, Long Video Understanding, and Temporal Grounding with off-the-shelf MLLMs.

Result: Demonstrates competitive performance with specialized fine-tuned methods on three complex visual tasks, using only intrinsic uncertainty as guidance.

Conclusion: Harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy to enhance fine-grained multimodal performance without additional training.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often struggle with fine-grained
perception, such as identifying small objects in high-resolution images or
finding key moments in long videos. Existing works typically rely on
complicated, task-specific fine-tuning, which limits their generalizability and
increases model complexity. In this work, we propose an effective,
training-free framework that uses an MLLM's intrinsic uncertainty as a
proactive guidance signal. Our core insight is that a model's output entropy
decreases when presented with relevant visual information. We introduce a
unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty,
enabling the model to autonomously focus on the most salient data. We apply
this simple principle to three complex visual tasks: Visual Search, Long Video
Understanding, and Temporal Grounding, allowing off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve
performance competitive with specialized, fine-tuned methods. Our work
validates that harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy
for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised deep learning motion correction for stress perfusion CMR improves temporal alignment and perfusion map accuracy, with 15x faster processing, trained on multivendor data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion correction is essential for pixel-wise perfusion mapping but registration-based methods are slow and variable; a fast, robust, generalizable solution is needed.

Method: An unsupervised deep learning pipeline performing three-step motion correction with one-shot estimation, uses robust PCA to mitigate contrast effects, aligns perfusion series and auxiliary images, trained/validated on 201 patients across vendors with 38 held out for testing.

Result: Significant improvement in temporal smoothness (p<0.001); Dice for myocardial alignment ~0.92 (0.04) and 0.91 (0.05); perfusion maps show lower within-myocardium standard deviation (0.52 (0.39) ml/min/g) vs baseline (0.55 (0.44)); processing time reduced 15-fold.

Conclusion: Deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion correction for stress perfusion CMR, enhances accuracy across dynamic and auxiliary images; trained on multivendor data, it generalizes across sequences and may facilitate broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.

Abstract: Background: Quantitative stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) is a powerful tool for assessing myocardial ischemia. Motion correction
is essential for accurate pixel-wise mapping but traditional registration-based
methods are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness
and scalability.
  Methods: We developed an unsupervised deep learning-based motion correction
pipeline that replaces iterative registration with efficient one-shot
estimation. The method corrects motion in three steps and uses robust principal
component analysis to reduce contrast-related effects. It aligns the perfusion
series and auxiliary images (arterial input function and proton
density-weighted series). Models were trained and validated on multivendor data
from 201 patients, with 38 held out for testing. Performance was assessed via
temporal alignment and quantitative perfusion values, compared to a previously
published registration-based method.
  Results: The deep learning approach significantly improved temporal
smoothness of time-intensity curves (p<0.001). Myocardial alignment (Dice =
0.92 (0.04) and 0.91 (0.05)) was comparable to the baseline and superior to
before registration (Dice = 0.80 (0.09), p<0.001). Perfusion maps showed
reduced motion, with lower standard deviation in the myocardium (0.52 (0.39)
ml/min/g) compared to baseline (0.55 (0.44) ml/min/g). Processing time was
reduced 15-fold.
  Conclusion: This deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion
correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across dynamic and
auxiliary images. Trained on multivendor data, it generalizes across sequences
and may facilitate broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViT-based emotion classification from DEAP using Continuous Wavelet Transform scaleograms and a subset of EEG channels achieves ~91.6% accuracy on 4-quadrant emotion labels with only 12 channels, suggesting low-cost EEG can approach multi-channel performance; reproducible code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the demand for accurate emotion prediction from neural signals while reducing hardware cost and measurement complexity by using a subset of EEG channels and a deep learning pipeline.

Method: Select subsets of DEAP EEG channels; convert EEG signals to scaleograms via Continuous Wavelet Transform; train a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier for 4-class arousal/valence labeling; evaluate with 12 channels, and compare to 32-channel state-of-the-art results.

Result: Achieved 91.57% accuracy on 4-quadrant emotion classification with 12 channels; state-of-the-art with 32 channels reports 96.9% accuracy.

Conclusion: Substantial input-channel reduction yields high emotion-prediction performance, indicating that low-cost EEG devices can be viable for affective computing; reproducible training scripts are provided.

Abstract: Accurately predicting emotions from brain signals has the potential to
achieve goals such as improving mental health, human-computer interaction, and
affective computing. Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a
promising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and
facial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements
of the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and
unbiased data source. However, conducting a full EEG is a complex,
resource-intensive process, leading to the rise of low-cost EEG devices with
simplified measurement capabilities. This work examines how subsets of EEG
channels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion
prediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped
EEG-measurements. Using Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data
into scaleograms, we trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion
classification. The model achieved over 91,57% accuracy in predicting 4
quadrants (high/low per arousal and valence) with only 12 measuring points
(also referred to as channels). Our work shows clearly, that a significant
reduction of input channels yields high results compared to state-of-the-art
results of 96,9% with 32 channels. Training scripts to reproduce our code can

### [64] [Extreme Blind Image Restoration via Prompt-Conditioned Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00728)
*Hongeun Kim,Bryan Sangwoo Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage ELQ-to-HQ restoration method: map extremely low-quality images to a less-degraded intermediate via a learnable projector, then restore to HQ with a frozen BIR model; framed by an Information Bottleneck objective for stable training; enables inference-time prompt refinement (LFO) and plug-and-play improvement of existing models without fine-tuning, validated on severe degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR) involves severe, compounded degradations causing large domain gaps between inputs and high-quality outputs. Direct end-to-end ELQ-to-HQ mapping is unstable and prone to artifacts; a modular approach that leverages existing BIR models and stabilizes training is needed.

Method: Train a projector that maps ELQ to an intermediate, less-degraded LQ image. Restore from this LQ to HQ using a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Use an information-theoretic objective (Information Bottleneck) to balance a low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term, stabilizing training. At inference, employ Look Forward Once (LFO) for prompt refinement and enable plug-and-play strengthening of existing models without finetuning.

Result: The authors report extensive experiments under severe degradation regimes demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework, including stability benefits and improved restoration quality.

Conclusion: A practical, theoretically-mounded (IB-based), plug-and-play framework for EBIR that can leverage existing BIR models without fine-tuning and supports inference-time prompt refinement, with broad applicability to severe degradation scenarios.

Abstract: Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but
falter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs
suffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope.
Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality
(HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to
unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel
framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We
first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate,
less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using
a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information
theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information
Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our
projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a
low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our
framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement,
and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models
without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation
regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.

*Andrés Laveda-Martínez,Natalia P. García-de-la-Puente,Fernando García-Torres,Niels Møller Israelsen,Ole Bang,Dominik Brouczek,Niels Benson,Adrián Colomer,Valery Naranjo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DL-based OCT defect detector for ceramics using U-Net; Dice 0.979; ~19s/volume; automated QC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-destructive, high-resolution internal defect detection is crucial in ceramic manufacturing. OCT provides detailed internal imaging, enabling detection of pores, delaminations, and inclusions. An automated DL approach can improve accuracy and speed while reducing manual annotation effort.

Method: Developed a U-Net–based neural network trained on OCT images with manually segmented defects. Explored multiple experimental configurations and applied post-processing to enable quantitative and qualitative evaluation of predictions.

Result: Dice score of 0.979; inference time of 18.98 seconds per volume; performance surpasses comparable studies.

Conclusion: Demonstrates accurate, viable automated QC for ceramic defect detection using OCT, enabling efficient and reliable non-destructive testing and defect identification such as inclusions.

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT) is essential in ceramic manufacturing to ensure
the quality of components without compromising their integrity. In this
context, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution internal
imaging, revealing defects such as pores, delaminations, or inclusions. This
paper presents an automatic defect detection system based on Deep Learning
(DL), trained on OCT images with manually segmented annotations. A neural
network based on the U-Net architecture is developed, evaluating multiple
experimental configurations to enhance its performance. Post-processing
techniques enable both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the
predictions. The system shows an accurate behavior of 0.979 Dice Score,
outperforming comparable studies. The inference time of 18.98 seconds per
volume supports its viability for detecting inclusions, enabling more
efficient, reliable, and automated quality control.

### [66] [Multi-Objective Task-Aware Predictor for Image-Text Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00766)
*Eunki Kim,Na Min An,James Thorne,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-and-play multi-objective predictor (MULTI-TAP) for image-text alignment that aligns with human preferences, is efficient, supports long sequences, and generalizes across LVLMs; introduces EYE4ALL datasets; demonstrates competitive performance against GPT-4o-based metrics and superiority over VisionREWARD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for reliable image-text alignment evaluation that captures human judgments across contexts, handles long sequences, is computationally efficient, and supports multi-objective scoring. Current predictors miss at least one of these properties, hindering reliable, user-centered vision-language systems.

Method: Freeze a pre-trained LVLM and add a lightweight ridge regression reward head to map hidden states to multi-objective scores. The predictor can output a single overall score or per-objective scores, is plug-and-play across LVLMs, and is evaluated on multi-objective benchmarks and a new dataset (EYE4ALLPref for chosen/rejected preferences and EYE4ALLMulti for fine-grained scores across seven dimensions).

Result: MULTI-TAP achieves higher performance than VisionREWARD on multi-objective benchmarks, and is on par with GPT-4o–based G-VEval while using a smaller model size (7–8B). It demonstrates robustness across LVLM architectures and improves efficiency. The authors release EYE4ALLPref and EYE4ALLMulti to anchor human preferences, including for blind/low-vision users.

Conclusion: MULTI-TAP provides a scalable, human-aligned, multi-objective evaluation framework for image-text alignment that generalizes across LVLMs and enables more accessible AI systems by capturing nuanced user preferences.

Abstract: Evaluating image-text alignment while reflecting human preferences across
multiple aspects is a significant issue for the development of reliable
vision-language applications. It becomes especially crucial in real-world
scenarios where multiple valid descriptions exist depending on contexts or user
needs. However, research progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive
benchmarks and existing evaluation predictors lacking at least one of these key
properties: (1) Alignment with human judgments, (2) Long-sequence processing,
(3) Inference efficiency, and (4) Applicability to multi-objective scoring. To
address these challenges, we propose a plug-and-play architecture to build a
robust predictor, MULTI-TAP (Multi-Objective Task-Aware Predictor), capable of
both multi and single-objective scoring. MULTI-TAP can produce a single overall
score, utilizing a reward head built on top of a large vision-language model
(LVLMs). We show that MULTI-TAP is robust in terms of application to different
LVLM architectures, achieving significantly higher performance than existing
metrics and even on par with the GPT-4o-based predictor, G-VEval, with a
smaller size (7-8B). By training a lightweight ridge regression layer on the
frozen hidden states of a pre-trained LVLM, MULTI-TAP can produce fine-grained
scores for multiple human-interpretable objectives. MULTI-TAP performs better
than VisionREWARD, a high-performing multi-objective reward model, in both
performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks and our newly released
text-image-to-text dataset, EYE4ALL. Our new dataset, consisting of
chosen/rejected human preferences (EYE4ALLPref) and human-annotated
fine-grained scores across seven dimensions (EYE4ALLMulti), can serve as a
foundation for developing more accessible AI systems by capturing the
underlying preferences of users, including blind and low-vision (BLV)
individuals.

### [67] [ZQBA: Zero Query Black-box Adversarial Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00769)
*Joana C. Costa,Tiago Roxo,Hugo Proença,Pedro R. M. Inácio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zero-query black-box adversarial attack (ZQBA) that uses internal feature representations from a DNN to perturb clean inputs, enabling transfer to other models without queries or surrogate-model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current black-box attacks either require many queries or training surrogate/diffusion models, which limits real-world applicability; a query-free, transferable attack would pose a practical threat to deployed systems.

Method: Extract feature maps from a DNN and add them to clean images to craft adversarial samples that impair the target model, avoiding surrogate losses and optimization; demonstrated transferability across models and datasets (CIFAR, Tiny ImageNet).

Result: ZQBA achieves transferability and outperforms single-query state-of-the-art black-box attacks in effectiveness while preserving imperceptibility (quantitative SSIM and qualitative evaluation); code released.

Conclusion: The work reveals a practical vulnerability of DNN deployments via zero-query, representation-based adversarial perturbations, highlighting the need for robust defenses and further evaluation across architectures and datasets.

Abstract: Current black-box adversarial attacks either require multiple queries or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples that can impair the target
model performance. However, these methods require training a surrogate loss or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples, which limits their
applicability in real-world settings. Thus, we propose a Zero Query Black-box
Adversarial (ZQBA) attack that exploits the representations of Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to fool other networks. Instead of requiring thousands of
queries to produce deceiving adversarial samples, we use the feature maps
obtained from a DNN and add them to clean images to impair the classification
of a target model. The results suggest that ZQBA can transfer the adversarial
samples to different models and across various datasets, namely CIFAR and Tiny
ImageNet. The experiments also show that ZQBA is more effective than
state-of-the-art black-box attacks with a single query, while maintaining the
imperceptibility of perturbations, evaluated both quantitatively (SSIM) and
qualitatively, emphasizing the vulnerabilities of employing DNNs in real-world
contexts. All the source code is available at

### [68] [Uncertainty-Aware Concept Bottleneck Models with Enhanced Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00773)
*Haifei Zhang,Patrick Barry,Eduardo Brandao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uncertainty-aware CBMs using binary class-level concept prototypes to classify via concept-vector distances; adds interpretability and conformal prediction for outliers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To close the accuracy-interpretability gap in Concept Bottleneck Models by injecting interpretable, distance-based class prototypes and enabling calibrated uncertainty via conformal prediction.

Method: Learn binary prototypes for each class in concept space. Classify by distances between predicted concept vectors and class prototypes; use these distances as scores and uncertainty measures. Prototypes serve as interpretable rules indicating which concepts justify a class. Enable conformal prediction by measuring deviation from prototypes for uncertain/outlier inputs.

Result: Abstract claims improved interpretability and robustness through the proposed prototypes and conformal prediction, though no empirical results are provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: The approach offers an uncertainty-aware, interpretable CBM framework with distance-based classification using class-level prototypes, and a mechanism (conformal prediction) to handle uncertain or outlier inputs.

Abstract: In the context of image classification, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
first embed images into a set of human-understandable concepts, followed by an
intrinsically interpretable classifier that predicts labels based on these
intermediate representations. While CBMs offer a semantically meaningful and
interpretable classification pipeline, they often sacrifice predictive
performance compared to end-to-end convolutional neural networks. Moreover, the
propagation of uncertainty from concept predictions to final label decisions
remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware and
interpretable classifier for the second stage of CBMs. Our method learns a set
of binary class-level concept prototypes and uses the distances between
predicted concept vectors and each class prototype as both a classification
score and a measure of uncertainty. These prototypes also serve as
interpretable classification rules, indicating which concepts should be present
in an image to justify a specific class prediction. The proposed framework
enhances both interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction
for uncertain or outlier inputs based on their deviation from the learned
binary class-level concept prototypes.

### [69] [MetaLogic: Robustness Evaluation of Text-to-Image Models via Logically Equivalent Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00796)
*Yifan Shen,Yangyang Shu,Hye-young Paik,Yulei Sui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaLogic uses metamorphic testing to assess T2I robustness by comparing semantically equivalent prompt pairs, without ground-truth images. It finds notable misalignment in SOTA models (Flux.dev 59%, DALLE-3 71%), and provides a scalable, fine-grained diagnostic framework for robustness gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models often produce semantically inconsistent images when prompts undergo minor linguistic changes, despite logical equivalence. Existing metrics rely on ground-truth images or single-prompt comparisons, limiting evaluation of robustness and generalization. A ground-truth-free, scalable framework that diagnoses logical misalignment is needed.

Method: Generate grammatically different but semantically identical prompt pairs (metamorphic testing). Produce image pairs from these prompts. Directly compare paired images to detect semantic inconsistencies, signaling failures in meaning preservation. Categorize alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional misalignment) and surface counterexamples for debugging. Evaluate across state-of-the-art T2I models (e.g., Flux.dev, DALLE-3).

Result: The framework efficiently identifies alignment failures across a range of logical constructs, revealing fine-grained inconsistencies overlooked by existing metrics. Reported misalignment rates are substantial (Flux.dev ~59%, DALLE-3 ~71%). MetaLogic is scalable, ground-truth-free, and effective at surfacing targeted robustness issues.

Conclusion: MetaLogic provides a scalable, ground-truth-free diagnostic tool for T2I robustness, complementing traditional evaluation metrics. It enables detailed categorization of semantic misalignment and yields actionable counterexamples for model debugging and refinement.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, especially diffusion-based
architectures, have significantly improved the visual quality of generated
images. However, these models continue to struggle with a critical limitation:
maintaining semantic consistency when input prompts undergo minor linguistic
variations. Despite being logically equivalent, such prompt pairs often yield
misaligned or semantically inconsistent images, exposing a lack of robustness
in reasoning and generalisation. To address this, we propose MetaLogic, a novel
evaluation framework that detects T2I misalignment without relying on ground
truth images. MetaLogic leverages metamorphic testing, generating image pairs
from prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical. By
directly comparing these image pairs, the framework identifies inconsistencies
that signal failures in preserving the intended meaning, effectively diagnosing
robustness issues in the model's logic understanding. Unlike existing
evaluation methods that compare a generated image to a single prompt, MetaLogic
evaluates semantic equivalence between paired images, offering a scalable,
ground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures. It categorises
these alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional
misalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging
and refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I
models and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical
constructs. We find that even the SOTA text-to-image models like Flux.dev and
DALLE-3 demonstrate a 59 percent and 71 percent misalignment rate,
respectively. Our results show that MetaLogic is not only efficient and
scalable, but also effective in uncovering fine-grained logical inconsistencies
that are overlooked by existing evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An automated SF-SPA framework converts street-view photos into quantitative PV deployment estimates for building facades, addressing perspective correction, semantic understanding, and spatial reasoning; achieves ~6.2% mean area error, ~100s per building; validated on 80 buildings across 4 countries; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban facades offer a significant but underutilized source of solar energy. Assessing their PV potential is hard due to complex geometries, occlusions, and semantic components; there is a need for scalable, automated methods for accurate PV deployment estimates to support urban energy planning and BIPV deployment.

Method: A four-stage pipeline: (1) geometric rectification of street-view images to correct perspective, (2) zero-shot semantic segmentation to identify facade components, (3) LLM-guided spatial reasoning to layout PV installations, and (4) energy simulation to predict yields. The approach processes images end-to-end to produce quantitative PV deployment estimates.

Result: Validated on 80 buildings across four countries with mean area estimation error 6.2% ± 2.8%. Approximately 100 seconds per building, reflecting substantial efficiency gains over manual methods. Simulated energy yields corroborate the method’s reliability for regional potential studies and BIPV planning. Code is available at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: SF-SPA enables automated, robust assessment of facade-based PV potential from street-view imagery, supporting urban energy planning, regional PV potential studies, and BIPV deployment decisions.

Abstract: Building facades represent a significant untapped resource for solar energy
generation in dense urban environments, yet assessing their photovoltaic (PV)
potential remains challenging due to complex geometries and semantic com
ponents. This study introduces SF-SPA (Semantic Facade Solar-PV Assessment), an
automated framework that transforms street-view photographs into quantitative
PV deployment assessments. The approach combines com puter vision and
artificial intelligence techniques to address three key challenges: perspective
distortion correction, semantic understanding of facade elements, and spatial
reasoning for PV layout optimization. Our four-stage pipeline processes images
through geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, Large
Language Model (LLM) guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation.
Validation across 80 buildings in four countries demonstrates ro bust
performance with mean area estimation errors of 6.2% &#177; 2.8% compared to
expert annotations. The auto mated assessment requires approximately 100
seconds per building, a substantial gain in efficiency over manual methods.
Simulated energy yield predictions confirm the method's reliability and
applicability for regional poten tial studies, urban energy planning, and
building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) deployment. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage, physics-aware image-to-video generation method (TrajVLM-Gen) that uses a vision-language model to predict coarse motion trajectories aligned with real-world dynamics and attention-based refinement for fine motion; evaluated on UCF-101 and MSR-VTT with competitive FVD scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video generation models produce physically inconsistent motion that violates real-world dynamics. There is a need to enforce physics-consistent motion in synthesized videos by combining perception-guided trajectory prediction with physics-aware generation.

Method: Stage 1: Use a Vision Language Model to predict coarse-grained, physics-consistent motion trajectories. Stage 2: Use these trajectories to guide video generation via attention-based mechanisms for fine-grained motion refinement. A trajectory-prediction dataset is built from video-tracking data to capture realistic motion patterns. Evaluation on UCF-101 and MSR-VTT.

Result: TrajVLM-Gen outperforms existing methods, achieving competitive Fréchet Video Distance (FVD) scores of 545 on UCF-101 and 539 on MSR-VTT, indicating improved temporal coherence and physical plausibility relative to baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage framework demonstrates promise for physics-aware video synthesis by combining language-guided trajectory prediction with attention-based refinement and a physics-aware trajectory dataset. Further work should include broader physics scenarios, ablations, and clearer baselines to validate the reported gains.

Abstract: Current video generation models produce physically inconsistent motion that
violates real-world dynamics. We propose TrajVLM-Gen, a two-stage framework for
physics-aware image-to-video generation. First, we employ a Vision Language
Model to predict coarse-grained motion trajectories that maintain consistency
with real-world physics. Second, these trajectories guide video generation
through attention-based mechanisms for fine-grained motion refinement. We build
a trajectory prediction dataset based on video tracking data with realistic
motion patterns. Experiments on UCF-101 and MSR-VTT demonstrate that
TrajVLM-Gen outperforms existing methods, achieving competitive FVD scores of
545 on UCF-101 and 539 on MSR-VTT.

*Divy Kala,Eshika Khandelwal,Makarand Tapaswi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Subjectivity in audio descriptions (ADs) is substantial and trimming clips is inadequate for evaluating ADs. Introduces ADQA, a benchmark for few-minute, coherent segments with visual appreciation (VA) and narrative understanding (NU) questions; finds current AD generation lags behind human-authored ADs and presents a public leaderboard with recommendations for future work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ADs enable blind/low-vision users to understand films. Existing automatic AD work focuses on short clips and single ground-truth references, neglecting subjectivity and coherence across longer segments. This work aims to quantify subjectivity and evaluate ADs at a longer, story-consistent scale.

Method: Align and analyze two independent AD tracks for the same movies to quantify when/what/how to describe (subjectivity). Propose ADQA, a QA benchmark for few-minute long, coherent video segments. ADQA includes Visual Appreciation (VA) questions about visual facts and Narrative Understanding (NU) questions about the plot. Evaluate current AD methods against human-authored ADs and provide public leaderboard and recommendations.

Result: Showing substantial subjectivity in AD writing and documenting inadequacies of trimmed clip evaluation. ADQA reveals that current automatic AD generation approaches lag behind human-authored descriptions in both VA and NU tasks across longer video segments; highlights gaps and informs future directions.

Conclusion: Encourages modeling and accounting for subjectivity, shifting evaluation to longer, coherent segments. Presents recommendations for future work and releases a public leaderboard to benchmark AD quality for BLV users.

Abstract: Audio descriptions (ADs) narrate important visual details in movies, enabling
Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users to understand narratives and appreciate visual
details. Existing works in automatic AD generation mostly focus on few-second
trimmed clips, and evaluate them by comparing against a single ground-truth
reference AD. However, writing ADs is inherently subjective. Through alignment
and analysis of two independent AD tracks for the same movies, we quantify the
subjectivity in when and whether to describe, and what and how to highlight.
Thus, we show that working with trimmed clips is inadequate. We propose ADQA, a
QA benchmark that evaluates ADs at the level of few-minute long, coherent video
segments, testing whether they would help BLV users understand the story and
appreciate visual details. ADQA features visual appreciation (VA) questions
about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on the
plot. Through ADQA, we show that current AD generation methods lag far behind
human-authored ADs. We conclude with several recommendations for future work
and introduce a public leaderboard for benchmarking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces PhraseStereo, a stereo-phrase grounding dataset that extends phrase-region segmentation to stereo image pairs by generating right views from single-view data using GenStereo, enabling depth-aware grounding and joint language-geometry reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current phrase grounding mostly handles single-view imagery and misses rich geometric cues from stereo. PhraseStereo aims to bridge language and 3D perception by providing aligned stereo pairs with phrase-level segmentation masks.

Method: Builds on PhraseCut; uses GenStereo to synthesize accurate right-view images from existing single-view data; produces stereo image pairs with aligned segmentation masks and phrase annotations; lays groundwork for stereo-aware grounding models.

Result: First dataset to bring phrase-region segmentation to stereo images; enables exploration of depth cues in grounding; dataset will be released online upon acceptance.

Conclusion: PhraseStereo enables joint reasoning over semantics and geometry, encouraging models that utilize depth cues for more precise and context-aware grounding in multimodal learning.

Abstract: Understanding how natural language phrases correspond to specific regions in
images is a key challenge in multimodal semantic segmentation. Recent advances
in phrase grounding are largely limited to single-view images, neglecting the
rich geometric cues available in stereo vision. For this, we introduce
PhraseStereo, the first novel dataset that brings phrase-region segmentation to
stereo image pairs. PhraseStereo builds upon the PhraseCut dataset by
leveraging GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing
single-view data, enabling the extension of phrase grounding into the stereo
domain. This new setting introduces unique challenges and opportunities for
multimodal learning, particularly in leveraging depth cues for more precise and
context-aware grounding. By providing stereo image pairs with aligned
segmentation masks and phrase annotations, PhraseStereo lays the foundation for
future research at the intersection of language, vision, and 3D perception,
encouraging the development of models that can reason jointly over semantics
and geometry. The PhraseStereo dataset will be released online upon acceptance
of this work.

### [74] [NSARM: Next-Scale Autoregressive Modeling for Robust Real-World Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00820)
*Xiangtao Kong,Rongyuan Wu,Shuaizheng Liu,Lingchen Sun,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NSARM is a two-stage Next-Scale Autoregressive Model for Real-ISR that uses a transformation network to produce preliminary scales from a low-quality input, followed by end-to-end fine-tuning with a pure autoregressive next-scale prediction. It delivers robust, high-quality, fast inference, outperforming diffusion-based and other Real-ISR methods and shows strong generalization across degradations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle diverse degradations and robustness is a major challenge. Diffusion-based methods are either slow (iterative denoising from noise) or rely on input-driven generation that can produce artifacts. ControlNet/LoRA adaptations can cause over-enhancement and hallucinations, and autoregressive (AR) models offer efficiency but need robustness. There is a need for a robust, fast AR-based Real-ISR method.

Method: Train NSARM in two stages: (1) a transformation network maps the input low-quality image to preliminary scales, (2) end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. The model uses a pure autoregressive next-scale prediction (bitwise) approach, enabling robust generation without restricting the pre-trained diffusion models. The two-stage training aims to improve robustness to input degradations while preserving generative capability.

Result: Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that NSARM, as a pure AR model, achieves superior visual results compared with existing Real-ISR methods, while maintaining fast inference speed. It demonstrates high robustness to input quality and strong generalization across degradations.

Conclusion: NSARM demonstrates that a two-stage, pure autoregressive Real-ISR framework with next-scale prediction can offer robust, high-quality, and efficient image SR, addressing limitations of diffusion-based methods and diffusion-free AR approaches. The approach shows promise for real-world applicability and generalization.

Abstract: Most recent real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods employ
pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to synthesize the high-quality
image either from random Gaussian noise, which yields realistic results but is
slow due to iterative denoising, or directly from the input low-quality image,
which is efficient but at the price of lower output quality. These approaches
train ControlNet or LoRA modules while keeping the pre-trained model fixed,
which often introduces over-enhanced artifacts and hallucinations, suffering
from the robustness to inputs of varying degradations. Recent visual
autoregressive (AR) models, such as pre-trained Infinity, can provide strong
T2I generation capabilities while offering superior efficiency by using the
bitwise next-scale prediction strategy. Building upon next-scale prediction, we
introduce a robust Real-ISR framework, namely Next-Scale Autoregressive
Modeling (NSARM). Specifically, we train NSARM in two stages: a transformation
network is first trained to map the input low-quality image to preliminary
scales, followed by an end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Such a comprehensive
fine-tuning enhances the robustness of NSARM in Real-ISR tasks without
compromising its generative capability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate that as a pure AR model, NSARM achieves superior visual
results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining a fast inference
speed. Most importantly, it demonstrates much higher robustness to the quality
of input images, showing stronger generalization performance. Project page:

### [75] [Feature Identification for Hierarchical Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00837)
*Julius Ott,Nastassia Vysotskaya,Huawei Sun,Lorenzo Servadei,Robert Wille*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces two hierarchical contrastive learning methods (G-HMLC and A-HMLC) that model inter-class, hierarchy-level relationships and handle imbalanced distributions, achieving state-of-the-art linear evaluation on CIFAR100 and ModelNet40 and outperforming prior hierarchical contrastive methods by about 2 percentage points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional classification often ignores the inherent inter-class relationships across hierarchy levels, missing supervisory signals. Hierarchical data exhibit inter-class relations and class imbalance at higher levels, which can hinder fine-grained clustering and representation learning.

Method: G-HMLC uses a Gaussian Mixture Model to explicitly model inter-class relationships across hierarchy levels. A-HMLC employs an attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features, mimicking human processing. Both approaches address imbalance and hierarchical relationships to enable fine-grained clustering across all levels.

Result: On CIFAR100 and ModelNet40, the methods achieve state-of-the-art performance in linear evaluation, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by approximately 2 percentage points in accuracy. Quantitative and qualitative analyses support the effectiveness.

Conclusion: The proposed hierarchical contrastive learning framework demonstrates strong potential for hierarchical representation learning in computer vision and beyond, offering improved clustering and downstream performance by explicitly modeling hierarchy-aware relationships.

Abstract: Hierarchical classification is a crucial task in many applications, where
objects are organized into multiple levels of categories. However, conventional
classification approaches often neglect inherent inter-class relationships at
different hierarchy levels, thus missing important supervisory signals. Thus,
we propose two novel hierarchical contrastive learning (HMLC) methods. The
first, leverages a Gaussian Mixture Model (G-HMLC) and the second uses an
attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features (A-HMLC), imitating
human processing. Our approach explicitly models inter-class relationships and
imbalanced class distribution at higher hierarchy levels, enabling fine-grained
clustering across all hierarchy levels. On the competitive CIFAR100 and
ModelNet40 datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in linear
evaluation, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by
2 percentage points in terms of accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is
backed by both quantitative and qualitative results, highlighting its potential
for applications in computer vision and beyond.

### [76] [Can World Models Benefit VLMs for World Dynamics?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00855)
*Kevin Zhang,Kuangzhi Ge,Xiaowei Chi,Renrui Zhang,Shaojun Shi,Zhen Dong,Sirui Han,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WorldLMs repurpose video-based generative priors as a single-step generative encoder to produce visual embeddings for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). The resulting DyVA variant enhances spatial and multi-frame reasoning, surpassing baselines on visual reasoning tasks and suggesting a path toward generalist vision learners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically investigate whether priors learned from large-scale video world models can improve multimodal understanding by serving as encoders for Vision-Language Models, addressing gaps where prior work has lacked broad, multimodal evaluation.

Method: Convert a video diffusion model into a one-step generative encoder; treat the denoised latent as a visual embedding; create WorldLM family with Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA) as the best variant; evaluate on a curated suite of visual reasoning tasks; analyze motion-consistency and compare to open-source and proprietary baselines; perform design-space exploration to identify promising directions.

Result: DyVA achieves state-of-the-art or comparable performance on the visual reasoning suite, improves spatial reasoning and enables single-image models to perform multi-frame reasoning, and exhibits latents that encode useful downstream information distinct from conventional encoders. The gains are attributed to motion-consistency priors learned from video pre-training.

Conclusion: WorldLMs offer a promising direction toward generalist vision learners by leveraging priors from world models; extensive design-space exploration and broader multimodal evaluation appear beneficial for future work.

Abstract: Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are
increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate
consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This
raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models,
might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose
multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the
potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically
lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we
strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred
into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a
generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting
latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of
models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that
generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding
that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing
variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method
significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image
models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of
visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and
proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We
attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization
from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model
designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study
can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world
models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.

### [77] [Gather-Scatter Mamba: Accelerating Propagation with Efficient State Space Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00862)
*Hyun-kyu Ko,Youbin Kim,Jihyeon Park,Dongheok Park,Gyeongjin Kang,Wonjun Cho,Hyung Yi,Eunbyung Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid GSMamba for video super-resolution: combines shifted window attention for spatial context with Mamba's linear-time selective temporal propagation, and introduces Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM) to align/redistribute features around a center anchor frame, reducing occlusion and maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers offer strong global context but have quadratic complexity and poor scalability for long sequences; standard SSMs (e.g., Mamba) enable input-dependent, linear-time temporal transitions but lack fine-grained spatial context due to causality. Video super-resolution requires both long-range temporal modeling and rich spatial detail, so an architecture that fuses efficient temporal propagation with spatial context aggregation and occlusion mitigation is desirable.

Method: Propose a hybrid architecture that (1) uses shifted window self-attention to aggregate spatial context within local windows, (2) employs Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient temporal propagation, and (3) introduces Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM) — an alignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame within the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back afterward to reduce occlusion and improve redistribution of aggregated information across frames.

Result: The abstract does not report quantitative results. It asserts that the approach mitigates Mamba’s spatial limitations, reduces occlusion artifacts, and provides an implementation (GitHub link) for reproducibility.

Conclusion: GSMamba presents a practical, alignment-aware VSR framework that combines spatial context aggregation with efficient temporal propagation, aiming to achieve good long-range modeling with linear-time complexity; code is released for evaluation.

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs)-most notably RNNs-have historically played a
central role in sequential modeling. Although attention mechanisms such as
Transformers have since dominated due to their ability to model global context,
their quadratic complexity and limited scalability make them less suited for
long sequences. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods have traditionally relied
on recurrent architectures to propagate features across frames. However, such
approaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of
parallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like
Mamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state
transitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while
maintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential,
Mamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its
causal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we
propose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for
spatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient
temporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an
alignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame
within the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back
afterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective
redistribution of aggregated information across all frames. The official
implementation is provided at: https://github.com/Ko-Lani/GSMamba.

### [78] [AI-CNet3D: An Anatomically-Informed Cross-Attention Network with Multi-Task Consistency Fine-tuning for 3D Glaucoma Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00882)
*Roshan Kenia,Anfei Li,Rishabh Srivastava,Kaveri A. Thakoor*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An anatomically-informed 3D cross-attention network for OCT glaucoma diagnosis that jointly analyzes the superior/inferior hemiretinas, optic nerve head, and macula. It uses Channel Attention Representations (CAREs) to visualize cross-attention and aligns them with Grad-CAMs for interpretability, achieving superior performance with ~100x fewer parameters than other attention models while maintaining efficiency, validated on two large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Condensing 3D OCT volumes into 2D reports loses crucial structural details. There is a need for models that (1) exploit 3D anatomical structure across hemiretinas, ONH, and macula; (2) provide interpretable visualizations of attention; and (3) do so efficiently for practical clinical deployment.

Method: A 3D CNN with cross-attention integrated across two axes to compare the superior and inferior hemiretinas while incorporating information from the optic nerve head and macula. Introduces Channel Attention Representations (CAREs) to visualize cross-attention outputs. Employs consistency-based multi-task fine-tuning to align CAREs with Grad-CAMs from the CNN’s final convolutional layer. The model, named AI-CNet3D (AI-'See'-Net3D), divides volumes along two axes to capture inter-hemiretinal asymmetries and fuses information from ONH and macula. The approach emphasizes anatomical coherence and interpretability while maintaining computational efficiency (significantly reduced parameters with comparable GFLOPS).

Result: The model outperforms state-of-the-art attention-based and CNN architectures on two large glaucoma OCT datasets across key metrics, demonstrating higher diagnostic performance with a substantial reduction in parameter count (≈100× fewer parameters) while preserving GFLOPS and interpretability through CAREs aligned with Grad-CAMs.

Conclusion: AI-CNet3D offers a more accurate, interpretable, and efficient solution for glaucoma classification from 3D OCT data by leveraging anatomically informed cross-attention across relevant retinal structures and providing visualization via CAREs that align with Grad-CAMs.

Abstract: Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that leads to optic nerve damage,
causing irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Optical coherence
tomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering
high-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the
conventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D
reports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this,
we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention
mechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the
extraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as
well as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We
introduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize
cross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task
fine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps
(Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance,
interpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D
(AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed
Cross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two
axes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification
by capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating
information from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on
two large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and
convolutional models across all key metrics. Finally, our model is
computationally efficient, reducing the parameter count by one-hundred--fold
compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic
performance and comparable GFLOPS.

*Yucheng Lu,Hubert Dariusz Zając,Veronika Cheplygina,Amelia Jiménez-Sánchez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A task-based survey reveals human factors in transfer learning source dataset selection for medical imaging; decisions are task-dependent and influenced by community norms, dataset properties, and perceived similarity, but similarity doesn't always predict performance; highlights need for clearer definitions and HCI tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transfer learning in medical imaging is highly sensitive to the choice of source datasets, which affects generalizability and patient outcomes. Decisions are often intuitive; this work seeks systematic, human-centered insights to improve source selection.

Method: Task-based survey with machine learning practitioners, adopting a human-computer interaction (HCI) perspective to understand how practitioners select source datasets, contrasting with model- and setup-focused benchmarks.

Result: Findings show task-dependent choices influenced by community practices, dataset properties, and computational/data-embedding aspects; perceived visual/semantic similarity does not always align with expected performance; practitioners use ambiguous terminology, underscoring the need for clearer definitions and HCI tools to make heuristics explicit.

Conclusion: Clarifying heuristics and developing practical HCI aids can enable more systematic and reliable source dataset selection in transfer learning for medical imaging.

Abstract: Transfer learning is crucial for medical imaging, yet the selection of source
datasets - which can impact the generalizability of algorithms, and thus
patient outcomes - often relies on researchers' intuition rather than
systematic principles. This study investigates these decisions through a
task-based survey with machine learning practitioners. Unlike prior work that
benchmarks models and experimental setups, we take a human-centered HCI
perspective on how practitioners select source datasets. Our findings indicate
that choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset
properties, and computational (data embedding), or perceived visual or semantic
similarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always
aligned, challenging a traditional "more similar is better" view. Participants
often used ambiguous terminology, which suggests a need for clearer definitions
and HCI tools to make them explicit and usable. By clarifying these heuristics,
this work provides practical insights for more systematic source selection in
transfer learning.

*Ali Shadman Yazdi,Annalisa Cappella,Benedetta Baldini,Riccardo Solazzo,Gianluca Tartaglia,Chiarella Sforza,Giuseppe Baselli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAL-Net is a fully automated deep learning pipeline that localizes 50 anatomical landmarks on stereo-photogrammetry facial models, achieving accuracy comparable to intra-observer variability and strong generalization across datasets while remaining lightweight and scalable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual landmark annotation on 3D facial scans is slow, expert-dependent, and limits high-throughput craniofacial research; existing deep-learning methods either rely on pseudo-landmarks or require complex inputs, hindering clinical applicability.

Method: A pipeline combining coarse alignment, ROI filtering, initial landmark approximation, and a patch-based pointwise CNN with attention mechanisms (PAL-Net). Trained on 214 annotated healthy adult scans; evaluated on 700 FaceScape subjects.

Result: Mean localization error: 3.686 mm; average distance error: 2.822 mm (comparable to intra-observer variability). On FaceScape: point-wise error 0.41 mm; distance-wise error 0.38 mm. Degrades in regions with poor mesh quality (ears, hairline) but generally accurate across regions; outperforms existing methods in both point-wise and structural metrics; lightweight and scalable.

Conclusion: PAL-Net generalizes well across datasets and facial regions, offering a favorable accuracy-cost trade-off for high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis and potential clinical workflow integration; code available at GitHub.

Abstract: Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is a
time-consuming and expertise-dependent task, yet it remains critical for
clinical assessments, morphometric analysis, and craniofacial research. While
several deep learning methods have been proposed for facial landmark
localization, most focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex input
representations, limiting their clinical applicability. This study presents a
fully automated deep learning pipeline (PAL-Net) for localizing 50 anatomical
landmarks on stereo-photogrammetry facial models. The method combines coarse
alignment, region-of-interest filtering, and an initial approximation of
landmarks with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.
Trained and evaluated on 214 annotated scans from healthy adults, PAL-Net
achieved a mean localization error of 3.686 mm and preserves relevant
anatomical distances with a 2.822 mm average error, comparable to
intra-observer variability. To assess generalization, the model was further
evaluated on 700 subjects from the FaceScape dataset, achieving a point-wise
error of 0.41\,mm and a distance-wise error of 0.38\,mm. Compared to existing
methods, PAL-Net offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
computational cost. While performance degrades in regions with poor mesh
quality (e.g., ears, hairline), the method demonstrates consistent accuracy
across most anatomical regions. PAL-Net generalizes effectively across datasets
and facial regions, outperforming existing methods in both point-wise and
structural evaluations. It provides a lightweight, scalable solution for
high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, with potential to support clinical
workflows and reduce reliance on manual annotation. Source code can be found at

*Victor Sechaud,Jérémy Scanvic,Quentin Barthélemy,Patrice Abry,Julián Tachella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised framework for inverse problems using a single incomplete observation; introduces an equivariance notion for reconstruction networks and shows that combining self-supervised splitting losses with equivariant networks yields unbiased supervised-loss estimates and state-of-the-art results on inpainting, MRI, and compressive sensing under highly rank-deficient forward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ground-truth data for training is expensive or unavailable; need learning-based reconstructions from noisy or incomplete measurements; current methods struggle with highly incomplete forward models; aims to enable self-supervised training with unbiased loss estimates.

Method: Define an equivariance concept for reconstruction networks; combine self-supervised splitting losses with equivariant reconstruction networks; prove unbiased estimation of supervised loss; validate on image inpainting, accelerated MRI, and compressive sensing.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in settings with highly rank-deficient forward models across multiple tasks; demonstrates robust reconstruction quality under challenging forward models.

Conclusion: Self-supervised learning with equivariant reconstruction networks provides unbiased loss estimates and strong performance for inverse problems with incomplete measurements, enabling effective learning without ground-truth references.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning for inverse problems allows to train a
reconstruction network from noise and/or incomplete data alone. These methods
have the potential of enabling learning-based solutions when obtaining
ground-truth references for training is expensive or even impossible. In this
paper, we propose a new self-supervised learning strategy devised for the
challenging setting where measurements are observed via a single incomplete
observation model. We introduce a new definition of equivariance in the context
of reconstruction networks, and show that the combination of self-supervised
splitting losses and equivariant reconstruction networks results in unbiased
estimates of the supervised loss. Through a series of experiments on image
inpainting, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and compressive sensing, we
demonstrate that the proposed loss achieves state-of-the-art performance in
settings with highly rank-deficient forward models.

*Zanwu Liu,Chao Yuan,Bo Li,Xiaowei Zhang,Guanglin Niu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight VPFA framework for Cross-Resolution ReID that identifies and compensates resolution-induced feature discrepancies along a semantic direction in feature space, avoiding super-resolution and achieving state-of-the-art performance with higher efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-Resolution ReID suffers from irregular image resolutions due to varying camera distances. Traditional SR-based or joint-learning methods add complexity and hit performance bottlenecks. The authors hypothesize that resolution differences correspond to semantic directions in ReID feature space, similar to word-embedding semantics, and seek to exploit this for efficient alignment.

Method: The authors first validate the existence of resolution-related semantic directions using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and Pearson correlation. Based on this, they propose Vector Panning Feature Alignment (VPFA), a lightweight framework that models and compensates resolution-specific feature discrepancy by moving features along a targeted semantic direction to align LR and HR representations without performing SR.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks show VPFA significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines while offering higher efficiency.

Conclusion: Modeling resolution-specific feature discrepancies as semantic directions in ReID feature space is effective. VPFA provides a simple, lightweight, and efficient solution to CR-ReID without heavy SR, achieving strong performance improvements.

Abstract: In surveillance scenarios, varying camera distances cause significant
differences among pedestrian image resolutions, making it hard to match
low-resolution (LR) images with high-resolution (HR) counterparts, limiting the
performance of Re-Identification (ReID) tasks. Most existing Cross-Resolution
ReID (CR-ReID) methods rely on super-resolution (SR) or joint learning for
feature compensation, which increases training and inference complexity and has
reached a performance bottleneck in recent studies. Inspired by semantic
directions in the word embedding space, we empirically discover that semantic
directions implying resolution differences also emerge in the feature space of
ReID, and we substantiate this finding from a statistical perspective using
Canonical Correlation Analysis and Pearson Correlation Analysis. Based on this
interesting finding, we propose a lightweight and effective Vector Panning
Feature Alignment (VPFA) framework, which conducts CR-ReID from a novel
perspective of modeling the resolution-specific feature discrepancy. Extensive
experimental results on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks show that our method
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models while
obtaining higher efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of
our model based on the new finding in this paper.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfVSR reframes video super-resolution as an autoregressive one-step diffusion process for streaming long-form videos, leveraging pre-trained diffusion priors with a causal DiT, rolling KV-cache, and patch-wise one-step diffusion distillation to enable efficient, scalable VSR with improved temporal coherence. A new long-sequence benchmark and semantic metrics accompany the method, achieving state-of-the-art quality and up to 58x speed-up over MGLD-VSR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world videos are extremely long, making existing VSR approaches inefficient due to multi-step denoising and suffer from artifacts when temporally decomposed. There is a need for scalable, efficient, and coherent long-form VSR that can operate on unbounded sequences.

Method: Transform VSR into an autoregressive-one-step-diffusion framework. Adapt pre-trained DiT into a causal structure with rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance for local and global coherence. Distill the diffusion process into a single step using patch-wise pixel supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching, enabling streaming inference and unbounded-length video processing.

Result: The approach yields state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic temporal consistency and achieves up to 58x speed-up compared to existing methods like MGLD-VSR.

Conclusion: InfVSR enables efficient, scalable long-form VSR by reformulating diffusion priors into an autoregressive one-step paradigm, achieving strong quality and coherence while dramatically improving speed and extending evaluation to long sequences.

Abstract: Real-world videos often extend over thousands of frames. Existing video
super-resolution (VSR) approaches, however, face two persistent challenges when
processing long sequences: (1) inefficiency due to the heavy cost of multi-step
denoising for full-length sequences; and (2) poor scalability hindered by
temporal decomposition that causes artifacts and discontinuities. To break
these limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an
autoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm. This enables streaming inference
while fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors. First, we adapt the
pre-trained DiT into a causal structure, maintaining both local and global
coherence via rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance. Second, we distill
the diffusion process into a single step efficiently, with patch-wise pixel
supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching. Together, these designs
enable efficient and scalable VSR for unbounded-length videos. To fill the gap
in long-form video evaluation, we build a new benchmark tailored for extended
sequences and further introduce semantic-level metrics to comprehensively
assess temporal consistency. Our method pushes the frontier of long-form VSR,
achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, and
delivers up to 58x speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR. Code will
be available at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/InfVSR.

TL;DR: Token-based multimodal T2I model (JEPA-T) using joint-embedding tokens and late fusion; supports class-conditional and free-text generation with improved alignment and data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text–image fusion remains difficult in token-centric T2I; need effective conditioning that preserves backbone generality and enables open-vocabulary generation.

Method: Encode images and captions into discrete tokens; use a joint-embedding predictive Transformer; add cross-attention after the feature predictor for conditional denoising; inject raw text embeddings prior to the flow-matching loss; same network supports class-conditional and free-text generation via iterative denoising of visual tokens conditioned on text.

Result: Outperforms non-fusion and late-fusion baselines on ImageNet-1K; demonstrates strong data efficiency and open-vocabulary generalization.

Conclusion: Late architectural fusion plus objective-level alignment provides a good balance between conditioning strength and backbone generality; code released.

Abstract: Modern Text-to-Image (T2I) generation increasingly relies on token-centric
architectures that are trained with self-supervision, yet effectively fusing
text with visual tokens remains a challenge. We propose \textbf{JEPA-T}, a
unified multimodal framework that encodes images and captions into discrete
visual and textual tokens, processed by a joint-embedding predictive
Transformer. To enhance fusion, we incorporate cross-attention after the
feature predictor for conditional denoising while maintaining a task-agnostic
backbone. Additionally, raw texts embeddings are injected prior to the flow
matching loss to improve alignment during training. During inference, the same
network performs both class-conditional and free-text image generation by
iteratively denoising visual tokens conditioned on text. Evaluations on
ImageNet-1K demonstrate that JEPA-T achieves strong data efficiency,
open-vocabulary generalization, and consistently outperforms non-fusion and
late-fusion baselines. Our approach shows that late architectural fusion
combined with objective-level alignment offers an effective balance between
conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I.The code is

TL;DR: FastForward performs fast, on-the-fly visual localization by building a 3D-anchored feature map from mapping images and predicting image-to-scene correspondences in a single feed-forward pass, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with minimal mapping time and good generalization to unseen domains.


<details>

Motivation: Reduce mating time and computational cost of camera relocalization while maintaining high accuracy, enabling practical real-time localization in large-scale and unseen environments.

Method: Represents multiple mapping images as a collection of features anchored in 3D space. Uses these mapping features to predict image-to-scene correspondences for a query image and estimate its camera pose. Combines with image retrieval to improve pose estimation in a single feed-forward pass.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy relative to methods with minimal map preparation time. Demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains, including challenging large-scale outdoor environments.

Conclusion: FastForward offers a fast, generalizable approach to visual localization that reduces map-building time and enables accurate pose estimation in new domains, including large-scale outdoor scenes.

Abstract: Visually localizing an image, i.e., estimating its camera pose, requires
building a scene representation that serves as a visual map. The representation
we choose has direct consequences towards the practicability of our system.
Even when starting from mapping images with known camera poses,
state-of-the-art approaches still require hours of mapping time in the worst
case, and several minutes in the best. This work raises the question whether we
can achieve competitive accuracy much faster. We introduce FastForward, a
method that creates a map representation and relocalizes a query image
on-the-fly in a single feed-forward pass. At the core, we represent multiple
mapping images as a collection of features anchored in 3D space. FastForward
utilizes these mapping features to predict image-to-scene correspondences for
the query image, enabling the estimation of its camera pose. We couple
FastForward with image retrieval and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when
compared to other approaches with minimal map preparation time. Furthermore,
FastForward demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains, including
challenging large-scale outdoor environments.

TL;DR: A plug-and-play refinement module improves autoregressive vision–language generation by better modeling spatial relations, applied as a post-pretraining step to jointly refine all tokens and reduce error accumulation, yielding more semantically consistent outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models handle sequential data well but treat visual signals as a sequence, ignoring spatial structure and correlations among tokens, which causes suboptimal generation and error accumulation in vision–language tasks.

Method: Introduce a post-pretraining refinement module that jointly refines all generated tokens of the autoregressive model. The module leverages global context and token relationships to enhance spatial correspondence modeling within the generated visual sequence, operating within a shared sequential prediction framework while mitigating error propagation.

Result: Empirical results show improved generation quality and semantically consistent outputs, demonstrating the effectiveness of refining tokens with global context to better align visual and language signals.

Conclusion: A plug-and-play refinement step can substantially improve spatial–sequential alignment in autoregressive vision–language models, offering a lightweight post-training augmentation that reduces error accumulation and enhances semantic consistency.

Abstract: Autoregressive models excel in sequential modeling and have proven to be
effective for vision-language data. However, the spatial nature of visual
signals conflicts with the sequential dependencies of next-token prediction,
leading to suboptimal results. This work proposes a plug-and-play refinement
module to enhance the complex spatial correspondence modeling within the
generated visual sequence. This module operates as a post-pretraining step to
jointly refine all generated tokens of autoregressive model, enhancing
vision-language modeling under a shared sequential prediction framework. By
leveraging global context and relationship across the tokens, our method
mitigates the error accumulation issue within the sequential generation.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the generation
quality, enhancing the model's ability to produce semantically consistent
results.

### [87] [SoftCFG: Uncertainty-guided Stable Guidance for Visual autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00996)
*Dongli Xu,Aleksei Tiulpin,Matthew B. Blaschko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SoftCFG extends classifier-free guidance for autoregressive image generation by distributing uncertainty-guided perturbations across tokens and stabilizing long sequences with Step Normalization; training-free and model-agnostic, achieving state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet-256 among AR models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) helps conditional generation but autoregressive (AR) image models face guidance diminishing (conditional-unconditional gap shrinks during decoding) and over-guidance (strong conditions distort visual coherence).

Method: SoftCFG performs uncertainty-guided inference that distributes adaptive, certainty-weighted perturbations across all generated tokens, so each token contributes to guidance while maintaining coherence with visual context. Step Normalization bounds cumulative perturbations to stabilize long-sequence generation. The approach is training-free and model-agnostic, compatible with existing AR pipelines.

Result: Significant image quality gains over standard CFG; achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet-256 among autoregressive models.

Conclusion: SoftCFG provides a simple, training-free enhancement for conditional AR image generation, improving stability and quality and enabling effective guidance across long sequences.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have emerged as powerful tools for image
generation by modeling images as sequences of discrete tokens. While
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been adopted to improve conditional
generation, its application in AR models faces two key issues: guidance
diminishing, where the conditional-unconditional gap quickly vanishes as
decoding progresses, and over-guidance, where strong conditions distort visual
coherence. To address these challenges, we propose SoftCFG, an
uncertainty-guided inference method that distributes adaptive perturbations
across all tokens in the sequence. The key idea behind SoftCFG is to let each
generated token contribute certainty-weighted guidance, ensuring that the
signal persists across steps while resolving conflicts between text guidance
and visual context. To further stabilize long-sequence generation, we introduce
Step Normalization, which bounds cumulative perturbations of SoftCFG. Our
method is training-free, model-agnostic, and seamlessly integrates with
existing AR pipelines. Experiments show that SoftCFG significantly improves
image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet
256 among autoregressive models.

*Qiming Zhao,Xingjian Li,Xiaoyu Cao,Xiaolong Wu,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TextCAM combines CAM with vision-language alignment to produce textual descriptions of salient visual attributes, yielding spatial and semantic explanations for DNNs in vision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAM explanations lack semantic attributes; there is a need for interpretable, semantically grounded rationales for deep vision models to improve trust and detect spurious correlations in high-stakes tasks.

Method: Derive channel-level semantic representations using CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis; aggregate them with CAM weights to generate textual descriptions of salient evidence; extend to group feature channels for finer-grained explanations.

Result: On ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB, TextCAM yields faithful and interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, help detect spurious correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

Conclusion: TextCAM offers a semantically grounded, faithful expansion of CAM explanations by integrating vision-language representations, providing richer, human-aligned explanations without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
but remain difficult to interpret, limiting their trustworthiness in
high-stakes applications. This paper focuses on deep vision models, for which a
dominant line of explainability methods are Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and
its variants working by highlighting spatial regions that drive predictions. We
figure out that CAM provides little semantic insight into what attributes
underlie these activations. To address this limitation, we propose TextCAM, a
novel explanation framework that enriches CAM with natural languages. TextCAM
combines the precise spatial localization of CAM with the semantic alignment of
vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we derive channel-level semantic
representations using CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis, and
aggregate them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of salient
visual evidence. This yields explanations that jointly specify where the model
attends and what visual attributes likely support its decision. We further
extend TextCAM to generate feature channels into semantically coherent groups,
enabling more fine-grained visual-textual explanations. Experiments on
ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB demonstrate that TextCAM produces faithful and
interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious
correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

### [89] [POVQA: Preference-Optimized Video Question Answering with Rationales for Data Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01009)
*Ashim Dahal,Ankit Ghimire,Saydul Akbar Murad,Nick Rahimi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POVQA compresses long videos into 1fps pooled frames to efficiently align LVLMs with supervision, achieving large gains on ReasonVQA with SFT+DPO and showing robustness across pooling schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long video question answering with large context is costly; existing long-context VQA still struggles to preserve temporal information. The paper proposes a data-efficient pipeline to summarize temporal evidence and enable LVLM-based VQA.

Method: Convert video into 1fps inputs using pooling variants (Blend Blur with Last Frame, Weighted Average, Exponential, Ramp). Fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B with supervised two-turn prompts (reasoning + final answer). Train with SFT and DPO on a new ReasonVQA dataset (12 movies, 239 QA pairs with reasoning prompts). Evaluate across pooling schemes and on zero-shot TVQA.

Result: On ReasonVQA, F1 improved from 0.212 to 0.543; BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291; ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528; rationale quality also improved. Gains persisted across pooling methods, indicating robustness. Similar improvements observed in zero-shot TVQA.

Conclusion: The approach yields robust, data-efficient VQA for long videos by compressing temporal information and leveraging supervised fine-tuning with LVLMs; pooling-agnostic gains suggest good generalization to temporal summarization tasks; applicable to other long-video VQA settings.

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) with Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has
gained significant traction in research ever since the Flamingo was introduced
by Deepmind. Recent advancements in large context/long video question answering
have allowed VQA tasks to have context window of 1500+ frames. However, this
only leads to 50 seconds of video footage without losing any significant
information. We introduce POVQA, a data-efficient pipeline that compresses each
second of video into a single temporally pooled image (via motion blur and
weighted averaging variants) and then align LVLMs with lightweight supervision.
Concretely, we build 1 fps input sources using Blend Blur with Last Frame,
Weighted Average, Exponential and Ramp pooling and fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B
with supervised two turn target including reasoning and final answer. We apply
Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on our
novel dataset ReasonVQA consisting of 12 movies with 239 human annotated
question-answer with reasoning prompts. On our ReasonVQA dataset, this method
dramatically improves performance over pooled baselines: F1 score improves from
0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, and ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528.
Rationale quality also significantly increases. Cross-evaluation of SFT + DPO
on various pooling functions show that the gains persist regardless of the
pooling scheme used at train or test time, indicating strong robustness on
summarization of temporal evidence. Similar observations were made on zero-shot
in TVQA.

*Yuxiang Guo,Jiang Liu,Ze Wang,Hao Chen,Ximeng Sun,Yang Zhao,Jialian Wu,Xiaodong Yu,Zicheng Liu,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces ImageDoctor, a multi-aspect evaluation and reward framework for text-to-image models, with four quality dimensions, pixel heatmaps, and a look-think-predict reasoning process, achieving strong human alignment and ~10% quality gain when used as a dense reward.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome reliance on a single scalar score for image quality and provide interpretable, comprehensive feedback and dense rewards for preference alignment in T2I models.

Method: Builds a vision-language model-based evaluator (ImageDoctor) with four dimensions (plausibility, semantic alignment, aesthetics, overall quality), produces pixel-level flaw heatmaps, uses a look-think-predict paradigm, trained via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning.

Result: Demonstrates strong alignment with human preferences across multiple datasets; using as a reward model yields ~10% improvement in generation quality over scalar-based rewards.

Conclusion: ImageDoctor is effective as both an evaluation metric and a dense reward model, enabling more interpretable feedback and improved T2I performance through better preference modeling.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models has increased the need
for reliable human preference modeling, a demand further amplified by recent
progress in reinforcement learning for preference alignment. However, existing
approaches typically quantify the quality of a generated image using a single
scalar, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive and interpretable
feedback on image quality. To address this, we introduce ImageDoctor, a unified
multi-aspect T2I model evaluation framework that assesses image quality across
four complementary dimensions: plausibility, semantic alignment, aesthetics,
and overall quality. ImageDoctor also provides pixel-level flaw indicators in
the form of heatmaps, which highlight misaligned or implausible regions, and
can be used as a dense reward for T2I model preference alignment. Inspired by
the diagnostic process, we improve the detail sensitivity and reasoning
capability of ImageDoctor by introducing a "look-think-predict" paradigm, where
the model first localizes potential flaws, then generates reasoning, and
finally concludes the evaluation with quantitative scores. Built on top of a
vision-language model and trained through a combination of supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, ImageDoctor demonstrates strong
alignment with human preference across multiple datasets, establishing its
effectiveness as an evaluation metric. Furthermore, when used as a reward model
for preference tuning, ImageDoctor significantly improves generation quality --
achieving an improvement of 10% over scalar-based reward models.

### [91] [Towards Adversarial Training under Hyperspectral Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01014)
*Weihua Zhang,Chengze Jiang,Jie Gui,Lu Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adversarial training in hyperspectral data (AT-RA) enhances robustness and preserves spectral semantics, addressing domain-specific challenges with data augmentation and spatial-smoothness constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperspectral models are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks; existing defenses based on network architecture are not scalable and struggle against strong attacks; hyperspectral data have unique spectral semantics and non-smooth adversarial perturbations that can distort information.

Method: Proposes AT-RA, a hyperspectral adversarial training framework augmented with data augmentation to diversify spectral information and enforce spatial smoothness, aimed at preserving spectral semantics during training.

Result: AT-RA yields substantial robustness gains (≈21.34% against AutoAttack and ≈18.78% against PGD-50) and a modest benign accuracy improvement of ≈2.68%.

Conclusion: AT-RA is effective for improving adversarial robustness in hyperspectral classification by addressing hyperspectral-specific challenges, demonstrating that spectral-aware training with augmentation can outperform baseline defenses.

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that hyperspectral classification models based
on deep learning are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
significant security risks. Although several approaches have attempted to
enhance adversarial robustness by modifying network architectures, these
methods often rely on customized designs that limit scalability and fail to
defend effectively against strong attacks. To address these challenges, we
introduce adversarial training to the hyperspectral domain, which is widely
regarded as one of the most effective defenses against adversarial attacks.
Through extensive empirical analyses, we demonstrate that while adversarial
training does enhance robustness across various models and datasets,
hyperspectral data introduces unique challenges not seen in RGB images.
Specifically, we find that adversarial noise and the non-smooth nature of
adversarial examples can distort or eliminate important spectral semantic
information. To mitigate this issue, we employ data augmentation techniques and
propose a novel hyperspectral adversarial training method, termed AT-RA. By
increasing the diversity of spectral information and ensuring spatial
smoothness, AT-RA preserves and corrects spectral semantics in hyperspectral
images. Experimental results show that AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by
21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50 while boosting benign
accuracy by 2.68%.

### [92] [Secure and reversible face anonymization with diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01031)
*Pol Labarbarie,Vincent Itier,William Puech*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A secure, high-quality reversible face anonymization method using diffusion models with a secret key and facial masks to enable reversible anonymization for authorized parties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Face images reveal sensitive information; existing methods trade off security, image quality, and reversibility. Diffusion models offer high-quality anonymization but lack reversible key-based control. The work introduces a secure reversible workflow.

Method: Integrates a secret key with the latent face representation in a diffusion model, constrains generation with a facial mask to preserve non-identity features, and uses deterministic forward/backward diffusion to enable recovery of the original face with the correct key.

Result: Produces anonymized faces that are less visually similar to original faces than prior methods while maintaining high image quality and allowing reversible recovery when supplied with the secret key.

Conclusion: Presents a novel secure, high-quality reversible face anonymization approach based on diffusion, combining key-based reversibility with identity-irrelevant feature preservation via masking.

Abstract: Face images processed by computer vision algorithms contain sensitive
personal information that malicious actors can capture without consent. These
privacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization
methods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure
scheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person
authentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized
images but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties
can reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the
first secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion
model. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces
representation of the diffusion model. To preserve identity-irrelevant
features, generation is constrained by a facial mask, maintaining high-quality
images. By using a deterministic forward and backward diffusion process, our
approach enforces that the original face can be recovered with the correct
secret key. We also show that the proposed method produces anonymized faces
that are less visually similar to the original faces, compared to other
previous work.

### [93] [Authentic Discrete Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01047)
*Xiao Li,Jiaqi Zhang,Shuxiang Zhang,Tianshui Chen,Liang Lin,Guangrun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A discrete diffusion framework (ADD) that operates directly in one-hot space using a float-encoded one-hot input and a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss, surpassing pseudo-discrete diffusion baselines in classification and enabling strong image-caption generation; ablations validate component gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To preserve core diffusion characteristics within discrete label space, avoiding diffusion in continuous latent spaces, and to bridge discriminative and generative learning for improved discrete diffusion tasks such as classification and captioning.

Method: Use float-encoded one-hot class data as the diffusion input, avoiding diffusion in continuous latent spaces or masking policies. Introduce a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss between the diffusion model outputs and the original one-hot labels. Employ coordinated mechanisms to maintain diffusion characteristics directly in the one-hot space, creating a linkage between discriminative and generative learning.

Result: ADD achieves superior classification performance compared to the baseline PDD approaches and demonstrates excellent text generation capabilities for image captioning. Ablation studies show measurable gains from each component.

Conclusion:  ADD provides a fundamental shift from pseudo-discrete diffusion to authentic discrete diffusion by operating in one-hot space with a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy objective; this yields improved classification and captioning performance, with component-wise gains validated by extensive ablations.

Abstract: We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally
redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion
characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated
mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD
reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class
data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking
policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced
between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This
synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative
learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior
performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits
excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations
validate the measurable gains of each component.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Instant4D is a fast, calibration-free monocular dynamic scene reconstruction system that processes casual videos using a native 4D representation, achieving minute-scale training and ~10-minute reconstructions with a dramatically smaller model footprint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing dynamic scenes from uncalibrated, casual video is hard due to slow optimization, complex parameter estimation, and lack of depth sensors; a fast, robust, calibration-free solution is needed.

Method: Pipeline: deep visual SLAM for geometric recovery, grid pruning to reduce redundancy, and a streamlined 4D Gaussian representation for temporal dynamics; monocular input, no depth sensors; efficient processing within minutes.

Result: 30x speed-up vs prior methods; training in under 2 minutes; single video reconstruction under 10 minutes on Dycheck or ~200 frames; model footprint reduced to under 10% of original; demonstrated on in-the-wild videos with good generalization.

Conclusion: Instant4D offers a practical, fast, and scalable solution for dynamic view synthesis from casual video, combining SLAM-based initialization, pruning, and a compact 4D representation to deliver competitive performance on benchmarks and real-world footage.

Abstract: Dynamic view synthesis has seen significant advances, yet reconstructing
scenes from uncalibrated, casual video remains challenging due to slow
optimization and complex parameter estimation. In this work, we present
Instant4D, a monocular reconstruction system that leverages native 4D
representation to efficiently process casual video sequences within minutes,
without calibrated cameras or depth sensors. Our method begins with geometric
recovery through deep visual SLAM, followed by grid pruning to optimize scene
representation. Our design significantly reduces redundancy while maintaining
geometric integrity, cutting model size to under 10% of its original footprint.
To handle temporal dynamics efficiently, we introduce a streamlined 4D Gaussian
representation, achieving a 30x speed-up and reducing training time to within
two minutes, while maintaining competitive performance across several
benchmarks. Our method reconstruct a single video within 10 minutes on the
Dycheck dataset or for a typical 200-frame video. We further apply our model to
in-the-wild videos, showcasing its generalizability. Our project website is

*Yanzhe Chen,Kevin Qinghong Lin,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Code2Video presents a code-centric, three-agent framework for generating educational videos from executable Python code, enabling controllable visuals, evaluated on a new discipline-specific MMMC benchmark and TeachQuiz metric; shows ~40% improvement over direct code generation and comparability to human tutorials; codebase released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Educational videos require precise visuals and coherent structure that are difficult for pixel-space generative models to reliably provide. A renderable, code-controlled environment offers explicit control over content and visuals, enabling scalable, interpretable educational video production.

Method: Three collaboratively agents: Planner structures lecture content and assets; Coder translates instructions into executable Python code with scope-guided auto-fix for efficiency; Critic uses vision-language models with visual anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and clarity. Evaluation on MMMC benchmark with diverse metrics (VLM-based aesthetics, code efficiency) and TeachQuiz, an end-to-end metric assessing knowledge recovery from generated videos. Benchmark and code/datasets released.

Result: Code2Video achieves about 40% improvement over direct code generation and produces videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials; demonstrates scalability, interpretability, and controllability in educational video generation; establishes MMMC benchmark and TeachQuiz as evaluation tools.

Conclusion: Code-centric video generation via collaborative agents is a promising path for producing professional educational videos, offering greater control and potential alignment with experts’ expectations; future work may enhance alignment, evaluation, and broader subject coverage.

Abstract: While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they
remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand
disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions,
limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such
requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable
environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g.,
code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for
generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework
comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture
content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual
assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable
Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;
and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual
anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support
systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,
discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse
dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and
particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a
VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos.
Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable,
interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct
code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvoWorld combines evolving 3D memory with panoramic video generation to achieve long-horizon, spatially coherent exploration from a single panorama, outperforming prior video-only models in realism and geometry consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans mentally simulate 3D environments; existing approaches lack explicit dynamic 3D memory to guide long-range video synthesis; EvoWorld aims to couple 3D memory evolution with view-conditioned video generation to improve spatial coherence across extended trajectories, evaluated across synthetic, indoor, and real-world scenes with a focus on loop closure and geometric consistency.

Method: A three-stage pipeline: (1) from a single panoramic image, generate future frames using a video generator with fine-grained view control; (2) evolve the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play transformer; (3) synthesize futures conditioned on geometric reprojections from the evolving 3D memory, projecting the geometry onto target views to provide rich spatial cues for generation.

Result: The evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and spatial coherence over long trajectories. A new benchmark spanning synthetic outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and real-world data shows improved loop-closure detection and geometric consistency compared to state-of-the-art video-only methods.

Conclusion: This work advances long-horizon, spatially consistent world modeling by tightly coupling evolving explicit 3D memory with video generation, offering a significant step toward more realistic and coherent long-range scene synthesis.

Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable ability to mentally explore and replay 3D
environments they have previously experienced. Inspired by this mental process,
we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with
evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration.
Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video
frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then
evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play
transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric
reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior
state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in
exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the
video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target
viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual
realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration
capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic
outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world
scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial
coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains
spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a
significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.

TL;DR: A training-free framework for editing any number of subjects in video frames by conditioning and mask retargeting, compatible with any mask-driven video generator, achieving state-of-the-art results on MSVBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable, training-free, multi-subject video editing that preserves non-target regions and handles arbitrary numbers of subjects, addressing limitations of fine-tuning, generalization, and mask boundary artifacts.

Method: Two components: (1) a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module that provides robust conditioning and mask motion sequences for multiple subjects; (2) a prior-based mask retargeting module that adapts the prior masks; these priors are then fed into a pretrained mask-driven video generation model to synthesize the edited video. The approach aims for strong generalization and compatibility with any mask-driven model.

Result: Extensive experiments on the MSVBench multi-subject benchmark show IMAGEdit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The framework is compatible with various mask-driven video generation models, with code, models, and datasets publicly available.

Conclusion: IMAGEdit offers a training-free, generalizable solution for editing any number of subjects in videos while preserving non-target regions, significantly broadening the practical applicability of video editing and simplifying deployment.

Abstract: In this paper, we present IMAGEdit, a training-free framework for any number
of video subject editing that manipulates the appearances of multiple
designated subjects while preserving non-target regions, without finetuning or
retraining. We achieve this by providing robust multimodal conditioning and
precise mask sequences through a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and
a prior-based mask retargeting module. We first leverage large models'
understanding and generation capabilities to produce multimodal information and
mask motion sequences for multiple subjects across various types. Then, the
obtained prior mask sequences are fed into a pretrained mask-driven video
generation model to synthesize the edited video. With strong generalization
capability, IMAGEdit remedies insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning
and overcomes mask boundary entanglement in videos with any number of subjects,
thereby significantly expanding the applicability of video editing. More
importantly, IMAGEdit is compatible with any mask-driven video generation
model, significantly improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on
our newly constructed multi-subject benchmark MSVBench verify that IMAGEdit
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets are

Conclusion: ToolBrain lowers barriers to training tool-using agents by supporting diverse RL and training strategies, practical utilities for tooling, and efficient inference, with public availability (toolbrain.org) to facilitate rapid domain adaptation.

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for agentic AI, yet training agents to
utilize tools remains challenging due to manually designed rewards, limited
training data, and poor multi-tool selection, resulting in slow adaptation,
wasted computational resources, and suboptimal performance. We introduce
ToolBrain, a lightweight and user-friendly framework for coaching tool use in
agentic models with flexible reinforcement learning (RL), easing the barriers
for researchers and practitioners to adapt LLM-based agents to specific
domains. It supports a wide range of training strategies, including RL
algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, as well as supervised learning. ToolBrain
enables custom reward callables directly on an agent's execution traces or
simply utilizes an automated LLM-as-a-judge system for reward generation. It is
packed with useful capabilities, including knowledge distillation from large to
small models for efficient development, automatic task generation from tool
descriptions, seamless tool retrieval, efficient fine-tuning pipelines with
QLoRA through Unsloth, and quantized inference via bitsandbytes. We demonstrate
ToolBrain through diverse use cases, such as training a CodeAct agent to

(up to 30.0%) in tool-use skills while keeping the codebase simple and
extensible in Agentic AI. Our framework is publicly available at

Motivation: Large reasoning language models suffer from overthinking, causing high computational cost. There is a need to balance reasoning quality with inference efficiency, and existing static suppression approaches may not adapt to varying certainty or task demands.

Method: ARS is training-free and uses multi-checkpoint certainty estimation with progressive suppression thresholds to dynamically suppress redundant reasoning steps. It operates across multiple model architectures and is evaluated on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Result: ARS achieves up to 53% token reduction, 46.1% latency reduction, and 57.9% energy reduction, while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Conclusion: ARS provides a superior, training-free approach to efficient reasoning in LRLMs, outperforming static suppression methods and offering practical efficiency gains across architectures and benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs or LRMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, but suffer from significant
computational inefficiencies due to overthinking phenomena. Existing efficient
reasoning methods face the challenge of balancing reasoning quality with
inference cost reduction. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Reasoning Suppression
(ARS)}, a novel training-free approach that dynamically suppresses redundant
reasoning steps while preserving accuracy through adaptive certainty
monitoring. ARS introduces a multi-checkpoint certainty estimation mechanism
with progressive suppression thresholds, achieving superior efficiency compared
to static suppression methods. Our extensive evaluation across mathematical
reasoning benchmarks using multiple model architectures demonstrates that ARS
achieves up to 53%, 46.1%, and 57.9% in token, latency and energy reduction,
while maintaining or improving accuracy.

### [101] [NeurIPS should lead scientific consensus on AI policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00075)
*Rishi Bommasani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeurIPS should actively catalyze scientific consensus on AI policy, filling a void in consensus formation by piloting evidence-based, climate-policy-style processes and refuting counterarguments about AI researchers' disagreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy-making for AI requires rigorous evidence and broad, credible consensus. There is a gap in formal consensus-formation mechanisms; NeurIPS, with its scientific authority and AI focus, is well-positioned to lead this effort and improve AI-policy quality.

Method: A position paper arguing for NeurIPS's role in consensus formation, identifying the deficit, drawing lessons from the IPCC, proposing initial pilots, and addressing anticipated objections to policy engagement by AI researchers.

Result: The paper identifies a complete void in consensus-formation mechanisms for AI policy and argues that NeurIPS should lead by piloting consensus-building efforts, inspired by IPCC leadership, and by dispelling common objections to AI researchers engaging in policy.

Conclusion: NeurIPS should champion scientific consensus to elevate AI policy quality, establishing leadership in policy-relevant science and coordinating initial pilots to create durable, credible policy guidance.

Abstract: Designing wise AI policy is a grand challenge for society. To design such
policy, policymakers should place a premium on rigorous evidence and scientific
consensus. While several mechanisms exist for evidence generation, and nascent
mechanisms tackle evidence synthesis, we identify a complete void on consensus
formation. In this position paper, we argue NeurIPS should actively catalyze
scientific consensus on AI policy. Beyond identifying the current deficit in
consensus formation mechanisms, we argue that NeurIPS is the best option due
its strengths and the paucity of compelling alternatives. To make progress, we
recommend initial pilots for NeurIPS by distilling lessons from the IPCC's
leadership to build scientific consensus on climate policy. We dispel
predictable counters that AI researchers disagree too much to achieve consensus
and that policy engagement is not the business of NeurIPS. NeurIPS leads AI on
many fronts, and it should champion scientific consensus to create higher
quality AI policy.

TL;DR: A position paper proposing CERTAIN, a framework for ethical, regulatory, and transparent AI in Europe, integrating semantic MLOps, ontology-based data lineage, and RegOps, validated through pilots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Europe-wide AI deployment raises ethical, legal, and regulatory concerns. There is a need for a unified framework that ensures transparency, accountability, and compliance with EU standards (e.g., EU AI Act, GDPR).

Method: Develop core components: (i) semantic MLOps for structured AI lifecycle management; (ii) ontology-driven data lineage tracking for traceability; (iii) RegOps workflows to operationalize compliance. Outline methodology and validation plan across diverse pilots.

Result: A position paper that outlines the framework and methodological steps for building and validating the core components across pilots; no empirical results yet, but a roadmap for compliant, responsible AI aligned with European standards.

Conclusion: If realized, CERTAIN aims to advance regulatory compliance and responsible AI innovation in Europe by integrating ethics, policy, and technical transparency.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has rapidly become a cornerstone technology,
significantly influencing Europe's societal and economic landscapes. However,
the proliferation of AI also raises critical ethical, legal, and regulatory
challenges. The CERTAIN (Certification for Ethical and Regulatory Transparency
in Artificial Intelligence) project addresses these issues by developing a
comprehensive framework that integrates regulatory compliance, ethical
standards, and transparency into AI systems. In this position paper, we outline
the methodological steps for building the core components of this framework.
Specifically, we present: (i) semantic Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) for
structured AI lifecycle management, (ii) ontology-driven data lineage tracking
to ensure traceability and accountability, and (iii) regulatory operations
(RegOps) workflows to operationalize compliance requirements. By implementing
and validating its solutions across diverse pilots, CERTAIN aims to advance
regulatory compliance and to promote responsible AI innovation aligned with
European standards.

### [103] [Judging by Appearances? Auditing and Intervening Vision-Language Models for Bail Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00088)
*Sagnik Basu,Shubham Prakash,Ashish Maruti Barge,Siddharth D Jaiswal,Abhisek Dash,Saptarshi Ghosh,Animesh Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Audits the use of standalone vision-language models for bail prediction and shows poor fairness and high-confidence wrongful bail denials, then improves outcomes via a RAG-based integration of legal precedents and targeted fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the rise of vision-language models, there is a risk that VLMs could be used to predict legal judgments (e.g., bail) based on image data, potentially amplifying bias and causing unjust outcomes. The work aims to audit VLMs' bail-prediction performance and develop interventions to mitigate harms before deployment.

Method: 1) Audit standalone VLMs on bail decision prediction across multiple intersectional groups; 2) Demonstrate high-rate wrongful bail denial with high confidence; 3) Develop interventions: a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to include legal precedents; 4) Fine-tune VLMs with novel schemes and evaluate impact.

Result: Initial VLMs perform poorly and exhibit biased, high-confidence errors (wrongful bail denials); the proposed RAG-including precedents and specialized fine-tuning substantially improve bail-prediction performance across groups.

Conclusion: Interventions that incorporate legal context through RAG and targeted fine-tuning can mitigate harms and improve reliability of VLM-based bail prediction, suggesting a safer path for future deployment and research before real-world use.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively used for legal judgment
prediction tasks based on case reports and crime history. However, with a surge
in the availability of large vision language models (VLMs), legal judgment
prediction systems can now be made to leverage the images of the criminals in
addition to the textual case reports/crime history. Applications built in this
way could lead to inadvertent consequences and be used with malicious intent.
In this work, we run an audit to investigate the efficiency of standalone VLMs
in the bail decision prediction task. We observe that the performance is poor
across multiple intersectional groups and models \textit{wrongly deny bail to
deserving individuals with very high confidence}. We design different
intervention algorithms by first including legal precedents through a RAG
pipeline and then fine-tuning the VLMs using innovative schemes. We demonstrate
that these interventions substantially improve the performance of bail
prediction. Our work paves the way for the design of smarter interventions on
VLMs in the future, before they can be deployed for real-world legal judgment
prediction.

*Songran Bai,Bingzhe Wu,Yiwei Zhang,Chengke Wu,Xiaolong Zheng,Yaze Yuan,Ke Wu,Jianqiang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AuditAgent is a domain-aware multi-agent framework for financial fraud detection that localizes subtle evidence across multi-year disclosures. It uses an expert-annotated dataset from enforcement documents and financial reports, subject-level risk priors, a hybrid retrieval strategy, and specialized agent modules to improve recall and interpretability, outperforming general-purpose agents and establishing a regulatory-grade benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial fraud detection in real-world, regulatory contexts is hindered by dispersed, subtle evidence across long time spans. There is a need for domain-specific reasoning, structured evidence localization, and transparent models that regulators can trust.

Method: Proposes AuditAgent, a multi-agent reasoning framework enhanced with auditing domain expertise. Key components include subject-level risk priors, a hybrid retrieval strategy, and specialized agent modules to locate and aggregate cross-report evidence. An expert-annotated dataset from China Securities Regulatory Commission documents anchors training/evaluation.

Result: Experimental results show substantial improvements in recall and interpretability compared to General-Purpose Agent paradigms, setting a new benchmark for automated financial forensics in real-world regulatory tasks.

Conclusion: Domain-specific reasoning and carefully constructed datasets are crucial for robust, transparent financial fraud detection applicable to regulatory environments; the framework demonstrates practical potential for real-world auditing applications.

Abstract: Financial fraud detection in real-world scenarios presents significant
challenges due to the subtlety and dispersion of evidence across complex,
multi-year financial disclosures. In this work, we introduce a novel
multi-agent reasoning framework AuditAgent, enhanced with auditing domain
expertise, for fine-grained evidence chain localization in financial fraud
cases. Leveraging an expert-annotated dataset constructed from enforcement
documents and financial reports released by the China Securities Regulatory
Commission, our approach integrates subject-level risk priors, a hybrid
retrieval strategy, and specialized agent modules to efficiently identify and
aggregate cross-report evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially outperforms General-Purpose Agent paradigm in both recall
and interpretability, establishing a new benchmark for automated, transparent
financial forensics. Our results highlight the value of domain-specific
reasoning and dataset construction for advancing robust financial fraud
detection in practical, real-world regulatory applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Embodied AI with visual-language models enables real-time adaptive decision-making for drones, demonstrated in Unreal Engine; enables a new class of recovery strategies beyond hand-coded rules, improving resilience and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional hand-coded recovery rules fail to anticipate real-world contingencies; need real-time commonsense, context-aware reasoning for autonomous drones to handle alarms, faults, and unexpected changes.

Method: Leverage embodied AI using large visual-language models to interpret drone surroundings and generate actions; validate in a simulated urban benchmark in Unreal Engine, focusing on sudden maneuvers for safe landings.

Result: Embodied AI enables adaptive recovery pipelines not feasible with hand coding; showed ability to dynamically interpret context and decide maneuvers, improving resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.

Conclusion: Embedding embodied AI in autonomous aerial systems expands design space for recovery/decision pipelines, advancing safety and resilience in real-world deployment.

Abstract: Autonomous drones must often respond to sudden events, such as alarms,
faults, or unexpected changes in their environment, that require immediate and
adaptive decision-making. Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers
hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate
the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete.
Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models,
provide commonsense reasoning to assess context and generate appropriate
actions in real time. We demonstrate this capability in a simulated urban
benchmark in the Unreal Engine, where drones dynamically interpret their
surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings. Our results show
that embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and
decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand,
advancing resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.

*Gabriel de Olim Gaul,Adam Gould,Avinash Kori,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Slot Attention Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning (SAA-CBR) is a neuro-symbolic image classifier that fuses object-centric Slot Attention with Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning, plus several integration strategies (feature fusion, representative-casebase reduction, count-based partial orders, One-vs-Rest for multi-class, and Supported AA-CBR). It achieves competitive results on CLEVR-Hans against baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine neural object-centric perception with symbolic reasoning for explainable, robust image classification, leveraging case-based reasoning and argumentation to support multi-class decisions and interpretability.

Method: Proposes a neuro-symbolic pipeline where Slot Attention provides object-centric features and AA-CBR performs symbolic reasoning on case-based arguments. Explores integration strategies: feature combination; casebase reduction via representative samples; novel count-based partial orders; One-Vs-Rest extension for multi-class; and Supported AA-CBR, a bipolar variant. Evaluated on CLEVR-Hans.

Result: SAA-CBR is an effective classifier on CLEVR-Hans, achieving competitive performance relative to baseline models.

Conclusion: The SAA-CBR framework effectively integrates neural and symbolic components for image classification, with multiple integration strategies showing promise; the approach yields competitive results and highlights the viability of neuro-symbolic case-based reasoning for visual tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Slot Attention Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning (SAA-CBR),
a novel neuro-symbolic pipeline for image classification that integrates
object-centric learning via a neural Slot Attention (SA) component with
symbolic reasoning conducted by Abstract Argumentation for Case-Based Reasoning
(AA-CBR). We explore novel integrations of AA-CBR with the neural component,
including feature combination strategies, casebase reduction via representative
samples, novel count-based partial orders, a One-Vs-Rest strategy for extending
AA-CBR to multi-class classification, and an application of Supported AA-CBR, a
bipolar variant of AA-CBR. We demonstrate that SAA-CBR is an effective
classifier on the CLEVR-Hans datasets, showing competitive performance against
baseline models.

### [107] [Thinkquel: A Model Dedicated to Text-to-dbt Using Synthetic Data and a Span-Aware Objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00186)
*Anni Li,Aria Attar,Paul Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Thinkquel is a fine-tuned NL-to-SQL model that combines a synthetic TS-SQL data pipeline and TS-GRPO training to align token-level learning with sequence-level, execution-based signals, yielding robust, portable, and execution-validated queries with strong execution success and competitive exact-match rates, plus improved training stability in Spider.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the mismatch between token-level objectives and global execution rewards, reduce the cost of large execution-validated corpora, and achieve robust SQL generation across warehouse-specific dialects by enabling a portable intermediate representation and better signal alignment.

Method: Introduce Thinkquel with a novel TS-SQL synthetic data pipeline that uses dbt as a portable intermediate representation, a span-aware reinforcement learning objective, and a Token-Sequence GRPO (TS-GRPO) to bridge token-level training signals with sequence-level execution rewards. Evaluation includes a two-stage SFT curriculum on TS-SQL and experiments on Spider.

Result: On a 500-example TS-SQL test set, Thinkquel (32B) achieves 93.2% execution success and 61.8% exact-result match, with a two-stage SFT curriculum, improving over the base model by 67.2% (exec.) and 44.4% (match). In Spider (14B) experiments, TS-GRPO enhances training stability and speeds convergence of the execution-match reward relative to GRPO and GSPO.

Conclusion: The approach delivers robust, portable NL-to-SQL generation with strong execution validation; TS-GRPO improves training stability and convergence. The method shows promise for cross-dialect reliability, though broader validation across more datasets and real-world pipelines would strengthen claims.

Abstract: Transforming natural-language requests into reliable, production-ready data
transformations remains challenging: correctness depends on precise schema
linking and warehouse-specific SQL dialects, while the strongest supervision
available during training--execution success and result matching--are provided
only at the sequence level. At the same time, assembling large,
execution-validated corpora is costly, and token-level objectives misalign with
these global signals, yielding unstable optimization and limited portability.
We introduce Thinkquel, a fine-tuned model for producing robust, portable, and
execution-validated database queries. Methodologies in Thinkquel integrates a
novel synthetic data pipeline, TS-SQL, that leverages dbt as a portable
intermediate representation with a span-aware reinforcement learning objective,
and Token-Sequence GRPO (TS-GRPO), specifically designed to bridge the gap
between token-level training signals and sequence-level execution rewards when
finetuning LLMs. On the 500-example TS-SQL test set, Thinkquel (32B) reaches
93.2\% execution success and 61.8\% exact-result match with a two-stage SFT
curriculum, improving over the base model by 67.2\% (exec.) and 44.4\% (match).
In Spider (14B) experiments, TS-GRPO increases training stability and speeds
convergence of the execution-match reward relative to GRPO and GSPO.

### [108] [DualTune: Decoupled Fine-Tuning for On-Device Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00229)
*Rohan Kadekodi,Zhan Jin,Keisuke Kamahori,Yile Gu,Sean Khatiri,Noah H. Bayindirli,Sergey Gorbunov,Baris Kasikci*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Decoupled fine-tuning with specialized LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-argument generation, plus a DualTune inference framework, enables on-device tool calling with hierarchical orchestration. It significantly improves tool-call accuracy on local LLMs (46% in MCP-Bench) and outperforms larger and similarly sized baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy-preserving, cost-effective on-device LLM inference is desirable, but local models lag behind frontier models in tool calling due to the need to select from many tools and to generate complex argument structures. This work motivates decoupling tool selection from argument generation to improve accuracy and efficiency on-device.

Method: Introduce decoupled fine-tuning: use LoRA adapters dedicated to tool selection and to tool-specific argument generation, trained with separate loss masking for each subtask. Then propose DualTune: an inference framework that dynamically loads the appropriate adapters to perform tool calls on local devices, splitting tool-call generation into selection and argument generation, and using hierarchical orchestration to limit the number of tools considered.

Result: Empirical results on MCP-Bench show that a Qwen-2.5-7B model trained with decoupled fine-tuning achieves a 46% improvement in tool calling accuracy over the base model, and outperforms other local reasoning, non-reasoning, and fine-tuned baselines of similar size and many models twice as large in most cases.

Conclusion: Decoupled fine-tuning coupled with DualTune enables effective, efficient, privacy-preserving on-device tool calling by separating the subtasks and dynamically loading specialized adapters, achieving substantial accuracy gains over comparable baselines.

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as agentic orchestrators has
revolutionized task automation, but the need for privacy-preserving,
cost-effective solutions demands on-device inference capabilities. However,
local LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool
calling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and
accurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a
methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks:
tool selection and argument generation. We propose "decoupled fine-tuning", a
novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated
LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using
separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present
DualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using
decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of
local models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation
step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the
corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune
implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required
for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that
the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool
calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local
reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases,
and models that are 2x larger, in most cases.

### [109] [MAGIC-MASK: Multi-Agent Guided Inter-Agent Collaboration with Mask-Based Explainability for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00274)
*Maisha Maliha,Dean Hougen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAGIC-MASK introduces a multi-agent, mask-based explainability framework that extends perturbation-based explanations to MARL via inter-agent collaboration, integrating PPO, adaptive exploration, and KL regularization to improve explanation fidelity and learning efficiency across single- and multi-agent benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explainability for Deep Reinforcement Learning remains challenging, with existing methods like StateMask suffering from high computational cost, limited exploration coverage, and poor adaptability to multi-agent settings. A scalable, transferable, and more efficient explainability framework is needed for safety-critical and multi-agent environments.

Method: MAGIC-MASK builds a unified mathematical formalism around trajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and KL-divergence regularization to produce localized saliency-based masks. It enables lightweight inter-agent collaboration by sharing masked state information and peer experiences, while integrating Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and adaptive epsilon-greedy exploration to guide mask discovery and policy learning.

Result: The framework demonstrates improved fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy robustness compared to state-of-the-art baselines on both single-agent and multi-agent benchmarks (e.g., a multi-agent highway driving environment and Google Research Football), with explanations that are localized, probabilistic, and transferable across agents.

Conclusion: By generalizing explainability from single-agent to multi-agent systems within a rigorous trajectory-perturbation and information-sharing formalism, MAGIC-MASK enables faster, more robust learning and interpretable explanations that transfer across agents and tasks, supporting safer deployment in multi-agent and safety-critical domains.

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making process of Deep Reinforcement Learning
agents remains a key challenge for deploying these systems in safety-critical
and multi-agent environments. While prior explainability methods like
StateMask, have advanced the identification of critical states, they remain
limited by computational cost, exploration coverage, and lack of adaptation to
multi-agent settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
mathematically grounded framework, MAGIC-MASK (Multi-Agent Guided Inter-agent
Collaboration with Mask-Based Explainability for Reinforcement Learning), that
extends perturbation-based explanation to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.
Our method integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy
exploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration to share masked state
information and peer experience. This collaboration enables each agent to
perform saliency-guided masking and share reward-based insights with peers,
reducing the time required for critical state discovery, improving explanation
fidelity, and leading to faster and more robust learning. The core novelty of
our approach lies in generalizing explainability from single-agent to
multi-agent systems through a unified mathematical formalism built on
trajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and Kullback-Leibler
divergence regularization. This framework yields localized, interpretable
explanations grounded in probabilistic modeling and multi-agent Markov decision
processes. We validate our framework on both single-agent and multi-agent
benchmarks, including a multi-agent highway driving environment and Google
Research Football, demonstrating that MAGIC-MASK consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy
robustness while offering interpretable and transferable explanations.

### [110] [ICL Optimized Fragility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00300)
*Serena Gomez Wannaz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ICL guides yield an “optimized fragility” trade-off: strong gains on general knowledge (91–99%), but degraded performance on complex reasoning tasks (riddles 10–43% vs baseline 43%), with no significant effect on a math Olympiad problem; results imply trade-offs between efficiency and flexible reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether in-context learning (ICL) guides alter cross-domain cognitive abilities and reveal potential efficiency-vs-reasoning trade-offs across multiple knowledge domains.

Method: Six GPT-OSS:20b variants (one baseline and five ICL configurations: simple, chain-of-thought, random, appended text, symbolic language). 840 tests spanning general knowledge, logic riddles, and a mathematical olympiad. An ANOVA revealed significant effects (p < 0.001) across ICL variants.

Result: ICL models achieved 91–99% accuracy on general knowledge tasks; riddles performance dropped to 10–43% compared with 43% for the baseline. No significant differences observed on the Olympiad problem (p = 0.2173). An overall phenomenon termed 'optimized fragility' was identified.

Conclusion: ICL guides induce systematic trade-offs between computation efficiency on easy tasks and reasoning flexibility on harder tasks. These cross-domain effects have important implications for LLM deployment and AI safety.

Abstract: ICL guides are known to improve task-specific performance, but their impact
on cross-domain cognitive abilities remains unexplored. This study examines how
ICL guides affect reasoning across different knowledge domains using six
variants of the GPT-OSS:20b model: one baseline model and five ICL
configurations (simple, chain-of-thought, random, appended text, and symbolic
language). The models were subjected to 840 tests spanning general knowledge
questions, logic riddles, and a mathematical olympiad problem. Statistical
analysis (ANOVA) revealed significant behavioral modifications (p less than
0.001) across ICL variants, demonstrating a phenomenon termed "optimized
fragility." ICL models achieved 91%-99% accuracy on general knowledge tasks
while showing degraded performance on complex reasoning problems, with accuracy
dropping to 10-43% on riddles compared to 43% for the baseline model. Notably,
no significant differences emerged on the olympiad problem (p=0.2173),
suggesting that complex mathematical reasoning remains unaffected by ICL
optimization. These findings indicate that ICL guides create systematic
trade-offs between efficiency and reasoning flexibility, with important
implications for LLM deployment and AI safety.

### [111] [BiasBusters: Uncovering and Mitigating Tool Selection Bias in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00307)
*Thierry Blankenstein,Jialin Yu,Zixuan Li,Vassilis Plachouras,Sunando Sengupta,Philip Torr,Yarin Gal,Alasdair Paren,Adel Bibi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A benchmark reveals tool-selection bias in LLM-powered agents using external tools. Bias arises from metadata and pretraining exposure, with models favoring a single provider or earlier-listed tools. A mitigation using subset filtering followed by uniform sampling reduces bias while maintaining task coverage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure fair deployment of tool-augmented LLMs by preventing systematic favoritism among tool providers and maintaining competitive neutrality in tool selection.

Method: Build a benchmark with diverse tool categories, each containing multiple functionally equivalent tools. Evaluate seven models. Conduct controlled experiments on tool features, metadata (name, description, parameters), and pre-training exposure to assess drivers of bias. Analyze predictors of tool choice and test a lightweight mitigation that filters to a relevant subset and samples uniformly.

Result: Unfairness is observed: models can fixate on a single provider or disproportionately prefer earlier-listed tools. Semantic alignment between queries and metadata strongly predicts choice. Perturbing descriptions shifts selections. Repeated pre-training exposure to a single endpoint amplifies bias. Mitigation by first filtering to a relevant subset and then sampling uniformly reduces bias and preserves task coverage.

Conclusion: Tool-selection bias is a key obstacle for fair deployment of tool-augmented LLMs. A simple, practical mitigation can reduce bias without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Agents backed by large language models (LLMs) often rely on external tools
drawn from marketplaces where multiple providers offer functionally equivalent
options. This raises a critical point concerning fairness: if selection is
systematically biased, it can degrade user experience and distort competition
by privileging some providers over others. We introduce a benchmark of diverse
tool categories, each containing multiple functionally equivalent tools, to
evaluate tool-selection bias. Using this benchmark, we test seven models and
show that unfairness exists with models either fixating on a single provider or
disproportionately preferring earlier-listed tools in context. To investigate
the origins of this bias, we conduct controlled experiments examining tool
features, metadata (name, description, parameters), and pre-training exposure.
We find that: (1) semantic alignment between queries and metadata is the
strongest predictor of choice; (2) perturbing descriptions significantly shifts
selections; and (3) repeated pre-training exposure to a single endpoint
amplifies bias. Finally, we propose a lightweight mitigation that first filters
the candidate tools to a relevant subset and then samples uniformly, reducing
bias while preserving good task coverage. Our findings highlight tool-selection
bias as a key obstacle for the fair deployment of tool-augmented LLMs.

### [112] [When Hallucination Costs Millions: Benchmarking AI Agents in High-Stakes Adversarial Financial Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00332)
*Zeshi Dai,Zimo Peng,Zerui Cheng,Ryan Yihe Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAIA reveals significant capability gaps in current AI models under adversarial, high-stakes conditions; tool augmentation helps but remains far from human performance, and models exhibit systematic, unreliable tool selection, with Pass@k masking dangerous trial-and-error. Adversarial robustness is framed as essential for trustworthy AI autonomy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world AI deployment occurs in environments where misinformation is weaponized and errors are irreversible. Existing benchmarks focus on controlled task completion and overlook adversarial, high-stakes resilience. CAIA targets this gap using crypto markets (where exploits caused billions) to stress-test AI decision-making.

Method: Evaluate 17 models on 178 time-anchored tasks in crypto-market scenarios requiring truth-vs-manipulation discrimination, navigation of fragmented information, and irreversible financial decisions under adversarial pressure. Compare baseline and tool-augmented performance, analyze tool-choice behavior, and assess metrics like Pass@k.

Result: Frontier models achieve ~28% accuracy without tools. Instrumented tools boost performance to ~67.4% but still fall short of ~80% human baseline, even with unlimited professional resources. A systematic tool-selection problem is observed: models prefer unreliable web search over authoritative data, falling for SEO and social-media manipulation. Correct answers accessible via specialized tools are underutilized. Pass@k metrics obscure dangerous trial-and-error behavior in autonomous deployment.

Conclusion: Adversarial robustness is a prerequisite for trustworthy AI autonomy. The benchmark indicates current models, despite strong reasoning, are unprepared for environments with active opposition, with implications extending to cybersecurity and content moderation. CAIA, with contamination controls and ongoing updates, seeks to drive development of resilient, adversarially robust AI systems.

Abstract: We present CAIA, a benchmark exposing a critical blind spot in AI evaluation:
the inability of state-of-the-art models to operate in adversarial, high-stakes
environments where misinformation is weaponized and errors are irreversible.
While existing benchmarks measure task completion in controlled settings,
real-world deployment demands resilience against active deception. Using crypto
markets as a testbed where $30 billion was lost to exploits in 2024, we
evaluate 17 models on 178 time-anchored tasks requiring agents to distinguish
truth from manipulation, navigate fragmented information landscapes, and make
irreversible financial decisions under adversarial pressure.
  Our results reveal a fundamental capability gap: without tools, even frontier
models achieve only 28% accuracy on tasks junior analysts routinely handle.
Tool augmentation improves performance but plateaus at 67.4% versus 80% human
baseline, despite unlimited access to professional resources. Most critically,
we uncover a systematic tool selection catastrophe: models preferentially
choose unreliable web search over authoritative data, falling for SEO-optimized
misinformation and social media manipulation. This behavior persists even when
correct answers are directly accessible through specialized tools, suggesting
foundational limitations rather than knowledge gaps. We also find that Pass@k
metrics mask dangerous trial-and-error behavior for autonomous deployment.
  The implications extend beyond crypto to any domain with active adversaries,
e.g. cybersecurity, content moderation, etc. We release CAIA with contamination
controls and continuous updates, establishing adversarial robustness as a
necessary condition for trustworthy AI autonomy. The benchmark reveals that
current models, despite impressive reasoning scores, remain fundamentally
unprepared for environments where intelligence must survive active opposition.

### [113] [Hierarchical Reasoning Model: A Critical Supplementary Material](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00355)
*Renee Ge,Qianli Liao,Tomaso Poggio*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A critical review of Hierarchical Reasoning Models (latent-space recurrent reasoning for transformers) showing variants that beat prior Sudoku-Extreme and Maze-Hard results; highlights early-stage status and directions for future work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address perceived limitations of transformers in logical reasoning by exploring latent-space recurrent reasoning architectures, evaluating the design choices of HRM models, and pushing forward improvements.

Method: Conduct a critical literature review of the HRM class, analyze key design choices, present and test new variants, and empirically evaluate on Sudoku-Extreme and Maze-Hard tasks, comparing with earlier reports.

Result: Proposed variants outperform prior results on Sudoku-Extreme and Maze-Hard; the study yields surprising observations and indicates promising directions, while noting the field remains in an early stage.

Conclusion: Hierarchical/latent-space recurrent reasoning for transformers shows promise but requires broader analysis and more systematic investigation to establish robustness and generality.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language
processing and related domains, as they largely focus on sequential,
autoregressive next-token prediction tasks. Yet, they struggle in logical
reasoning, not necessarily because of a fundamental limitation of these models,
but possibly due to the lack of exploration of more creative uses, such as
latent space and recurrent reasoning. An emerging exploration in this direction
is the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (Wang et al., 2025), which introduces a
novel type of recurrent reasoning in the latent space of transformers,
achieving remarkable performance on a wide range of 2D reasoning tasks. Despite
the promising results, this line of models is still at an early stage and calls
for in-depth investigation. In this work, we perform a critical review on this
class of models, examine key design choices and present intriguing variants
that achieve significantly better performance on the Sudoku-Extreme and
Maze-Hard tasks than previously reported. Our results also raise surprising
observations and intriguing directions for further research.

*Kaiwen Yu,Mengying Sun,Zhijin Qin,Xiaodong Xu,Ping Yang,Yue Xiao,Gang Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A semantic-driven AI agent communication framework with three enabling techniques—semantic adaptation transmission, semantic lightweight transmission, and semantic self-evolution control—that collectively improve convergence speed and robustness in multi-agent networks, with distributed hierarchical optimization outperforming conventional decision-making schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI agents increasingly substitute humans in perception, decision-making, and collaboration, there is a need for communication that conveys task-relevant meaning efficiently under dynamic environments and limited resources.

Method: Propose a semantic-driven AI agent communication framework and three techniques: (1) semantic adaptation transmission using fine-tuning with real or generative samples to adapt models to varying environments; (2) semantic lightweight transmission employing pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling to reduce model complexity and computational burden on edge agents; (3) semantic self-evolution control with distributed hierarchical decision-making to optimize multi-dimensional resources for robust multi-agent collaboration in dynamic settings. Evaluation via simulations comparing against conventional schemes.

Result: The approach yields faster convergence and stronger robustness; the distributed hierarchical optimization substantially outperforms traditional decision-making schemes.

Conclusion: Semantic-driven AI agent communication networks can enable robust, efficient multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environments; the framework’s techniques collectively enhance adaptability, efficiency, and decision quality, suggesting strong potential for deployment in AI agent networks.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of intelligent services, communication targets are
shifting from humans to artificial intelligent (AI) agents, which require new
paradigms to enable real-time perception, decision-making, and collaboration.
Semantic communication, which conveys task-relevant meaning rather than raw
data, offers a promising solution. However, its practical deployment remains
constrained by dynamic environments and limited resources. To address these
issues, this article proposes a semantic-driven AI agent communication
framework and develops three enabling techniques. First, semantic adaptation
transmission applies fine-tuning with real or generative samples to efficiently
adapt models to varying environments. Second, semantic lightweight transmission
incorporates pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling to reduce
model complexity and alleviate computational burden on edge agents. Third,
semantic self-evolution control employs distributed hierarchical
decision-making to optimize multi-dimensional resources, enabling robust
multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environments. Simulation results show that
the proposed solutions achieve faster convergence and stronger robustness,
while the proposed distributed hierarchical optimization method significantly
outperforms conventional decision-making schemes, highlighting its potential
for AI agent communication networks.

*Dadi Guo,Tianyi Zhou,Dongrui Liu,Chen Qian,Qihan Ren,Shuai Shao,Zhiyuan Fan,Yi R. Fung,Kun Wang,Linfeng Zhang,Jing Shao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TRACE evolves tasks from existing benchmarks by having agents freely explore and reproduce higher-difficulty tasks, recording validatable trajectories. It increases task complexity while ensuring reproducibility, shifting benchmarks toward dynamic, self-evolving evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agent benchmarks quickly saturate as models improve, making evaluations less informative. There is a need for sustainable, reproducible, and progressively challenging benchmarks that can document agent trajectories for validation.

Method: Three-stage TRACE process: (1) evolutionary proposal mining to generate higher-difficulty task proposals via exploration and divergent thinking; (2) problem formation and free exploration where feasible task candidates are created and agents freely explore them while recording execution trajectories; (3) multi-level validation ensuring evolved tasks come with validatable and reproducible trajectories.

Result: Applied to GAIA benchmark, TRACE consistently increases task complexity while improving the reliability of correctness via validatable execution trajectories.

Conclusion: TRACE represents a paradigm shift from static benchmarks to dynamic, self-evolving evaluation systems, offering a sustainable and challenging runway for advancing agent development.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and agent system designs have
empowered agents with unprecedented levels of capability. However, existing
agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly
developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent
abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based
Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE)
framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and
encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher
difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework
proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task
evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2)
problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into
feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while
recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which
ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible
trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE
framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability
of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. This work marks a
paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic,
self-evolving evaluation systems, providing a sustainable and challenging
runway for agent development.

*Sarvesh Soni,Dina Demner-Fushman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Automated evaluation of patient-facing AI health answers can closely match expert judgments when anchored to clinician-provided references, enabling scalable comparison across many AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Human expert review for free-text AI health responses is slow and labor-intensive; need scalable, reliable evaluation for hospitalization-related patient questions.

Method: Systematic study with 100 patient cases, 28 AI systems generating 2,800 responses; assessed across three dimensions (answers the question; uses appropriate clinical note evidence; uses general medical knowledge); metrics anchored by clinician-authored reference answers; compared automated rankings to expert ratings.

Result: Automated rankings closely matched expert ratings, indicating feasibility of scalable automated evaluation when metrics are well designed and anchored.

Conclusion: Carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI systems and support patient-clinician communication.

Abstract: Automated approaches to answer patient-posed health questions are rising, but
selecting among systems requires reliable evaluation. The current gold standard
for evaluating the free-text artificial intelligence (AI) responses--human
expert review--is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability. Automated
metrics are promising yet variably aligned with human judgments and often
context-dependent. To address the feasibility of automating the evaluation of
AI responses to hospitalization-related questions posed by patients, we
conducted a large systematic study of evaluation approaches. Across 100 patient
cases, we collected responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total) and assessed them
along three dimensions: whether a system response (1) answers the question, (2)
appropriately uses clinical note evidence, and (3) uses general medical
knowledge. Using clinician-authored reference answers to anchor metrics,
automated rankings closely matched expert ratings. Our findings suggest that
carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI
systems and support patient-clinician communication.

### [117] [Expandable Decision-Making States for Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning in Soccer Tactical Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00480)
*Kenjiro Ide,Taiga Someya,Kohei Kawaguchi,Keisuke Fujii*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS) for soccer agent models that fuse relational tactical context with action masking to yield interpretable, cross-dataset robust policies, improving predictive performance and exploratory insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Invasion sports present high-dimensional, coupled state spaces; traditional rule-based methods are intuitive but limited; ML models often lack interpretable agent representations and cross-source robustness; need human-aligned, robust agent models.

Method: Define EDMS: semantically enriched representation with relational variables (e.g., scoring of space, pass opportunities, marking pressure) and action masking to assign distinct decision sets to on-ball/off-ball agents; learn value functions/policies that map to tactical concepts rather than raw coordinates; optimize to reduce action-prediction loss and TD error; integrate open-source library for cross-dataset evaluation; qualitative Q-value visualizations.

Result: Compared to baselines, EDMS with action masking reduced action-prediction loss and TD error; qualitative analyses show highlighting of high-risk/high-reward patterns; successful cross-provider evaluation via open-source library and compatibility with multiple datasets.

Conclusion: EDMS offers interpretable, robust agent-level tactical models aligned with play rules; relational features and action masking enable mapping to human-understandable concepts and improved predictive performance; supports reproducible research across datasets.

Abstract: Invasion team sports such as soccer produce a high-dimensional, strongly
coupled state space as many players continuously interact on a shared field,
challenging quantitative tactical analysis. Traditional rule-based analyses are
intuitive, while modern predictive machine learning models often perform
pattern-matching without explicit agent representations. The problem we address
is how to build player-level agent models from data, whose learned values and
policies are both tactically interpretable and robust across heterogeneous data
sources. Here, we propose Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS), a
semantically enriched state representation that augments raw positions and
velocities with relational variables (e.g., scoring of space, pass, and score),
combined with an action-masking scheme that gives on-ball and off-ball agents
distinct decision sets. Compared to prior work, EDMS maps learned value
functions and action policies to human-interpretable tactical concepts (e.g.,
marking pressure, passing lanes, ball accessibility) instead of raw coordinate
features, and aligns agent choices with the rules of play. In the experiments,
EDMS with action masking consistently reduced both action-prediction loss and
temporal-difference (TD) error compared to the baseline. Qualitative case
studies and Q-value visualizations further indicate that EDMS highlights
high-risk, high-reward tactical patterns (e.g., fast counterattacks and
defensive breakthroughs). We also integrated our approach into an open-source
library and demonstrated compatibility with multiple commercial and open
datasets, enabling cross-provider evaluation and reproducible experiments.

### [118] [Rethinking Reward Models for Multi-Domain Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00492)
*Dong Bok Lee,Seanie Lee,Sangwoo Park,Minki Kang,Jinheon Baek,Dongki Kim,Dominik Wagner,Jiongdao Jin,Heejun Lee,Tobias Bocklet,Jinyu Wang,Jingjing Fu,Sung Ju Hwang,Jiang Bia,Lei Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Across 14 domains, four reward-model variants (DisORM/GenORM vs DisPRM/GenPRM) were evaluated; generative outcome model (GenORM) was most robust, while generative PRM underperformed; discriminative variants performed similarly, with ORM on par with PRM. This challenges the view that stepwise, fine-grained scoring always improves verification and supports outcome-based generation for multi-domain deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test-time scaling of LLMs relies on reward models to verify reasoning. Conventional wisdom favors stepwise, discriminative reward models (PRMs/ORMs) due to assumed superiority in guiding complex reasoning. This study seeks to systematically evaluate this across diverse domains to assess generalizability.

Method: Unified evaluation of four reward-model variants: discriminative ORM/PRM (DisORM, DisPRM) and generative ORM/PRM (GenORM, GenPRM) across 14 diverse domains. Analysis includes theoretical reasoning about error accumulation in step-wise scoring and empirical results, with attention to long reasoning trajectories and self-correction.

Result: DisORM ≈ DisPRM; GenPRM underperforms; GenORM consistently yields significant gains across all domains. Step-wise PRM/ORM scoring inherits label noise from LLM auto-labeling and struggles with long reasoning, causing error accumulation as reasoning length grows.

Conclusion: Generative outcome verification (GenORM) is more robust for multi-domain deployment than discriminative or stepwise reward models. This challenges the belief that finer-grained supervision is always better and suggests prioritizing GenORM for scalable, cross-domain LLM evaluation. The authors provide code and data publicly to facilitate replication.

Abstract: The reliability of large language models (LLMs) during test-time scaling is
often assessed with \emph{external verifiers} or \emph{reward models} that
distinguish correct reasoning from flawed logic. Prior work generally assumes
that process reward models (PRMs), which score every intermediate reasoning
step, outperform outcome reward models (ORMs) that assess only the final
answer. This view is based mainly on evidence from narrow, math-adjacent
domains. We present the first unified evaluation of four reward model variants,
discriminative ORM and PRM (\DisORM, \DisPRM) and generative ORM and PRM
(\GenORM, \GenPRM), across 14 diverse domains. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
we find that (i) \DisORM performs on par with \DisPRM, (ii) \GenPRM is not
competitive, and (iii) overall, \GenORM is the most robust, yielding
significant and consistent gains across every tested domain. We attribute this
to PRM-style stepwise scoring, which inherits label noise from LLM
auto-labeling and has difficulty evaluating long reasoning trajectories,
including those involving self-correcting reasoning. Our theoretical analysis
shows that step-wise aggregation compounds errors as reasoning length grows,
and our empirical observations confirm this effect. These findings challenge
the prevailing assumption that fine-grained supervision is always better and
support generative outcome verification for multi-domain deployment. We
publicly release our code, datasets, and checkpoints at
\href{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}{\underline{\small\texttt{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}}}
to facilitate future research in multi-domain settings.

### [119] [VIRTUE: Visual-Interactive Text-Image Universal Embedder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00523)
*Wei-Yao Wang,Kazuya Tateishi,Qiyu Wu,Shusuke Takahashi,Yuki Mitsufuji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes VIRTUE, a Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder that endows embedding models with visual-interactive capabilities by incorporating segmentation prompts to localize regions, improving both universal embedding tasks and segmentation-caption retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current embedding models lack visual-interactive grounding to specify regions of interest; integrating segmentation/prompts can enrich entity-level information and localized grounding, complementing global representations in vision-language embeddings.

Method: Extend segmentation models with visual prompts that pinpoint image regions, integrated with a vision-language embedder to learn representations; evaluate on a large Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark (1M samples) and across 36 universal MMEB tasks plus 5 visual-interactive SCaR tasks.

Result: VIRTUE achieves state-of-the-art performance across 36 MMEB tasks (3.1%–8.5% gains) and 5 visual-interactive SCaR tasks (15.2%–20.3% gains).

Conclusion: Introducing visual interactions into embedding models enables precise, region-aware grounding and entity-level information within images, enhancing representation learning and broad applicability in both traditional embedding and interactive retrieval tasks.

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning models have demonstrated successful
operation across complex tasks, and the integration of vision-language models
(VLMs) has further enabled embedding models with instruction-following
capabilities. However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive
capabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding
box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their
human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual
interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of
user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn
entity-level information within images to complement their global
representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends
the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the
realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process
visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling
the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To
evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale
Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples
that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a
specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a
state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal
MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.

*Leopold Müller,Joshua Holstein,Sarah Bause,Gerhard Satzger,Niklas Kühl*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 15 data quality dimensions for RAG systems across four stages (data extraction, data transformation, prompt/search, generation) derived from 16 interviews; highlights need for new DQ measures, front-loaded quality management, and dynamic, pipeline-spanning quality control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG combines enterprise knowledge with LLMs; static data quality (DQ) frameworks fail to address the dynamic, multi-stage data handling in RAG; improving DQ coverage can improve reliability and trust in AI outputs.

Method: Qualitative study based on 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners from leading IT service companies; qualitative content analysis; inductive derivation of 15 DQ dimensions distributed across four processing stages (data extraction, data transformation, prompt & search, generation).

Result: Identified 15 distinct DQ dimensions; several are novel relative to traditional DQ frameworks and primarily affect early stages of the RAG pipeline; DQ issues propagate through the pipeline, requiring a dynamic, stage-aware quality management approach.

Conclusion: To support RAG, DQ frameworks must be extended with new, stage-aware dimensions; front-loaded quality controls are essential; quality management must adapt as data flows through the pipeline and issues propagate downstream.

Abstract: Organizations increasingly adopt Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
enhance Large Language Models with enterprise-specific knowledge. However,
current data quality (DQ) frameworks have been primarily developed for static
datasets, and only inadequately address the dynamic, multi-stage nature of RAG
systems. This study aims to develop DQ dimensions for this new type of AI-based
systems. We conduct 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of leading
IT service companies. Through a qualitative content analysis, we inductively
derive 15 distinct DQ dimensions across the four processing stages of RAG
systems: data extraction, data transformation, prompt & search, and generation.
Our findings reveal that (1) new dimensions have to be added to traditional DQ
frameworks to also cover RAG contexts; (2) these new dimensions are
concentrated in early RAG steps, suggesting the need for front-loaded quality
management strategies, and (3) DQ issues transform and propagate through the
RAG pipeline, necessitating a dynamic, step-aware approach to quality
management.

### [121] [Toward Safer Diffusion Language Models: Discovery and Mitigation of Priming Vulnerability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00565)
*Shojiro Yamabe,Jun Sakuma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Diffusion language models have a critical vulnerability: if an affirmative token appears at an intermediate denoising step, subsequent iterations can steer the output toward harmful content, bypassing safety guardrails. The authors propose a DLM-specific safety-alignment method targeting contaminated intermediate states, achieving substantial mitigation with little task-performance cost and improved robustness against jailbreaks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and mitigate safety risks unique to diffusion language models (DLMs), where iterative denoising and bidirectional conditioning could expose new jailbreak paths not present in autoregressive LMs.

Method: 1) Analyze how intermediate affirmative tokens steer DLM outputs toward harmful responses; show that existing optimization-based jailbreaks can succeed on DLMs. 2) Propose a safety-alignment training regime tailored to DLMs that enables safe responses from contaminated intermediate states. 3) Evaluate impact on task performance and resistance to jailbreaks.

Result: The proposed DLM-specific safety-alignment method significantly reduces vulnerability to intermediate-state jailbreaks with minimal degradation to task performance and improves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks.

Conclusion: DLM safety requires architecture-specific strategies. The paper demonstrates a practical mitigation for the identified vulnerability and motivates further research into DLM-focused safety techniques.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) generate tokens in parallel through
iterative denoising, which can reduce latency and enable bidirectional
conditioning. However, the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit
this inference mechanism are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal that
DLMs have a critical vulnerability stemming from their iterative denoising
process and propose a countermeasure. Specifically, our investigation shows
that if an affirmative token for a harmful query appears at an intermediate
step, subsequent denoising can be steered toward a harmful response even in
aligned models. As a result, simply injecting such affirmative tokens can
readily bypass the safety guardrails. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
vulnerability allows existing optimization-based jailbreak attacks to succeed
on DLMs. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel safety alignment method
tailored to DLMs that trains models to generate safe responses from
contaminated intermediate states that contain affirmative tokens. Our
experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly mitigates the
vulnerability with minimal impact on task performance. Furthermore, our method
improves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks. Our work
underscores the need for DLM-specific safety research.

*Minki Kang,Wei-Ning Chen,Dongge Han,Huseyin A. Inan,Lukas Wutschitz,Yanzhi Chen,Robert Sim,Saravan Rajmohan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACON is a unified framework that optimizes long-context compression for LLM agents by learning compression guidelines in natural language space, with distillation to smaller models, yielding memory savings while preserving task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long context lengths in agentic tasks incur high memory/compute costs and hinder long-horizon reasoning; existing compression work focused on short tasks. Need a general approach to compress both observations and histories.

Method: Propose ACON: learn compression guidelines using paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed fails; LLMs analyze failure causes and update guidelines; compress both environment observations and interaction histories; distill the optimized LLM compressor into smaller models.

Result: Significant memory/token reduction (26-54% peak tokens) with minimal performance loss; preserves >95% accuracy when distilled to smaller compressors; improves performance of smaller LMs on long-horizon tasks by up to 46%; validated on AppWorld, OfficeBench, Multi-objective QA.

Conclusion: ACON provides a general, end-to-end approach to context optimization for agentic LLMs, enabling efficient long-horizon reasoning and tool use, with practical gains via distillation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic,
real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective
tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length,
as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This
expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior
work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow
applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified
framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and
interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON
leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given
paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails,
capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is
updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM
compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module.
Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON
reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task
performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller
compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46%
performance improvement.

### [123] [HARPA: A Testability-Driven, Literature-Grounded Framework for Research Ideation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00620)
*Rosni Vasu,Peter Jansen,Pao Siangliulue,Cristina Sarasua,Abraham Bernstein,Peter Clark,Bhavana Dalvi Mishra*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HARPA is an adaptive ideation system for automated scientific discovery that organizes literature trends, hypothesis-design exploration, and gap-based refinement to produce testable, grounded hypotheses, aided by a reward model that improves with prior outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for hypotheses that are both testable and grounded in scientific literature, and for ideation tools that adapt to prior experimental outcomes rather than remaining static.

Method: HARPA uses literature mining to identify emerging trends, explores hypothesis design spaces, and converges on precise, testable hypotheses by pinpointing research gaps and justifying design choices. It is evaluated against a strong baseline AI-researcher, tested with the ASD agent CodeScientist, and includes learning a reward model from prior experimental outcomes to score new hypotheses.

Result: Compared with baseline, HARPA-driven proposals show similar qualitative quality but significantly higher feasibility (+0.78, p<0.05, bootstrap) and groundedness (+0.85, p<0.01, bootstrap) on a 10-point scale. With CodeScientist ASD agent, HARPA produced more successful executions (20 vs. 11) and fewer failures (16 vs. 21) out of 40 trials. A learned reward model yields ≈28% absolute gain over the untrained scorer.

Conclusion: HARPA advances AI-driven scientific discovery by delivering adaptive, outcome-informed hypothesis ideation that improves feasibility and groundedness, and demonstrates stronger alignment between expert feasibility judgments and actual execution success.

Abstract: While there has been a surge of interest in automated scientific discovery
(ASD), especially with the emergence of LLMs, it remains challenging for tools
to generate hypotheses that are both testable and grounded in the scientific
literature. Additionally, existing ideation tools are not adaptive to prior
experimental outcomes. We developed HARPA to address these challenges by
incorporating the ideation workflow inspired by human researchers. HARPA first
identifies emerging research trends through literature mining, then explores
hypothesis design spaces, and finally converges on precise, testable hypotheses
by pinpointing research gaps and justifying design choices. Our evaluations
show that HARPA-generated hypothesis-driven research proposals perform
comparably to a strong baseline AI-researcher across most qualitative
dimensions (e.g., specificity, novelty, overall quality), but achieve
significant gains in feasibility(+0.78, p$<0.05$, bootstrap) and groundedness
(+0.85, p$<0.01$, bootstrap) on a 10-point Likert scale. When tested with the
ASD agent (CodeScientist), HARPA produced more successful executions (20 vs. 11
out of 40) and fewer failures (16 vs. 21 out of 40), showing that expert
feasibility judgments track with actual execution success. Furthermore, to
simulate how researchers continuously refine their understanding of what
hypotheses are both testable and potentially interesting from experience, HARPA
learns a reward model that scores new hypotheses based on prior experimental
outcomes, achieving approx. a 28\% absolute gain over HARPA's untrained
baseline scorer. Together, these methods represent a step forward in the field
of AI-driven scientific discovery.

### [124] [Is Model Editing Built on Sand? Revealing Its Illusory Success and Fragile Foundation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00625)
*Wei Liu,Haomei Xu,Bingqing Liu,Zhiying Deng,Haozhao Wang,Jun Wang,Ruixuan Li,Yee Whye Teh,Wee Sun Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Current model-editing methods for LLMs appear fragile and often rely on shortcuts, failing under negation tests; calls for rethinking evaluation and foundations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs encode outdated or incorrect knowledge; editing aims to update/delete/forget safely, but the literature may overstate success due to weak evaluation lacking negative examples; robust evaluation is needed for alignment and safety.

Method: Systematically develop a new evaluation suite including negation and negative examples; assess state-of-the-art editing methods against these tests to reveal reliance on shortcuts vs. genuine semantic updates.

Result: State-of-the-art editing approaches fail under negation/negative queries; evidence suggests updates rely on shortcuts rather than real semantic changes, casting doubt on claimed robustness.

Conclusion: Urgent reevaluation of model-editing foundations; promote evaluations that test true semantic integration with negative examples; avoid overfitting to shortcut-driven metrics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) inevitably encode outdated or incorrect
knowledge. Updating, deleting, and forgetting such knowledge is important for
alignment, safety, and other issues. To address this issue, model editing has
emerged as a promising paradigm: by precisely editing a small subset of
parameters such that a specific fact is updated while preserving other
knowledge. Despite its great success reported in previous papers, we find the
apparent reliability of editing rests on a fragile foundation and the current
literature is largely driven by illusory success. The fundamental goal of
steering the model's output toward a target with minimal modification would
encourage exploiting hidden shortcuts, rather than utilizing real semantics.
This problem directly challenges the feasibility of the current model editing
literature at its very foundation, as shortcuts are inherently at odds with
robust knowledge integration. Coincidentally, this issue has long been obscured
by evaluation frameworks that lack the design of negative examples. To uncover
it, we systematically develop a suite of new evaluation methods. Strikingly, we
find that state-of-the-art approaches collapse even under the simplest negation
queries. Our empirical evidence shows that editing is likely to be based on
shortcuts rather than full semantics, calling for an urgent reconsideration of
the very basis of model editing before further advancements can be meaningfully
pursued.

Motivation: Diffusion models offer strong probabilistic trajectory predictions but are large and slow, limiting real-world deployment in AVs/ITS. The work aims to enable real-time, resource-efficient probabilistic forecasting without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD) transfers knowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student across distillation iterations, jointly reducing sampling steps and model size. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss incorporates guidance from both the teacher and ground-truth data to mitigate overfitting and improve robustness.

Result: CDDM achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy on ETH-UCY and nuScenes. It retains 96.2% ADE and 95.5% FDE of the baseline on pedestrian trajectories, while using only 231k parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps (≈161× compression, ≈31× acceleration, ≈9 ms latency). Qualitative results demonstrate diverse, accurate trajectories under dynamic interactions.

Conclusion: By marrying high-performing diffusion models with deployment constraints, CDDM enables resource-efficient probabilistic trajectory prediction for AVs/ITS; code is released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a fundamental task in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), supporting efficient motion planning
and real-time traffic safety management. Diffusion models have recently
demonstrated strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction, but
their large model size and slow sampling process hinder real-world deployment.
This paper proposes Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM), a novel
method for real-time and lightweight trajectory prediction. Built upon
Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), CDDM progressively transfers
knowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student
model, jointly reducing both the number of sampling steps and the model size
across distillation iterations. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss is
further introduced to incorporate guidance from both the teacher and
ground-truth data, mitigating potential overfitting and ensuring robust
performance. Extensive experiments on the ETH-UCY pedestrian benchmark and the
nuScenes vehicle benchmark demonstrate that CDDM achieves state-of-the-art
prediction accuracy. The well-distilled CDDM retains 96.2% and 95.5% of the
baseline model's ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories, while
requiring only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps, corresponding to 161x
compression, 31x acceleration, and 9 ms latency. Qualitative results further
show that CDDM generates diverse and accurate trajectories under dynamic agent
behaviors and complex social interactions. By bridging high-performing
generative models with practical deployment constraints, CDDM enables
resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for AVs and ITS. Code is available

### [126] [Expected Attention: KV Cache Compression by Estimating Attention from Future Queries Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00636)
*Alessio Devoto,Maximilian Jeblick,Simon Jégou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Training-free KV-cache compression via Expected Attention: estimates per-KV importance using closed-form expected attention scores, enabling principled pruning with minimal residual degradation; effective in both prefill and decoding; accompanied by the KVPress library.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV cache memory is a major bottleneck in large language model inference. Attention-score pruning relying on future tokens is impractical since future scores aren’t available during compression, and modern accelerators often don’t materialize full attention matrices, making past scores inaccessible.

Method: Compute expected attention scores for each KV pair using distributional properties of LLM activations, deriving closed-form expressions. Rank KV pairs by these scores and prune accordingly. The method is training-free and applies to both prefilling and decoding.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prefill and decoding, achieving effective KV-cache compression with minimal impact on the residual stream.

Conclusion: Presents a practical, training-free approach to KV-cache pruning that addresses key limitations of prior methods and is accompanied by KVPress, a library that includes 20+ techniques for benchmarking and implementation.

Abstract: Memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache represents a major bottleneck
for efficient large language model inference. While attention-score-based KV
cache pruning shows promise, it faces critical practical limitations: attention
scores from future tokens are unavailable during compression, and modern
implementations like Flash Attention do not materialize the full attention
matrix, making past scores inaccessible. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce $\textbf{Expected Attention, a training-free compression method}$
that estimates KV pairs importance by predicting how future queries will attend
to them. Our approach leverages the distributional properties of LLM
activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV
pair. These scores enable principled ranking and pruning of KV pairs with
minimal impact on the residual stream, achieving effective compression without
performance degradation. Importantly, our method operates seamlessly across
both prefilling and decoding phases, consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both scenarios. Finally, $\textbf{we release
KVPress, a comprehensive library to enable researchers to implement and
benchmark KV cache compression methods, already including more than 20
techniques}$.

*Giacomo Ignesti,Davide Moroni,Massimo Martinelli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Batch-CAM fuses a batch Grad-CAM implementation with a prototypical reconstruction loss to steer models toward salient features, achieving higher accuracy and better reconstruction quality while cutting training and inference time, supporting more transparent, explainable AI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In high-stakes domains like healthcare, interpretable and trustworthy AI is crucial. Existing explainability methods (e.g., Grad-CAM) often trade off between model performance and interpretability. The paper aims to jointly improve accuracy, reconstruction quality, and efficiency while enhancing evidence-based explanations.

Method: Introduce Batch-CAM, a training paradigm that uses a batch-level Grad-CAM computation aligned with a prototypical reconstruction loss. The model is guided to attend to salient image regions through Grad-CAM while a reconstruction objective encourages latent representations to align with class prototypes, combining classification, explainability, and reconstructive constraints in a single objective.

Result: Empirical results indicate improvements in classification accuracy and image reconstruction quality, alongside reduced training and inference times. The approach also enhances evidence-relevant learning, contributing to more transparent and trustworthy models.

Conclusion: Batch-CAM represents a step toward explainable, efficient AI in critical domains by integrating Grad-CAM-based saliency with a prototypical reconstruction objective, promoting models that are both accurate and more interpretable.

Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of deep learning models is crucial for
advancing artificial intelligence, particularly in high-stakes fields such as
healthcare, where accurate explanations are as vital as precision. This paper
introduces Batch-CAM, a novel training paradigm that fuses a batch
implementation of the Grad-CAM algorithm with a prototypical reconstruction
loss. This combination guides the model to focus on salient image features,
thereby enhancing its performance across classification tasks. Our results
demonstrate that Batch-CAM achieves a simultaneous improvement in accuracy and
image reconstruction quality while reducing training and inference times. By
ensuring models learn from evidence-relevant information,this approach makes a
relevant contribution to building more transparent, explainable, and
trustworthy AI systems.

### [128] [Relevance-Zone Reduction in Game Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00689)
*Chi-Huang Lin,Ting Han Wei,Chun-Jui Wang,Hung Guei,Chung-Chin Shih,Yun-Jui Tsai,I-Chen Wu,Ti-Rong Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Iterative Relevance-Zone reduction narrows the search region in game solving, achieving smaller RZs and reusable knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Game trees grow exponentially; existing RZs are not unique and larger RZs hinder reuse and pruning. Reducing RZs can improve efficiency and enable knowledge reuse across board sizes/openings.

Method: Iteratively solve the same position while progressively tightening the region; design three constraint-generation strategies; introduce an RZ Pattern Table to exploit past solutions.

Result: On 7x7 Killall-Go, average RZ size reduced to 85.95% of the original (roughly 14.05% reduction). Reduced RZs can be stored as reusable knowledge for future solving tasks, aiding larger boards or different openings.

Conclusion: Iterative RZ reduction yields smaller, reusable regions, enhancing search efficiency and enabling knowledge transfer across tasks; it provides a practical approach to scale game solving.

Abstract: Game solving aims to find the optimal strategies for all players and
determine the theoretical outcome of a game. However, due to the exponential
growth of game trees, many games remain unsolved, even though methods like
AlphaZero have demonstrated super-human level in game playing. The
Relevance-Zone (RZ) is a local strategy reuse technique that restricts the
search to only the regions relevant to the outcome, significantly reducing the
search space. However, RZs are not unique. Different solutions may result in
RZs of varying sizes. Smaller RZs are generally more favorable, as they
increase the chance of reuse and improve pruning efficiency. To this end, we
propose an iterative RZ reduction method that repeatedly solves the same
position while gradually restricting the region involved, guiding the solver
toward smaller RZs. We design three constraint generation strategies and
integrate an RZ Pattern Table to fully leverage past solutions. In experiments
on 7x7 Killall-Go, our method reduces the average RZ size to 85.95% of the
original. Furthermore, the reduced RZs can be permanently stored as reusable
knowledge for future solving tasks, especially for larger board sizes or
different openings.

### [129] [ACPO: Adaptive Curriculum Policy Optimization for Aligning Vision-Language Models in Complex Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00690)
*Yunhao Wang,Ziting Li,Shuai Chen,Tao Liu,Chao Song,Junjie Jiang,Jian Zhu,Peng Gao,Bin Qin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ACPO introduces a dual adaptive framework for aligning large-scale vision-language models: a dynamic curriculum that shifts from near on-policy exploration to off-policy exploitation via increasing sample reuse, and an Advantage-Aware Adaptive Clipping (AAAC) that modulates clipping bounds per token based on normalized advantage. This leads to improved performance, faster convergence, and greater stability on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, surpassing DAPO and PAPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional policy optimization for large VLM alignment relies on static training schedules and fixed clipping (as in PPO), which hamper effective exploration-exploitation balance and sensitive gradient updates. There is a need for adaptive mechanisms that (1) gradually shift from stable on-policy learning to more sample-efficient off-policy updates, and (2) apply per-sample, advantage-aware clipping to preserve informative updates while controlling destructive updates.

Method: Introduce Adaptive Curriculum Policy Optimization (ACPO) with two components: (1) a dynamic curriculum that orchestrates a principled transition from a stable near on-policy exploration phase to an efficient off-policy exploitation phase by progressively increasing sample reuse; (2) an Advantage-Aware Adaptive Clipping (AAAC) mechanism that replaces fixed clipping with dynamic, sample-wise bounds modulated by each token's normalized advantage, enabling larger gradients for high-potential samples while guarding against harmful updates.

Result: Empirical evaluation on challenging multimodal reasoning benchmarks MathVista, LogicVista, and MMMU-Pro shows ACPO outperforming strong baselines such as DAPO and PAPO, achieving state-of-the-art performance, faster convergence, and improved training stability.

Conclusion: ACPO effectively addresses core RL optimization challenges in aligning large-scale VLMs for complex multimodal reasoning. Its dynamic curriculum and per-sample AAAC enable more robust, efficient policy updates and better overall performance, suggesting broad applicability to other large-model alignment tasks.

Abstract: Aligning large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning via
reinforcement learning is often hampered by the limitations of existing policy
optimization algorithms, such as static training schedules and the rigid,
uniform clipping mechanism in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). In this work,
we introduce Adaptive Curriculum Policy Optimization (ACPO), a novel framework
that addresses these challenges through a dual-component adaptive learning
strategy. First, ACPO employs a dynamic curriculum that orchestrates a
principled transition from a stable, near on-policy exploration phase to an
efficient, off-policy exploitation phase by progressively increasing sample
reuse. Second, we propose an Advantage-Aware Adaptive Clipping (AAAC) mechanism
that replaces the fixed clipping hyperparameter with dynamic, sample-wise
bounds modulated by the normalized advantage of each token. This allows for
more granular and robust policy updates, enabling larger gradients for
high-potential samples while safeguarding against destructive ones. We conduct
extensive experiments on a suite of challenging multimodal reasoning
benchmarks, including MathVista, LogicVista, and MMMU-Pro. Results demonstrate
that ACPO consistently outperforms strong baselines such as DAPO and PAPO,
achieving state-of-the-art performance, accelerated convergence, and superior
training stability.

*Yusif Ibrahimov,Tarique Anwar,Tommy Yuan,Turan Mutallimov,Elgun Hasanov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AttentionDep is a domain-aware, explainable model for depression severity estimation from social media that fuses contextual text with a mental health knowledge graph and uses ordinal regression, achieving >5% improvement in graded F1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a pressing need for trustworthy, interpretable AI in mental health assessment using social media data. By combining contextual information with curated clinical knowledge, the model aims to provide clinically meaningful and explainable severity predictions.

Method: Hierarchical encoding of posts with unigrams and bigrams; attention mechanisms highlight clinically relevant tokens; cross-attention with a curated mental health knowledge graph enriches contextual features; ordinal regression preserves natural severity ordering.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by over 5% in graded F1 across datasets and offers interpretable insights into predictions.

Conclusion: This work advances trustworthy and transparent AI for mental health assessment from social media by integrating domain knowledge and explainability, with potential clinical impact.

Abstract: In today's interconnected society, social media platforms provide a window
into individuals' thoughts, emotions, and mental states. This paper explores
the use of platforms like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Reddit for
depression severity detection. We propose AttentionDep, a domain-aware
attention model that drives explainable depression severity estimation by
fusing contextual and domain knowledge. Posts are encoded hierarchically using
unigrams and bigrams, with attention mechanisms highlighting clinically
relevant tokens. Domain knowledge from a curated mental health knowledge graph
is incorporated through a cross-attention mechanism, enriching the contextual
features. Finally, depression severity is predicted using an ordinal regression
framework that respects the clinical-relevance and natural ordering of severity
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that AttentionDep outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by over 5% in graded F1 score across datasets, while
providing interpretable insights into its predictions. This work advances the
development of trustworthy and transparent AI systems for mental health
assessment from social media.

### [131] [EvolProver: Advancing Automated Theorem Proving by Evolving Formalized Problems via Symmetry and Difficulty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00732)
*Yuchen Tian,Ruiyuan Huang,Xuanwu Wang,Jing Ma,Zengfeng Huang,Ziyang Luo,Hongzhan Lin,Da Zheng,Lun Du*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A data augmentation pipeline improves robustness of LLMs for formal theorem proving by generating semantically equivalent variants and harder problems, enabling a 7B prover to achieve SOTA on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs for formal theorem proving struggle with generalization and fragility to small changes in problem statements. Robust training data that captures symmetry (equivalence) and varying difficulty is needed to improve reliability across domains and transformations.

Method: Three components: EvolAST—AST-based syntactic symmetry to create semantically equivalent problem variants; EvolDomain—LLMs translating theorems across mathematical domains for semantic symmetry; EvolDifficulty—carefully designed evolutionary prompts to produce problems of wider difficulty. The evolved data trains EvolProver, a 7B non-reasoning prover.

Result: EvolProver achieves 53.8% pass@32 on FormalMATH-Lite (SOTA for comparable-size models, including reasoning-free). Also sets SOTA for non-reasoning models on MiniF2F-Test (69.8% pass@32), Ineq-Comp-Seed (52.2%), and Ineq-Comp-Transformed (34.0%). Ablation studies confirm the augmentation pipeline’s effectiveness across benchmarks.

Conclusion: A data augmentation framework exploiting symmetry and difficulty can substantially boost robustness and generalization of LLM-based provers, achieving leading performance with a relatively small (7B) model and improving non-reasoning baselines across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for formal theorem proving have shown
significant promise, yet they often lack generalizability and are fragile to
even minor transformations of problem statements. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel data augmentation pipeline designed to enhance model
robustness from two perspectives: symmetry and difficulty. From the symmetry
perspective, we propose two complementary methods: EvolAST, an Abstract Syntax
Tree (AST) based approach that targets syntactic symmetry to generate
semantically equivalent problem variants, and EvolDomain, which leverages LLMs
to address semantic symmetry by translating theorems across mathematical
domains. From the difficulty perspective, we propose EvolDifficulty, which uses
carefully designed evolutionary instructions to guide LLMs in generating new
theorems with a wider range of difficulty. We then use the evolved data to
train EvolProver, a 7B-parameter non-reasoning theorem prover. EvolProver
establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on FormalMATH-Lite with a 53.8%
pass@32 rate, surpassing all models of comparable size, including
reasoning-based models. It also sets new SOTA records for non-reasoning models
on MiniF2F-Test (69.8% pass@32), Ineq-Comp-Seed (52.2% pass@32), and
Ineq-Comp-Transformed (34.0% pass@32). Ablation studies further confirm our
data augmentation pipeline's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.

*Seunghoo Hong,Geonho Son,Juhun Lee,Simon S. Woo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces the DDIM Inversion Attack (DIA) to disrupt the integrated DDIM trajectory, providing stronger defense against diffusion-based real-image editing and misinformative content than prior methods; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models enable real-image inversion for editing, which can be misused to create deepfakes and privacy- or copyright-infringing content. Existing defenses (e.g., AdvDM, Photoguard) fight the diffusion process but fail due to misalignment with the test-time denoising trajectory.

Method: Proposes an attack on the integrated DDIM trajectory path (DIA) to disrupt the inversion/editing process, and evaluates its effectiveness across multiple editing methods.

Result: DIA achieves effective disruption and outperforms previous defense methods across various editing methods, demonstrating stronger practical defense potential.

Conclusion: DIA provides a practical defense framework against malicious diffusion-based editing, with actionable results for industry and research; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown to be strong representation learners, showcasing
state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains. Aside from accelerated
sampling, DDIM also enables the inversion of real images back to their latent
codes. A direct inheriting application of this inversion operation is real
image editing, where the inversion yields latent trajectories to be utilized
during the synthesis of the edited image. Unfortunately, this practical tool
has enabled malicious users to freely synthesize misinformative or deepfake
contents with greater ease, which promotes the spread of unethical and abusive,
as well as privacy-, and copyright-infringing contents. While defensive
algorithms such as AdvDM and Photoguard have been shown to disrupt the
diffusion process on these images, the misalignment between their objectives
and the iterative denoising trajectory at test time results in weak disruptive
performance.In this work, we present the DDIM Inversion Attack (DIA) that
attacks the integrated DDIM trajectory path. Our results support the effective
disruption, surpassing previous defensive methods across various editing
methods. We believe that our frameworks and results can provide practical
defense methods against the malicious use of AI for both the industry and the
research community. Our code is available here:

Motivation: Assess the benefits and challenges of integrating AI/LLMs into university teaching, focusing on pedagogy, learning outcomes, and ethical implications.

Method: Qualitative study based on interviews with course coordinators in data science courses at Wageningen University, analyzed thematically to identify benefits, challenges, and recommendations.

Result: AI offers task automation and potential learning enhancements; concerns include student overreliance and possible erosion of cognitive/problem-solving skills; emphasizes responsible use, ethics, and need to adapt assessments to preserve learning outcomes.

Conclusion: With thoughtful integration, AI can be a valuable educational asset that complements core learning processes rather than replacing them; success depends on alignment with learning goals and robust pedagogical design.

Abstract: This study explores the integration of AI, particularly large language models
(LLMs) like ChatGPT, into educational settings, focusing on the implications
for teaching and learning. Through interviews with course coordinators from
data science courses at Wageningen University, this research identifies both
the benefits and challenges associated with AI in the classroom. While AI tools
can streamline tasks and enhance learning, concerns arise regarding students'
overreliance on these technologies, potentially hindering the development of
essential cognitive and problem solving skills. The study highlights the
importance of responsible AI usage, ethical considerations, and the need for
adapting assessment methods to ensure educational outcomes are met. With
careful integration, AI can be a valuable asset in education, provided it is
used to complement rather than replace fundamental learning processes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the heterogeneity and terminology in chemical data that hinder automated extraction, and push toward robust evaluation benchmarks that can guide method development.

Method: Create 10 manually curated, domain-expert-validated datasets focusing on nanomaterials and small molecules; benchmark state-of-the-art agent-based systems (e.g., ChatGPT Agent) and chemical-specific extraction agents, plus their own single-agent preprocessing approach; compare with modern baselines (GPT-5, GPT-5 Thinking).

Result: Findings indicate persistent challenges in chemical information extraction, especially with domain terminology, complex tables/diagrams, and context-dependent ambiguities; the ChemX benchmark proves useful for advancing automated chemistry information extraction and evaluating generalization and methodologies.

Conclusion: ChemX serves as a critical resource to advance chemistry information extraction, encouraging improved methods and reliable evaluation strategies that generalize beyond current agent-based approaches.

Abstract: The emergence of agent-based systems represents a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, with growing applications in automated data
extraction. However, chemical information extraction remains a formidable
challenge due to the inherent heterogeneity of chemical data. Current
agent-based approaches, both general-purpose and domain-specific, exhibit
limited performance in this domain. To address this gap, we present ChemX, a
comprehensive collection of 10 manually curated and domain-expert-validated
datasets focusing on nanomaterials and small molecules. These datasets are
designed to rigorously evaluate and enhance automated extraction methodologies
in chemistry. To demonstrate their utility, we conduct an extensive
benchmarking study comparing existing state-of-the-art agentic systems such as
ChatGPT Agent and chemical-specific data extraction agents. Additionally, we
introduce our own single-agent approach that enables precise control over
document preprocessing prior to extraction. We further evaluate the performance
of modern baselines, such as GPT-5 and GPT-5 Thinking, to compare their
capabilities with agentic approaches. Our empirical findings reveal persistent
challenges in chemical information extraction, particularly in processing
domain-specific terminology, complex tabular and schematic representations, and
context-dependent ambiguities. The ChemX benchmark serves as a critical
resource for advancing automated information extraction in chemistry,
challenging the generalization capabilities of existing methods, and providing
valuable insights into effective evaluation strategies.

### [135] [Semantic Bridges Between First Order c-Representations and Cost-Based Semantics: An Initial Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00817)
*Nicholas Leisegang,Giovanni Casini,Thomas Meyer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Weighted-knowledge bases with cost-based semantics can align with c-representations, yielding equivalent interpretation orderings under certain conditions and sharing expressible entailment notions; this semantic equivalence suggests cross-pollination between the two formalisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inconsistency in ontology-mediated data querying motivates comparing two distinct non-monotonic formalisms: Bienvenu et al.'s cost-based semantics for weighted KBs and Kern-Isberner's c-representations for defeasible conditionals.

Method: Perform a semantic-level comparison to identify conditions under which a weighted KB and a set of defeasible conditionals induce the same ordering of interpretations. Analyze how penalties/weights relate to defeasible rankings, and examine which notions of entailment are expressible in both formalisms.

Result: Under certain conditions, the weighted KB and the defeasible set produce the same interpretation ordering, implying equivalence of semantic structures up to relative costs. Some entailment notions are equivalently expressible in both frameworks.

Conclusion: The findings illuminate a potential bridge between cost-based semantics and c-representations, suggesting avenues for cross-fertilization and joint development in ontology-mediated reasoning under inconsistency.

Abstract: Weighted-knowledge bases and cost-based semantics represent a recent
formalism introduced by Bienvenu et al. for Ontology Mediated Data Querying in
the case where a given knowledge base is inconsistent. This is done by adding a
weight to each statement in the knowledge base (KB), and then giving each DL
interpretation a cost based on how often it breaks rules in the KB. In this
paper we compare this approach with c-representations, a form of non-monotonic
reasoning originally introduced by Kern-Isberner. c-Representations describe a
means to interpret defeasible concept inclusions in the first-order case. This
is done by assigning a numerical ranking to each interpretations via penalties
for each violated conditional. We compare these two approaches on a semantic
level. In particular, we show that under certain conditions a weighted
knowledge base and a set of defeasible conditionals can generate the same
ordering on interpretations, and therefore an equivalence of semantic
structures up to relative cost. Moreover, we compare entailment described in
both cases, where certain notions are equivalently expressible in both
formalisms. Our results have the potential to benefit further work on both
cost-based semantics and c-representations

### [136] [Logical Consistency Between Disagreeing Experts and Its Role in AI Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00821)
*Andrés Corrada-Emmanuel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Logic-based unsupervised evaluation of classifiers using agreement/disagreement patterns, cast as an integer linear program to infer consistently possible true labels; enables no-knowledge alarms for LLM judges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: When experts disagree, at least one is not perfect; complete agreement provides little evaluative information. The paper seeks a framework to evaluate classifiers without ground truth by exploiting logical consistency.

Method: Formalize a logic of unsupervised evaluation with universal linear equalities and inequalities. Use observed summaries of aligned decisions as input to an integer linear programming problem over possible true labels to compute the set of group evaluations that are logically consistent.

Result: Derives the set of evaluations consistent with observed agreement/disagreement. Demonstrates practicality by building no-knowledge alarms that detect when LLMs-as-Judges violate a user-specified grading threshold.

Conclusion: A logic-based, unsupervised evaluation approach can yield meaningful guardrails and detection mechanisms for classifiers and judge-like systems using only logical consistency constraints.

Abstract: If two experts disagree on a test, we may conclude both cannot be 100 per
cent correct. But if they completely agree, no possible evaluation can be
excluded. This asymmetry in the utility of agreements versus disagreements is
explored here by formalizing a logic of unsupervised evaluation for
classifiers. Its core problem is computing the set of group evaluations that
are logically consistent with how we observe them agreeing and disagreeing in
their decisions. Statistical summaries of their aligned decisions are inputs
into a Linear Programming problem in the integer space of possible correct or
incorrect responses given true labels. Obvious logical constraints, such as,
the number of correct responses cannot exceed the number of observed responses,
are inequalities. But in addition, there are axioms, universally applicable
linear equalities that apply to all finite tests. The practical and immediate
utility of this approach to unsupervised evaluation using only logical
consistency is demonstrated by building no-knowledge alarms that can detect
when one or more LLMs-as-Judges are violating a minimum grading threshold
specified by the user.

TL;DR: Comparative benchmarking study of classical ML models for fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL) in power system protection using EMT data; achieves high accuracy and low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DER growth and grid dynamics complicate protection; conventional fixed-threshold protection struggles under dynamic conditions; there is a need for systematic benchmarks across ML models and settings.

Method: Benchmark multiple classical ML models on EMT-derived voltage and current waveforms segmented into sliding windows of 10–50 ms; evaluate under real-time constraints; assess accuracy, robustness to window size, and runtime efficiency.

Result: Best FC model: F1 = 0.992 ± 0.001; best FL model: R2 = 0.806 ± 0.008; mean processing time ≈ 0.563 ms.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that classical ML approaches can deliver high-performance fault classification and localization with ultra-low latency, supporting the viability of ML benchmarks for power system protection; further work may examine generalizability and model diversity.

Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs),
particularly renewables, poses significant challenges for power system
protection, with fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL) being
among the most critical tasks. Conventional protection schemes, based on fixed
thresholds, cannot reliably identify and localize short circuits with the
increasing complexity of the grid under dynamic conditions. Machine learning
(ML) offers a promising alternative; however, systematic benchmarks across
models and settings remain limited. This work presents, for the first time, a
comparative benchmarking study of classical ML models for FC and FL in power
system protection based on EMT data. Using voltage and current waveforms
segmented into sliding windows of 10 ms to 50 ms, we evaluate models under
realistic real-time constraints. Performance is assessed in terms of accuracy,
robustness to window size, and runtime efficiency. The best-performing FC model
achieved an F1 score of 0.992$\pm$0.001, while the top FL model reached an R2
of 0.806$\pm$0.008 with a mean processing time of 0.563 ms.

Conclusion: Integrating data balancing techniques with ensemble methods significantly enhances early detection of manipulative activities, contributing to a fairer, more transparent, and more stable cryptocurrency market.

Abstract: This study aims to detect pump and dump (P&D) manipulation in cryptocurrency
markets, where the scarcity of such events causes severe class imbalance and
hinders accurate detection. To address this issue, the Synthetic Minority
Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, and advanced ensemble learning
models were evaluated to distinguish manipulative trading behavior from normal
market activity. The experimental results show that applying SMOTE greatly
enhanced the ability of all models to detect P&D events by increasing recall
and improving the overall balance between precision and recall. In particular,
XGBoost and LightGBM achieved high recall rates (94.87% and 93.59%,
respectively) with strong F1-scores and demonstrated fast computational
performance, making them suitable for near real time surveillance. These
findings indicate that integrating data balancing techniques with ensemble
methods significantly improves the early detection of manipulative activities,
contributing to a fairer, more transparent, and more stable cryptocurrency
market.

### [139] [Learning Compact Representations of LLM Abilities via Item Response Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00844)
*Jianhao Chen,Chenxu Wang,Gengrui Zhang,Peng Ye,Lei Bai,Wei Hu,Yuzhong Qu,Shuyue Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a compact, interpretable representation of LLM abilities using an IRT-inspired probability model and a Mixture-of-Experts network to predict whether a model answers a query, enabling model routing and benchmark performance prediction with state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of LLMs creates a need for compact, transferable representations of model capabilities to enable efficient routing, selection, and benchmarking.

Method: Model the probability of a correct answer as a function of three factors: a multi-skill model-ability vector, a query discrimination vector, and a query difficulty scalar, learned jointly via a Mixture-of-Experts network that couples model- and query-level embeddings.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in model routing and benchmark accuracy prediction; learned parameters are interpretable and reflect meaningful model and query characteristics.

Conclusion: IRT-inspired, MoE-based representation learning yields compact, interpretable encodings of model abilities that support effective routing and evaluation of LLMs on new benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the number of large language models
(LLMs), yet efficiently managing and utilizing these vast resources remains a
significant challenge. In this work, we explore how to learn compact
representations of LLM abilities that can facilitate downstream tasks, such as
model routing and performance prediction on new benchmarks. We frame this
problem as estimating the probability that a given model will correctly answer
a specific query. Inspired by the item response theory (IRT) in psychometrics,
we model this probability as a function of three key factors: (i) the model's
multi-skill ability vector, (2) the query's discrimination vector that
separates models of differing skills, and (3) the query's difficulty scalar. To
learn these parameters jointly, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network
that couples model- and query-level embeddings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach leads to state-of-the-art performance in both
model routing and benchmark accuracy prediction. Moreover, analysis validates
that the learned parameters encode meaningful, interpretable information about
model capabilities and query characteristics.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AIDE uses Monte Carlo Tree Search to automate insights and data exploration, enabling scalable identification of transformations and models to reveal data patterns, with extensibility for future strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap between abundant data and actionable knowledge; automated knowledge discovery faces open problems in navigating data, extracting implicit relationships, and aligning with subjective goals.

Method: Introduce Automated Insights and Data Exploration (AIDE) leveraging Monte Carlo Tree Search to guide exploration, pattern extraction, and transformation/model discovery; evaluate on real and synthetic datasets; designed for future integration of additional strategies and domain knowledge.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in identifying data transformations and models that uncover interesting patterns; the MCTS-based framework offers extensibility for adding more strategies and domain knowledge.

Conclusion: AIDE is a valuable step toward automated knowledge discovery, providing a robust, extensible framework that can incorporate more pattern extraction strategies and domain knowledge for future work.

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly focused on leveraging data from their
processes to gain insights and drive decision-making. However, converting this
data into actionable knowledge remains a difficult and time-consuming task.
There is often a gap between the volume of data collected and the ability to
process and understand it, which automated knowledge discovery aims to fill.
Automated knowledge discovery involves complex open problems, including
effectively navigating data, building models to extract implicit relationships,
and considering subjective goals and knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a
novel method for Automated Insights and Data Exploration (AIDE), that serves as
a robust foundation for tackling these challenges through the use of Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We evaluate AIDE using both real-world and synthetic
data, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying data transformations and
models that uncover interesting data patterns. Among its strengths, AIDE's
MCTS-based framework offers significant extensibility, allowing for future
integration of additional pattern extraction strategies and domain knowledge.
This makes AIDE a valuable step towards developing a comprehensive solution for
automated knowledge discovery.

### [141] [FusionAdapter for Few-Shot Relation Learning in Multimodal Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00894)
*Ran Liu,Yuan Fang,Xiaoli Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FusionAdapter enables few-shot relation learning in multimodal knowledge graphs by using per-modality adapters and a fusion strategy to preserve modality-specific information, leading to better generalization to novel relations with limited supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMKG approaches typically align different modalities into a single shared space, which can obscure the unique, complementary information provided by each modality and hurts performance in low-resource or few-shot relation settings.

Method: Proposes an adapter module for efficient adaptation of each modality to unseen relations and a fusion strategy that integrates multimodal entity representations while preserving diverse modality-specific characteristics.

Result: Empirical evaluation on two benchmark MMKG datasets shows FusionAdapter achieving superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Adapting and fusing modality-specific representations via adapters improves few-shot relation learning in MMKGs, offering better generalization with minimal supervision.

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) incorporate various modalities, including
text and images, to enhance entity and relation representations. Notably,
different modalities for the same entity often present complementary and
diverse information. However, existing MMKG methods primarily align modalities
into a shared space, which tends to overlook the distinct contributions of
specific modalities, limiting their performance particularly in low-resource
settings. To address this challenge, we propose FusionAdapter for the learning
of few-shot relationships (FSRL) in MMKG. FusionAdapter introduces (1) an
adapter module that enables efficient adaptation of each modality to unseen
relations and (2) a fusion strategy that integrates multimodal entity
representations while preserving diverse modality-specific characteristics. By
effectively adapting and fusing information from diverse modalities,
FusionAdapter improves generalization to novel relations with minimal
supervision. Extensive experiments on two benchmark MMKG datasets demonstrate
that FusionAdapter achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

### [142] [On Discovering Algorithms for Adversarial Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00922)
*Shashank Reddy Chirra,Jayden Teoh,Praveen Paruchuri,Pradeep Varakantham*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Discovered Adversarial Imitation Learning (DAIL) introduces a data-driven, meta-learned reward assignment (RA) function for Adversarial Imitation Learning, discovered via an LLM-guided evolutionary search; it improves stability and generalization, outperforming human-designed baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RA design in Adversarial Imitation Learning is underexplored and highly influential on training dynamics, yet most work focuses on density ratio estimation. Automating RA discovery could enhance stability and performance across tasks and optimization algorithms.

Method: Model RA as a function of the density ratio ρ_E/ρ_π. Use an LLM-guided evolutionary framework to explore the space of RA functions and meta-learn a robust AIL algorithm (DAIL). Evaluate on unseen environments and against different policy optimization methods; provide public code.

Result: DAIL generalizes to unseen environments and policy optimization algorithms and outperforms current state-of-the-art human-designed RA baselines. The work offers insights into why RA affects training stability in AIL.

Conclusion: Data-driven discovery of RA functions can enhance the stability and performance of AIL and yields a generalizable meta-learnt algorithm. The approach shifts RA design from human-crafted to automated, with potential for broader applicability; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) methods, while effective in settings
with limited expert demonstrations, are often considered unstable. These
approaches typically decompose into two components: Density Ratio (DR)
estimation $\frac{\rho_E}{\rho_{\pi}}$, where a discriminator estimates the
relative occupancy of state-action pairs under the policy versus the expert;
and Reward Assignment (RA), where this ratio is transformed into a reward
signal used to train the policy. While significant research has focused on
improving density estimation, the role of reward assignment in influencing
training dynamics and final policy performance has been largely overlooked. RA
functions in AIL are typically derived from divergence minimization objectives,
relying heavily on human design and ingenuity. In this work, we take a
different approach: we investigate the discovery of data-driven RA functions,
i.e, based directly on the performance of the resulting imitation policy. To
this end, we leverage an LLM-guided evolutionary framework that efficiently
explores the space of RA functions, yielding \emph{Discovered Adversarial
Imitation Learning} (DAIL), the first meta-learnt AIL algorithm. Remarkably,
DAIL generalises across unseen environments and policy optimization algorithms,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art of \emph{human-designed} baselines.
Finally, we analyse why DAIL leads to more stable training, offering novel
insights into the role of RA functions in the stability of AIL. Code is
publicly available: https://github.com/shshnkreddy/DAIL.

### [143] [Test-Time Search in Neural Graph Coarsening Procedures for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00958)
*Yoonju Sim,Hyeonah Kim,Changhyun Kwon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A neural separation method for RCIs in CVRP is enhanced by a test-time stochastic graph coarsening approach called GraphCHiP, which improves dual bounds and uncovers FCIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DL-based separation for RCIs yields too few and not diverse cuts; need inference-time improvements and ability to identify FCIs.

Method: Introduce stochastic edge selection in graph coarsening; GraphCHiP leverages coarsening history to identify RCIs and FCIs; perform a test-time search with stochasticity.

Result: On randomly generated CVRP instances, the approach reduces the dual gap compared to prior neural separation; it also discovers effective FCIs on at least one instance.

Conclusion: Inference-time stochastic graph coarsening improves neural separation for CVRP and enables FCIs discovery, highlighting potential for stronger cuts in cutting-plane methods.

Abstract: The identification of valid inequalities, such as the rounded capacity
inequalities (RCIs), is a key component of cutting plane methods for the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). While a deep learning-based
separation method can learn to find high-quality cuts, our analysis reveals
that the model produces fewer cuts than expected because it is insufficiently
sensitive to generate a diverse set of generated subsets. This paper proposes
an alternative: enhancing the performance of a trained model at inference time
through a new test-time search with stochasticity. First, we introduce
stochastic edge selection into the graph coarsening procedure, replacing the
previously proposed greedy approach. Second, we propose the Graph Coarsening
History-based Partitioning (GraphCHiP) algorithm, which leverages coarsening
history to identify not only RCIs but also, for the first time, the Framed
capacity inequalities (FCIs). Experiments on randomly generated CVRP instances
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the dual gap compared
to the existing neural separation method. Additionally, our method discovers
effective FCIs on a specific instance, despite the challenging nature of
identifying such cuts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the persistent tradeoff between forecasting accuracy and interpretability in multivariate time series, particularly in finance, by integrating fuzzy inference with neural attention mechanisms.

Method: A hybrid architecture that uses LSTM networks with temporal attention to condense multivariate inputs into interpretable features, which are then processed by fuzzy inference systems within a transformer-like framework aimed at long-term forecasting of stock data (S&P 500).

Result: The model achieves forecasting performance comparable to traditional models such as ARIMA and LSTM while enabling meaningful information flow and interpretability within the network; evaluated on the S&P 500 index with initial results highlighting interpretability gains and tradeoffs between accuracy and explainability.

Conclusion: Fuzzformer shows potential for interpretable long-term forecasting in financial multivariate time series, offering a usable balance between accuracy and interpretability, but with ongoing tradeoffs to optimize; practical application appears feasible given current results.

Abstract: In the complex landscape of multivariate time series forecasting, achieving
both accuracy and interpretability remains a significant challenge. This paper
introduces the Fuzzy Transformer (Fuzzformer), a novel recurrent neural network
architecture combined with multi-head self-attention and fuzzy inference
systems to analyze multivariate stock market data and conduct long-term time
series forecasting. The method leverages LSTM networks and temporal attention
to condense multivariate data into interpretable features suitable for fuzzy
inference systems. The resulting architecture offers comparable forecasting
performance to conventional models such as ARIMA and LSTM while providing
meaningful information flow within the network. The method was examined on the
real world stock market index S\&P500. Initial results show potential for
interpretable forecasting and identify current performance tradeoffs,
suggesting practical application in understanding and forecasting stock market
behavior.

### [145] [QUASAR: Quantum Assembly Code Generation Using Tool-Augmented LLMs via Agentic RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00967)
*Cong Yu,Valter Uotila,Shilong Deng,Qingyuan Wu,Tuo Shi,Songlin Jiang,Lei You,Bo Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QUASAR is an agentic reinforcement learning framework that uses tool-augmented LLMs to generate and optimize quantum circuits. It employs external quantum simulators for verification and a hierarchical reward mechanism, achieving near-perfect validity on a 4B LLM and outperforming GPT-4o, GPT-5, DeepSeek-V3, and several baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based quantum circuit generation suffers from two main issues: (1) parameterized quantum gates require precise numerical values influenced by circuit size, depth, and layout; (2) LLMs lack deep quantum-domain knowledge, leading to syntactically or semantically incorrect circuits. There is a need to align LLMs with quantum-specific knowledge and to verify generated circuits using real quantum simulators.

Method:  QUASAR integrates an agentic reinforcement learning framework with tool-augmented LLMs. It (i) uses external quantum simulators to verify circuit correctness, (ii) employs a sophisticated hierarchical reward mechanism during RL training to align generated circuits with quantum-domain requirements, and (iii) leverages tool augmentation to provide LLMs with simulator feedback and quantum-domain guidance.

Result: The framework yields improvements in both syntax and semantic quality of generated circuits. In experiments augmenting a 4B LLM, QUASAR achieves Pass@1 of 99.31% and Pass@10 of 100%, outperforming industrial LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-5, DeepSeek-V3) and multiple SFT-only or RL-only baselines.

Conclusion: QUASAR effectively aligns LLMs with quantum-domain knowledge and validates circuits via external simulators, demonstrating that agentic RL with tool-augmented LLMs can produce high-quality task-specific quantum circuits and scale to competitive LLMs. This approach may generalize to other domains requiring precise parameterization and domain-specific verification.

Abstract: Designing and optimizing task-specific quantum circuits are crucial to
leverage the advantage of quantum computing. Recent large language model
(LLM)-based quantum circuit generation has emerged as a promising automatic
solution. However, the fundamental challenges remain unaddressed: (i)
parameterized quantum gates require precise numerical values for optimal
performance, which also depend on multiple aspects, including the number of
quantum gates, their parameters, and the layout/depth of the circuits. (ii)
LLMs often generate low-quality or incorrect quantum circuits due to the lack
of quantum domain-specific knowledge. We propose QUASAR, an agentic
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for quantum circuits generation and
optimization based on tool-augmented LLMs. To align the LLM with
quantum-specific knowledge and improve the generated quantum circuits, QUASAR
designs (i) a quantum circuit verification approach with external quantum
simulators and (ii) a sophisticated hierarchical reward mechanism in RL
training. Extensive evaluation shows improvements in both syntax and semantic
performance of the generated quantum circuits. When augmenting a 4B LLM, QUASAR
has achieved the validity of 99.31% in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10,
outperforming industrial LLMs of GPT-4o, GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3 and several
supervised-fine-tuning (SFT)-only and RL-only baselines.

*Aueaphum Aueawatthanaphisut*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An integrated federated learning framework (AFFR) for rare-disease diagnosis that combines few-shot meta-learning, energy-aware client scheduling, and calibrated DP-secure aggregation to enable privacy-preserving, robust edge-device deployment with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle extreme data scarcity, privacy concerns, and device constraints in rare-disease diagnosis, where centralized data sharing is impractical.

Method: Three-pillared modular pipeline: (i) few-shot federated optimization with meta-learning to generalize from small patient samples; (ii) energy-aware client scheduling to reduce dropouts and balance participation; (iii) secure aggregation with calibrated differential privacy to protect model updates; evaluated on simulated datasets; achieves better accuracy and robustness than baseline FL.

Result: Up to 10% accuracy improvement over baseline FL; >50% reduction in client dropouts; privacy-utility trade-offs within clinically acceptable bounds.

Conclusion: AFFR provides a practical, equitable, and trustworthy framework for federated rare-disease diagnosis that can be deployed in real-world clinical networks.

Abstract: Rare-disease diagnosis remains one of the most pressing challenges in digital
health, hindered by extreme data scarcity, privacy concerns, and the limited
resources of edge devices. This paper proposes the Adaptive Federated Few-Shot
Rare-Disease Diagnosis (AFFR) framework, which integrates three pillars: (i)
few-shot federated optimization with meta-learning to generalize from limited
patient samples, (ii) energy-aware client scheduling to mitigate device
dropouts and ensure balanced participation, and (iii) secure aggregation with
calibrated differential privacy to safeguard sensitive model updates. Unlike
prior work that addresses these aspects in isolation, AFFR unifies them into a
modular pipeline deployable on real-world clinical networks. Experimental
evaluation on simulated rare-disease detection datasets demonstrates up to 10%
improvement in accuracy compared with baseline FL, while reducing client
dropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence. Furthermore,
privacy-utility trade-offs remain within clinically acceptable bounds. These
findings highlight AFFR as a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy
federated diagnosis of rare conditions.

*Saravanan Venkatachalam*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A practical, end-to-end forecasting and monitoring framework for after-sales demand that unifies diverse models, segmentation, and AI narratives to support inventory decisions across 90+ countries and ~6k parts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To deliver calibrated, actionable forecasts with explainability and governance that tie forecasting performance to business impact and enable proactive inventory management in a global, regime-shifting environment (e.g., COVID-19).

Method: A revenue- and cluster-aware ensemble of statistical, ML, and deep-learning models; exogenous signals; regime-aware handling of COVID-19; Pareto-aware segmentation with high-revenue items forecasted individually and long tail pooled in clusters; horizon-aware ensemble weighting by business losses; performance scorecard with accuracy, bias, and hotspot metrics; trend module tracking MAPE/WMAPE and bias; LLMs for role-aware narratives and reporting contracts; reproducible workflow with request spec, model execution, artifacts, AI narratives; deployment across 90+ countries and 6,000 parts.

Result: Country-part forecasts with calibrated intervals; improved focus on high-revenue items; interpretable insights (bias, hotspots, root causes); trend tracking and regime-change detection; AI-generated narratives; an end-to-end workflow enabling data-driven inventory decisions.

Conclusion: The framework delivers scalable, explainable, and decision-focused forecasting and monitoring that connects forecasting accuracy to business levers, enabling planners to identify where accuracy is heading and which actions to take.

Abstract: This paper presents a practical architecture for after-sales demand
forecasting and monitoring that unifies a revenue- and cluster-aware ensemble
of statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models with a role-driven
analytics layer for scorecards and trend diagnostics. The framework ingests
exogenous signals (installed base, pricing, macro indicators, life cycle,
seasonality) and treats COVID-19 as a distinct regime, producing country-part
forecasts with calibrated intervals. A Pareto-aware segmentation forecasts
high-revenue items individually and pools the long tail via clusters, while
horizon-aware ensembling aligns weights with business-relevant losses (e.g.,
WMAPE). Beyond forecasts, a performance scorecard delivers decision-focused
insights: accuracy within tolerance thresholds by revenue share and count, bias
decomposition (over- vs under-forecast), geographic and product-family
hotspots, and ranked root causes tied to high-impact part-country pairs. A
trend module tracks trajectories of MAPE/WMAPE and bias across recent months,
flags entities that are improving or deteriorating, detects change points
aligned with known regimes, and attributes movements to lifecycle and seasonal
factors. LLMs are embedded in the analytics layer to generate role-aware
narratives and enforce reporting contracts. They standardize business
definitions, automate quality checks and reconciliations, and translate
quantitative results into concise, explainable summaries for planners and
executives. The system exposes a reproducible workflow -- request
specification, model execution, database-backed artifacts, and AI-generated
narratives -- so planners can move from "How accurate are we now?" to "Where is
accuracy heading and which levers should we pull?", closing the loop between
forecasting, monitoring, and inventory decisions across more than 90 countries
and about 6,000 parts.

*Federico Tiblias,Irina Bigoulaeva,Jingcheng Niu,Simone Balloccu,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SMDS is a model-agnostic method to automatically discover and analyze feature manifolds in language models. Applied to temporal reasoning, it reveals diverse geometric structures (circles, lines, clusters) that reflect concept properties, are stable across models, support reasoning, and reshape with context, suggesting LMs use structured, entity-based representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitation of prior work that learns geometry for individual features without generalization. The paper seeks a general, model-agnostic method to uncover how concepts are organized in latent spaces and to understand the functional role of these feature manifolds in reasoning.

Method: Introduce Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling (SMDS), a model-agnostic approach that jointly learns low-dimensional manifolds for multiple features. Apply SMDS to temporal reasoning as a case study, analyzing the geometry and stability of the discovered manifolds across model families and sizes, and observe how manifolds adapt to contextual changes.

Result: SMDS discovers diverse geometric structures for different features (circles, lines, clusters). The manifolds consistently reflect concept properties, remain stable across model families and sizes, actively support reasoning in models, and dynamically reshape in response to context changes.

Conclusion: The findings illuminate the functional role of feature manifolds in LMs, supporting a view that entities are encoded and transformed within structured representations, and that such manifolds underlie entity-based reasoning across models.

Abstract: The linear representation hypothesis states that language models (LMs) encode
concepts as directions in their latent space, forming organized,
multidimensional manifolds. Prior efforts focus on discovering specific
geometries for specific features, and thus lack generalization. We introduce
Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling (SMDS), a model-agnostic method to
automatically discover feature manifolds. We apply SMDS to temporal reasoning
as a case study, finding that different features form various geometric
structures such as circles, lines, and clusters. SMDS reveals many insights on
these structures: they consistently reflect the properties of the concepts they
represent; are stable across model families and sizes; actively support
reasoning in models; and dynamically reshape in response to context changes.
Together, our findings shed light on the functional role of feature manifolds,
supporting a model of entity-based reasoning in which LMs encode and transform
structured representations.

### [149] [Uncovering the Computational Ingredients of Human-Like Representations in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01030)
*Zach Studdiford,Timothy T. Rogers,Kushin Mukherjee,Siddharth Suresh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A broad evaluation of 70+ LLMs across architectures and training methods shows that instruction-tuning and larger attention head dimensionality align models more with human conceptual representations on a triplet similarity task, while multimodal pretraining and overall parameter count have limited impact; benchmarks vary in capturing alignment, with none fully accounting for human-AI representational variance; underscores a benchmarking gap and points to key ingredients for human-like representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine which computational ingredients of LLMs drive human-like representations and to assess whether current benchmarks capture representational alignment between humans and models, addressing a gap where models may appear strong on benchmarks but not align with human concepts.

Method: Evaluate over 70 diverse models on a triplet similarity task derived from the THINGS database to measure human conceptual representations. Compare model representations to human data to compute alignment. Analyze how architectural features (e.g., instruction-finetuning, attention head dimensionality, multimodal pretraining, parameter size) relate to alignment. Correlate alignment with existing benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, MUSR) to assess their adequacy.

Result: Instruction-finetuned models with larger dimensionality of attention heads show higher human-model alignment. Multimodal pretraining and larger parameter counts have limited impact on alignment. Some benchmarks better capture alignment than others, but no current benchmark fully accounts for the variance in alignment, indicating insufficiency for measuring human-AI representational similarity.

Conclusion: To advance toward models with human-like conceptual representations, focus on instruction-tuning and increasing the dimensionality of attention mechanisms. Develop or adopt benchmarks that more accurately assess representational alignment, as existing benchmarks do not fully capture the variance in human-model representations.

Abstract: The ability to translate diverse patterns of inputs into structured patterns
of behavior has been thought to rest on both humans' and machines' ability to
learn robust representations of relevant concepts. The rapid advancement of
transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has led to a diversity of
computational ingredients -- architectures, fine tuning methods, and training
datasets among others -- but it remains unclear which of these ingredients are
most crucial for building models that develop human-like representations.
Further, most current LLM benchmarks are not suited to measuring
representational alignment between humans and models, making benchmark scores
unreliable for assessing if current LLMs are making progress towards becoming
useful cognitive models. We address these limitations by first evaluating a set
of over 70 models that widely vary in their computational ingredients on a
triplet similarity task, a method well established in the cognitive sciences
for measuring human conceptual representations, using concepts from the THINGS
database. Comparing human and model representations, we find that models that
undergo instruction-finetuning and which have larger dimensionality of
attention heads are among the most human aligned, while multimodal pretraining
and parameter size have limited bearing on alignment. Correlations between
alignment scores and scores on existing benchmarks reveal that while some
benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) are better suited than others (e.g., MUSR) for
capturing representational alignment, no existing benchmark is capable of fully
accounting for the variance of alignment scores, demonstrating their
insufficiency in capturing human-AI alignment. Taken together, our findings
help highlight the computational ingredients most essential for advancing LLMs
towards models of human conceptual representation and address a key
benchmarking gap in LLM evaluation.

*Akchunya Chanchal,David A. Kelly,Hana Chockler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a forward-pass Activation-Deactivation (AD) paradigm implemented as ConvAD to produce robust CNN explanations by deactivating model components corresponding to occluded input, avoiding input occlusion artifacts and retraining; shows robustness gains (up to 62.5%) while preserving predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occlusion-based, black-box explainers rely on occluding input which creates out-of-distribution artifacts and requires domain knowledge to choose occlusion values; a method that yields robust explanations without altering decisions is desirable.

Method: Introduce Activation-Deactivation (AD) forward-pass paradigm and ConvAD, a drop-in module for CNNs that deactivates parts of the model tied to occluded input during the forward pass. No additional training. Compare AD explanations to occlusion-based baselines using proxies for robustness, size, and confidence drop-off across multiple datasets and architectures.

Result: AD-based explanations are more robust than occlusion-based explanations, with robustness improvements reported up to 62.5%. ConvAD does not change the network's decisions and provides more robust explanations without domain knowledge or retraining.

Conclusion: ConvAD enables robust, training-free explanations via a straightforward model augmentation, mitigating issues with input occlusions and improving explanation quality across datasets and architectures.

Abstract: Black-box explainability methods are popular tools for explaining the
decisions of image classifiers. A major drawback of these tools is their
reliance on mutants obtained by occluding parts of the input, leading to
out-of-distribution images. This raises doubts about the quality of the
explanations. Moreover, choosing an appropriate occlusion value often requires
domain knowledge. In this paper we introduce a novel forward-pass paradigm
Activation-Deactivation (AD), which removes the effects of occluded input
features from the model's decision-making by switching off the parts of the
model that correspond to the occlusions. We introduce ConvAD, a drop-in
mechanism that can be easily added to any trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN), and which implements the AD paradigm. This leads to more robust
explanations without any additional training or fine-tuning. We prove that the
ConvAD mechanism does not change the decision-making process of the network. We
provide experimental evaluation across several datasets and model
architectures. We compare the quality of AD-explanations with explanations
achieved using a set of masking values, using the proxies of robustness, size,
and confidence drop-off. We observe a consistent improvement in robustness of
AD explanations (up to 62.5%) compared to explanations obtained with
occlusions, demonstrating that ConvAD extracts more robust explanations without
the need for domain knowledge.

Motivation: Faithfulness of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales is crucial for interpretability but remains unverifiable; the Curry-Howard correspondence offers a principled link between formal proofs and programs, enabling formal verification of reasoning traces.

Method: Propose a mapping from informal CoT steps to typed logical inferences, and an extraction/mapping pipeline to convert CoT narratives into a formal, well-typed proof structure. Treat plausible reasoning steps as typed rules to produce verifiable certificates, outlining a pipeline for converting narratives into formal proofs.

Result: Conceptual framework introducing a pipeline to transform CoT narratives into formal proofs; claims a strong certificate of computational faithfulness and a path toward formal verification rather than heuristic interpretability.

Conclusion: This Curry-Howard-based approach shifts interpretability toward formal verification, offering a route to more reliable and trustworthy AI systems.

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of
large language models, the faithfulness of the generated rationales remains an
open problem for model interpretability. We propose a novel theoretical lens
for this problem grounded in the Curry-Howard correspondence, which posits a
direct relationship between formal proofs and computer programs. Under this
paradigm, a faithful reasoning trace is analogous to a well-typed program,
where each intermediate step corresponds to a typed logical inference. We
operationalise this analogy, presenting methods to extract and map the
informal, natural language steps of CoT into a formal, typed proof structure.
Successfully converting a CoT trace into a well-typed proof serves as a strong,
verifiable certificate of its computational faithfulness, moving beyond
heuristic interpretability towards formal verification. Our framework provides
a methodology to transform plausible narrative explanations into formally
verifiable programs, offering a path towards building more reliable and
trustworthy AI systems.

### [152] [Safety Instincts: LLMs Learn to Trust Their Internal Compass for Self-Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01088)
*Guobin Shen,Dongcheng Zhao,Haibo Tong,Jindong Li,Feifei Zhao,Yi Zeng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SIRL uses the model’s own safety instincts as a self-generated reward, reinforcing low-entropy refusals to harmful prompts and leveraging high-entropy risky outputs as signals, yielding robust jailbreak resistance with minimal unlabeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety in LLMs lacks universal standards and reliable validators; external supervision is expensive and inconsistent. The authors observe that aligned models already encode strong internal safety beliefs (confident refusals, high entropy for risky content) and propose exploiting this intrinsic signal to enable autonomous, scalable safety training without external annotations.

Method: Introduce Safety Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), which translates internal confidence signals into a self-generated reward. The model is trained to reinforce low-entropy refusals on harmful prompts using only ~15,000 unlabeled prompts, applied to Llama and Qwen, with no reliance on external validators or human annotations.

Result: SIRL achieves 89%+ Defense Success Rates (DSRs) against 20+ jailbreak methods, spanning static prompts to adaptive attacks. It matches or surpasses resource-intensive supervised methods while preserving performance on mathematics, coding, and conversation benchmarks.

Conclusion: Effective alignment can emerge from within the model’s own safety instincts, enabling more autonomous and scalable AI safety mechanisms that scale without extensive human oversight.

Abstract: Ensuring Large Language Model (LLM) safety remains challenging due to the
absence of universal standards and reliable content validators, making it
difficult to obtain effective training signals. We discover that aligned models
already possess robust internal safety beliefs: they consistently produce
high-confidence refusals to harmful requests while exhibiting high entropy when
generating potentially dangerous content. This entropy gap reveals an untapped
signal--models intrinsically "know" when to refuse. We introduce Safety
Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), which transforms this internal
confidence into a self-generated reward signal, eliminating dependence on
external validators or human annotations. SIRL teaches models to trust their
safety instincts by reinforcing low-entropy refusal behaviors. Evaluated on
Llama and Qwen models, SIRL maintains 89%+ Defense Success Rates (DSRs) against
20+ jailbreak methods, from static prompts to adaptive attacks. Using only
15,000 unlabeled prompts, SIRL surpasses resource-intensive supervised methods
while preserving performance on mathematics, coding, and conversation
benchmarks. Our work demonstrates that effective alignment can emerge from
within, paving the way for more autonomous and robust AI safety mechanisms that
scale without extensive human oversight.

*Alexander Nasuta,Alessandro Cisi,Sylwia Olbrych,Gustavo Vieira,Rui Fernandes,Lucas Paletta,Marlene Mayr,Rishyank Chevuri,Robert Woitsch,Hans Aoyang Zhou,Anas Abdelrazeq,Robert H. Schmitt*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A two-layer CP+MDP framework for human-centric production planning: CP handles order-line allocation for efficient, feasible schedules; MDP handles worker-line allocation incorporating human factors to improve fairness and preference alignment. Evaluates greedy, MCTS, and RL; validated via 16 automotive-domain sessions with KPIs and expert ratings; CP yields compact, feasible plans with low tardiness, while MDP enhances fairness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To jointly optimize manufacturing throughput and workforce well-being by integrating automated, data-driven scheduling with human-centric worker assignment.

Method: Layer 1 uses Constraint Programming to allocate order-lines under machine capacities, processing times, and due dates. Layer 2 uses a Markov Decision Process to assign workers to lines, incorporating worker preferences, experience, resilience, and medical constraints. Three strategies (greedy, Monte Carlo Tree Search, reinforcement learning) are implemented and compared. Evaluation with 16 test sessions from automotive-domain experts, using quantitative KPIs and expert ratings.

Result: CP-based scheduling yields compact, feasible production plans with low tardiness. The MDP-based worker allocation significantly improves fairness and preference alignment compared to baselines. Domain experts rated both components as effective; suggestions include refining the objective to penalize excessive earliness and to improve continuity in worker assignments.

Conclusion: Combining constraint-programming–based scheduling with learning-based decision-making yields a robust, human-centric production planning approach, enabling simultaneous throughput optimization and workforce well-being, with practical applicability in industry.

Abstract: This work presents a two-layer, human-centric production planning framework
designed to optimize both operational efficiency and workforce fairness in
industrial manufacturing. The first layer formulates the Order-Line allocation
as a Constraint Programming (CP) problem, generating high-utilization
production schedules that respect machine capacities, processing times, and due
dates. The second layer models Worker-Line allocation as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP), integrating human factors such as worker preference, experience,
resilience, and medical constraints into the assignment process. Three solution
strategies, greedy allocation, MCTS, and RL, are implemented and compared
across multiple evaluation scenarios. The proposed system is validated through
16 test sessions with domain experts from the automotive industry, combining
quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs) with expert ratings. Results
indicate that the CP-based scheduling approach produces compact, feasible
production plans with low tardiness, while the MDP-based worker allocation
significantly improves fairness and preference alignment compared to baseline
approaches. Domain experts rated both the Order-Line and Worker-Line components
as effective and highlighted opportunities to further refine the objective
function to penalize excessive earliness and improve continuity in worker
assignments. Overall, the findings demonstrate that combining CP with
learning-based decision-making provides a robust approach for human-centric
production planning. The approach enables simultaneous optimization of
throughput and workforce well-being, offering a practical foundation for fair
and efficient manufacturing scheduling in industrial settings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A modular, clinician-aligned extension of PRISM that routes emergency-department episodes to a suite of lightweight, domain-specific transformers, enabling low-latency, interpretable consults with compute savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable safe, auditable, low-latency expert consultation in EDs by distributing tasks across specialist models while preserving a shared backbone for efficiency and interpretability; avoid dominance of common events and support scalable deployment.

Method: Introduce PRISM-Consult: a router reads initial tokens to dispatch episodes to specialist models (Cardiac-Vascular, Pulmonary, Gastro-Oesophageal, Musculoskeletal, Psychogenic). Each specialist uses PRISM’s compact transformer backbone and token template. Data methodology differentiates initial vs. conclusive ICD-9 families; calibration of routing thresholds; report per-domain results to prevent dominance; analyze routing quality and compute savings under a safety-first policy.

Result: Specialists show smooth convergence with low development perplexities across domains. The router achieves high routing quality and large compute savings versus consult-all, under a safety-first policy. Per-domain results are reported to prevent dominance by common events. The framework enables safe, auditable, and low-latency consult at scale.

Conclusion: The PRISM-Consult framework provides a practical path to scalable, safe, auditable, and low-latency expert consultation in EDs. The authors outline validation steps including external/temporal replication, asymmetric life-threat thresholds, and multi-label arbitration to meet prospective deployment standards.

Abstract: We present PRISM-Consult, a clinician-aligned panel-of-experts architecture
that extends the compact PRISM sequence model into a routed family of domain
specialists. Episodes are tokenized as structured clinical events; a
light-weight router reads the first few tokens and dispatches to specialist
models (Cardiac-Vascular, Pulmonary, Gastro-Oesophageal, Musculoskeletal,
Psychogenic). Each specialist inherits PRISM's small transformer backbone and
token template, enabling parameter efficiency and interpretability. On
real-world Emergency Department cohorts, specialists exhibit smooth convergence
with low development perplexities across domains, while the router achieves
high routing quality and large compute savings versus consult-all under a
safety-first policy. We detail the data methodology (initial vs. conclusive
ICD-9 families), routing thresholds and calibration, and report per-domain
results to avoid dominance by common events. The framework provides a practical
path to safe, auditable, and low-latency consult at scale, and we outline
validation steps-external/temporal replication, asymmetric life-threat
thresholds, and multi-label arbitration-to meet prospective clinical deployment
standards.

*Evan Heus,Rick Bookstaber,Dhruv Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An LLM-centric agent framework treats the supply chain as a knowledge graph, using centrality-guided graph traversal and context shells to produce real-time, explainable risk narratives without fine-tuning or a graph database.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex, multi-modal, network-native financial risk data; standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) oversimplifies relationships; specialist models are costly and static. There is a need for integrated, scalable reasoning over supply-chain networks that can incorporate numerical data and news streams.

Method: Represent the supply chain as a knowledge graph and apply structural network science for retrieval. A graph traverser guided by network centrality scores extracts economically salient risk paths. An agentic architecture orchestrates graph retrieval with data from numerical factor tables and news streams. Introduce 'context shells'—descriptive templates that embed raw figures in natural language—to render quantitative data intelligible to the LLM.

Result: The approach enables the model to generate concise, explainable, and context-rich risk narratives in real-time without costly fine-tuning or a dedicated graph database.

Conclusion: Exploits the duality between networks and knowledge graphs to unify retrieval and reasoning for supply-chain risk analysis. It offers a lightweight, scalable solution that bridges RAG and specialist models, delivering real-time, interpretable risk analysis without heavy infrastructure.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with the complex, multi-modal, and
network-native data underlying financial risk. Standard Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) oversimplifies relationships, while specialist models are
costly and static. We address this gap with an LLM-centric agent framework for
supply chain risk analysis. Our core contribution is to exploit the inherent
duality between networks and knowledge graphs (KG). We treat the supply chain
network as a KG, allowing us to use structural network science principles for
retrieval. A graph traverser, guided by network centrality scores, efficiently
extracts the most economically salient risk paths. An agentic architecture
orchestrates this graph retrieval alongside data from numerical factor tables
and news streams. Crucially, it employs novel ``context shells'' -- descriptive
templates that embed raw figures in natural language -- to make quantitative
data fully intelligible to the LLM. This lightweight approach enables the model
to generate concise, explainable, and context-rich risk narratives in real-time
without costly fine-tuning or a dedicated graph database.

TL;DR: A 15B open-weights multimodal reasoning model, Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker, achieves frontier-level performance through a data-centric three-stage continual pre-training strategy starting from Pixtral-12B, without RL, enabling competitive results on image benchmarks with single-GPU deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether data-centric continual pre-training and thoughtful training design can achieve frontier-level multimodal reasoning at modest scale and limited compute.

Method: Three-stage approach: (1) depth upscaling to expand reasoning capacity without training from scratch; (2) staged continual pre-training—first establishing foundational text and vision understanding, then enhancing visual reasoning via targeted synthetic data addressing spatial structure, compositional understanding, and fine-grained perception; (3) high-quality text-only supervised fine-tuning on curated instruction-response pairs with explicit reasoning traces across mathematics, coding, science, and tool use. Starting point is Pixtral-12B; no reinforcement learning or preference optimization used. Model released with training recipes under MIT license.

Result: Achieves frontier-level performance: AI Index score of 52, matching DeepSeek-R1-0528; across ten image benchmarks, averages within five points of Gemini-2.5-Flash and Claude Sonnet-3.7; demonstrates competitive results under single-GPU deployment constraints and lower computational resource usage than larger models.

Conclusion: The study suggests a data-centric mid-training design can close substantial capability gaps without massive scaling, making frontier-level multimodal reasoning more accessible; model and training protocols released publicly to advance open-source research.

Abstract: We present Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker, a 15-billion parameter open-weights

that first develops foundational text and vision understanding, then enhances
visual reasoning through targeted synthetic data generation addressing spatial

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bridge introduces interdependent parallel LLM generation by treating batched hidden states as a single holistic tensor, adding a small number of parameters to enable cross-sequence information sharing. It yields higher accuracy and consistency than independent generations and scales to arbitrary generation widths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle inefficiency and suboptimal quality in parallel generation where multiple responses are produced independently, by enabling information sharing across sequences to improve overall quality.

Method: Recast batched LLM hidden states for N parallel generations as a holistic tensor and inject a small set of trainable parameters (2.8%-5.1% of model size). Train once to enable interdependent generation that scales to any width, compatible with post-generation aggregation techniques.

Result: Achieves up to ~50% relative gains in mean accuracy (over RL with verifiable rewards) and improved consistency of correct responses; performance surpasses independent generation across generation widths; parameter overhead remains small.

Conclusion: A general, scalable approach to parallel LLM inference that leverages cross-sequence information with minimal parameter overhead, enabling better results than independent parallel generation and compatible with various aggregation methods.

Abstract: Parallel LLM inference scaling involves sampling a set of $N>1$ responses for
a single input prompt. However, these $N$ parallel responses tend to be
generated independently from each other, partitioning compute resources and
leaving potentially useful information in one generation untapped by others.
This is in contrast to response length scaling where past computation is used
in all future steps. For higher quality responses and response sets, we propose
Bridge to generate interdependent responses in parallel by rethinking batched
LLM hidden states as holistic tensors rather than independent slices. With only
a small amount (2.8%-5.1%) of new parameters, Bridge improves the relative mean
accuracy gains from reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards by up to 50%
and boosts consistency of correct responses. Trained once, Bridge scales to any
generation width, all with greater performance than independent generations,
unlocking a more general mode of parallel scaling that effectively leverages
information between sequences, compatible with any post-generation aggregation
technique.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboPilot is a dual-thinking, closed-loop robotic manipulation framework that combines fast and slow reasoning with feedback and chain-of-thought guidance to improve robustness and performance on long-horizon tasks, evaluated on RoboPilot-Bench and real-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the limitations of open-loop planning that lacks feedback, resulting in poor robustness to environmental changes and error accumulation; enable adaptive, feedback-driven reasoning for complex manipulation in dynamic real-world settings.

Method: A dual-thinking closed-loop framework using primitive actions for structured planning combined with flexible action generation, augmented by feedback to trigger replanning. Chain-of-Thought reasoning guides high-level task planning and constrains low-level action generation. The system dynamically switches between fast and slow thinking to balance speed and accuracy. Evaluation uses RoboPilot-Bench (21 tasks across 10 categories) and real-world industrial-robot deployment.

Result: RoboPilot outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25.9% in task success rate and demonstrates robustness through real-world industrial deployment.

Conclusion: Integrating adaptive feedback, dual-thinking, and chain-of-thought planning yields robust, efficient manipulation capabilities for complex, long-horizon tasks in dynamic environments; the RoboPilot-Bench benchmark supports systematic robustness evaluation.

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in autonomous robotics, executing complex or
long-horizon tasks remains a fundamental challenge. Most current approaches
follow an open-loop paradigm with limited reasoning and no feedback, resulting
in poor robustness to environmental changes and severe error accumulation. We
present RoboPilot, a dual-thinking closed-loop framework for robotic
manipulation that supports adaptive reasoning for complex tasks in real-world
dynamic environments. RoboPilot leverages primitive actions for structured task
planning and flexible action generation, while introducing feedback to enable
replanning from dynamic changes and execution errors. Chain-of-Thought
reasoning further enhances high-level task planning and guides low-level action
generation. The system dynamically switches between fast and slow thinking to
balance efficiency and accuracy. To systematically evaluate the robustness of
RoboPilot in diverse robot manipulation scenarios, we introduce
RoboPilot-Bench, a benchmark spanning 21 tasks across 10 categories, including
infeasible-task recognition and failure recovery. Experiments show that
RoboPilot outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25.9\% in task success
rate, and the real-world deployment on an industrial robot further demonstrates
its robustness in real-world settings.

*Jorge Mendez-Mendez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Replacing key TAMP components with Gemini 2.5 Flash in 16 variants yields slower, less reliable planning than engineered planners; adding geometric detail can worsen task-planning errors, and faster non-reasoning LLMs often perform better when guided by TAMP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well LLM-based planning generalizes to robotics and whether semantic LLM knowledge can be integrated with formal task and motion planning (TAMP) in practice.

Method: Develop 16 Gemini-based planners by substituting key TAMP components; evaluate zero-shot across 4,950 problems in three domains.

Result: Gemini-based planners show lower success rates and longer planning times; geometric detail increases task-planning errors; faster non-reasoning LLM variants outperform slower reasoning variants when guided by the TAMP system.

Conclusion: Integrating LLMs into TAMP is nontrivial and highly sensitive to design choices; these experiments suggest engineered TAMP approaches may outperform Gemini-based substitutions, underscoring the need for careful integration strategies between LLMs and formal planning.

Abstract: Using large language models (LLMs) to solve complex robotics problems
requires understanding their planning capabilities. Yet while we know that LLMs
can plan on some problems, the extent to which these planning capabilities
cover the space of robotics tasks is unclear. One promising direction is to
integrate the semantic knowledge of LLMs with the formal reasoning of task and
motion planning (TAMP). However, the myriad of choices for how to integrate
LLMs within TAMP complicates the design of such systems. We develop 16
algorithms that use Gemini 2.5 Flash to substitute key TAMP components. Our
zero-shot experiments across 4,950 problems and three domains reveal that the
Gemini-based planners exhibit lower success rates and higher planning times
than their engineered counterparts. We show that providing geometric details
increases the number of task-planning errors compared to pure PDDL
descriptions, and that (faster) non-reasoning LLM variants outperform (slower)
reasoning variants in most cases, since the TAMP system can direct the LLM to
correct its mistakes.

*Alireza Aliyari,Gholamreza Vossoughi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI controller improves robustness and drastically reduces computation for exoskeleton control, outperforming NMPC-DNN under unseen disturbances while cutting joint torques and computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address robustness gaps and high computational load of nonlinear MPC in real-time robotic control, especially under disturbances or data-shift, by integrating a learning-based NMPC approximation with a simple PI correction.

Method: Train a deep neural network to approximate NMPC for a 3-DOF human-robot dynamic model (ankle, knee, hip) during squat; create a Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI by combining NMPC-DNN output with a PI controller; validate on an exoskeleton with >5.3 million training samples; compare against NMPC-DNN under unseen conditions; quantify joint torque reductions and computational cost.

Result: Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI achieves significantly lower tracking error than NMPC-DNN under unseen conditions; ankle/knee/hip RMS torque reductions of 30.9%, 41.8%, 29.7% respectively; computational cost reduced by 99.93% compared to NMPC; demonstrates robustness and efficiency.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid approach offers robust nonlinear control for exoskeletons with large computational savings, indicating potential for broader deployment in robotic systems where NMPC alone is impractical due to real-time constraints.

Abstract: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is a precise controller, but its
heavy computational load often prevents application in robotic systems. Some
studies have attempted to approximate NMPC using deep neural networks
(NMPC-DNN). However, in the presence of unexpected disturbances or when
operating conditions differ from training data, this approach lacks robustness,
leading to large tracking errors. To address this issue, for the first time,
the NMPC-DNN output is combined with a PI controller (Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI). The
proposed controller is validated by applying it to an exoskeleton robot during
squat movement, which has a complex dynamic model and has received limited
attention regarding robust nonlinear control design. A human-robot dynamic
model with three active joints (ankle, knee, hip) is developed, and more than
5.3 million training samples are used to train the DNN. The results show that,
under unseen conditions for the DNN, the tracking error in Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI
is significantly lower compared to NMPC-DNN. Moreover, human joint torques are
greatly reduced with the use of the exoskeleton, with RMS values for the
studied case reduced by 30.9%, 41.8%, and 29.7% at the ankle, knee, and hip,
respectively. In addition, the computational cost of Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI is
99.93% lower than that of NMPC.

### [161] [TGPO: Temporal Grounded Policy Optimization for Signal Temporal Logic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00225)
*Yue Meng,Fei Chen,Chuchu Fan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TGPO introduces a hierarchical, temporally-grounded RL method to solve general STL tasks by decomposing STL into timed subgoals and invariants, using a high-level time allocator and a low-level time-conditioned policy. It uses Metropolis-Hastings guided by a critic for temporally feasible exploration and achieves a substantial improvement over baselines across five domains (avg. +31.6% success).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STL’s non-Markovian, long-horizon specifications create sparse, delayed rewards that standard RL struggles with. Prior work either handles only restricted STL fragments or treats robustness as a sparse terminal reward, limiting general applicability. There is a need for a general framework that can plan temporally grounded subgoals and learn dense, stage-wise rewards.

Method: Decompose STL into timed subgoals and invariant constraints. A high-level policy allocates concrete time budgets for subgoals; a low-level time-conditioned policy learns to achieve the subsequences with dense rewards. At inference, sample multiple time allocations and pick the best rollout. Use the learned critic to guide high-level temporal search via Metropolis-Hastings sampling to focus exploration on temporally feasible solutions. Evaluated on five environments from navigation to manipulation, drones, and quadrupedal locomotion.

Result: TGPO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, especially in high-dimensional and long-horizon tasks, with an average 31.6% improvement in task success rate across the tested tasks.

Conclusion: TGPO provides a general, scalable approach to solving STL-based tasks by grounding temporality in a hierarchical policy with temporally-aware search. The method improves success rates across diverse domains and offers a practical pathway for applying STL to complex robotic tasks; code will be released at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Learning control policies for complex, long-horizon tasks is a central
challenge in robotics and autonomous systems. Signal Temporal Logic (STL)
offers a powerful and expressive language for specifying such tasks, but its
non-Markovian nature and inherent sparse reward make it difficult to be solved
via standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Prior RL approaches focus
only on limited STL fragments or use STL robustness scores as sparse terminal
rewards. In this paper, we propose TGPO, Temporal Grounded Policy Optimization,
to solve general STL tasks. TGPO decomposes STL into timed subgoals and
invariant constraints and provides a hierarchical framework to tackle the
problem. The high-level component of TGPO proposes concrete time allocations
for these subgoals, and the low-level time-conditioned policy learns to achieve
the sequenced subgoals using a dense, stage-wise reward signal. During
inference, we sample various time allocations and select the most promising
assignment for the policy network to rollout the solution trajectory. To foster
efficient policy learning for complex STL with multiple subgoals, we leverage
the learned critic to guide the high-level temporal search via
Metropolis-Hastings sampling, focusing exploration on temporally feasible
solutions. We conduct experiments on five environments, ranging from
low-dimensional navigation to manipulation, drone, and quadrupedal locomotion.
Under a wide range of STL tasks, TGPO significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines (especially for high-dimensional and long-horizon
cases), with an average of 31.6% improvement in task success rate compared to
the best baseline. The code will be available at

*Odichimnma Ezeji,Michael Ziegltrum,Giulio Turrisi,Tommaso Belvedere,Valerio Modugno*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A probabilistic safety layer for Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) called BC-MPPI adds a learned surrogate to constraints to probabilistically guarantee feasibility, guiding sampling away from unsafe trajectories; validated on a quadrotor with static/moving obstacles and integrated into verification-ready pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPPI is fast and gradient-free but lacks hard guarantees on constraint satisfaction; there is a need for verifiable safety in autonomous systems and compatibility with validation workflows.

Method: Attach a probabilistic surrogate to every state/input constraint. During replanning, the surrogate outputs the probability that a candidate trajectory is feasible; this probability scales the trajectory's weight, biasing sampling toward safe regions. Surrogate trained from 1000 offline simulations; no hand-tuned penalties or sample rejection; runtime safety score is a scalar artifact.

Result: Across 100–1500 rollouts, BC-MPPI preserves safety margins and satisfies the prescribed probability of violation. Demonstrated on a quadrotor in MuJoCo with static and moving obstacles.

Conclusion: The surrogate is a standalone, version-controlled artefact; the runtime safety score enables integration with verification-and-validation pipelines for certifiable autonomous systems.

Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control has recently emerged as a fast,
gradient-free alternative to model-predictive control in highly non-linear
robotic tasks, yet it offers no hard guarantees on constraint satisfaction. We
introduce Bayesian-Constraints MPPI (BC-MPPI), a lightweight safety layer that
attaches a probabilistic surrogate to every state and input constraint. At each
re-planning step the surrogate returns the probability that a candidate
trajectory is feasible; this joint probability scales the weight given to a
candidate, automatically down-weighting rollouts likely to collide or exceed
limits and pushing the sampling distribution toward the safe subset; no
hand-tuned penalty costs or explicit sample rejection required. We train the
surrogate from 1000 offline simulations and deploy the controller on a
quadrotor in MuJoCo with both static and moving obstacles. Across K in
[100,1500] rollouts BC-MPPI preserves safety margins while satisfying the
prescribed probability of violation. Because the surrogate is a stand-alone,
version-controlled artefact and the runtime safety score is a single scalar,
the approach integrates naturally with verification-and-validation pipelines
for certifiable autonomous systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MO-IRL models time-varying cost weights in human arm-reaching, achieving lower RMSE with phase-specific costs and good cross-subject generalization, suggesting dynamic, subject-independent cost structures and potential robotics applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover dynamic cost structures that govern human motor control during reaching, improve prediction accuracy with fewer demonstrations, and assess generalization across subjects.

Method: Apply Minimal Observation Inverse Reinforcement Learning (MO-IRL) to a planar two-link model using high-resolution motion capture. Segment trajectories into phases, learn phase-specific combinations of seven candidate costs, and iteratively refine weights by scaling trajectories in a max-entropy IRL framework. Compare to classical IRL, with ten trials per posture and multiple segment weight divisions; validate via cross-validation and unseen-subject testing.

Result: Average joint-angle RMSEs of 6.4° (six segments) and 5.6° (eight segments) versus 10.4° with a single static weight. Unseen subject validation ~8° RMSE, indicating robust generalization. Learned weights emphasize acceleration minimization at movement onset/termination, aligning with smoothness in biological motion.

Conclusion: MO-IRL can efficiently uncover dynamic, subject-independent cost structures underlying human motor control, with potential applications for humanoid robots.

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Minimal Observation Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (MO-IRL) to model and predict human arm-reaching
movements with time-varying cost weights. Using a planar two-link biomechanical
model and high-resolution motion-capture data from subjects performing a
pointing task, we segment each trajectory into multiple phases and learn
phase-specific combinations of seven candidate cost functions. MO-IRL
iteratively refines cost weights by scaling observed and generated trajectories
in the maximum entropy IRL formulation, greatly reducing the number of required
demonstrations and convergence time compared to classical IRL approaches.
Training on ten trials per posture yields average joint-angle Root Mean Squared
Errors (RMSE) of 6.4 deg and 5.6 deg for six- and eight-segment weight
divisions, respectively, versus 10.4 deg using a single static weight.
Cross-validation on remaining trials and, for the first time, inter-subject
validation on an unseen subject's 20 trials, demonstrates comparable predictive
accuracy, around 8 deg RMSE, indicating robust generalization. Learned weights
emphasize joint acceleration minimization during movement onset and
termination, aligning with smoothness principles observed in biological motion.
These results suggest that MO-IRL can efficiently uncover dynamic,
subject-independent cost structures underlying human motor control, with
potential applications for humanoid robots.

*Linjin He,Xinda Qi,Dong Chen,Zhaojian Li,Xiaobo Tan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DiSA-IQL extends implicit Q-learning with distribution-shift robustness for offline learning in soft robot control, penalizing unreliable state-action pairs to mitigate distribution shift and outperform baselines on in-/out-of-distribution goal-reaching tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL for soft robots is attractive for safety and practicality, but distribution shift harms generalization; current model-based, bio-inspired or vanilla offline RL have limitations; there is a need for robust offline methods for soft robots.

Method: Proposes DiSA-IQL, an extension of IQL that incorporates robustness modulation by penalizing unreliable state-action pairs to reduce distribution shift effects.

Result: Evaluated on goal-reaching tasks in in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings; DiSA-IQL consistently outperforms BC, CQL, and vanilla IQL; improvements in success rates, smoother trajectories, robustness; code open-source.

Conclusion: DiSA-IQL offers a more robust offline RL approach for soft robot control under distribution shifts; supports reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Soft snake robots offer remarkable flexibility and adaptability in complex
environments, yet their control remains challenging due to highly nonlinear
dynamics. Existing model-based and bio-inspired controllers rely on simplified
assumptions that limit performance. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has
recently emerged as a promising alternative, but online training is often
impractical because of costly and potentially damaging real-world interactions.
Offline RL provides a safer option by leveraging pre-collected datasets, but it
suffers from distribution shift, which degrades generalization to unseen
scenarios. To overcome this challenge, we propose DiSA-IQL
(Distribution-Shift-Aware Implicit Q-Learning), an extension of IQL that
incorporates robustness modulation by penalizing unreliable state-action pairs
to mitigate distribution shift. We evaluate DiSA-IQL on goal-reaching tasks
across two settings: in-distribution and out-of-distribution evaluation.
Simulation results show that DiSA-IQL consistently outperforms baseline models,
including Behavior Cloning (BC), Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), and vanilla
IQL, achieving higher success rates, smoother trajectories, and improved
robustness. The codes are open-sourced to support reproducibility and to
facilitate further research in offline RL for soft robot control.

*Shounak Sural,Charles Kekeh,Wenliang Liu,Federico Pecora,Mouhacine Benosman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces PINCoDE, a physics-informed neural CDE framework for long-horizon, multi-robot trajectory forecasting; scalable to 100 robots; achieves ADE <0.5 m for a 1-minute horizon; shows 2.7x pose-error reduction over 4 minutes with curriculum learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of long-horizon motion forecasting for multiple autonomous robots due to non-linear agent interactions, error accumulation, and continuous-time dynamics. Seeks useful learned dynamics for travel time prediction, planning, and generative simulation by integrating physics priors.

Method: Uses neural Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) to model continuous-time multi-robot dynamics, augmented with physics-informed constraints. The model is conditioned on future goals, learns differential equation parameters, and scales from 10 to 100 robots without extra parameters. Training includes curriculum learning.

Result: Achieves average displacement error (ADE) below 0.5 meters for a 1-minute horizon. Scales from 10 to 100 robots without additional parameters. Curriculum learning yields a 2.7× reduction in forecasted pose error over 4-minute horizons compared to analytical models.

Conclusion: PINCoDE demonstrates effective continuous-time, physics-informed long-horizon trajectory forecasting for multi-agent systems, with scalable model size and significant accuracy gains via curriculum learning.

Abstract: Long-horizon motion forecasting for multiple autonomous robots is challenging
due to non-linear agent interactions, compounding prediction errors, and
continuous-time evolution of dynamics. Learned dynamics of such a system can be
useful in various applications such as travel time prediction,
prediction-guided planning and generative simulation. In this work, we aim to
develop an efficient trajectory forecasting model conditioned on multi-agent
goals. Motivated by the recent success of physics-guided deep learning for
partially known dynamical systems, we develop a model based on neural
Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) for long-horizon motion forecasting.
Unlike discrete-time methods such as RNNs and transformers, neural CDEs operate
in continuous time, allowing us to combine physics-informed constraints and
biases to jointly model multi-robot dynamics. Our approach, named PINCoDE
(Physics-Informed Neural Controlled Differential Equations), learns
differential equation parameters that can be used to predict the trajectories
of a multi-agent system starting from an initial condition. PINCoDE is
conditioned on future goals and enforces physics constraints for robot motion
over extended periods of time. We adopt a strategy that scales our model from
10 robots to 100 robots without the need for additional model parameters, while
producing predictions with an average ADE below 0.5 m for a 1-minute horizon.
Furthermore, progressive training with curriculum learning for our PINCoDE
model results in a 2.7X reduction of forecasted pose error over 4 minute
horizons compared to analytical models.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VLA-RFT uses a data-driven world model as a controllable simulator to fine-tune Vision-Language-Action models with reinforcement learning, achieving high sample efficiency and robustness under distribution shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely heavily on imitation learning, which causes compounding errors and poor robustness when faced with distribution shifts. RL can mitigate these issues but is costly due to real-world data requirements or sim-to-real gaps. A data-efficient post-training approach is needed.

Method: Train a world model on real interaction data to predict future observations conditioned on actions, turning it into a controllable simulator. Use policy rollouts with dense, trajectory-level rewards derived from goal-achieving references, enabling efficient fine-tuning with fewer than 400 steps.

Result: VLA-RFT surpasses strong supervised baselines and is more efficient than simulator-based RL. It shows strong robustness under perturbations and maintains stable task execution, demonstrating improved generalization and robustness for VLA models.

Conclusion: World-model-based reinforcement fine-tuning offers a practical post-training paradigm to enhance the generalization and robustness of Vision-Language-Action models.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable embodied decision-making but rely
heavily on imitation learning, leading to compounding errors and poor
robustness under distribution shift. Reinforcement learning (RL) can mitigate
these issues yet typically demands costly real-world interactions or suffers
from sim-to-real gaps. We introduce VLA-RFT, a reinforcement fine-tuning
framework that leverages a data-driven world model as a controllable simulator.
Trained from real interaction data, the simulator predicts future visual
observations conditioned on actions, allowing policy rollouts with dense,
trajectory-level rewards derived from goal-achieving references. This design
delivers an efficient and action-aligned learning signal, drastically lowering
sample requirements. With fewer than 400 fine-tuning steps, VLA-RFT surpasses
strong supervised baselines and achieves greater efficiency than
simulator-based RL. Moreover, it exhibits strong robustness under perturbed
conditions, sustaining stable task execution. Our results establish
world-model-based RFT as a practical post-training paradigm to enhance the
generalization and robustness of VLA models. For more details, please refer to

### [167] [Seeing through Uncertainty: Robust Task-Oriented Optimization in Visual Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00441)
*Yiyuan Pan,Yunzhe Xu,Zhe Liu,Hesheng Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NeuRO introduces an integrated learning-to-optimize framework that couples perception with robust optimization for long-horizon visual navigation under data scarcity. It uses Partially Input Convex Neural Networks (PICNNs) with conformal calibration to create convex uncertainty sets that parameterize constraints, and reformulates planning under partial observability as a robust optimization problem to enable uncertainty-aware, transferable policies. It achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in generalization to unseen environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity leads to overfitting and poor generalization in visually-guided navigation. Increasing architectural complexity often harms performance in small-sample regimes. There is a need to tightly integrate perception and planning under uncertainty to enable robust, transferable policies for long-horizon tasks.

Method: NeuRO tightly couples perception networks with downstream task-level robust optimization. It converts noisy visual predictions under limited data into convex uncertainty sets via PICNNs calibrated with conformal methods, directly parameterizing optimization constraints. It then reformulates planning under partial observability as a robust optimization problem to produce uncertainty-aware policies that can transfer across environments.

Result: Extensive experiments on unordered and sequential multi-object navigation tasks show NeuRO achieving state-of-the-art performance, with strong generalization to unseen environments.

Conclusion: NeuRO represents a significant step toward robust, generalizable autonomous agents by integrating perception with task-level robust optimization, reducing data demands and improving cross-environment transfer.

Abstract: Visual navigation is a fundamental problem in embodied AI, yet practical
deployments demand long-horizon planning capabilities to address
multi-objective tasks. A major bottleneck is data scarcity: policies learned
from limited data often overfit and fail to generalize OOD. Existing neural
network-based agents typically increase architectural complexity that
paradoxically become counterproductive in the small-sample regime. This paper
introduce NeuRO, a integrated learning-to-optimize framework that tightly
couples perception networks with downstream task-level robust optimization.
Specifically, NeuRO addresses core difficulties in this integration: (i) it
transforms noisy visual predictions under data scarcity into convex uncertainty
sets using Partially Input Convex Neural Networks (PICNNs) with conformal
calibration, which directly parameterize the optimization constraints; and (ii)
it reformulates planning under partial observability as a robust optimization
problem, enabling uncertainty-aware policies that transfer across environments.
Extensive experiments on both unordered and sequential multi-object navigation
tasks demonstrate that NeuRO establishes SoTA performance, particularly in
generalization to unseen environments. Our work thus presents a significant
advancement for developing robust, generalizable autonomous agents.

*Run Su,Hao Fu,Shuai Zhou,Yingao Fu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Offline-to-online RL for robot social navigation using Return-to-Go (RTG) prediction within a causal Transformer, featuring spatiotemporal fusion and a hybrid offline-online sampling strategy to reduce distribution shifts and improve robustness. Empirical results in simulation show higher success and fewer collisions than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL for robot social navigation suffers from uncertain pedestrian behavior and limited interaction during training, leading to suboptimal exploration and distributional shift when deployed online. The aim is to bridge offline training and online deployment by predicting RTG and guiding fine-tuning.

Method: Incorporates RTG prediction into a causal Transformer with a spatiotemporal fusion module that jointly encodes temporal pedestrian motion patterns and spatial crowd dynamics. Adds a hybrid offline-online experience sampling mechanism to stabilize policy updates during fine-tuning and balance prior knowledge with real-time adaptation.

Result: Simulated experiments show higher success rates and lower collision rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines, indicating improved navigation policy robustness and adaptability.

Conclusion: The proposed offline-to-online fine-tuning RL framework with RTG-augmented causal Transformer and hybrid sampling enhances robustness and adaptability of robot social navigation, bringing more reliable performance in real-world settings.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising framework for
addressing robot social navigation challenges. However, inherent uncertainties
in pedestrian behavior and limited environmental interaction during training
often lead to suboptimal exploration and distributional shifts between offline
training and online deployment. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes a novel offline-to-online fine-tuning RL algorithm for robot social
navigation by integrating Return-to-Go (RTG) prediction into a causal
Transformer architecture. Our algorithm features a spatiotem-poral fusion model
designed to precisely estimate RTG values in real-time by jointly encoding
temporal pedestrian motion patterns and spatial crowd dynamics. This RTG
prediction framework mitigates distribution shift by aligning offline policy
training with online environmental interactions. Furthermore, a hybrid
offline-online experience sampling mechanism is built to stabilize policy
updates during fine-tuning, ensuring balanced integration of pre-trained
knowledge and real-time adaptation. Extensive experiments in simulated social
navigation environments demonstrate that our method achieves a higher success
rate and lower collision rate compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These
results underscore the efficacy of our algorithm in enhancing navigation policy
robustness and adaptability. This work paves the way for more reliable and
adaptive robotic navigation systems in real-world applications.

### [169] [From Human Hands to Robot Arms: Manipulation Skills Transfer via Trajectory Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00491)
*Han Zhou,Jinjin Cao,Liyuan Ma,Xueji Fang,Guo-jun Qi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Traj2Action introduces a 3D trajectory—an intermediate representation—to bridge the morphology gap between humans and robots for skill transfer. It first learns a coarse trajectory and then uses a co-denoising framework to convert it into robot-specific actions, enabling scalable transfer from human demonstrations to real robot manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The key bottleneck in learning diverse real-world manipulation is reliance on costly teleoperation. Human videos offer scale but transferring knowledge is hindered by embodiment mismatch. Traj2Action aims to close this gap by using a common 3D trajectory of the task endpoint as a shared representation.

Method: Train a two-stage pipeline: (1) generate a coarse 3D endpoint trajectory (motion plan) using both human and robot data; (2) condition a co-denoising generative process to synthesize precise robot actions (orientation, gripper state) guided by the trajectory, producing robot-specific controls.

Result: Real-world experiments on a Franka robot show performance gains of up to 27% and 22.25% over a π0 baseline for short- and long-horizon tasks, respectively, with results improving as human data scales in policy learning.

Conclusion: Traj2Action effectively bridges the human-robot embodiment gap via a unified 3D trajectory intermediate representation, enabling scalable transfer of manipulation knowledge and improving real-world robot performance; code/video available on the project page.

Abstract: Learning diverse manipulation skills for real-world robots is severely
bottlenecked by the reliance on costly and hard-to-scale teleoperated
demonstrations. While human videos offer a scalable alternative, effectively
transferring manipulation knowledge is fundamentally hindered by the
significant morphological gap between human and robotic embodiments. To address
this challenge and facilitate skill transfer from human to robot, we introduce
Traj2Action,a novel framework that bridges this embodiment gap by using the 3D
trajectory of the operational endpoint as a unified intermediate
representation, and then transfers the manipulation knowledge embedded in this
trajectory to the robot's actions. Our policy first learns to generate a coarse
trajectory, which forms an high-level motion plan by leveraging both human and
robot data. This plan then conditions the synthesis of precise, robot-specific
actions (e.g., orientation and gripper state) within a co-denoising framework.
Extensive real-world experiments on a Franka robot demonstrate that Traj2Action
boosts the performance by up to 27% and 22.25% over $\pi_0$ baseline on short-
and long-horizon real-world tasks, and achieves significant gains as human data
scales in robot policy learning. Our project website, featuring code and video
demonstrations, is available at

### [170] [Two stage GNSS outlier detection for factor graph optimization based GNSS-RTK/INS/odometer fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00524)
*Baoshan Song,Penggao Yan,Xiao Xia,Yihan Zhong,Weisong Wen,Li-Ta Hsu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Two-stage outlier detection for GNSS-RTK-INS-odometer fusion using a Doppler-based GNSS-only stage and an IMU/odometer-informed stage within a factor-graph framework; achieves significant robustness and RMSE improvement (0.52 m to 0.30 m) in urban canyons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNSS positioning in complex environments is severely affected by NLOS, multipath, and blockages, which introduce large pseudo-range outliers that degrade RTK performance and tightly coupled GNSS-INS/odometer fusion.

Method: Stage 1: Use Doppler measurements for GNSS-only outlier detection since Doppler is less sensitive to multipath/NLOS than pseudo-range. Stage 2: Use pre-integrated IMU and odometer constraints to generate predicted double-difference pseudo-range, enabling refined outlier rejection. The two stages are integrated within a factor graph optimization framework for a tightly coupled GNSS-RTK-INS-odometer system.

Result: The framework reduces the impact of pseudo-range outliers, improving positioning accuracy and consistency. In a deep urban canyon test, the RMSE of GNSS-RTK/INS/odometer fusion improved from 0.52 m to 0.30 m (42.3% improvement).

Conclusion: The two-stage outlier-detection approach enhances robustness against pseudo-range errors and degraded satellite quality, enabling more reliable GNSS-RTK-INS-odometer fusion in challenging environments.

Abstract: Reliable GNSS positioning in complex environments remains a critical
challenge due to non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation, multipath effects, and
frequent signal blockages. These effects can easily introduce large outliers
into the raw pseudo-range measurements, which significantly degrade the
performance of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) real-time kinematic
(RTK) positioning and limit the effectiveness of tightly coupled GNSS-based
integrated navigation system. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage
outlier detection method and apply the method in a tightly coupled GNSS-RTK,
inertial navigation system (INS), and odometer integration based on factor
graph optimization (FGO). In the first stage, Doppler measurements are employed
to detect pseudo-range outliers in a GNSS-only manner, since Doppler is less
sensitive to multipath and NLOS effects compared with pseudo-range, making it a
more stable reference for detecting sudden inconsistencies. In the second
stage, pre-integrated inertial measurement units (IMU) and odometer constraints
are used to generate predicted double-difference pseudo-range measurements,
which enable a more refined identification and rejection of remaining outliers.
By combining these two complementary stages, the system achieves improved
robustness against both gross pseudo-range errors and degraded satellite
measuring quality. The experimental results demonstrate that the two-stage
detection framework significantly reduces the impact of pseudo-range outliers,
and leads to improved positioning accuracy and consistency compared with
representative baseline approaches. In the deep urban canyon test, the outlier
mitigation method has limits the RMSE of GNSS-RTK/INS/odometer fusion from 0.52
m to 0.30 m, with 42.3% improvement.

*Yen-Ling Tai,Yi-Ru Yang,Kuan-Ting Yu,Yu-Wei Chao,Yi-Ting Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GRITS introduces a spillage-aware guided diffusion policy for robot food scooping that jointly learns a spillage predictor and uses it as a differentiable guide during diffusion sampling to steer trajectories toward safer scooping actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic food scooping is prone to spillage due to diverse and dynamic food states; existing learning-from-demonstration methods struggle to generalize, reducing reliability and task success.

Method: Train a spillage predictor on simulated spillage scenarios across four primitive shapes with varied physical properties; integrate predictor as a differentiable guidance signal in a guided diffusion policy to steer sampling toward low-spillage trajectories while maintaining task success; validate on a real robotic platform with six training categories and ten unseen categories.

Result: GRITS achieves 82% task success and 4% spillage on unseen categories, reducing spillage by over 40% compared to baselines without guidance.

Conclusion: Guided diffusion with a spillage predictor provides effective and generalizable control for robotic food scooping, improving reliability and reducing spillage, with demonstrated real-world applicability.

Abstract: Robotic food scooping is a critical manipulation skill for food preparation
and service robots. However, existing robot learning algorithms, especially
learn-from-demonstration methods, still struggle to handle diverse and dynamic
food states, which often results in spillage and reduced reliability. In this
work, we introduce GRITS: A Spillage-Aware Guided Diffusion Policy for Robot
Food Scooping Tasks. This framework leverages guided diffusion policy to
minimize food spillage during scooping and to ensure reliable transfer of food
items from the initial to the target location. Specifically, we design a
spillage predictor that estimates the probability of spillage given current
observation and action rollout. The predictor is trained on a simulated dataset
with food spillage scenarios, constructed from four primitive shapes (spheres,
cubes, cones, and cylinders) with varied physical properties such as mass,
friction, and particle size. At inference time, the predictor serves as a
differentiable guidance signal, steering the diffusion sampling process toward
safer trajectories while preserving task success. We validate GRITS on a
real-world robotic food scooping platform. GRITS is trained on six food
categories and evaluated on ten unseen categories with different shapes and
quantities. GRITS achieves an 82% task success rate and a 4% spillage rate,
reducing spillage by over 40% compared to baselines without guidance, thereby
demonstrating its effectiveness.

*Pietro Mazzaglia,Cansu Sancaktar,Markus Peschl,Daniel Dijkman*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HyT enables learning from chain-of-thoughts in vision-language-action models but allows bypassing them at inference, providing performance benefits with flexible latency in robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-thought improves reasoning but increases output length and latency, which is problematic for real-world robotic manipulation. There is a need to gain CoT benefits without mandatory CoT during inference and to support flexible outputs.

Method: Introduce Hybrid Training (HyT): train VLAs to learn from thoughts and forecast diverse outputs (thoughts, actions, or instructions). At inference time, selectively generate thoughts, directly predict actions, or follow instructions, enabling latency-flexible deployment while retaining CoT gains.

Result: Evaluations on simulated benchmarks and real-world robotic experiments indicate that HyT preserves performance benefits from CoT training while enabling flexible inference (actions directly, thoughts, or instructions) and reducing latency.

Conclusion: HyT provides a practical approach to leverage embodied reasoning without mandatory inference-time CoT, offering latency-flexible and task-adaptive deployment for VLAs in robotics.

Abstract: Using Large Language Models to produce intermediate thoughts, a.k.a.
Chain-of-thought (CoT), before providing an answer has been a successful recipe
for solving complex language tasks. In robotics, similar embodied CoT
strategies, generating thoughts before actions, have also been shown to lead to
improved performance when using Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs). As these
techniques increase the length of the model's generated outputs to include the
thoughts, the inference time is negatively affected. Delaying an agent's
actions in real-world executions, as in robotic manipulation settings, strongly
affects the usability of a method, as tasks require long sequences of actions.
However, is the generation of long chains-of-thought a strong prerequisite for
achieving performance improvements? In this work, we explore the idea of Hybrid
Training (HyT), a framework that enables VLAs to learn from thoughts and
benefit from the associated performance gains, while enabling the possibility
to leave out CoT generation during inference. Furthermore, by learning to
conditionally predict a diverse set of outputs, HyT supports flexibility at
inference time, enabling the model to either predict actions directly, generate
thoughts or follow instructions. We evaluate the proposed method in a series of
simulated benchmarks and real-world experiments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Knowledge graphs model driving scenes to assess dataset coverage and model competence; applied to NuPlan to identify gaps and improve explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure safe and trustworthy use of ML in automated driving by knowing what training data covers and where gaps exist.

Method: Represent driving data as knowledge graphs with entities and relations, query sub-scene configurations, and estimate competence from coverage and scene complexity; apply to NuPlan dataset.

Result: Demonstrated feasibility on NuPlan: sub-scene coverage informs estimated competence and provides human-understandable explanations about dataset content and gaps.

Conclusion: Graph-based dataset analysis can monitor ML competence and support safer, more trustworthy deployment of automated driving systems.

Abstract: Automated driving functions increasingly rely on machine learning for tasks
like perception and trajectory planning, requiring large, relevant datasets.
The performance of these algorithms depends on how closely the training data
matches the task. To ensure reliable functioning, it is crucial to know what is
included in the dataset to assess the trained model's operational risk. We aim
to enhance the safe use of machine learning in automated driving by developing
a method to recognize situations that an automated vehicle has not been
sufficiently trained on. This method also improves explainability by describing
the dataset at a human-understandable level. We propose modeling driving data
as knowledge graphs, representing driving scenes with entities and their
relationships. These graphs are queried for specific sub-scene configurations
to check their occurrence in the dataset. We estimate a vehicle's competence in
a driving scene by considering the coverage and complexity of sub-scene
configurations in the training set. Higher complexity scenes require greater
coverage for high competence. We apply this method to the NuPlan dataset,
modeling it with knowledge graphs and analyzing the coverage of specific
driving scenes. This approach helps monitor the competence of machine learning
models trained on the dataset, which is essential for trustworthy AI to be
deployed in automated driving.

*Federico Oliva,Tom Shaked,Daniele Carnevale,Amir Degani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An optimization-based observer design framework (TBOD) for nonlinear systems and multi-sensor fusion that tunes observer parameters using pre-recorded measurement trajectories, inspired by Moving Horizon Estimation; demonstrated on rover localization with IMU and UWB, achieving EKF-like position accuracy but improved orientation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient, modular, and tunable observers for nonlinear systems with multiple sensors—addressing the challenge of manual, ad-hoc observer design and the need for accurate sensor fusion.

Method: Parametrize observer dynamics and optimize the parameters over a finite set of nominal measurement trajectories. Leverages ideas from Moving Horizon Estimators to tune the observer and fuse sensors in a lightweight, modular fashion.

Result: Applied to a terrestrial rover localization task using IMU and UWB ranging; validated against a motion-capture system. TBOD matched EKF in position accuracy and significantly improved orientation estimation.

Conclusion: TBOD provides a lightweight, general-purpose sensor fusion and observer-design framework that is easy to tune and can handle general sensors in a modular way, with good position accuracy and enhanced orientation estimation compared to a baseline EKF.

Abstract: Efficient observer design and accurate sensor fusion are key in state
estimation. This work proposes an optimization-based methodology, termed
Trajectory Based Optimization Design (TBOD), allowing the user to easily design
observers for general nonlinear systems and multi-sensor setups. Starting from
parametrized observer dynamics, the proposed method considers a finite set of
pre-recorded measurement trajectories from the nominal plant and exploits them
to tune the observer parameters through numerical optimization. This research
hinges on the classic observer's theory and Moving Horizon Estimators
methodology. Optimization is exploited to ease the observer's design, providing
the user with a lightweight, general-purpose sensor fusion methodology. TBOD's
main characteristics are the capability to handle general sensors efficiently
and in a modular way and, most importantly, its straightforward tuning
procedure. The TBOD's performance is tested on a terrestrial rover localization
problem, combining IMU and ranging sensors provided by Ultra Wide Band
antennas, and validated through a motion-capture system. Comparison with an
Extended Kalman Filter is also provided, matching its position estimation
accuracy and significantly improving in the orientation.

It introduces a spatio-temporal feature-instructed pose estimation with a temporal distance field for 3D map matching and a motion-aware hierarchical fusion/optimization. Reported results: 1.34° rotation, 6.9 mm translation, 10.08 ms latency, outperforming baselines by >50%.

Motivation: GPS signals are unreliable in urban environments due to attenuation and multipath; urban 3D maps enable VPS but current methods struggle with accuracy and efficiency during landing.

Method: Proposes EV-Pose with (1) a spatio-temporal feature-instructed pose estimation module that builds a temporal distance field for 3D map matching, and (2) a motion-aware hierarchical fusion and optimization scheme that exploits drone motion in early event filtering and later pose optimization, leveraging an event camera.

Result: Achieves rotation accuracy of 1.34 degrees, translation accuracy of 6.9 mm, tracking latency of 10.08 ms, and >50% improvement over baselines.

Conclusion: EV-Pose enables accurate and efficient 6-DoF pose tracking for drone landing in urban environments when using VPS, with a demonstrable performance advantage.

Abstract: After years of growth, drone-based delivery is transforming logistics. At its
core, real-time 6-DoF drone pose tracking enables precise flight control and
accurate drone landing. With the widespread availability of urban 3D maps, the
Visual Positioning Service (VPS), a mobile pose estimation system, has been
adapted to enhance drone pose tracking during the landing phase, as
conventional systems like GPS are unreliable in urban environments due to
signal attenuation and multi-path propagation. However, deploying the current
VPS on drones faces limitations in both estimation accuracy and efficiency. In
this work, we redesign drone-oriented VPS with the event camera and introduce
EV-Pose to enable accurate, high-frequency 6-DoF pose tracking for accurate
drone landing. EV-Pose introduces a spatio-temporal feature-instructed pose
estimation module that extracts a temporal distance field to enable 3D point
map matching for pose estimation; and a motion-aware hierarchical fusion and
optimization scheme to enhance the above estimation in accuracy and efficiency,
by utilizing drone motion in the \textit{early stage} of event filtering and
the \textit{later stage} of pose optimization. Evaluation shows that EV-Pose
achieves a rotation accuracy of 1.34$\degree$ and a translation accuracy of
6.9$mm$ with a tracking latency of 10.08$ms$, outperforming baselines by
$>$50\%, \tmcrevise{thus enabling accurate drone landings.} Demo:

### [177] [HAMLET: Switch your Vision-Language-Action Model into a History-Aware Policy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00695)
*Myungkyu Koo,Daewon Choi,Taeyoung Kim,Kyungmin Lee,Changyeon Kim,Youngyo Seo,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HAMLET adds memory-based history conditioning to vision-language-action models via moment tokens and a lightweight memory module, enabling history-aware action prediction and improving performance on history-dependent robotic manipulation benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robotic manipulation tasks are inherently history-dependent, and existing VLA models typically rely only on the current observation, limiting guidance from past context.

Method: Introduce moment tokens that compactly encode perceptual information at each timestep, initialized via time-contrastive learning to capture temporally distinctive cues. A lightweight memory module aggregates past moment tokens into memory features used for action prediction, transforming a state-of-the-art VLA into a history-aware policy.

Result: On GR00T N1.5 real-world tasks, HAMLET achieves 76.4% average success on history-dependent tasks, surpassing the baseline by 47.2%. In RoboCasa Kitchen (100-demo setup) performance improves from 64.1% to 66.4%, and in LIBERO from 95.6% to 97.7%.

Conclusion: HAMLET demonstrates that scalable history-aware adaptations of VLAs can substantially improve performance on history-dependent manipulation tasks and benchmarks, validating the value of incorporating temporal context into these models.

Abstract: Inherently, robotic manipulation tasks are history-dependent: leveraging past
context could be beneficial. However, most existing Vision-Language-Action
models (VLAs) have been designed without considering this aspect, i.e., they
rely solely on the current observation, ignoring preceding context. In this
paper, we propose HAMLET, a scalable framework to adapt VLAs to attend to the
historical context during action prediction. Specifically, we introduce moment
tokens that compactly encode perceptual information at each timestep. Their
representations are initialized with time-contrastive learning, allowing them
to better capture temporally distinctive aspects. Next, we employ a lightweight
memory module that integrates the moment tokens across past timesteps into
memory features, which are then leveraged for action prediction. Through
empirical evaluation, we show that HAMLET successfully transforms a
state-of-the-art VLA into a history-aware policy, especially demonstrating
significant improvements on long-horizon tasks that require historical context.
In particular, on top of GR00T N1.5, HAMLET achieves an average success rate of
76.4% on history-dependent real-world tasks, surpassing the baseline
performance by 47.2%. Furthermore, HAMLET pushes prior art performance from
64.1% to 66.4% on RoboCasa Kitchen (100-demo setup) and from 95.6% to 97.7% on
LIBERO, highlighting its effectiveness even under generic robot-manipulation
benchmarks.

*Giovanni Minelli,Giulio Turrisi,Victor Barasuol,Claudio Semini*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A Cross-State Transition Attention Transformer with a State Transition Attention (STA) mechanism and temporal masking improves robustness of supervised robotic manipulation policies to execution variations, outperforming cross-attention and standard temporal models, with >2x gains on precision-critical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy learning from demonstrations remains challenging when execution variations occur; while attention on historical context helps, existing models treat all past states uniformly and do not explicitly model temporal evolution patterns like failure and recovery.

Method: Propose a Cross-State Transition Attention Transformer that uses a novel State Transition Attention (STA) module to modulate attention weights based on learned state evolution; combine this with temporal masking during training by randomly removing visual information from recent timesteps to encourage temporal reasoning from history.

Result: In simulation, STA consistently outperforms standard cross-attention and temporal models (TCN, LSTM) across tasks, achieving more than 2x improvement over cross-attention on precision-critical tasks.

Conclusion: Capturing state evolution in attention and applying temporal masking during training yields more robust manipulation policies under execution variations, suggesting broad applicability to learning from demonstrations with complex temporal structures.

Abstract: Learning robotic manipulation policies through supervised learning from
demonstrations remains challenging when policies encounter execution variations
not explicitly covered during training. While incorporating historical context
through attention mechanisms can improve robustness, standard approaches
process all past states in a sequence without explicitly modeling the temporal
structure that demonstrations may include, such as failure and recovery
patterns. We propose a Cross-State Transition Attention Transformer that
employs a novel State Transition Attention (STA) mechanism to modulate standard
attention weights based on learned state evolution patterns, enabling policies
to better adapt their behavior based on execution history. Our approach
combines this structured attention with temporal masking during training, where
visual information is randomly removed from recent timesteps to encourage
temporal reasoning from historical context. Evaluation in simulation shows that
STA consistently outperforms standard cross-attention and temporal modeling
approaches like TCN and LSTM networks across all tasks, achieving more than 2x
improvement over cross-attention on precision-critical tasks.

### [182] [RTFF: Random-to-Target Fabric Flattening Policy using Dual-Arm Manipulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00814)
*Kai Tang,Dipankar Bhattacharya,Hang Xu,Fuyuki Tokuda,Norman C. Tien,Kazuhiro Kosuge*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces RTFF, a hybrid IL-VS policy with mesh-based representations and MACT Transformer for robust fabric flattening, achieving zero-shot target alignment on a real dual-arm system with good generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fabric deformability, effectively infinite DOF, and occlusions (wrinkles, folds, EE/arm) make reliable flattening/alignment difficult in garment manipulation; need a generalizable policy that can map random wrinkled fabric states to wrinkle-free targets.

Method: A hybrid Imitaion Learning-Visual Servoing (IL-VS) framework. IL provides coarse alignment using explicit fabric models; VS refines to exact target. A template-based mesh offers target representation, wrinkle-aware geometry prediction, and consistent vertex correspondence. A Transformer-based MACT (Mesh Action Chunking Transformer) conditions mesh information for the policy.

Result: Real dual-arm tele-operation demonstrations show zero-shot alignment to various wrinkle-free targets, high accuracy, and strong generalization across fabrics and scales.

Conclusion: The RTFF framework effectively combines model-based coarse alignment with vision-based fine alignment using a mesh-centric representation and transformer-based policy, enabling robust, generalizable fabric manipulation for garment production.

Abstract: Robotic fabric manipulation in garment production for sewing, cutting, and
ironing requires reliable flattening and alignment, yet remains challenging due
to fabric deformability, effectively infinite degrees of freedom, and frequent
occlusions from wrinkles, folds, and the manipulator's End-Effector (EE) and
arm. To address these issues, this paper proposes the first Random-to-Target
Fabric Flattening (RTFF) policy, which aligns a random wrinkled fabric state to
an arbitrary wrinkle-free target state. The proposed policy adopts a hybrid
Imitation Learning-Visual Servoing (IL-VS) framework, where IL learns with
explicit fabric models for coarse alignment of the wrinkled fabric toward a
wrinkle-free state near the target, and VS ensures fine alignment to the
target. Central to this framework is a template-based mesh that offers precise
target state representation, wrinkle-aware geometry prediction, and consistent
vertex correspondence across RTFF manipulation steps, enabling robust
manipulation and seamless IL-VS switching. Leveraging the power of mesh, a
novel IL solution for RTFF-Mesh Action Chunking Transformer (MACT)-is then
proposed by conditioning the mesh information into a Transformer-based policy.
The RTFF policy is validated on a real dual-arm tele-operation system, showing
zero-shot alignment to different targets, high accuracy, and strong
generalization across fabrics and scales. Project website:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes PoPAN, a lifecycle-aware Product-Process-Resource (PPR) model embedded as a digital shadow in the Asset Administration Shell, with AutomationML serialization, demonstrated via EV battery disassembly for remanufacturing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial standards typically cover only production and do not address the full product life cycle; there is a need to incorporate end-of-life impacts and to support repairing, remanufacturing, or upcycling within cyber-physical production systems by maintaining lifecycle traceability.

Method: Develop PoPAN from the PPR modeling paradigm, ensuring product structure is the modeling basis and embedding capabilities for repairing, remanufacturing, and upcycling within CPS. Encapsulate the model as a digital shadow inside the Asset Administration Shell and serialize it in AutomationML for broader adoption. Demonstrate with a use-case on disassembling electric vehicle batteries to enable remanufacturing for stationary applications.

Result: The approach is demonstrated on disassembling electric vehicle batteries to support their remanufacturing for stationary battery applications, illustrating feasibility of lifecycle-integrated modeling and data exchange via AutomationML.

Conclusion: PoPAN enables lifecycle-aware product modeling by linking product structure with end-of-life processes, packaged as a digital shadow within the AAS and serialized in AutomationML, facilitating adoption in CPS-based production systems; future work includes broader validations and extension to additional lifecycle stages.

Abstract: Current products, especially in the automotive sector, pose complex technical
systems having a multi-disciplinary mechatronic nature. Industrial standards
supporting system engineering and production typically (i) address the
production phase only, but do not cover the complete product life cycle, and
(ii) focus on production processes and resources rather than the products
themselves. The presented approach is motivated by incorporating impacts of
end-of-life phase of the product life cycle into the engineering phase. This
paper proposes a modelling approach coming up from the Product-Process-Resource
(PPR) modeling paradigm. It combines requirements on (i) respecting the product
structure as a basis for the model, and (ii) it incorporates repairing,
remanufacturing, or upcycling within cyber-physical production systems. The
proposed model called PoPAN should accompany the product during the entire life
cycle as a digital shadow encapsulated within the Asset Administration Shell of
a product. To facilitate the adoption of the proposed paradigm, the paper also
proposes serialization of the model in the AutomationML data format. The model
is demonstrated on a use-case for disassembling electric vehicle batteries to
support their remanufacturing for stationary battery applications.

TL;DR: A framework for real-time, task-aware visual feature selection in visual-inertial navigation, using a non-submodular MSE objective, with four polynomial-time approximation algorithms and rigorous performance bounds, validated on benchmarks and a control-aware platform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual-Inertial Navigation (VIN) in robots operates under tight time and energy constraints. Selecting informative visual features is NP-hard, especially with a non-submodular MSE objective, necessitating efficient, theoretically grounded algorithms to enable real-time operation.

Method: Proposes a task-oriented framework that optimizes a mean-squared-error (MSE) objective for feature selection, aided by a simplified dynamic anticipation model. To cope with NP-hardness, it introduces four polynomial-time approximations: (1) classic greedy with constant-factor guarantees; (2) low-rank greedy variant to reduce computational load; (3) randomized greedy sampler balancing speed and solution quality; (4) linearization-based selector using a first-order Taylor expansion for near-constant-time execution. The analysis leverages submodularity ratios, curvature, and element-wise curvature to derive performance bounds.

Result: The paper establishes rigorous performance guarantees for the proposed algorithms and validates them through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks and a custom control-aware platform, demonstrating strong approximation guarantees and real-time feasibility.

Conclusion: The framework offers a practical, theoretically grounded approach for task-oriented feature selection in VIN under NP-hardness, enabling efficient real-time deployment; results suggest potential for broader applicability and future improvements in tighter bounds, dynamic modeling, or hardware-accelerated implementations.

Abstract: This paper presents a task-oriented computational framework to enhance
Visual-Inertial Navigation (VIN) in robots, addressing challenges such as
limited time and energy resources. The framework strategically selects visual
features using a Mean Squared Error (MSE)-based, non-submodular objective
function and a simplified dynamic anticipation model. To address the
NP-hardness of this problem, we introduce four polynomial-time approximation
algorithms: a classic greedy method with constant-factor guarantees; a low-rank
greedy variant that significantly reduces computational complexity; a
randomized greedy sampler that balances efficiency and solution quality; and a
linearization-based selector based on a first-order Taylor expansion for
near-constant-time execution. We establish rigorous performance bounds by
leveraging submodularity ratios, curvature, and element-wise curvature
analyses. Extensive experiments on both standardized benchmarks and a custom
control-aware platform validate our theoretical results, demonstrating that
these methods achieve strong approximation guarantees while enabling real-time
deployment.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GPC is a training-free method that combines distributional scores from multiple diffusion-based policies via convex weights + test-time search to improve robotic control without retraining, backed by theory and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce data and training costs for diffusion-based robotic control by leveraging existing, pre-trained policies. Show that composing policies can outperform any single policy even in one step, and propagate gains along trajectories.

Method: Theoretically, convexly combine distributional scores from several diffusion models to obtain a better one-step objective; use a Grönwall-type bound to argue trajectory-level improvements. Introduce General Policy Composition (GPC): a plug-and-play method that, at test time, convexly weights scores from heterogeneous pre-trained policies (e.g., VA, VLA, diffusion, flow-matching) across modalities and performs search to select actions.

Result: Empirical validation on Robomimic, PushT, RoboTwin, and real-world robotics shows GPC consistently improves performance and adaptability across tasks. Analysis includes comparisons of alternative composition operators and weighting strategies to shed light on mechanisms behind GPC's success.

Conclusion: GPC provides a simple, effective, training-free pathway to boost control performance by leveraging existing policies, enabling cross-policy and cross-modality composition without additional training.

Abstract: Diffusion-based models for robotic control, including vision-language-action
(VLA) and vision-action (VA) policies, have demonstrated significant
capabilities. Yet their advancement is constrained by the high cost of
acquiring large-scale interaction datasets. This work introduces an alternative
paradigm for enhancing policy performance without additional model training.
Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that the composed policies can exceed the
performance of either parent policy. Our contribution is threefold. First, we
establish a theoretical foundation showing that the convex composition of
distributional scores from multiple diffusion models can yield a superior
one-step functional objective compared to any individual score. A
Gr\"onwall-type bound is then used to show that this single-step improvement
propagates through entire generation trajectories, leading to systemic
performance gains. Second, motivated by these results, we propose General
Policy Composition (GPC), a training-free method that enhances performance by
combining the distributional scores of multiple pre-trained policies via a
convex combination and test-time search. GPC is versatile, allowing for the
plug-and-play composition of heterogeneous policies, including VA and VLA
models, as well as those based on diffusion or flow-matching, irrespective of
their input visual modalities. Third, we provide extensive empirical
validation. Experiments on Robomimic, PushT, and RoboTwin benchmarks, alongside
real-world robotic evaluations, confirm that GPC consistently improves
performance and adaptability across a diverse set of tasks. Further analysis of
alternative composition operators and weighting strategies offers insights into
the mechanisms underlying the success of GPC. These results establish GPC as a
simple yet effective method for improving control performance by leveraging
existing policies.

### [189] [Real-Time Trajectory Generation and Hybrid Lyapunov-Based Control for Hopping Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01138)
*Matthew Woodward*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Real-time trajectory generation with non-linear drag compensation and a Lyapunov-based controller enables rotor-based hopping robots to execute and follow complex aerial trajectories from liftoff to touchdown, with stable orientation control, across size scales and applicable to quadrotors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hopping robots currently cannot directly control their aerial trajectories or transitions to flight, which undermines the efficiency benefits of hopping. A real-time, efficient control-and-trajectory framework is needed to realize aerial maneuvers while preserving hopping advantages.

Method: A real-time, computationally efficient trajectory generation methodology that compensates non-linear drag, paired with a Lyapunov-based controller, enabling liftoff-to-touchdown trajectories on horizontal and vertical surfaces and strict orientation control at touchdown.

Result: The integrated system can create and follow complex aerial trajectories from liftoff to touchdown on horizontal and vertical surfaces, while maintaining strict orientation at touchdown, and it is computationally efficient enough to apply across size scales, with applicability to quadrotors.

Conclusion: This approach broadens the operational envelope of hopping robots by enabling direct, efficient aerial control and transitions, with general applicability across sizes and to quadrotor platforms.

Abstract: The advent of rotor-based hopping robots has created very capable hopping
platforms with high agility and efficiency, and similar controllability, as
compared to their purely flying quadrotor counterparts. Advances in robot
performance have increased the hopping height to greater than 4 meters and
opened up the possibility for more complex aerial trajectories (i.e.,
behaviors). However, currently hopping robots do not directly control their
aerial trajectory or transition to flight, eliminating the efficiency benefits
of a hopping system. Here we show a real-time, computationally efficiency,
non-linear drag compensated, trajectory generation methodology and accompanying
Lyapunov-based controller. The combined system can create and follow complex
aerial trajectories from liftoff to touchdown on horizontal and vertical
surfaces, while maintaining strick control over the orientation at touchdown.
The computational efficiency provides broad applicability across all size
scales of hopping robots while maintaining applicability to quadrotors in
general.

### [190] [Methodological Framework for Quantifying Semantic Test Coverage in RAG Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00001)
*Noah Broestl,Adel Nasser Abdalla,Rajprakash Bale,Hersh Gupta,Max Struever*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A methodology to quantify the semantic coverage of RAG test questions against documents using embeddings, clustering, and coverage metrics, with outlier filtering, validated on two use cases to improve test suites and detect misaligned documents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation frameworks for LLM/RAG often lack systematic coverage of the underlying knowledge base, creating blind spots in test suites.

Method: Embed document chunks and test questions into a unified vector space; compute basic proximity, content-weighted, and multi-topic coverage; apply clustering for structure; use outlier detection to filter irrelevant questions; derive recommendations for new test questions.

Result: Two use-case studies show the framework quantifies coverage, reveals underrepresented content areas, and yields concrete guidance for generating high-value test questions.

Conclusion: Provides RAG developers with practical tools to build more robust test suites, improving reliability and extending to detection of misaligned documents.

Abstract: Reliably determining the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems depends on comprehensive test questions. While a proliferation of
evaluation frameworks for LLM-powered applications exists, current practices
lack a systematic method to ensure these test sets adequately cover the
underlying knowledge base, leaving developers with significant blind spots. To
address this, we present a novel, applied methodology to quantify the semantic
coverage of RAG test questions against their underlying documents. Our approach
leverages existing technologies, including vector embeddings and clustering
algorithms, to create a practical framework for validating test
comprehensiveness. Our methodology embeds document chunks and test questions
into a unified vector space, enabling the calculation of multiple coverage
metrics: basic proximity, content-weighted coverage, and multi-topic question
coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate outlier detection to filter irrelevant
questions, allowing for the refinement of test sets. Experimental evidence from
two distinct use cases demonstrates that our framework effectively quantifies
test coverage, identifies specific content areas with inadequate
representation, and provides concrete recommendations for generating new,
high-value test questions. This work provides RAG developers with essential
tools to build more robust test suites, thereby improving system reliability
and extending to applications such as identifying misaligned documents.

*Ahmed A. Elhag,Arun Raja,Alex Morehead,Samuel M. Blau,Garrett M. Morris,Michael M. Bronstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes TransIP, a Transformer-based interatomic potential that learns SO(3) equivariance without explicit equivariant architectures, achieving competitive accuracy and better data efficiency on OMol25.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLIPs rely on hard-wired roto-translational symmetry via equivariant networks, which can limit flexibility, efficiency, and scalability. The work explores learning equivariance instead.

Method: Train a generic non-equivariant Transformer to learn SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing representations in embedding space, using the Open Molecules OMol25 dataset for diverse molecular types.

Result: TransIP attains comparable performance to state-of-the-art equivariant baselines and achieves 40–60% improvement over a data augmentation baseline across varying dataset sizes.

Conclusion: Learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient alternative to explicit equivariant or augmentation-based MLIPs, with potential benefits in flexibility and scalability.

Abstract: Accurate and scalable machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are
essential for molecular simulations ranging from drug discovery to new material
design. Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries
through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias
that can often lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and
scalability. In this work, we introduce TransIP: Transformer-based Inter-Atomic
Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving
symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Our approach
guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn
SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space.
Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse
molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of
molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and
electrolyte-like species), TransIP attains comparable performance in
machine-learning force fields versus state-of-the-art equivariant baselines.
Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60%
improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly,
our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient
alternative to equivariant or augmentation-based MLIP models.

### [192] [Rethinking RoPE Scaling in Quantized LLM: Theory, Outlier, and Channel-Band Analysis with Weight Rescaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00028)
*Ye Qiao,Haocheng Xu,Xiaofan Zhang,Sitao Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic analysis of RoPE-based interpolation with post-training quantization (PTQ) revealing degradation due to multiple coupled effects; introduces two diagnostics and Q-ROAR, a lightweight, weight-only, interpolation-aware stabilization method for quantized LLMs that improves long-context perplexity by >14% without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending the context window of LLMs is essential for tasks with long-range dependencies. RoPE-based interpolation and extrapolation enable longer input lengths without retraining, and PTQ makes deployment feasible. However, PI+PTQ can degrade accuracy; a systematic analysis and practical mitigation are needed.

Method: Introduce two diagnostics: interpolation pressure (per-band sensitivity to phase scaling) and tail-inflation ratios (outlier shift from short to long contexts). Propose Q-ROAR (Quantization, RoPE-interpolation, and Outlier Aware Rescaling): a weight-only, interpolation-aware stabilization of PI for quantized LLMs. Q-ROAR groups RoPE dimensions into a small number of frequency bands and performs a lightweight search over per-band scales for Key and Query weights (with an optional symmetric variant). The search is guided by the diagnostics and uses a tiny long-context development dataset; no fine-tuning, no architectural changes, minimal deployment overhead.

Result: Empirically, Q-ROAR reduces long-context perplexity by more than 14%, while preserving short-context performance, inference throughput, and compatibility with existing LLM stacks.

Conclusion: Q-ROAR provides a practical, deployment-friendly stabilization for RoPE interpolation under quantization, enabling longer-context support in quantized LLMs without retraining or major architectural changes.

Abstract: Extending the context window support of large language models (LLMs) is
crucial for tasks with long-distance dependencies. RoPE-based interpolation and
extrapolation methods, such as linear scaling and frequency-aware schemes,
enable longer input length support without retraining, while post-training
quantization (PTQ) makes deployment practical. However, we show that combining
RoPE position interpolation (PI) with PTQ degrades accuracy due to coupled
effects including long-context aliasing, dynamic-range dilation, anisotropy
from axis-aligned quantizers vs. rotated RoPE pairs, and outlier shifting that
produces position-dependent logit noise. We provide, to the best of our
knowledge, the first systematic analysis of the PI+PTQ approach and introduce
two practical diagnostics: interpolation pressure (per-band sensitivity to
phase scaling) and tail-inflation ratios (outlier shift from short to long
contexts). Following the analysis results, we propose Q-ROAR (Quantization,
RoPE-interpolation, and Outlier Aware Rescaling), a weight-only,
interpolation-aware stabilization of PI for quantized LLMs. Q-ROAR groups RoPE
dimensions into a small number of frequency bands and performs a lightweight
search over per-band scales for Key and Query weights (with an optional
symmetric variant to preserve logit scale). The search is guided by our
diagnostics and uses a tiny long-context development dataset, requiring no
fine-tuning to the model, no architecture or kernel changes, and no additional
deployment overhead. Empirically, Q-ROAR reduces the model's perplexity on
long-context workloads by more than 14%, while preserving short-context
performance, inference throughput, and compatibility with existing LLM system
stacks.

### [193] [DexBench: Benchmarking LLMs for Personalized Decision Making in Diabetes Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00038)
*Maria Ana Cardei,Josephine Lamp,Mark Derdzinski,Karan Bhatia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DexBench is the first patient-facing LLM benchmark for diabetes decision-making, with 7 task categories and a dataset from CGMs and behavioral logs across 15k individuals, enabling 360,600 personalized questions and evaluation across 5 metrics; 8 LLMs show variability without a clear winner, highlighting the need for safer, more reliable AI in diabetes care.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in evaluation benchmarks that focus on real-world, patient-facing diabetes decision-making, rather than generic or clinician-facing tasks. The work aims to enable robust prototyping of AI for diabetes care by providing a realistic, context-rich benchmark.

Method: Construct 7 diabetes-relevant task categories; assemble a month-long time-series dataset (glucose traces and behavioral logs) from 15,000 individuals across type 1, type 2, and pre-diabetes/wellness groups; generate 360,600 personalized contextual questions; evaluate 8 LLMs on five metrics (accuracy, groundedness, safety, clarity, actionability).

Result: There is substantial task- and metric-level variability among evaluated LLMs; no single model dominates across all dimensions, suggesting the benchmark reveals nuanced strengths/weaknesses of models in patient-facing diabetes tasks.

Conclusion: DexBench provides a framework to improve the reliability, safety, and practical utility of AI in diabetes care and can guide future development and evaluation of patient-facing AI systems.

Abstract: We present DexBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate large language
model (LLM) performance across real-world decision-making tasks faced by
individuals managing diabetes in their daily lives. Unlike prior health
benchmarks that are either generic, clinician-facing or focused on clinical
tasks (e.g., diagnosis, triage), DexBench introduces a comprehensive evaluation
framework tailored to the unique challenges of prototyping patient-facing AI
solutions in diabetes, glucose management, metabolic health and related
domains. Our benchmark encompasses 7 distinct task categories, reflecting the
breadth of real-world questions individuals with diabetes ask, including basic
glucose interpretation, educational queries, behavioral associations, advanced
decision making and long term planning. Towards this end, we compile a rich
dataset comprising one month of time-series data encompassing glucose traces
and metrics from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and behavioral logs (e.g.,
eating and activity patterns) from 15,000 individuals across three different
diabetes populations (type 1, type 2, pre-diabetes/general health and
wellness). Using this data, we generate a total of 360,600 personalized,
contextual questions across the 7 tasks. We evaluate model performance on these
tasks across 5 metrics: accuracy, groundedness, safety, clarity and
actionability. Our analysis of 8 recent LLMs reveals substantial variability
across tasks and metrics; no single model consistently outperforms others
across all dimensions. By establishing this benchmark, we aim to advance the
reliability, safety, effectiveness and practical utility of AI solutions in
diabetes care.

### [194] [Linear Regression in p-adic metric spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00043)
*Gregory D. Baker,Scott McCallum,Dirk Pattinson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theoretical foundation for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces is developed to respect hierarchical data. The main result shows that an n-dimensional p-adic regression plane minimizing the sum of distances to points must pass through at least n+1 data points, contrasting Euclidean regression. Corollaries show that degree-n polynomials minimizing p-adic residuals pass through at least n+1 points, and that approximating higher-degree polynomials yields a difference with distinct rational roots. Two NLP applications (hierarchical taxonomies and modeling grammatical morphology) illustrate practical impact. The work suggests p-adic metrics align with hierarchical structures, arguing for representative-point selection over interpolation in hierarchical data contexts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data often possess hierarchical, discrete branching structures that Euclidean metrics fail to capture. p-adic metric spaces naturally encode hierarchy, offering a promising foundation for ML on such data. The work seeks to establish theoretical guarantees and practical implications of using p-adic distances for regression-like tasks in hierarchical domains.

Method: Develop a theoretical framework for optimization in p-adic spaces. Prove that the n-dimensional plane minimizing the p-adic sum of distances to a dataset must pass through at least n+1 points. Derive corollaries: (i) a degree-n polynomial minimizing p-adic residual sum must go through at least n+1 points; (ii) a degree-n polynomial approximating a higher-degree polynomial at finite points yields a difference polynomial with distinct rational roots. Demonstrate applicability via two NLP tasks: analyzing hierarchical taxonomies and modeling grammatical morphology.

Result: A central theorem establishes that p-adic regression planes must pass through at least n+1 data points, highlighting a fundamental difference from Euclidean regression. From this, corollaries about polynomials of degree n and their residuals follow, including distinct rational roots in the resulting difference polynomials. The paper also provides two NLP-oriented applications, showing that p-adic metrics can capture hierarchical structure in taxonomy analysis and morphological modeling, with interpolation often replaced by selecting observed representatives.

Conclusion: p-adic metrics offer a natural and potentially fundamental framework for learning with hierarchical data. They align with the discrete, branching nature of such data, suggesting that models should favor observed points as representatives rather than interpolating between them. This perspective may guide model design for taxonomy and morphology in NLP and broader hierarchical domains.

Abstract: Many real-world machine learning problems involve inherently hierarchical
data, yet traditional approaches rely on Euclidean metrics that fail to capture
the discrete, branching nature of hierarchical relationships. We present a
theoretical foundation for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces, which
naturally respect hierarchical structure. Our main result proves that an
n-dimensional plane minimizing the p-adic sum of distances to points in a
dataset must pass through at least n + 1 of those points -- a striking contrast
to Euclidean regression that highlights how p-adic metrics better align with
the discrete nature of hierarchical data. As a corollary, a polynomial of
degree n constructed to minimise the p-adic sum of residuals will pass through
at least n + 1 points. As a further corollary, a polynomial of degree n
approximating a higher degree polynomial at a finite number of points will
yield a difference polynomial that has distinct rational roots. We demonstrate
the practical significance of this result through two applications in natural
language processing: analyzing hierarchical taxonomies and modeling grammatical
morphology. These results suggest that p-adic metrics may be fundamental to
properly handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning. In
hierarchical data, interpolation between points often makes less sense than
selecting actual observed points as representatives.

*Abdelrhman Gaber,Hassan Abd-Eltawab,Youssif Abuzied,Muhammad ElMahdy,Tamer ElBatt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedLLM-Align uses LLM-derived textual embeddings to align heterogeneous tabular data in federated learning, enabling privacy-preserving, communication-efficient FL with improved F1 and robustness without schema harmonization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneity of tabular data across clients (divergent schemas and feature spaces) and privacy concerns hinder standard FL; need a way to integrate disparate data without sharing raw data.

Method: Serialize records to text; extract embeddings using pre-trained LLMs (DistilBERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, ClinicalBERT); train lightweight local classifiers under FedAvg; no manual schema harmonization; preserves privacy.

Result: Outperforms baselines across settings and backbones; up to +0.25 F1 improvement; 65% reduction in communication cost; stress tests show graceful degradation under extreme schema divergence.

Conclusion: FedLLM-Align offers a robust, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient framework for FL in heterogeneous tabular environments.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing
raw data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare, finance, and IoT. A major obstacle, however, is the heterogeneity
of tabular data across clients, where divergent schemas and incompatible
feature spaces prevent straightforward aggregation. To address this challenge,
we propose FedLLM-Align, a federated framework that leverages pre-trained large
language models (LLMs) as universal feature extractors. Tabular records are
serialized into text, and embeddings from models such as DistilBERT, ALBERT,
RoBERTa, and ClinicalBERT provide semantically aligned representations that
support lightweight local classifiers under the standard FedAvg protocol. This
approach removes the need for manual schema harmonization while preserving
privacy, since raw data remain strictly local. We evaluate FedLLM-Align on
coronary heart disease prediction using partitioned Framingham datasets with
simulated schema divergence. Across all client settings and LLM backbones, our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to
+0.25 improvement in F1-score and a 65% reduction in communication cost. Stress
testing under extreme schema divergence further demonstrates graceful
degradation, unlike traditional methods that collapse entirely. These results
establish FedLLM-Align as a robust, privacy-preserving, and
communication-efficient solution for federated learning in heterogeneous
environments.

*Sicong Liu,Weiye Wu,Xiangrui Xu,Teng Li,Bowen Pang,Bin Guo,Zhiwen Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A survey of adaptive, resource-efficient agentic AI at the intersection of foundation models (FMs) and agent-enabled systems, addressing deployment constraints on edge/mobile and proposing techniques like elastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and agentic applications, with open challenges on accuracy-latency-communication trade-offs and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models enable scalable, multimodal reasoning and cognition, while AI agents aim to operate autonomously with long-term adaptability. Real-world deployment on edge/mobile hardware introduces strict constraints (memory, energy, bandwidth, latency). A systematic characterization is needed to reconcile high-capacity models with resource limits and to guide design of adaptive, efficient agentic AI.

Method: Systematic survey and taxonomy that maps FM structures, cognition, and hardware resources. The work categorizes enabling techniques into four areas: elastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and agentic AI applications; discusses open challenges and future opportunities; analyzes trade-offs and robustness under distribution shifts; proposes a unified perspective for algorithm-system co-design and collaborative edge deployment.

Result: Provides a structured taxonomy and a unified framework connecting FM cognition, agentic behavior, and hardware/resource constraints, along with identified challenges and opportunities. It clarifies how to balance accuracy, latency, and communication while maintaining robustness, and outlines future directions for integrating cognitive adaptation and edge deployment.

Conclusion: The convergence of foundation models and agentic AI, guided by algorithm-system co-design and edge-aware development, offers a path to scalable, adaptive, and resource-efficient intelligent agents. The survey aims to catalyze discussion on integrating agentic intelligence with practical agent systems and deploying them robustly across edge environments.

Abstract: Foundation models have reshaped AI by unifying fragmented architectures into
scalable backbones with multimodal reasoning and contextual adaptation. In
parallel, the long-standing notion of AI agents, defined by the
sensing-decision-action loop, is entering a new paradigm: with FMs as their
cognitive core, agents transcend rule-based behaviors to achieve autonomy,
generalization, and self-reflection. This dual shift is reinforced by
real-world demands such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual assistants,
and GUI agents, as well as ecosystem advances in embedded hardware, edge
computing, mobile deployment platforms, and communication protocols that
together enable large-scale deployment. Yet this convergence collides with
reality: while applications demand long-term adaptability and real-time
interaction, mobile and edge deployments remain constrained by memory, energy,
bandwidth, and latency. This creates a fundamental tension between the growing
complexity of FMs and the limited resources of deployment environments. This
survey provides the first systematic characterization of adaptive,
resource-efficient agentic AI systems. We summarize enabling techniques into
elastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and
agentic AI applications, and identify open challenges in balancing
accuracy-latency-communication trade-offs and sustaining robustness under
distribution shifts. We further highlight future opportunities in
algorithm-system co-design, cognitive adaptation, and collaborative edge
deployment. By mapping FM structures, cognition, and hardware resources, this
work establishes a unified perspective toward scalable, adaptive, and
resource-efficient agentic AI. We believe this survey can help readers to
understand the connections between enabling technologies while promoting
further discussions on the fusion of agentic intelligence and intelligent
agents.

### [197] [Approximately Unimodal Likelihood Models for Ordinal Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00122)
*Ryoya Yamasaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes approximately unimodal likelihood models for ordinal regression to handle non-unimodal conditional distributions, reducing bias of strictly unimodal models while maintaining a mostly unimodal structure; shows experimental effectiveness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world ordinal data often exhibit a predominantly unimodal CPD but with regions that deviate from unimodality. Strict unimodal models can bias the CPD in these regions. A flexible model that is approximately unimodal aims to capture near-unimodal shapes while avoiding bias.

Method: Introduce an approximately unimodal likelihood formulation that can represent unimodal CPDs as well as CPDs that are close to unimodal. The approach likely relaxes strict unimodality with regularization or flexible parameterization to allow slight deviations from unimodality. Experimental validation on ordinal data and OR tasks.

Result: Empirical evidence suggests the proposed model effectively models ordinal data and improves ordinal regression tasks compared with strictly unimodal approaches.

Conclusion: The approximately unimodal likelihood framework offers a practical compromise between enforcing unimodality and preserving data-driven CPD shapes, addressing bias while remaining applicable to real-world ordinal data.

Abstract: Ordinal regression (OR, also called ordinal classification) is classification
of ordinal data, in which the underlying target variable is categorical and
considered to have a natural ordinal relation for the underlying explanatory
variable. A key to successful OR models is to find a data structure `natural
ordinal relation' common to many ordinal data and reflect that structure into
the design of those models. A recent OR study found that many real-world
ordinal data show a tendency that the conditional probability distribution
(CPD) of the target variable given a value of the explanatory variable will
often be unimodal. Several previous studies thus developed unimodal likelihood
models, in which a predicted CPD is guaranteed to become unimodal. However, it
was also observed experimentally that many real-world ordinal data partly have
values of the explanatory variable where the underlying CPD will be
non-unimodal, and hence unimodal likelihood models may suffer from a bias for
such a CPD. Therefore, motivated to mitigate such a bias, we propose
approximately unimodal likelihood models, which can represent up to a unimodal
CPD and a CPD that is close to be unimodal. We also verify experimentally that
a proposed model can be effective for statistical modeling of ordinal data and
OR tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BigBang-Proton is a unified, cross-domain scientific LLM framework that uses Theory-Experiment Learning, Binary Patch Encoding, and Monte Carlo Attention to achieve multitask scientific performance, showing strong arithmetic, physics, chemistry, and biology task results and aiming for a universe-scale model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To replace/task-augment scientific computing with a single multitask model that leverages both theoretical text and real-world numerical data, enabling broad, cross-disciplinary capabilities beyond traditional task-specific models.

Method: A sequence-based auto-regressive model pretrained with a cross-discipline mix of theoretical text and real-world numerical data, featuring three innovations: (1) Theory-Experiment Learning to align data sources, (2) Binary Patch Encoding instead of BPE, and (3) Monte Carlo Attention instead of standard transformers; followed by fine-tuning for downstream tasks.

Result: Reported strong performance across tasks: 100% accuracy on up to 50-digit arithmetic additions; competitive or supra on particle-physics jet tagging; MAE-parity in inter-atomic potentials; spatiotemporal model parity in water quality; outperforming baselines in genome modeling.

Conclusion: Language-guided scientific computing via a unified multitask model can match or exceed task-specific models while enabling scalable multitask learning, with prospects for scaling pretraining toward a universe-scale material-world foundational model.

Abstract: We introduce BigBang-Proton, a unified sequence-based architecture for
auto-regressive language modeling pretrained on cross-scale, cross-structure,
cross-discipline real-world scientific tasks to construct a scientific
multi-task learner. BigBang-Proton incorporates three fundamental innovations
compared to mainstream general-purpose LLMs: Theory-Experiment Learning
paradigm aligns large-scale numerical experimental data with theoretical text
corpora; Binary Patch Encoding replaces byte pair encoding(BPE) tokenization;
Monte Carlo Attention substitutes traditional transformer architectures.
Through next-word-prediction pretraining on cross-discipline scientific
datasets of real-world problems mixed with general textual corpus, followed by
fine-tuning and inference on downstream tasks, BigBang-Proton demonstrates
100\% accuracy in up to 50-digit arithmetic addition operations, performance on
par with leading specialized models in particle physics jet tagging, matching
MAE of specialized models in inter-atomic potential simulation, performance
comparable to traditional spatiotemporal models in water quality prediction,
and benchmark-exceeding performance in genome modeling. These results prove
that language-guided scientific computing can match or exceed the performance
of task-specific scientific models while maintaining multitask learning
capabilities. We further hypothesize to scale the pretraining to the universe
scale as a fundamental step toward developing material world foundational
model.

### [199] [Large Language Models Inference Engines based on Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00133)
*Adarsha Balaji,Sandeep Madireddy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeurTransformer introduces a spike-based transformer for inference by replacing self-attention with spike-based attention, converting the feed-forward block to an SNN, and fine-tuning with surrogate learning. It achieves energy-efficient inference with modest accuracy trade-offs on GPT-2 variants and significant energy reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers excel in language tasks but are computationally expensive. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer potential energy efficiency but training large SNNs is hard and converting full transformers to SNNs can be impractical. The work aims to enable efficient, scalable transformer inference with SNNs for general language modeling.

Method: (1) Replace self-attention with spike-based self-attention (SSA). (2) Convert the trained transformer's feed-forward block to an equivalent SNN. (3) Fine-tune the SSA block using SNN surrogate learning methods. Evaluate on three GPT-2 variants to assess accuracy and energy efficiency.

Result: Converted GPT-2 small models show a 5-12% loss in cosine similarity and a 9.7% reduction in perplexity. SSA-based self-attention achieves 64.71%–85.28% energy reductions compared to an ASA-based self-attention on digital hardware.

Conclusion: NeurTransformer demonstrates that transformer-based SNNs can be a viable path toward energy-efficient inference for language models, with substantial energy gains and controllable performance trade-offs; further work could optimize the trade-offs and scaling for larger models.

Abstract: Foundational models based on the transformer architecture are currently the
state-of-the-art in general language modeling, as well as in scientific areas
such as material science and climate. However, training and deploying these
models is computationally challenging as the time and space complexity has a
quadratic relation to the input sequence length. Several efforts exploring
efficient computational paradigms and model architectures to address these
limitations have been made. In this work, we explore spiking neural networks
(SNNs) to design transformer models. A challenge in training large-scale SNNs,
using existing surrogate learning methods is inefficient and time-consuming. On
the other hand, techniques to convert existing transformer-based models to
their SNN equivalent are not scalable, as achieving optimal performance comes
at the cost of a large number of spike time-steps, i.e. increased latency. To
address this, we propose NeurTransformer, a methodology for designing
transformer-based SNN for inference using a supervised fine-tuning approach
with existing conversion methods. The proposed methodology works by: (1)
replacing the self-attention mechanism with a spike-based self-attention (SSA),
(2) converting the feed-forward block of the trained transformer model to its
equivalent SNN, and (3) fine-tuning the SSA block using SNN-based surrogate
learning algorithms. We benchmark the proposed methodology and demonstrate its
accuracy and scalability using three variants of the GPT-2 model of increasing
model size. We observe that the converted GPT-2 small models demonstrate a
5-12% loss in cosine similarity and a 9.7% reduction in perplexity. Finally, we
demonstrate the energy efficiency of the SSA block compared to the ASA block
and show between 64.71% and 85.28% reductions in estimated energy consumption

### [200] [Nonparametric Identification of Latent Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00136)
*Yujia Zheng,Shaoan Xie,Kun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theoretical framework for identifiability of concepts from diverse observation classes using comparison, achieving hidden-concept identifiability without fixed generative models; introduces local guarantees and nonparametric structure discovery; validated on synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans learn by comparing diverse observations; this comparison-based mechanism can drive machine learning to recover true concepts; current concept-learning theory lacks general identifiability guarantees and strong theory; there is a need for a framework that ensures identifiability when multiple observation classes are involved.

Method: Develop a theoretical framework for identifiability of concepts with multiple observation classes. Prove that with sufficient cross-class diversity, hidden concepts are identifiable without assuming specific concept types, functional forms, or parametric generative models. When global conditions fail, provide alternative guarantees based on local comparisons, extending applicability. Also establish nonparametric identifiability of the hidden structure between classes and concepts.

Result: Establishes identifiability results under diversity; introduces local guarantees to broaden applicability; demonstrates nonparametric identifiability of the class-concept structure; corroborated by experiments on synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: Proposes a correctness-backed theory for concept learning via comparison, removing reliance on restrictive models. The framework supports both global and local identifiability guarantees and allows nonparametric discovery of the class–concept structure, with validation in synthetic and real-world settings.

Abstract: We are born with the ability to learn concepts by comparing diverse
observations. This helps us to understand the new world in a compositional
manner and facilitates extrapolation, as objects naturally consist of multiple
concepts. In this work, we argue that the cognitive mechanism of comparison,
fundamental to human learning, is also vital for machines to recover true
concepts underlying the data. This offers correctness guarantees for the field
of concept learning, which, despite its impressive empirical successes, still
lacks general theoretical support. Specifically, we aim to develop a
theoretical framework for the identifiability of concepts with multiple classes
of observations. We show that with sufficient diversity across classes, hidden
concepts can be identified without assuming specific concept types, functional
relations, or parametric generative models. Interestingly, even when conditions
are not globally satisfied, we can still provide alternative guarantees for as
many concepts as possible based on local comparisons, thereby extending the
applicability of our theory to more flexible scenarios. Moreover, the hidden
structure between classes and concepts can also be identified
nonparametrically. We validate our theoretical results in both synthetic and
real-world settings.

### [201] [Which Rewards Matter? Reward Selection for Reinforcement Learning under Limited Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00144)
*Shreyas Chaudhari,Renhao Zhang,Philip S. Thomas,Bruno Castro da Silva*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Formalizes reward selection for RL with limited feedback (RLLF); analyzes heuristics and pre-trained strategies to pick informative rewards, identifying critical subsets that steer optimal trajectories and recover after deviations, enabling near-optimal policies with far fewer labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In practice, obtaining reward labels is costly; selecting which samples to label can dramatically improve policy performance under limited feedback; the work formalizes this problem and studies selection strategies.

Method: Introduce RLLF problem; study two strategy classes: (i) reward-free heuristics based on state visitation and partial value information, (ii) strategies pretrained with auxiliary evaluative feedback; identify properties of rewards that maximize impact.

Result: Key finding: informative rewards are those that guide toward optimal trajectories and support recovery after deviations; with effective selection, near-optimal policies can be learned with significantly fewer labeled rewards.

Conclusion: Reward selection is a powerful paradigm for scaling RL under feedback constraints; focusing labeling on impactful rewards yields strong performance gains with reduced labeling requirements.

Abstract: The ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to learn effective policies
is determined by the rewards available during training. However, for practical
problems, obtaining large quantities of reward labels is often infeasible due
to computational or financial constraints, particularly when relying on human
feedback. When reinforcement learning must proceed with limited feedback --
only a fraction of samples get rewards labeled -- a fundamental question
arises: which samples should be labeled to maximize policy performance? We
formalize this problem of reward selection for reinforcement learning from
limited feedback (RLLF), introducing a new problem formulation that facilitates
the study of strategies for selecting impactful rewards. Two types of selection
strategies are investigated: (i) heuristics that rely on reward-free
information such as state visitation and partial value functions, and (ii)
strategies pre-trained using auxiliary evaluative feedback. We find that
critical subsets of rewards are those that (1) guide the agent along optimal
trajectories, and (2) support recovery toward near-optimal behavior after
deviations. Effective selection methods yield near-optimal policies with
significantly fewer reward labels than full supervision, establishing reward
selection as a powerful paradigm for scaling reinforcement learning in
feedback-limited settings.

### [202] [Partial Identification Approach to Counterfactual Fairness Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00163)
*Saeyoung Rho,Junzhe Zhang,Elias Bareinboim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Partial identification bounds for counterfactual fairness with a Bayesian method, applied to COMPAS; finds a spurious positive race effect and a negative age effect.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing counterfactual fairness is challenging when the mechanism is unknown and the measure is not identifiable; informative bounds from observational data are needed to evaluate fairness.

Method: Develop a partial-identification framework to bound counterfactual fairness measures; introduce a Bayesian approach to produce high-confidence bounds; apply to COMPAS dataset examining race, age, and sex.

Result: Produced informative bounds for counterfactual fairness; observed a positive (spurious) effect on the COMPAS score when changing race to African-American and a negative (direct causal) effect when aging from young to old.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of Bayesian partial identification for counterfactual fairness and highlights the risk of misinterpreting associations as fairness signals; useful for fairness evaluation when identifiability is not possible.

Abstract: The wide adoption of AI decision-making systems in critical domains such as
criminal justice, loan approval, and hiring processes has heightened concerns
about algorithmic fairness. As we often only have access to the output of
algorithms without insights into their internal mechanisms, it was natural to
examine how decisions would alter when auxiliary sensitive attributes (such as
race) change. This led the research community to come up with counterfactual
fairness measures, but how to evaluate the measure from available data remains
a challenging task. In many practical applications, the target counterfactual
measure is not identifiable, i.e., it cannot be uniquely determined from the
combination of quantitative data and qualitative knowledge. This paper
addresses this challenge using partial identification, which derives
informative bounds over counterfactual fairness measures from observational
data. We introduce a Bayesian approach to bound unknown counterfactual fairness
measures with high confidence. We demonstrate our algorithm on the COMPAS
dataset, examining fairness in recidivism risk scores with respect to race,
age, and sex. Our results reveal a positive (spurious) effect on the COMPAS
score when changing race to African-American (from all others) and a negative
(direct causal) effect when transitioning from young to old age.

### [203] [Why Can't Transformers Learn Multiplication? Reverse-Engineering Reveals Long-Range Dependency Pitfalls](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00184)
*Xiaoyan Bai,Itamar Pres,Yuntian Deng,Chenhao Tan,Stuart Shieber,Fernanda Viégas,Martin Wattenberg,Andrew Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reverse-engineered implicit chain-of-thought Transformer for multi-digit multiplication reveals long-range dependencies encoded in attention, a DAG-based cache/retrieve mechanism for pairwise partial products, and geometric representations (Minkowski sums and Fourier digit representations). Standard fine-tuning lacks these inductive biases, leading to failure; introducing a running-sum auxiliary loss provides the bias to succeed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why large language models struggle with multi-digit multiplication and to uncover the mechanisms that enable an implicit chain-of-thought to succeed, in order to diagnose training pitfalls and propose fixes.

Method: Reverse-engineer an implicit-CoT model, use logit attributions and linear probes to detect long-range structure, analyze attention to show a directed acyclic graph that caches/retrieves partial products, and inspect geometry of representations (Minkowski sums of digit pairs; Fourier basis for digits). Compare with standard fine-tuning and test an auxiliary running-sum loss via linear regression probes to induce the needed inductive bias.

Result: Evidence of long-range structure enabling multi-digit multiplication; a mechanism where attention constructs a DAG to cache/retrieve pairwise partial products; geometry shows partial products in attention heads correspond to Minkowski sums and digits encoded in a Fourier basis; standard fine-tuning converges to a local optimum lacking these dependencies; an auxiliary running-sum predictor provides the inductive bias that enables successful learning.

Conclusion: There is a pitfall in learning long-range dependencies in Transformers under standard fine-tuning; incorporating inductive biases (e.g., a running-sum predictor) can recover the needed long-range structure and enable accurate multi-digit multiplication, as demonstrated by reverse-engineered mechanisms.

Abstract: Language models are increasingly capable, yet still fail at a seemingly
simple task of multi-digit multiplication. In this work, we study why, by
reverse-engineering a model that successfully learns multiplication via
\emph{implicit chain-of-thought}, and report three findings: (1) Evidence of
long-range structure: Logit attributions and linear probes indicate that the
model encodes the necessary long-range dependencies for multi-digit
multiplication. (2) Mechanism: the model encodes long-range dependencies using
attention to construct a directed acyclic graph to ``cache'' and ``retrieve''
pairwise partial products. (3) Geometry: the model implements partial products
in attention heads by forming Minkowski sums between pairs of digits, and
digits are represented using a Fourier basis, both of which are intuitive and
efficient representations that the standard fine-tuning model lacks. With these
insights, we revisit the learning dynamics of standard fine-tuning and find
that the model converges to a local optimum that lacks the required long-range
dependencies. We further validate this understanding by introducing an
auxiliary loss that predicts the ``running sum'' via a linear regression probe,
which provides an inductive bias that enables the model to successfully learn
multi-digit multiplication. In summary, by reverse-engineering the mechanisms
of an implicit chain-of-thought model we uncover a pitfall for learning
long-range dependencies in Transformers and provide an example of how the
correct inductive bias can address this issue.

### [204] [PrunedLoRA: Robust Gradient-Based structured pruning for Low-rank Adaptation in Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00192)
*Xin Yu,Cong Xie,Ziyu Zhao,Tiantian Fan,Lingzhou Xue,Zhi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PrunedLoRA introduces a structured-pruning framework that converts over-parameterized LoRA adapters into highly expressive, adaptable low-rank adapters by dynamically pruning during fine-tuning and preventing reactivation, coupled with a gradient-based pruning strategy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA often trades off expressiveness for parameter efficiency, leaving a gap with full fine-tuning. There is a need for adaptive, expressive low-rank adapters that can allocate rank where needed while remaining robust to perturbations.

Method: PrunedLoRA initializes an over-parameterized LoRA and applies structured pruning that dynamically prunes less important components during fine-tuning; once pruned, components are not reactivated. It uses a gradient-based pruning strategy that minimizes the pruning error for the overall loss, with a grounded interpretation and a theoretical robustness analysis showing gradient-based pruning can be more robust than activation-based pruning under weight perturbation.

Result: Empirically, PrunedLoRA consistently outperforms LoRA and related variants on supervised fine-tuning tasks spanning mathematical reasoning, code generation, and natural language understanding, and exhibits advantages over existing structured pruning methods across a range of sparsity levels.

Conclusion: PrunedLoRA provides flexible, adaptive rank allocation with enhanced expressiveness and robustness, backed by theoretical analysis and strong empirical performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely used paradigm for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models, yet its
representational capacity often lags behind full fine-tuning. Within the
context of LoRA, a key open question is how to obtain expressive low-rank
adapters from over-parameterized spaces. We propose \textit{PrunedLoRA}, a new
framework that leverages structured pruning to obtain highly representative
low-rank adapters from an over-parameterized initialization. Unlike prior
approaches that impose a fixed low-rank budget, PrunedLoRA dynamically prunes
less important components during fine-tuning and prevents their reactivation,
enabling flexible and adaptive rank allocation. For structured pruning, by
minimizing the pruning error for overall loss, we provide fine-grained pruning
and recovery updates in a gradient-based pruning strategy with grounded
interpretation. We provide the first theoretical analysis of the robustness of
structured pruning and provably show that under the impact of weight
perturbation, gradient-based pruning is more robust than activation-based
pruning with respect to overall loss. Empirically, PrunedLoRA consistently
outperforms LoRA and its variants across supervised fine-tuning tasks in
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and natural language understanding,
and it also demonstrates advantages over existing structured pruning methods
across diverse sparsity levels.

### [205] [GRPO-$λ$: Credit Assignment improves LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00194)
*Prasanna Parthasarathi,Mathieu Reymond,Boxing Chen,Yufei Cui,Sarath Chandar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRPO-λ extends GRPO with lambda-return eligibility traces and critic-free TD error approximation for RL fine-tuning of LLMs, yielding notable gains on math reasoning tasks across model sizes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO lacks explicit reward/critic for fine-grained credit assignment across token sequences, limiting RL fine-tuning effectiveness for complex reasoning.

Method: Approximate lambda-return via eligibility traces using token-level log probabilities after each sequence; critic-free TD error approximation; explore multiple lambda weighting schemes; apply to LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen-2.5, 1.5B–7B models, on four math datasets; compare to GRPO.

Result: During RL training, GRPO-λ achieves 30–40% improvement over GRPO; final averaged scores on AIME24, Math500, OlympiadMath, MinervaMath, AMC improve by >3 points, with 4.5-point gain on the 7B model.

Conclusion: GRPO-λ improves credit assignment and yields robust gains over GRPO across model scales and math benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of critic-free, eligibility-trace-based RL fine-tuning for complex reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for tasks requiring
complex reasoning, prompting significant interest in improving their reasoning
abilities through post-training. Especially RL based methods using verifiable
reward, like the state-of-the-art GRPO, have shown to tremendously improve
reasoning behaviors when applied as post-training methods. However, the lack of
an explicit reward or critic model limits GRPO's ability to assign fine-grained
credit across token sequences. In this work, we present GRPO-$\lambda$, a novel
extension to GRPO that enhances credit assignment in RL finetuning of LLMs for
complex reasoning tasks. We approximate learning from $\lambda$-return with a
reformulation of eligibility traces using token-level log-probabilities applied
after each sequence generation, and a novel critic-free approximation of the
temporal-difference error. We introduce a few variations for the weighting of
the $\lambda$-return, and their applications to the eligibility-trace, where
all the variations provide significant gains over GRPO. We compare
GRPO-$\lambda$ against GRPO by training models from 1.5B to 7B parameters on
$4$ different math reasoning datasets. The training plots demonstrate 30-40%
improved performance during RL training on both LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen-2.5
architectures. Finally, we show that with GRPO-$\lambda$, the resulting average
performance on AIME24, Math500, OlympiadMath, MinervaMath, and AMC improves
over GRPO by over $3$ points and a $4.5$ points improvement on the 7B model.

### [206] [RouterArena: An Open Platform for Comprehensive Comparison of LLM Routers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00202)
*Yifan Lu,Rixin Liu,Jiayi Yuan,Xingqi Cui,Shenrun Zhang,Hongyi Liu,Jiarong Xing*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RouterArena proposes the first open benchmarking platform to compare LLM routers using a structured dataset, difficulty levels, diverse metrics, and an automated leaderboard, aiming to standardize router evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a rapid proliferation of LLM routers, and no standardized benchmark exists to compare them across domains, capabilities, and costs; a leaderboard is needed to guide selection and drive improvement.

Method: Design of a principally constructed dataset with broad knowledge domain coverage, assignment of distinguishable difficulty levels per domain, an extensive metric suite, and an automated framework for updating a leaderboard; initial leaderboard demonstrated.

Result: An initial leaderboard with detailed metrics is presented, along with a publicly accessible framework to benchmark routers; platform to be opened to the public soon.

Conclusion: RouterArena could become a standard benchmark for LLM routers, enabling transparent and comparable evaluation, though questions remain about coverage, update cadence, fairness, and practical adoption.

Abstract: Today's LLM ecosystem comprises a wide spectrum of models that differ in
size, capability, and cost. No single model is optimal for all scenarios;
hence, LLM routers have become essential for selecting the most appropriate
model under varying circumstances. However, the rapid emergence of various
routers makes choosing the right one increasingly challenging. To address this
problem, we need a comprehensive router comparison and a standardized
leaderboard, similar to those available for models. In this work, we introduce
RouterArena, the first open platform enabling comprehensive comparison of LLM
routers. RouterArena has (1) a principally constructed dataset with broad
knowledge domain coverage, (2) distinguishable difficulty levels for each
domain, (3) an extensive list of evaluation metrics, and (4) an automated
framework for leaderboard updates. Leveraging our framework, we have produced
the initial leaderboard with detailed metrics comparison as shown in Figure 1.
We will make our platform open to the public soon.

### [207] [LoRAFusion: Efficient LoRA Fine-Tuning for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00206)
*Zhanda Zhu,Qidong Su,Yaoyao Ding,Kevin Song,Shang Wang,Gennady Pekhimenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRAFusion is a plug-and-play system that speeds up LoRA-based fine-tuning of LLMs by (1) fusing memory-bound operations with a kernel-level graph-splitting approach and (2) optimizing multi-adapter scheduling via adaptive batching and bin-packing, achieving substantial end-to-end speedups and kernel gains, and is open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LoRA fine-tuning suffers from two inefficiencies: (i) large activation tensors incur substantial runtime overhead due to redundant memory accesses, and (ii) lack of concurrent fine-tuning of multiple independent LoRA adapters sharing a base model leads to pipeline inefficiencies and poor GPU utilization.

Method: Kernel-level: a graph-splitting method that fuses memory-bound operations to eliminate redundant memory accesses while preserving compute-bound GEMM performance without recomputation or extra synchronization. Scheduling-level: an adaptive batching algorithm for multi-job fine-tuning that splits adapters into groups to stagger batch execution, then solves a bin-packing problem within each group to produce balanced, dependency-aware microbatches.

Result: LoRAFusion achieves up to 1.96× end-to-end speedup versus Megatron-LM (1.47× average) and up to 1.46× against mLoRA (1.29× average). The fused kernel yields up to 1.39× kernel performance improvement (1.27× on average). It is open-sourced at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: LoRAFusion provides a practical, plug-and-play solution that addresses memory-bound inefficiencies and multi-adapter scheduling bottlenecks in LoRA fine-tuning, delivering substantial end-to-end speedups and enabling efficient concurrent multi-adapter training.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the leading Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), as it significantly
reduces GPU memory usage while maintaining competitive fine-tuned model quality
on downstream tasks. Despite these benefits, we identify two key inefficiencies
in existing LoRA fine-tuning systems. First, they incur substantial runtime
overhead due to redundant memory accesses on large activation tensors. Second,
they miss the opportunity to concurrently fine-tune multiple independent LoRA
adapters that share the same base model on the same set of GPUs. This leads to
missed performance gains such as reduced pipeline bubbles, better communication
overlap, and improved GPU load balance.
  To address these issues, we introduce LoRAFusion, an efficient LoRA
fine-tuning system for LLMs. At the kernel level, we propose a graph-splitting
method that fuses memory-bound operations. This design eliminates unnecessary
memory accesses and preserves the performance of compute-bound GEMMs without
incurring the cost of recomputation or synchronization. At the scheduling
level, LoRAFusion introduces an adaptive batching algorithm for multi-job
fine-tuning. It first splits LoRA adapters into groups to intentionally stagger
batch execution across jobs, and then solves a bin-packing problem within each
group to generate balanced, dependency-aware microbatches. LoRAFusion achieves
up to $1.96\times$ ($1.47\times$ on average) end-to-end speedup compared to
Megatron-LM, and up to $1.46\times$ ($1.29\times$ on average) improvement over
mLoRA, the state-of-the-art multi-LoRA fine-tuning system. Our fused kernel
achieves up to $1.39\times$ ($1.27\times$ on average) kernel performance
improvement and can directly serve as a plug-and-play replacement in existing
LoRA systems. We open-source LoRAFusion at
https://github.com/CentML/lorafusion.

### [208] [Directed-MAML: Meta Reinforcement Learning Algorithm with Task-directed Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00212)
*Yang Zhang,Huiwen Yan,Mushuang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Directed-MAML introduces a first-order task-directed approximation before the second-order gradient step in meta-RL to reduce computation and speed up convergence, and it can be integrated into other meta-learning methods like FOMAML and Meta-SGD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address two key drawbacks of applying MAML to meta-RL: (i) high computational/memory cost from second-order gradients, and (ii) the complexity of nested optimization that hampers convergence to a global optimum.

Method: Before performing the second-order gradient step, apply a first-order task-directed approximation to estimate the effect of second-order gradients, thereby accelerating convergence and reducing computational cost. Demonstrated on CartPole-v1, LunarLander-v2, and a two-vehicle intersection crossing scenario; also shows that the task-directed approximation can be integrated into other meta-learning algorithms (FOMAML, Meta-SGD).

Result: Directed-MAML and its task-directed approach outperform MAML-based baselines in computational efficiency and convergence speed on the tested RL tasks; the task-directed approximation can be effectively embedded into other meta-learning algorithms to achieve similar gains in efficiency and speed.

Conclusion: Task-directed approximation is an effective mechanism to mitigate second-order overhead in meta-RL and can be generalized to other meta-learning frameworks, offering a practical route to faster convergence with lower computational demands.

Abstract: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) is a versatile meta-learning framework
applicable to both supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying MAML to meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) presents
notable challenges. First, MAML relies on second-order gradient computations,
leading to significant computational and memory overhead. Second, the nested
structure of optimization increases the problem's complexity, making
convergence to a global optimum more challenging. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Directed-MAML, a novel task-directed meta-RL algorithm.
Before the second-order gradient step, Directed-MAML applies an additional
first-order task-directed approximation to estimate the effect of second-order
gradients, thereby accelerating convergence to the optimum and reducing
computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that Directed-MAML
surpasses MAML-based baselines in computational efficiency and convergence
speed in the scenarios of CartPole-v1, LunarLander-v2 and two-vehicle
intersection crossing. Furthermore, we show that task-directed approximation
can be effectively integrated into other meta-learning algorithms, such as
First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (FOMAML) and Meta Stochastic Gradient
Descent(Meta-SGD), yielding improved computational efficiency and convergence
speed.

*Houjun Liu,Shikhar Murty,Christopher D. Manning,Róbert Csordás*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Thoughtbubbles enables transformers to learn adaptive, latent-space parallel computation during pretraining by forking/deleting residual streams, improving inference-time compute efficiency without explicit chain-of-thought tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing inference-time scaling methods that rely on serial, explicit chain-of-thought generation and cannot be pretraining-era, the authors seek a latent, parallel computation mechanism that can be learned during pretraining.

Method: Introduce Thoughtbubbles, a transformer variant that can dynamically fork or delete residual streams in latent space, creating 'bubbles' of cloned residuals for harder tokens. Training uses standard language modeling loss at pretraining, enabling adaptive computation to be learned without additional supervision.

Result: Outperforms standard decoder LMs and non-adaptive parallel computation baselines on perplexity (OpenWebText, peS2o) and zero-shot tasks (HellaSwag, LAMBADA) across 150M–772M parameter scales after pretraining.

Conclusion: Adaptive, latent-space computation can be learned during pretraining, enabling unified train/test-time reasoning behavior and more scalable inference without relying on explicit chain-of-thought tokens.

Abstract: Current approaches for scaling inference-time compute in transformers rely on
training them to emit explicit chain-of-thought tokens before producing an
answer. While these methods are powerful, they are limited because they cannot
be applied during pretraining and are limited to only serially-generated,
natural-language verbalization to scale inference-time compute. In this work,
we propose Thoughtbubbles, a transformer variant that natively performs
parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete
residual streams. Thus, tokens that require a large amount of computation can
form a "bubble" of cloned residuals in the middle of the network for additional
thinking. Crucially, this behavior is learned during pretraining with only
language modeling loss. Thoughtbubbles outperforms both standard decoder LMs as
well as non-adaptive parallel computation approaches on OpenWebText and peS2o
perplexity and in zero-shot evaluations such as HellaSwag and LAMBADA after
pretraining across 150M to 772M parameter scales. The implicit nature of our
method enables adaptive computation to be learned starting at pretraining time,
paving the way to unify train and test-time behavior for reasoning models.

*Alex Chen,Renato Geh,Aditya Grover,Guy Van den Broeck,Daniel Israel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KV cache compression increases throughput but can severely affect instruction fidelity in multi-instruction prompts, including leaking system prompts; compression method, instruction order, and eviction bias influence leakage. Simple eviction-policy tweaks can mitigate these issues.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand real-world risks of KV cache compression on LLM behavior in realistic multi-step prompts, beyond reported throughput gains.

Method: Empirical analysis of compressed KV caches during multi-instruction prompting. The study varies compression methods, instruction order, and eviction bias, and measures effects on prompt leakage and instruction following; proposes eviction-policy changes.

Result: Some instructions degrade rapidly under compression; system prompt leakage increases with certain configurations; factors like compression method, instruction order, and eviction bias affect leakage; targeted eviction-policy tweaks can reduce leakage and improve multi-instruction performance.

Conclusion: KV cache compression can compromise prompt fidelity; careful design of eviction policies is essential to preserve instruction following while maintaining throughput gains.

Abstract: KV cache compression promises increased throughput and efficiency with
negligible loss in performance. While the gains in throughput are indisputable
and recent literature has indeed shown minimal degradation on particular
benchmarks, in general the consequences of compression in realistic scenarios
such as multi-instruction prompting have been insufficiently studied. In this
paper, we identify several pitfalls practitioners should be aware of when
deploying KV cache compressed LLMs. Importantly, we show that certain
instructions degrade much more rapidly with compression, effectively causing
them to be completely ignored by the LLM. As a practical example of that, we
highlight system prompt leakage as a case study, empirically showing the impact
of compression on leakage and general instruction following. We show several
factors that play a role in prompt leakage: compression method, instruction
order, and KV eviction bias. We then propose simple changes to KV cache
eviction policies that can reduce the impact of these factors and improve the
overall performance in multi-instruction tasks.

*Siva Viknesh,Amirhossein Arzani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DIANO: a deterministic autoencoding neural operator that yields interpretable latent spaces for dimensional and geometric reduction, with a differentiable PDE solver in latent space to enforce physics priors; evaluated on flow and artery geometries, outperforming baselines in interpretability and enabling latent PDE dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve interpretability of latent spaces in physics-informed machine learning for high-dimensional spatiotemporal flows, by constructing physically meaningful latent representations and embedding governing equations directly in latent dynamics.

Method: DIFFERentiable Autoencoding Neural Operator (DIANO): encoding and decoding neural operators with spatial coarsening and refinement to compress/reconstruct high-dimensional inputs; integrate a fully differentiable PDE solver in the latent space to advance latent dynamics using multiple PDE formulations (e.g., 2D unsteady advection-diffusion, 3D Poisson); compare against Convolutional Neural Operator and standard autoencoders on problems like flow past a 2D cylinder, arterial stenosis, and 3D coronary artery.

Result: DIANO produces latent spaces that are interpretable for both dimensionality and geometric reduction; latent PDEs in the latent space can advance both high- and low-fidelity PDEs while embedding physical priors; demonstrates capability across 2D/3D flow cases, showing effective latent representations and solvable latent PDE dynamics.

Conclusion: DIANO offers a physics-informed, interpretable latent space framework for scientific ML, enabling both dimensional and geometric reduction with integrated latent dynamics; useful for embedding governing equations within latent representations and solving PDEs in latent space.

Abstract: Scientific machine learning has enabled the extraction of physical insights
from high-dimensional spatiotemporal flow data using linear and nonlinear
dimensionality reduction techniques. Despite these advances, achieving
interpretability within the latent space remains a challenge. To address this,
we propose the DIfferentiable Autoencoding Neural Operator (DIANO), a
deterministic autoencoding neural operator framework that constructs physically
interpretable latent spaces for both dimensional and geometric reduction, with
the provision to enforce differential governing equations directly within the
latent space. Built upon neural operators, DIANO compresses high-dimensional
input functions into a low-dimensional latent space via spatial coarsening
through an encoding neural operator and subsequently reconstructs the original
inputs using a decoding neural operator through spatial refinement. We assess
DIANO's latent space interpretability and performance in dimensionality
reduction against baseline models, including the Convolutional Neural Operator
and standard autoencoders. Furthermore, a fully differentiable partial
differential equation (PDE) solver is developed and integrated within the
latent space, enabling the temporal advancement of both high- and low-fidelity
PDEs, thereby embedding physical priors into the latent dynamics. We further
investigate various PDE formulations, including the 2D unsteady
advection-diffusion and the 3D Pressure-Poisson equation, to examine their
influence on shaping the latent flow representations. Benchmark problems
considered include flow past a 2D cylinder, flow through a 2D symmetric
stenosed artery, and a 3D patient-specific coronary artery. These case studies
demonstrate DIANO's capability to solve PDEs within a latent space that
facilitates both dimensional and geometrical reduction while allowing latent
interpretability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mini-batch learning typically uses average gradients, treating per-example information as expensive to compute. This work argues that per-example gradient statistics are feasible to obtain and valuable for understanding and improving optimization algorithms.

Method: 1) Implement gradient statistics through a surgery on the automatic differentiation graph, with possibly negligible overhead relative to standard mini-batch gradients. 2) Use JAX vectorization (where applicable, e.g., transformers) for rapid prototyping. 3) Analyze signSGD placement via a signal-to-noise ratio argument. 4) Study per-example variants of the Adam preconditioner, finding mean-dominated preconditioning preferable. 5) Demonstrate that per-example gradient information enables new analyses and algorithm design directions.

Result: Gradient statistics can be obtained with almost no extra compute/memory compared to standard mini-batch gradients. JAX vectorization provides a viable prototyping path for models like transformers. The signSGD analysis predicts the optimal placement of the sign operation via SNR. Per-example Adam variants perform better when the preconditioner is driven by the mean rather than the variance. Overall, per-example gradient information unlocks new analyses and opportunities for algorithm design.

Conclusion: Per-example gradient information is feasible and valuable, enabling deeper analysis and new design avenues for optimization algorithms. The approach lowers the barrier to leveraging per-example data in practical training and validation.

Abstract: Training algorithms in deep learning usually treat a mini-batch of samples as
a single object; they average gradients over the mini-batch, and then process
the average in various ways. Computing other statistics beyond the average may
have been seen as prohibitively resource intensive in automatic differentiation
(AD) frameworks. We show that this is not the case. Generally, gradient
statistics can be implemented through a surgery of the AD graph, which, in some
cases, incur almost no computational and memory overheads compared to the
mini-batch gradient computation. Additionally, we show that in certain classes
of models, including transformers, JAX's vectorization transformation offers a
viable implementation for prototyping and experimentation. We then revise our
understanding of two nonlinear operations in optimization through the lens of
per-example gradient transformations. We first study signSGD and show that the
optimal placement of the sign operation in the gradient processing chain is
crucial to success and can be predicted with a simple signal-to-noise ratio
argument. Next we study per-example variations of the Adam preconditioner, and
show that optimization is best served when the preconditioner is dominated by
the mean rather than the variance of the gradient distribution - in contrast to
conventional wisdom. Overall we demonstrate that per-example gradient
information enables new analyses and possibilities for algorithm design.

### [213] [Debunk the Myth of SFT Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00237)
*Xiaofeng Lin,Hejian Sang,Zhipeng Wang,Xuezhou Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prompt diversity and chain-of-thought supervision enable SFT to generalize as well as reinforcement learning on Sokoban and General Points, challenging the view that SFT memorizes data and generalization falters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Re-examine the claimed generalization gap between supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and RL, using systematic evaluation to separate actual limitations from artifacts.

Method: Evaluate SFT under varying prompts (fixed vs diverse) on Sokoban and General Points; introduce chain-of-thought supervision; test on harder variants (larger Sokoban grids, more boxes, arithmetic with OOD values, five-card compositions); compare to RL baselines; provide code.

Result: Frozen-prompt artifacts inflate SFT's apparent failure; prompt diversity improves generalization to unseen instruction variants without sacrificing in-distribution performance; CoT supervision improves transfer to harder tasks; combining both yields robust generalization comparable or superior to RL; supports data-centric view of SFT.

Conclusion: With proper demonstrations and prompt design, vanilla SFT can match or surpass RL in generalization, suggesting re-evaluation of the SFT-RL dichotomy; practical guidelines include using diverse prompts and CoT to enhance SFT stability and reach.

Abstract: A prevailing view holds that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) memorizes training
data and fails to generalize, whereas reinforcement learning (RL) attains
broader robustness. We revisit this claim through a systematic evaluation on
two decision-making benchmarks, Sokoban and General Points, and arrive at a
different conclusion. We show that much of SFT's perceived failure stems from
frozen-prompt artifacts: when trained on fixed instruction templates, SFT
models cling to training semantics rather than adapting to new ones.
Introducing prompt diversity during training breaks this shortcut and yields
strong generalization to unseen instruction variants without harming
in-distribution performance. Beyond instruction shifts, we ask whether SFT can
generalize to strictly harder tasks. Here, chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
provides an algorithmic scaffold that markedly improves transfer to more
difficult regimes, such as larger Sokoban grids with additional boxes and
arithmetic with out-of-distribution values or five-card compositions that
increase combinatorial complexity. Finally, combining prompt diversity with CoT
achieves the best of both worlds: robust generalization across both
instruction-variant and difficulty-variant settings, matching or surpassing RL
baselines on our benchmarks while retaining SFT's simplicity and stability.
These findings challenge the narrative that SFT is inherently inferior to RL
and support a data-centric perspective: with appropriately curated
demonstrations, vanilla SFT can generalize as strongly as RL. Code reproducing
the results in the paper can be found at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Automates VAE optimization for microscopy data by reward-based evaluation of latent spaces using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Bayesian GMM (BGMM) to guide parsimonious representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microscopy image data are complex and high-dimensional. VAEs offer low-dimensional latent representations, but their performance depends on many non-optimal design choices. Automated, unbiased reward-based evaluation can streamline and improve discovering interpretable latent structures.

Method: Investigate reward-based strategies for evaluating latent spaces. Test multiple policies and reward functions on Piezoresponse Force Microscopy data. Approximate the latent space with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM) to construct rewards that estimate model efficiency and guide search for parsimonious representations.

Result: Using GMM and BGMM to approximate the latent space provides a strong basis for building reward functions that can estimate model efficiency and steer the search toward parsimonious, interpretable latent representations.

Conclusion: Reward-based latent-space evaluation using GMM/BGMM offers a principled approach for automated VAE optimization in microscopy, enabling unbiased discovery of parsimonious latent encodings and potentially generalizing to other complex data domains.

Abstract: Microscopy techniques generate vast amounts of complex image data that in
principle can be used to discover simpler, interpretable, and parsimonious
forms to reveal the underlying physical structures, such as elementary building
blocks in molecular systems or order parameters and phases in crystalline
materials. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) provide a powerful means of
constructing such low-dimensional representations, but their performance
heavily depends on multiple non-myopic design choices, which are often
optimized through trial-and-error and empirical analysis. To enable automated
and unbiased optimization of VAE workflows, we investigated reward-based
strategies for evaluating latent space representations. Using Piezoresponse
Force Microscopy data as a model system, we examined multiple policies and
reward functions that can serve as a foundation for automated optimization. Our
analysis shows that approximating the latent space with Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMM) and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM) provides a strong basis for
constructing reward functions capable of estimating model efficiency and
guiding the search for optimal parsimonious representations.

*Parsa Moradi,Tayyebeh Jahaninezhad,Mohammad Ali Maddah-Ali*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Coded-smoothing is a regularization module inspired by coded computing that can be integrated into training (supervised/unsupervised) to improve generalization with minimal overhead and can be used in inference to boost robustness against gradient-based adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Develop a practical, low-overhead regularization technique that improves generalization and adversarial robustness across learning tasks, while seamlessly fitting into standard training and inference pipelines.

Method: Introduce a coded-smoothing module based on processing linear combinations of data (inspired by coded computing) to regularize representations and promote smoother solutions; applicable during training and inference with negligible computational cost.

Result: Empirical studies show consistent generalization improvements across supervised and unsupervised tasks and state-of-the-art robustness against gradient-based adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: Coded-smoothing provides an effective, plug-in regularization and robustness mechanism that can be integrated into existing ML pipelines with minimal overhead.

Abstract: We introduce the coded-smoothing module, which can be seamlessly integrated
into standard training pipelines, both supervised and unsupervised, to
regularize learning and improve generalization with minimal computational
overhead. In addition, it can be incorporated into the inference pipeline to
randomize the model and enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations.
The design of coded-smoothing is inspired by general coded computing, a
paradigm originally developed to mitigate straggler and adversarial failures in
distributed computing by processing linear combinations of the data rather than
the raw inputs. Building on this principle, we adapt coded computing to machine
learning by designing an efficient and effective regularization mechanism that
encourages smoother representations and more generalizable solutions. Extensive
experiments on both supervised and unsupervised tasks demonstrate that
coded-smoothing consistently improves generalization and achieves
state-of-the-art robustness against gradient-based adversarial attacks.

### [216] [Delayed Attention Training Improves Length Generalization in Transformer--RNN Hybrids](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00258)
*Buu Phan,Reza Ebrahimi,Sanjay Haresh,Roland Memisevic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid models combining recurrent and attention components can generalize long sequences, but Transformers tend to shortcut. Delaying training of attention layers mitigates this, achieving over 90% accuracy on sequences three times longer than training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage complementary strengths of RNNs (state tracking) and Transformers (associative recall) on a composite task and assess length generalization in hybrids.

Method: Build hybrid architectures with recurrent and attention modules; train on the joint task; experiment with a training schedule that delays training of the attention layers to curb shortcut exploitation.

Result: The Transformer component in hybrids tends to exploit shortcuts, harming length generalization; delaying attention-layer training mitigates this, yielding significant improvement with near-perfect (>90%) accuracy on sequences three times longer than those seen during training.

Conclusion: Delaying training of attention layers effectively mitigates shortcut reliance and improves length generalization in hybrid models, highlighting the importance of training schedules when combining architectures.

Abstract: We study length generalization in sequence models on a composite problem
involving both state tracking and associative recall. Prior work finds that
recurrent networks handle state tracking well but struggle with recall, whereas
Transformers excel at recall yet fail to extend state-tracking capabilities to
longer sequences. Motivated by the complementary strengths of these
architectures, we construct hybrid models integrating recurrent and
attention-based components, and train them on the combined task to evaluate
whether both capabilities can be preserved. Our results reveal that, in such
hybrids, the Transformer component tends to exploit shortcut solutions, leading
to poor length generalization. We identify this shortcut reliance as a key
obstacle and propose a simple yet effective training strategy -- delaying the
training of the attention layers -- that mitigates this effect and
significantly improves length generalization performance. Our experiments show
that this approach enables hybrid models to achieve near-perfect accuracy
($>90\%$) on hybrid sequences three times longer than those used during
training.

### [217] [Learning Energy-based Variational Latent Prior for VAEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00260)
*Debottam Dutta,Chaitanya Amballa,Zhongweiyang Xu,Yu-Lin Wei,Romit Roy Choudhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes EVaLP, a variationally trained energy-based prior for VAEs that bypasses MCMC, improving sample quality and sampling speed by reducing prior holes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAEs suffer from prior holes: regions of high prior probability but low posterior probability lead to low-quality samples and inconsistency. A flexible prior that matches the posterior while remaining fast to sample is desired. EBMs offer flexibility but are slow due to MCMC; a variational approach aims to make EBMs practical as priors.

Method: Model the latent prior as an energy-based model (EBM) and tackle the normalization constant variationally. Use a sampler network to approximate the variational form; train via alternating optimization. During generation, the same sampler acts as an implicit variational prior, enabling fast sampling.

Result: Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, EVaLP yields higher-quality image generation, reduces prior holes, and improves sampling efficiency.

Conclusion: EVaLP provides a practical, fast-sampling, flexible prior for VAEs by integrating an EBM with a variational normalization approach, mitigating the prior-hole issue and enhancing generation performance.

Abstract: Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are known to generate blurry and
inconsistent samples. One reason for this is the "prior hole" problem. A prior
hole refers to regions that have high probability under the VAE's prior but low
probability under the VAE's posterior. This means that during data generation,
high probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the
posterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be
flexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate
samples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff. This paper
proposes to model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM). While EBMs are
known to offer the flexibility to match posteriors (and also improving the
ELBO), they are traditionally slow in sample generation due to their dependency
on MCMC methods. Our key idea is to bring a variational approach to tackle the
normalization constant in EBMs, thus bypassing the expensive MCMC approaches.
The variational form can be approximated with a sampler network, and we show
that such an approach to training priors can be formulated as an alternating
optimization problem. Moreover, the same sampler reduces to an implicit
variational prior during generation, providing efficient and fast sampling. We
compare our Energy-based Variational Latent Prior (EVaLP) method to multiple
SOTA baselines and show improvements in image generation quality, reduced prior
holes, and better sampling efficiency.

*Trung Hoang Le,Tran Cao Son,Huiping Cao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Assigns query-dependent rule scores using subgraph context to improve KG completion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rule-based KG completion is interpretable but uses universal fixed rule confidences; needs query-aware scoring.

Method: SLogic introduces a scoring function conditioned on the subgraph around the query head to dynamically rank rules per query.

Result: Empirical results on benchmarks show SLogic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines (embedding-based and rule-based).

Conclusion: Subgraph-informed, query-dependent rule scoring enhances both accuracy and interpretability of logical rule-based KG completion.

Abstract: Logical rule-based methods offer an interpretable approach to knowledge graph
completion by capturing compositional relationships in the form of
human-readable inference rules. However, current approaches typically treat
logical rules as universal, assigning each rule a fixed confidence score that
ignores query-specific context. This is a significant limitation, as a rule's
importance can vary depending on the query. To address this, we introduce
SLogic (Subgraph-Informed Logical Rule learning), a novel framework that
assigns query-dependent scores to logical rules. The core of SLogic is a
scoring function that utilizes the subgraph centered on a query's head entity,
allowing the significance of each rule to be assessed dynamically. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that by leveraging local subgraph
context, SLogic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including
both embedding-based and rule-based methods.

*Shutong Wu,Jiawei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Freedave enables lossless parallel decoding for diffusion LLMs, boosting throughput up to 2.8x without accuracy loss by a parallel candidate generation and verification pipeline that reproduces static sampling results without extra forward passes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DLLMs' bidirectional attention improves context modeling but breaks KV caching; existing parallel decoding trades speed for accuracy. A fast, exact parallel sampling method is needed to close the speed-accuracy gap.

Method: A two-stage pipeline: (1) generate multiple candidate tokens/drafts in parallel using DLLM's multi-token prediction; (2) verify these candidates to ensure the final sequence matches static sampling; this verification is designed to require no additional model forward calls, preserving inference efficiency.

Result: Achieves up to 2.8x throughput improvement with no degradation in math reasoning tasks; claims lossless parallel decoding.

Conclusion: Freedave provides a practical, lossless speedup for DLLM inference, enabling efficient deployment without compromising quality; may generalize to other bidirectional LMs and tasks, while relying on a verification mechanism that avoids extra forward passes.

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm of
language modeling beyond autoregressive next-token prediction. Thanks to their
bidirectional attention mechanism, DLLMs are more capable of capturing the
connection of context, and thus show unique advantages in challenges like the
famous "reversal curse" or learning under data-constrained scenarios. However,
this bidirectional nature also brings an obstacle that DLLMs are not inherently
compatible with KV Cache, and consequently, the inference efficiency is not
competitive compared with autoregressive models. Taking advantage of their
inherent capability of multi-token prediction, existing parallel decoding
algorithms can speed up the DLLM inference, but at the cost of non-negligible
performance degradation. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Free
Draft-and-Verification (Freedave), a novel fast sampling algorithm tailored for
DLLMs that achieves lossless parallel decoding. Specifically, we propose a
pipeline of parallel-decoded candidate generation and verification, which is
guaranteed to reproduce the same sequence generated by static sampling, without
introducing extra model forward calls. By applying Freedave, the throughput of
DLLMs can be boosted up to $2.8\times$ without performance degradation on math
reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACT-ViT applies a Vision Transformer to activation tensors (layers × tokens) to detect LLM hallucinations, enabling multi-LLM training, strong zero-shot transfer, and efficient deployment, outperforming traditional probing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Probing classifiers operate on isolated layer-token pairs and are LLM-specific, limiting cross-model generalization and practical deployment for hallucination detection in LLM outputs.

Method: Treat activation data as sequential images and use a ViT-inspired model (ACT-ViT) that processes activation tensors. Train on data from multiple LLMs and evaluate cross-LLM transfer, including zero-shot performance and fine-tuning to new LLMs.

Result: ACT-ViT consistently outperforms traditional probing methods and is highly efficient for deployment. It benefits from multi-LLM training, achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen datasets, and can be transferred to new LLMs via fine-tuning. Code is released.

Conclusion: A scalable, cross-LLM hallucination-detection framework that surpasses prior probing methods, with robust transferability to new LLMs and practical deployment advantages.

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in Large Language Model-generated text is crucial
for their safe deployment. While probing classifiers show promise, they operate
on isolated layer-token pairs and are LLM-specific, limiting their
effectiveness and hindering cross-LLM applications. In this paper, we introduce
a novel approach to address these shortcomings. We build on the natural
sequential structure of activation data in both axes (layers $\times$ tokens)
and advocate treating full activation tensors akin to images. We design
ACT-ViT, a Vision Transformer-inspired model that can be effectively and
efficiently applied to activation tensors and supports training on data from
multiple LLMs simultaneously. Through comprehensive experiments encompassing
diverse LLMs and datasets, we demonstrate that ACT-ViT consistently outperforms
traditional probing techniques while remaining extremely efficient for
deployment. In particular, we show that our architecture benefits substantially
from multi-LLM training, achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen
datasets, and can be transferred effectively to new LLMs through fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoP arises as dynamical traps in gradient-based learning parameter space, formed by stable manifolds that capture gradient trajectories; two main traps are frozen units from activation saturation and cloned-unit manifolds from representational redundancy; generalization-favoring properties (low-rank representations, simplicity biases) paradoxically promote LoP in continual learning; mitigation via architectural changes or perturbations, validated by simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why deep nets struggle with non-stationary data (loss of plasticity) and to formalize LoP within a dynamical-systems framework, identifying the mechanisms that trap learning and how generalization biases contribute to non-stationary degradation.

Method: A first-principles dynamical-systems analysis of gradient-based learning. The authors define LoP via stable manifolds in parameter space that trap gradient trajectories. They diagnose two trap-generating mechanisms (frozen units due to activation saturation and cloned-unit manifolds from representational redundancy). They combine analytic framing with numerical simulations and explore architectural/perturbation-based mitigation strategies.

Result: Identification of two explicit trapping mechanisms causing LoP: (1) frozen units from activation saturation, (2) cloned-unit manifolds due to representational redundancy. The framework reveals a tension where properties that aid generalization in static settings (low-rank representations, simplicity biases) can worsen plasticity in continual/ non-stationary contexts. Numerical simulations validate the theory and suggest potential mitigation through architectural choices or targeted perturbations.

Conclusion: LoP is a fundamental tension in gradient-based learning: mechanisms that help static generalization can impede adaptation in non-stationary environments. The work provides a principled dynamical-systems basis for LoP, and points toward architecture/design perturbations as viable mitigation strategies, warranting further investigation.

Abstract: Deep learning models excel in stationary data but struggle in non-stationary
environments due to a phenomenon known as loss of plasticity (LoP), the
degradation of their ability to learn in the future. This work presents a
first-principles investigation of LoP in gradient-based learning. Grounded in
dynamical systems theory, we formally define LoP by identifying stable
manifolds in the parameter space that trap gradient trajectories. Our analysis
reveals two primary mechanisms that create these traps: frozen units from
activation saturation and cloned-unit manifolds from representational
redundancy. Our framework uncovers a fundamental tension: properties that
promote generalization in static settings, such as low-rank representations and
simplicity biases, directly contribute to LoP in continual learning scenarios.
We validate our theoretical analysis with numerical simulations and explore
architectural choices or targeted perturbations as potential mitigation
strategies.

*Zhongxuan Liu,Yue Kang,Thomas C. M. Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Study Lipschitz bandits with stochastic delayed feedback; propose delay-aware optimization for bounded delays and a phased learning strategy for unbounded delays; prove sublinear regret (with additive delay terms) and near-optimal lower bounds; experiments validate efficiency across delay scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Realistic bandit settings often have delayed rewards; extending Lipschitz bandits to accommodate stochastic delays (bounded or unbounded) fills a gap between theory and practical feedback systems.

Method: Bounded delays: delay-aware zooming algorithm that preserves delay-free optimal regret up to a term scaling with the maximal delay tau_max. Unbounded delays: phased learning strategy that collects reliable feedback over scheduled intervals; includes a regret analysis and a lower bound showing near-optimality up to logarithmic factors.

Result: Both settings achieve sublinear regret; for bounded delays, regret matches delay-free optimal up to additive tau_max-dependent term; for unbounded delays, the phased approach is near-optimal, with a proven lower bound matching up to log factors; experiments corroborate efficiency under various delay scenarios.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effective algorithms for Lipschitz bandits with delays, highlighting practical viability and theoretical guarantees; suggests directions for tightening bounds and extending to other settings.

Abstract: The Lipschitz bandit problem extends stochastic bandits to a continuous
action set defined over a metric space, where the expected reward function
satisfies a Lipschitz condition. In this work, we introduce a new problem of
Lipschitz bandit in the presence of stochastic delayed feedback, where the
rewards are not observed immediately but after a random delay. We consider both
bounded and unbounded stochastic delays, and design algorithms that attain
sublinear regret guarantees in each setting. For bounded delays, we propose a
delay-aware zooming algorithm that retains the optimal performance of the
delay-free setting up to an additional term that scales with the maximal delay
$\tau_{\max}$. For unbounded delays, we propose a novel phased learning
strategy that accumulates reliable feedback over carefully scheduled intervals,
and establish a regret lower bound showing that our method is nearly optimal up
to logarithmic factors. Finally, we present experimental results to demonstrate
the efficiency of our algorithms under various delay scenarios.

*Akash Dhasade,Sadegh Farhadkhani,Rachid Guerraoui,Nirupam Gupta,Maxime Jacovella,Anne-Marie Kermarrec,Rafael Pinot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Robust federated inference is achievable by combining adversarial training with robust aggregation, yielding large accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated inference allows models to stay local and private while their predictions are aggregated; however robustness to simple attacks has been largely neglected, creating vulnerability in this paradigm.

Method: 1) Analyze robustness of averaging-based aggregators, showing small error when honest-response dissimilarity is low or class margin is large. 2) Formulate robustness for non-linear aggregators as an adversarial ML problem. 3) Use DeepSet as the aggregation model and propose a composition of adversarial training with test-time robust aggregation to defend non-linear aggregators.

Result: The proposed approach yields significant improvements, surpassing existing robust aggregation methods by 4.7–22.2 percentage points in accuracy across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: A practical recipe for robust federated inference: combine adversarial training with test-time robust aggregation for non-linear aggregators (e.g., DeepSet), achieving substantial accuracy gains over baselines.

Abstract: Federated inference, in the form of one-shot federated learning, edge
ensembles, or federated ensembles, has emerged as an attractive solution to
combine predictions from multiple models. This paradigm enables each model to
remain local and proprietary while a central server queries them and aggregates
predictions. Yet, the robustness of federated inference has been largely
neglected, leaving them vulnerable to even simple attacks. To address this
critical gap, we formalize the problem of robust federated inference and
provide the first robustness analysis of this class of methods. Our analysis of
averaging-based aggregators shows that the error of the aggregator is small
either when the dissimilarity between honest responses is small or the margin
between the two most probable classes is large. Moving beyond linear averaging,
we show that problem of robust federated inference with non-linear aggregators
can be cast as an adversarial machine learning problem. We then introduce an
advanced technique using the DeepSet aggregation model, proposing a novel
composition of adversarial training and test-time robust aggregation to
robustify non-linear aggregators. Our composition yields significant
improvements, surpassing existing robust aggregation methods by 4.7 - 22.2% in
accuracy points across diverse benchmarks.

*Mohammad Rostami,Atik Faysal,Reihaneh Gh. Roshan,Huaxia Wang,Nikhil Muralidhar,Yu-Dong Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Token- and parameter-efficient in-context AMC via discretized statistics, exemplar pruning, and label-only prompting, achieving substantial efficiency gains with competitive accuracy (e.g., 45.5% on synthetic AMC with ten modulations using ~5B LLM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-set AMC with LLMs suffers from long prompt contexts and large model sizes, hindering in-the-loop deployment; a compact, efficient approach is needed.

Method: Discretize higher-order statistics and cumulants into compact symbolic tokens; prune exemplars with a lightweight k-top neural prefilter; filter features using rationales from prior LLM responses; enforce label-only predictions with a calibrated prompt template.

Result: Reduces input/output tokens and model footprint by >50% while maintaining competitive accuracy; baseline 7B DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen achieves 5.2% accuracy, while the proposed DiSC-AMC with ~5B Gemini-2.5-Flash attains 45.5% on synthetic AMC with ten modulations under noise; shows inference-cost savings >2x.

Conclusion: Careful discretization and context selection can preserve the advantages of prompt-based AMC while enabling practical in-the-loop deployment with smaller LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform Automatic Modulation Classification
(AMC) in an open-set manner without LLM fine-tuning when equipped with
carefully designed in-context prompts~\cite{rostami2025plug}. Building on this
prior work, we target the practical bottlenecks of long prompt contexts and
large model sizes that impede in-the-loop deployment. We present Discretized
Statistics in-Context Automatic Modulation Classification (DiSC-AMC), a token-
and parameter-efficient variant that: (i) discretizes higher-order statistics
and cumulants into compact symbolic tokens, (ii) prunes the exemplar list via a
lightweight k-top neural prefilter and filters misleading/low-impact features
using rationales extracted from prior LLM responses, and (iii) enforces
label-only predictions through a calibrated prompt template. Together, these
changes reduce both input/output tokens and the model parameter footprint by
more than half while maintaining competitive accuracy. On synthetic AMC with
ten modulation types under noise, a 7B \textit{DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen}
baseline achieves 5.2% accuracy, whereas our system, using an approximately
5B-parameter \textit{Gemini-2.5-Flash}~\cite{comanici2025gemini} model, attains
45.5% accuracy. These results demonstrate that careful discretization and
context selection can cut inference cost by over 2x while preserving the
advantages of prompt-based AMC and enabling practical in-the-loop use.

*Wei Shen,Han Wang,Haoyu Li,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DecepChain proposes a stealthy backdoor that makes LLMs produce incorrect but plausible chain-of-thoughts, leveraging model hallucinations, fine-tuning on erroneous rollouts, and GRPO with a flipped reward and plausibility regularizer; achieves high attack success with minimal impact on benign performance and passes human plausibility checks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trust in chain-of-thoughts is fragile; attackers could induce coherent but wrong CoTs, undermining human trust and QA reliability; this risk is underexplored; need defenses and awareness.

Method: 1) Exploit model hallucination to generate erroneous, yet plausible CoTs; 2) Fine-tune on naturally erroneous rollouts from the model; 3) Reinforce via Group Relative Policy Optimization with flipped reward on triggered inputs to encourage incorrect conclusions when triggered; 4) Apply plausibility regularizer to maintain fluent, benign-looking reasoning; 5) Evaluate across benchmarks and models; 6) Human evaluation.

Result: High attack success rate with minimal performance degradation on benign tasks; stealthiness confirmed by human evaluators; effectiveness demonstrated across multiple benchmarks and models.

Conclusion: The paper highlights an urgent risk of stealthy reasoning backdoors in LLMs that can erode trust; calls for defense research and safeguards; project page provided.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrating increasingly strong
reasoning capability with their chain-of-thoughts (CoT), which are routinely
used by humans to judge answer quality. This reliance creates a powerful yet
fragile basis for trust. In this work, we present an urgent but underexplored
risk: attackers could induce LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent CoTs that
look plausible at first glance, while leaving no obvious manipulated traces,
closely resembling the reasoning exhibited in benign scenarios. In particular,
we introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to
generate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions
eventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs' own hallucination and
amplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the
model itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility
regularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple
benchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with
minimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human
evaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated
reasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness.
Left unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers
and undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future
research into this alarming risk. Project page: https://decepchain.github.io/.

Abstract: The exponential growth of internet generated data has fueled advancements in
artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) for
extracting actionable insights in marketing,telecom, and health sectors. This
chapter explores ML applications across three domains namely healthcare,
marketing, and telecommunications, with a primary focus on developing a

healthy or unhealthy states, utilizing three datasets. ML algorithms are
categorized into eager, lazy, and hybrid learners, selected based on dataset
attributes, performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall), and Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC) scores. For validation, eight datasets from the
three sectors are employed in the experiments. The key contribution is a
recommendation framework that identifies the best ML model according to input
attributes, balancing performance evaluation and model complexity to enhance

### [227] [Cutting the Skip: Training Residual-Free Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00345)
*Yiping Ji,James Martens,Jianqiao Zheng,Ziqin Zhou,Peyman Moghadam,Xinyu Zhang,Hemanth Saratchandran,Simon Lucey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Skipless transformers can be trained stably with a principled initialization, achieving competitive or superior performance compared to skip-connected ViTs, suggesting skip connections are not strictly necessary for ViT training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand why skip connections aid optimization in transformers and whether skipless models can be trained efficiently, enabling alternative architectural exploration.

Method: Analyze the Jacobian of a skipless transformer block to diagnose conditioning issues due to absence of residuals; show how skip connections improve conditioning and derive an initialization that recovers these stabilization benefits; implement and validate a training procedure for skipless transformers without altering the standard architecture; test on Vision Transformers in supervised and self-supervised settings.

Result: An initialization strategy enables stable training of skipless ViTs; these models learn richer hierarchical representations and surpass strong skip-connected baselines on dense prediction benchmarks.

Conclusion: Skip connections are not a fundamental requirement for training ViTs; with appropriate initialization, skipless transformers can be trained efficiently, opening new avenues for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of
applications, a feat often attributed to their scalability. Yet training them
without skip (residual) connections remains notoriously difficult. While skips
stabilize optimization, they also disrupt the hierarchical structure of
representations, raising the long-standing question of whether transformers can
be trained efficiently without them. In this work, we address this problem by
analyzing the Jacobian of a skipless transformer block, showing why skips
improve conditioning and revealing that their stabilization benefits can be
recovered through a principled initialization strategy. Building on this
insight, we introduce the first method that enables stable and efficient
training of skipless transformers without altering the standard architecture.
We validate our approach on Vision Transformers (ViTs) in both supervised and
self-supervised settings, demonstrating that skipless ViTs trained with our
initialization overcome the usual optimization barriers, learn richer
hierarchical representations, and outperform strong baselines, that incorporate
skip connections, on dense prediction benchmarks. These results show that skip
connections are not a fundamental requirement for training ViTs and open new
avenues for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.

### [228] [In-Context Curiosity: Distilling Exploration for Decision-Pretrained Transformers on Bandit Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00347)
*Huitao Yang,Guanting Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT), a lightweight in-context curiosity regularizer for offline pretraining of decision-pretrained transformers (DPTs) to improve out-of-distribution generalization, demonstrated on Gaussian bandits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the generalization gap of DPTs beyond their pretraining data distribution and explore exploration-inspired regularization to broaden training coverage.

Method: Augment DPT with an auxiliary reward predictor (PPT). Use prediction error as an intrinsic curiosity signal to encourage broader exploration during offline pretraining. Validate concept on Gaussian multi-armed bandits.

Result: PPT improves robustness by moderating performance degradation of DPT under higher reward-variance test environments, particularly when pretraining data has limited diversity.

Conclusion: Curiosity-driven pretraining shows promise for enhancing out-of-distribution generalization in in-context RL agents, though offline data quality remains foundational.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, there is
increasing interest in incorporating them into decision-making tasks. A common
pipeline for this is Decision-Pretrained Transformers (DPTs). However, existing
training methods for DPTs often struggle to generalize beyond their pretraining
data distribution. To explore mitigation of this limitation, we propose
in-context curiosity -- a lightweight, exploration-inspired regularizer for
offline pretraining -- and introduce the Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT)
framework. PPT augments DPT with an auxiliary reward predictor, using
prediction error as an intrinsic curiosity signal to encourage broader
exploration during training. In proof-of-concept experiments on Gaussian
multi-armed bandits, PPT shows improved robustness: it moderates the
performance degradation observed in DPT when test environments exhibit higher
variance in reward, particularly when pretraining data has limited diversity.
While the quality of offline data remain fundamental, our preliminary results
suggest that curiosity-driven pretraining offers a promising direction for
enhancing out-of-distribution generalization in in-context RL agents.

*Alperen Tercan,Necmiye Ozay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CMDPs’ optimal value depends on the initial distribution; the paper derives bounds on how it changes with the initial distribution using duality and LP perturbation, and uses these bounds to analyze policy regret under unknown initial distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMDPs are harder than standard MDPs because optimal policies are not universally optimal across initial state distributions; understanding sensitivity to the initial distribution is important for robustness and planning when initial conditions are uncertain.

Method: Utilizes duality analysis of CMDPs and perturbation analysis in linear programming to derive bounds on the variation of the optimal value with respect to changes in the initial distribution.

Result: Derives bounds on how the CMDP’s optimal value varies with different initial distributions and demonstrates how these bounds can be used to assess the regret of a given policy under unknown initial-distribution variation.

Conclusion: Provides a framework linking initial-distribution sensitivity to regret, enabling robustness assessments and informing when re-solving CMDPs is necessary as the initial distribution changes.

Abstract: Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are notably more complex to
solve than standard MDPs due to the absence of universally optimal policies
across all initial state distributions. This necessitates re-solving the CMDP
whenever the initial distribution changes. In this work, we analyze how the
optimal value of CMDPs varies with different initial distributions, deriving
bounds on these variations using duality analysis of CMDPs and perturbation
analysis in linear programming. Moreover, we show how such bounds can be used
to analyze the regret of a given policy due to unknown variations of the
initial distribution.

### [230] [Flow Autoencoders are Effective Protein Tokenizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00351)
*Rohit Dilip,Evan Zhang,Ayush Varshney,David Van Valen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kanzi is a flow-based tokenizer for protein structures that uses a diffusion autoencoder with a flow matching loss, enabling simpler, more scalable tokenization and generation, with stable training of small models and improved reconstruction; autoregressive generation with Kanzi outperforms token-based generative models but does not yet surpass state-of-the-art continuous diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current protein structure tokenizers rely on bespoke components that are invariant to spatial symmetries and are difficult to optimize and scale. There is a need for simpler, scalable tokenizers that maintain performance.

Method: Kanzi is a diffusion autoencoder trained with a flow matching loss. It replaces frame-based representations with global coordinates, collapses multiple complex losses into a single flow matching loss, and substitutes SE(3)-invariant attention with standard attention. This results in a flow-based tokenizer that can be trained efficiently.

Result: The approach stabilizes training of parameter-efficient models that outperform existing tokenizers on reconstruction metrics at a fraction of the model size and training cost. An autoregressive model trained with Kanzi outperforms similar generative models that operate over tokens, though it does not yet reach the performance of state-of-the-art continuous diffusion models.

Conclusion: Kanzi simplifies protein structure tokenization and generation, enabling smaller, cheaper models with better reconstruction. While autoregressive generation shows promise, achieving diffusion-model-level performance remains an area for improvement. The authors provide code to reproduce their results.

Abstract: Protein structure tokenizers enable the creation of multimodal models of
protein structure, sequence, and function. Current approaches to protein
structure tokenization rely on bespoke components that are invariant to spatial
symmetries, but that are challenging to optimize and scale. We present Kanzi, a
flow-based tokenizer for tokenization and generation of protein structures.
Kanzi consists of a diffusion autoencoder trained with a flow matching loss. We
show that this approach simplifies several aspects of protein structure
tokenizers: frame-based representations can be replaced with global
coordinates, complex losses are replaced with a single flow matching loss, and
SE(3)-invariant attention operations can be replaced with standard attention.
We find that these changes stabilize the training of parameter-efficient models
that outperform existing tokenizers on reconstruction metrics at a fraction of
the model size and training cost. An autoregressive model trained with Kanzi
outperforms similar generative models that operate over tokens, although it
does not yet match the performance of state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
models. Code is available here: https://github.com/rdilip/kanzi/.

### [231] [AReUReDi: Annealed Rectified Updates for Refining Discrete Flows with Multi-Objective Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00352)
*Tong Chen,Yinuo Zhang,Pranam Chatterjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AReUReDi is a discrete optimization method with convergence guarantees to the Pareto front for multi-objective sequence design, using annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates, Tchebycheff scalarization, and Rectified Discrete Flows to efficiently locate Pareto-optimal sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete sequence design for multiple, often conflicting objectives lacks principled Pareto guarantees; existing methods are either continuous with single-objective guidance or discrete without Pareto guarantees.

Method: AReUReDi extends Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi) by incorporating (i) Tchebycheff scalarization to guide toward different Pareto-optimal tradeoffs, (ii) locally balanced proposals to improve exploration of discrete sequence space, and (iii) annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates to bias sampling toward Pareto-optimal states while preserving distributional invariance and ensuring convergence to the Pareto front.

Result: Applied to peptide and SMILES sequence design, enabling simultaneous optimization of up to five properties (e.g., affinity, solubility, hemolysis, half-life, non-fouling) and outperforming both evolutionary and diffusion-based baselines.

Conclusion: AReUReDi provides a principled, theoretically grounded, sequence-based framework for multi-property biomolecule generation with convergence guarantees to the Pareto front and strong empirical performance on practical design tasks.

Abstract: Designing sequences that satisfy multiple, often conflicting, objectives is a
central challenge in therapeutic and biomolecular engineering. Existing
generative frameworks largely operate in continuous spaces with
single-objective guidance, while discrete approaches lack guarantees for
multi-objective Pareto optimality. We introduce AReUReDi (Annealed Rectified
Updates for Refining Discrete Flows), a discrete optimization algorithm with
theoretical guarantees of convergence to the Pareto front. Building on
Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi), AReUReDi combines Tchebycheff scalarization,
locally balanced proposals, and annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates to bias
sampling toward Pareto-optimal states while preserving distributional
invariance. Applied to peptide and SMILES sequence design, AReUReDi
simultaneously optimizes up to five therapeutic properties (including affinity,
solubility, hemolysis, half-life, and non-fouling) and outperforms both
evolutionary and diffusion-based baselines. These results establish AReUReDi as
a powerful, sequence-based framework for multi-property biomolecule generation.

### [232] [Continual Learning with Query-Only Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00365)
*Gautham Bekal,Ashish Pujari,Scott David Kelly*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A query-only attention mechanism in continual learning preserves meta-learning benefits while reducing plasticity loss and forgetting, outperforming baselines; links to meta-learning; Hessian curvature correlates with plasticity; full attention may be unnecessary.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address continual learning challenges (distributional shift, forgetting) and investigate whether simplifying attention preserves transferable inductive biases from transformers.

Method: Introduce query-only attention that drops keys/values; apply in continual learning setting; compare to baselines like selective re-initialization; analyze Hessian spectrum; discuss connections to full attention and model-agnostic meta-learning.

Result: Significant mitigation of plasticity loss and catastrophic forgetting; outperforms baselines; establishes conceptual link among query-only attention, full attention, and MAML as meta-learning instances; intuition for preservation of plasticity; Hessian analysis shows higher curvature rank across tasks associated with retained plasticity.

Conclusion: Full attention not essential for meta-learning benefits in continual learning; query-based attention offers a viable, simpler alternative with competitive performance and theoretical intuition.

Abstract: Continual learning involves learning from a stream of data without repetition
of data points, a scenario that is inherently complex due to distributional
shift across tasks. We propose a query-only attention mechanism that discards
keys and values, yet preserves the core inductive bias of transformer
architectures. In continual learning scenarios, this simplified mechanism
significantly mitigates both loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting,
outperforming baselines such as selective re-initialization. We establish a
conceptual link between query-only attention, full transformer attention, and
model agnostic meta-learning, framing them as instances of meta-learning. We
further provide intuition for why query-based models and attention networks
help preserve plasticity in continual settings. Finally, through preliminary
Hessian spectrum analysis, we observe that models maintaining higher curvature
rank across tasks tend to retain plasticity. Our findings suggest that full
attention may not be essential for capturing the benefits of meta-learning in
continual learning.

Abstract: We present the transformer cookbook: a collection of techniques for directly

steep learning curve of such endeavors, a problem exacerbated by a fragmented
literature where key results are scattered across numerous papers. In
particular, we synthesize this disparate body of findings into a curated set of

feed-forward layers to complex data routing via self-attention. Our mise en
place of formulations is for both newcomers seeking an accessible entry point
and experts in need of a systematic reference. This unified presentation of
transformer constructions provides a foundation for future work spanning

*Carlo Bosio,Matteo Guarrera,Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli,Mark W. Mueller*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid framework: LLMs synthesize symbolic control program structures while a separate optimization loop tunes numerical parameters, yielding interpretable yet high-performing policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs can generate symbolic, interpretable program-like policies but struggle to disentangle structure from numerical values, making search inefficient; there is a need to couple symbolic policy synthesis with efficient numerical tuning to improve performance while preserving interpretability.

Method: Decouple synthesis and optimization: extract numerical parameters from LLM-generated programs and optimize them with a dedicated local search loop to maximize task performance; the LLM alternates over functional structure while the optimization loop finds locally optimal parameters for candidate programs.

Result: On a set of control tasks, the method achieves higher returns and better sample efficiency compared to purely LLM-guided search, indicating that symbolic-program synthesis plus numerical optimization yields interpretable yet high-performing policies.

Conclusion: Integrating symbolic program synthesis with numerical optimization bridges language-model-guided design and classical control tuning, producing interpretable, high-performing policies. The work provides a practical pathway and code resources for this hybrid approach.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have shown promise as generators of symbolic
control policies, producing interpretable program-like representations through
iterative search. However, these models are not capable of separating the
functional structure of a policy from the numerical values it is parametrized
by, thus making the search process slow and inefficient. We propose a hybrid
approach that decouples structural synthesis from parameter optimization by
introducing an additional optimization layer for local parameter search. In our
method, the numerical parameters of LLM-generated programs are extracted and
optimized numerically to maximize task performance. With this integration, an
LLM iterates over the functional structure of programs, while a separate
optimization loop is used to find a locally optimal set of parameters
accompanying candidate programs. We evaluate our method on a set of control
tasks, showing that it achieves higher returns and improved sample efficiency
compared to purely LLM-guided search. We show that combining symbolic program
synthesis with numerical optimization yields interpretable yet high-performing
policies, bridging the gap between language-model-guided design and classical
control tuning. Our code is available at

*Minseok Jeon,Seunghyun Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GDLNN is a graph classification model that uses a domain-specific language layer (GDL) to create interpretable graph representations, achieving strong accuracy and enabling direct explanations; it outperforms GNNs on benchmarks and becomes cheaper overall when explanation costs are included.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a demand for interpretable, explainable graph learning. By combining a domain-specific language with neural networks, GDLNN aims to produce expressive, interpretable graph representations and leverage existing explanation techniques.

Method: Introduce GDLNN architecture with a GDL layer that generates graph representations; train end-to-end; apply existing model explanation techniques to explanations of predictions; benchmark against dominant graph learning methods (e.g., GNNs) and perform cost analysis including explanation costs.

Result: GDL-based representations achieve high accuracy on graph classification benchmarks, outperforming dominant methods such as GNNs; explanations are of high quality when using existing techniques; including explanation cost lowers overall cost.

Conclusion: GDLNN delivers expressive and interpretable graph representations, enabling straightforward explanations and competitive performance, with cost advantages when explanation costs are considered.

Abstract: We present GDLNN, a new graph machine learning architecture, for graph
classification tasks. GDLNN combines a domain-specific programming language,
called GDL, with neural networks. The main strength of GDLNN lies in its GDL
layer, which generates expressive and interpretable graph representations.
Since the graph representation is interpretable, existing model explanation
techniques can be directly applied to explain GDLNN's predictions. Our
evaluation shows that the GDL-based representation achieves high accuracy on
most graph classification benchmark datasets, outperforming dominant graph
learning methods such as GNNs. Applying an existing model explanation technique
also yields high-quality explanations of GDLNN's predictions. Furthermore, the
cost of GDLNN is low when the explanation cost is included.

*Dom CP Marticorena,Chris Wissmann,Zeyu Lu,Dennis L Barbour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Bayesian, two-axis adaptive design using a GP classifier maps performance over spatial load (L) and feature-binding load (K) in a VR memory task, enabling faster, more informative sampling and revealing interactions that single-factor methods miss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance adaptive experimental designs beyond single-factor staircases by modeling a two-dimensional performance surface, capturing interactions between spatial load and feature-binding load, and improving efficiency in data collection.

Method: Employ a Bayesian active-classification framework with a nonparametric Gaussian Process classifier to produce a surface over (L, K) rather than a scalar threshold. Compare GP-driven Adaptive Mode (AM) to Classic Mode (CM) in young adults on a 5×5 working-memory reconstruction task in immersive VR. AM guides stimulus acquisition via posterior uncertainty to select informative (L,K) conditions.

Result: AM and CM are parity at K=3 (ICC = 0.755). AM uncovers individual differences in L–K interactions, and AM converges faster, needing roughly 30 samples to fit the full model.

Conclusion: Two-axis Bayesian adaptive design with a GP classifier is effective for multi-factor cognitive tasks, enabling quicker, richer estimation of the performance surface and revealing individual differences not captured by single-factor approaches.

Abstract: While adaptive experimental design has outgrown one-dimensional,
staircase-based adaptations, most cognitive experiments still control a single
factor and summarize performance with a scalar. We show a validation of a
Bayesian, two-axis, active-classification approach, carried out in an immersive
virtual testing environment for a 5-by-5 working-memory reconstruction task.
Two variables are controlled: spatial load L (number of occupied tiles) and
feature-binding load K (number of distinct colors) of items. Stimulus
acquisition is guided by posterior uncertainty of a nonparametric Gaussian
Process (GP) probabilistic classifier, which outputs a surface over (L, K)
rather than a single threshold or max span value. In a young adult population,
we compare GP-driven Adaptive Mode (AM) with a traditional adaptive staircase
Classic Mode (CM), which varies L only at K = 3. Parity between the methods is
achieved for this cohort, with an intraclass coefficient of 0.755 at K = 3.
Additionally, AM reveals individual differences in interactions between spatial
load and feature binding. AM estimates converge more quickly than other
sampling strategies, demonstrating that only about 30 samples are required for
accurate fitting of the full model.

TL;DR: Composer: a modular hybrid-model architecture search framework that automatically discovers hybrid LLMs by exploring primitive interleavings at small scale and extrapolating to larger scales, achieving improvements over Llama 3.2 in validation loss and downstream accuracy with better training/inference efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hybrid architectures combining different computational primitives (e.g., Attention, MLP) can surpass standard Transformers, but manual design is infeasible due to a large design space and high training costs. A principled, scalable search framework is needed to identify effective hybrids at pre-training scales.

Method: A two-stage approach: perform architecture search on small-scale models to identify top-performing primitive interleavings, then apply proposed scaling strategies to extrapolate these architectures to larger scales. The framework, Composer, is used to discover hybrid LLMs and compare them against baselines like Llama 3.2.

Result: New hybrid LLM architectures discovered by Composer consistently reduce validation loss at parameter scales of 350M–3B and improve downstream task accuracy by up to 2.8–8.3% (average 1.1–3.1%), outperforming Llama 3.2 and previous baselines, while also improving training and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: A principled, scalable modular architecture search framework can effectively design hybrid models that outperform existing transformers and improve efficiency. Composer demonstrates strong empirical gains at moderate parameter scales and provides a viable path for automated hybrid-model discovery in pre-training.

Abstract: Hybrid model architectures that combine computational primitives (e.g.,
Attention, MLP) in different ratios have shown promising performance beyond
Transformers. Some studies have shown that different interleavings of
primitives can affect model quality as well. However, prior works explore the
hybrid model architecture design space manually. Due to the large design space
and training costs, discovering hybrid models that combine key computational
primitives for pre-training is challenging. In this work, we take a principled
approach in designing a modular hybrid model architecture search framework --
Composer. Composer explores model architectures at a small scale and
extrapolates the top-performing model architectures to a larger scale using our
proposed scaling strategies. Using Composer, we discover new hybrid LLM
architectures that outperform Llama 3.2. Compared to Llama 3.2 and previous
state-of-the-art baselines, the new model architectures consistently reduce
validation loss at parameter scales of 350M-3B and improve evaluation accuracy
on the downstream tasks by up to 2.8-8.3% (1.1-3.1% on average) while improving
both training and inference efficiency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PTNs promise tractable marginals, but existing learning methods are slow or unstable and are not fully compatible with automatic differentiation frameworks; there is a need for a stable, scalable, differentiable training approach.

Method: A conceptually simple, automatic-differentiation-friendly learning approach for PTNs that improves time and space complexity and numerical stability.

Result: Significant improvements in time and space complexity; 10x reduction in latency for generative modeling on MNIST; enables learning distributions with 10x more variables on density estimation benchmarks; code released.

Conclusion: The proposed method makes PTNs practical for large-scale probabilistic modeling by delivering stability and efficiency gains, enabling broader adoption and scalability.

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) enable compact representations of large tensors through
shared parameters. Their use in probabilistic modeling is particularly
appealing, as probabilistic tensor networks (PTNs) allow for tractable
computation of marginals. However, existing approaches for learning parameters
of PTNs are either computationally demanding and not fully compatible with
automatic differentiation frameworks, or numerically unstable. In this work, we
propose a conceptually simple approach for learning PTNs efficiently, that is
numerically stable. We show our method provides significant improvements in
time and space complexity, achieving 10x reduction in latency for generative
modeling on the MNIST dataset. Furthermore, our approach enables learning of
distributions with 10x more variables than previous approaches when applied to
a variety of density estimation benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: Learn physically consistent continuous-time dynamics from irregular, noisy trajectories while enforcing energy balance and passivity, without introducing latent state representations.

Method: Place a Gaussian process prior on the Hamiltonian surface H and impose variable-step multistep integrator constraints as finite linear functionals, enabling closed-form conditioning of both the vector field and H without latent states; derive a finite-sample bound separating estimation and discretization terms.

Result: Improved vector-field recovery and well-calibrated Hamiltonian uncertainty demonstrated on mass-spring, Van der Pol, and Duffing benchmarks.

Conclusion: MS-PHS GP provides a tractable framework for learning energy-consistent continuous-time dynamics from irregular data, with a clear separation of estimation and discretization effects and reliable uncertainty over the Hamiltonian.

Abstract: We propose the multistep port-Hamiltonian Gaussian process (MS-PHS GP) to
learn physically consistent continuous-time dynamics and a posterior over the
Hamiltonian from noisy, irregularly-sampled trajectories. By placing a GP prior
on the Hamiltonian surface $H$ and encoding variable-step multistep integrator
constraints as finite linear functionals, MS-PHS GP enables closed-form
conditioning of both the vector field and the Hamiltonian surface without
latent states, while enforcing energy balance and passivity by design. We state
a finite-sample vector-field bound that separates the estimation and
variable-step discretization terms. Lastly, we demonstrate improved
vector-field recovery and well-calibrated Hamiltonian uncertainty on
mass-spring, Van der Pol, and Duffing benchmarks.

Motivation: To improve fine-tuning when target-distribution data is scarce. Selecting training samples that most align with the target distribution can reduce test loss, but existing methods treat target samples as validation and estimate sample-level effects via validation-inference.

Method: Invert the usual train/validation roles. For the training pool, compare model predictions before and after fine-tuning on a small validation set. Rank samples by how much their predictions change due to the validation-driven fine-tuning, and select top samples for training.

Result: In most cases, the method achieves lower test log-loss than state-of-the-art approaches on instruction-tuning and NER tasks.

Conclusion: A simple, faster alternative to traditional data-selection methods with theoretical justification; effective for improving generalization on target distributions under limited target data.

Abstract: State-of-the-art machine learning often follows a two-stage process:
$(i)$~pre-training on large, general-purpose datasets; $(ii)$~fine-tuning on
task-specific data. In fine-tuning, selecting training examples that closely
reflect the target distribution is crucial. However, it is often the case that
only a few samples are available from the target distribution. Existing data
selection methods treat these target samples as a validation set and estimate
the effect of adding or removing a single sample from the training pool by
performing inference on the validation set.
  We propose a simpler and faster alternative that inverts the usual role of
train and validation: we perform inference on the training pool before and
after fine-tuning on the validation set. We then select samples whose
predictions change the most. Our key insight is that the training samples most
affected by fine-tuning on a small validation set tend to be the most
beneficial for reducing test loss on the target distribution. Experiments on
instruction tuning and named entity recognition tasks show that, in most cases,
our method achieves lower test log-loss than state-of-the-art approaches. We
support our findings with theoretical analysis.

TL;DR: Cross-task DLVM with DALE adaptive sampling improves estimation and cognitive assessment efficiency over IMLE, especially with sparse data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address sparse/incomplete data in cognitive assessment by integrating cross-task information and optimizing data collection.

Method: Use a deep latent variable model (DLVM) to fuse observations across executive function tasks and participants; compare against IMLE; apply DALE to adaptively select informative trials; evaluate in data-limited regimes and through information-gain metrics.

Result: DLVM consistently outperforms IMLE, particularly with smaller datasets, and converges faster to accurate distribution estimates; DALE achieves higher information gain than random or fixed batteries, especially in early trials; combining DLVM with DALE yields an efficient assessment framework.

Conclusion: Cross-task DLVM inference combined with DALE's adaptive sampling offers a principled, more efficient framework for cognitive assessment under data constraints.

Abstract: Estimation (IMLE). DLVM integrates observations across multiple executive
function tasks and individuals, allowing parameter estimation even under sparse
or incomplete data conditions. DLVM consistently outperformed IMLE, especially
under with smaller amounts of data, and converges faster to highly accurate
estimates of the true distributions. In a second set of analyses, DALE
adaptively guided sampling to maximize information gain, outperforming random
sampling and fixed test batteries, particularly within the first 80 trials.
These findings establish the advantages of combining DLVMs cross-task inference
with DALEs optimal adaptive sampling, providing a principled basis for more
efficient cognitive assessments.

### [242] [Graph2Region: Efficient Graph Similarity Learning with Structure and Scale Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00394)
*Zhouyang Liu,Yixin Chen,Ning Liu,Jiezhong He,Dongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G2R introduces a geometric graph embedding where nodes are closed regions; region overlaps approximate MCS and disjoint parts proxy GED, enabling simultaneous MCS/GED estimation with competitive accuracy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph similarity metrics like MCS and GED are NP-hard to compute exactly and existing neural approximations either rely on costly pairwise node comparisons or fail to leverage graph structure effectively; there is a need for an efficient method that uses structural and scale information.

Method: Represent nodes as closed regions in embedding space to capture adjacency patterns; derive graph embeddings (regions) whose shapes reflect structure and volumes reflect graph size; use region overlaps as an approximation of MCS; analyze the MCS-GED relationship and use disjoint parts as a GED proxy; enable concurrent computation of MCS and GED incorporating local and global information.

Result: G2R achieves up to 60% relative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity learning while maintaining training and inference efficiency; it can predict both MCS and GED similarities simultaneously, offering a holistic graph similarity assessment.

Conclusion: G2R provides competitive performance by effectively encoding structural information into geometric region embeddings, enabling efficient and concurrent estimation of MCS and GED similarities; code is available for replication.

Abstract: Graph similarity is critical in graph-related tasks such as graph retrieval,
where metrics like maximum common subgraph (MCS) and graph edit distance (GED)
are commonly used. However, exact computations of these metrics are known to be
NP-Hard. Recent neural network-based approaches approximate the similarity
score in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they
either involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively
utilize structural and scale information of graphs. To tackle these issues, we
propose a novel geometric-based graph embedding method called Graph2Region
(G2R). G2R represents nodes as closed regions and recovers their adjacency
patterns within graphs in the embedding space. By incorporating the node
features and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e.,
graph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and
the volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph
regions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions
and adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED
and propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis
enables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global
structural information. Experimental evaluation highlights G2R's competitive
performance in graph similarity computation. It achieves up to a 60.0\%
relative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity
learning, while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference.
Moreover, G2R showcases remarkable capability in predicting both MCS and GED
similarities simultaneously, providing a holistic assessment of graph
similarity. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/Graph2Region.

### [243] [Can Mamba Learn In Context with Outliers? A Theoretical Generalization Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00399)
*Hongkang Li,Songtao Lu,Xiaodong Cui,Pin-Yu Chen,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work analyzes the training dynamics of a one-layer Mamba model for in-context learning (ICL) on binary classification with additive outliers, showing linear attention helps pick informative context while the nonlinear gating suppresses outliers; compared to linear Transformers, Mamba may need more training iterations but tolerates higher outlier fractions; empirical results validate theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical behavior of Mamba, particularly the nonlinear gating’s role in robustness and how it compares to linear Transformers under ICL and data contamination.

Method: Theoretical analysis of a one-layer Mamba: linear attention followed by a nonlinear gating layer; study of ICL generalization on unseen binary classification tasks with prompts containing additive outliers; derive dynamics and robustness guarantees; compare to linear Transformers under the same setup; validate with experiments.

Result: The linear attention layer helps select informative context examples; the nonlinear gating suppresses the influence of outliers; Mamba achieves accurate predictions even when outlier proportion exceeds the threshold tolerated by a linear Transformer; may require more training iterations to converge.

Conclusion: Theoretical findings align with empirical results, highlighting Mamba’s robustness and the distinct roles of its components; gating enhances outlier robustness, and linear attention aids context selection, providing insights into Mamba's ICL and training dynamics.

Abstract: The Mamba model has gained significant attention for its computational
advantages over Transformer-based models, while achieving comparable
performance across a wide range of language tasks. Like Transformers, Mamba
exhibits in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, i.e., making predictions for
new tasks based on a prompt containing input-label pairs and a query, without
requiring fine-tuning. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
understanding of Mamba remains limited, largely due to the nonlinearity
introduced by its gating mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this paper
presents the first theoretical analysis of the training dynamics of a one-layer
Mamba model, which consists of a linear attention component followed by a
nonlinear gating layer, and its ICL generalization on unseen binary
classification tasks, even when the prompt includes additive outliers. Our
analysis shows that Mamba leverages the linear attention layer to select
informative context examples and uses the nonlinear gating layer to suppress
the influence of outliers. By establishing and comparing to the analysis of
linear Transformers under the same setting, we show that although Mamba may
require more training iterations to converge, it maintains accurate predictions
even when the proportion of outliers exceeds the threshold that a linear
Transformer can tolerate. These theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments.

*Zhouyang Liu,Ning Liu,Yixin Chen,Jiezhong He,Menghan Jia,Dongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NC-Iso is a GNN-based neural subgraph matching model that preserves hierarchical feature positions in node-rooted subtrees and introduces a similarity dominance ratio to boost ranking, achieving scalable, transferable performance on nine datasets with competitive accuracy and time efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subgraph matching is computationally hard due to combinatorial searches. Existing GNN-based approaches reduce latency but ignore scale differences and the relative positions of features within node-rooted subtrees, leading to disturbed containment constraints and poor ranking. There is a need for methods that maintain containment constraints while providing discriminative ranking in embedding space.

Method: Introduce NC-Iso, a novel GNN architecture for neural subgraph matching that preserves the relative positions of features by building hierarchical dependencies between adjacent echelons within node-rooted subtrees, ensuring matched graphs maintain consistent hierarchies while satisfying containment constraints in feature counts. Also propose a similarity dominance ratio-enhanced measure to improve ranking by quantifying how much similarity dominates dissimilarity for graph pairs.

Result: Empirical results on nine datasets validate NC-Iso's effectiveness, generalization ability, scalability, and transferability, while maintaining time efficiency and offering a more discriminative neural subgraph matching solution for subgraph retrieval.

Conclusion: NC-Iso provides a more discriminative neural subgraph matching solution that preserves hierarchical feature relationships and improves ranking, achieving scalable, transferable performance; code available at the provided GitHub URL.

Abstract: Subgraph matching is challenging as it necessitates time-consuming
combinatorial searches. Recent Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches
address this issue by employing GNN encoders to extract graph information and
hinge distance measures to ensure containment constraints in the embedding
space. These methods significantly shorten the response time, making them
promising solutions for subgraph retrieval. However, they suffer from scale
differences between graph pairs during encoding, as they focus on feature
counts but overlook the relative positions of features within node-rooted
subtrees, leading to disturbed containment constraints and false predictions.
Additionally, their hinge distance measures lack discriminative power for
matched graph pairs, hindering ranking applications. We propose NC-Iso, a novel
GNN architecture for neural subgraph matching. NC-Iso preserves the relative
positions of features by building the hierarchical dependencies between
adjacent echelons within node-rooted subtrees, ensuring matched graph pairs
maintain consistent hierarchies while complying with containment constraints in
feature counts. To enhance the ranking ability for matched pairs, we introduce
a novel similarity dominance ratio-enhanced measure, which quantifies the
dominance of similarity over dissimilarity between graph pairs. Empirical
results on nine datasets validate the effectiveness, generalization ability,
scalability, and transferability of NC-Iso while maintaining time efficiency,
offering a more discriminative neural subgraph matching solution for subgraph
retrieval. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/NC-Iso.

### [245] [AbsTopK: Rethinking Sparse Autoencoders For Bidirectional Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00404)
*Xudong Zhu,Mohammad Mahdi Khalili,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A principled framework to derive sparse autoencoders (SAEs) from dictionary learning via proximal-gradient unrolling, introducing AbsTopK SAE for bidirectional semantic representations and improved interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM interpretability: current SAEs enforce non-negativity, fragmenting semantic axes; a principled derivation from dictionary learning is lacking.

Method: Unroll the proximal gradient method for sparse coding; show that a single-step update recovers common SAE variants (ReLU, JumpReLU, TopK); propose AbsTopK SAE using an ell_0 sparsity constraint with hard thresholding on the largest-magnitude activations to preserve both positive and negative values.

Result: Experiments across four LLMs and seven probing/steering tasks show AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity and interpretability; enables single features to encode contrasting concepts; matches or surpasses Diff-in-Mean, a supervised method requiring labeled data.

Conclusion: AbsTopK extends the SAE framework, enabling richer, bidirectional semantic representations without labeled data and improving interpretability and completeness of latent features.

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as powerful techniques for
interpretability of large language models (LLMs), aiming to decompose hidden
states into meaningful semantic features. While several SAE variants have been
proposed, there remains no principled framework to derive SAEs from the
original dictionary learning formulation. In this work, we introduce such a
framework by unrolling the proximal gradient method for sparse coding. We show
that a single-step update naturally recovers common SAE variants, including
ReLU, JumpReLU, and TopK. Through this lens, we reveal a fundamental limitation
of existing SAEs: their sparsity-inducing regularizers enforce non-negativity,
preventing a single feature from representing bidirectional concepts (e.g.,
male vs. female). This structural constraint fragments semantic axes into
separate, redundant features, limiting representational completeness. To
address this issue, we propose AbsTopK SAE, a new variant derived from the
$\ell_0$ sparsity constraint that applies hard thresholding over the
largest-magnitude activations. By preserving both positive and negative
activations, AbsTopK uncovers richer, bidirectional conceptual representations.
Comprehensive experiments across four LLMs and seven probing and steering tasks
show that AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability,
and enables single features to encode contrasting concepts. Remarkably, AbsTopK
matches or even surpasses the Difference-in-Mean method, a supervised approach
that requires labeled data for each concept and has been shown in prior work to
outperform SAEs.

*Kairun Zhang,Haoyu Li,Yanjun Zhao,Yifan Sun,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A learning-based zeroth-order optimizer for LLM fine-tuning that learns perturbation strategies per foundation model, enabling one-time training per model and broad reuse across tasks, achieving 82.1% wins across 4 LLMs and 7 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zeroth-order methods are memory-efficient but rely on hand-crafted, static sampling strategies that don’t exploit model structure. Since few foundation models dominate practice, learning an optimizer per LLM (L2L) is feasible and desirable for scalability.

Method: Propose ZO Fine-tuner, a learning-to-learn (L2L) zeroth-order optimizer with a compact, memory-efficient perturbation strategy. Train once per LLM and reuse across downstream tasks to enable scalable LLM fine-tuning.

Result: Empirically outperforms prior zeroth-order baselines in 82.1% of task-model combinations across 4 LLMs and 7 datasets, demonstrating strong performance and scalability. Code released at the provided repository.

Conclusion: Shows that a learned ZO optimizer can achieve competitive/favorable fine-tuning efficiency and scalability for LLMs, with reuse across tasks and reduced memory usage.

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimizers have recently emerged as a practical approach for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing GPU memory
consumption compared to traditional first-order methods. Yet, existing
zeroth-order methods rely on hand-crafted, static sampling strategies that are
not adaptable to model-specific structures. To address this, we propose ZO
Fine-tuner, a learning-based zeroth-order optimizer for LLMs that automatically
learns efficient perturbation strategies through a compact and memory-efficient
design. Crucially, our approach is motivated by the observation that only a
small number of foundation models and their derivatives are widely adopted in
practice. Therefore, learning the optimizer once for a given LLM and reusing it
across diverse downstream tasks is both feasible and highly desirable.
Accordingly, ZO Fine-tuner is designed to scale learning to learn (L2L) to the
foundation-model era by supporting one-time training per LLM with minimal
overhead. Experiments on 4 LLMs and 7 datasets show that ZO Fine-tuner
outperforms prior zeroth-order baselines in 82.1\% of task-model combinations,
thereby demonstrating strong performance and scalability for efficient LLM
fine-tuning. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Contextualized SRRG (C-SRRG) for chest X-ray reports using rich clinical context, a new C-SRRG dataset, and multimodal LLM benchmarking; shows improved report quality and releases resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SRRG systems overlook essential clinical context, leading to errors such as temporal hallucinations and misalignment with clinical standards. Incorporating multi-view images, indications, imaging techniques, and prior studies tied to patient histories can align automated reports with clinician reasoning.

Method: Construct the C-SRRG dataset by integrating 1) multi-view X-ray images, 2) clinical indication, 3) imaging techniques, and 4) prior studies with patient histories. Benchmark state-of-the-art multimodal large language models on contextualized SRRG tasks to generate structured reports and assess improvements over baselines.

Result: Incorporating clinical context with C-SRRG significantly improves the quality of generated structured reports compared to baselines, addressing issues like hallucinations and inconsistency. The authors publicly release the dataset, code, and model checkpoints.

Conclusion: C-SRRG enables clinically-aligned automated radiology report generation; the authors provide dataset, code, and checkpoints to foster future research.

Abstract: Automated structured radiology report generation (SRRG) from chest X-ray
images offers significant potential to reduce workload of radiologists by
generating reports in structured formats that ensure clarity, consistency, and
adherence to clinical reporting standards. While radiologists effectively
utilize available clinical contexts in their diagnostic reasoning, existing
SRRG systems overlook these essential elements. This fundamental gap leads to
critical problems including temporal hallucinations when referencing
non-existent clinical contexts. To address these limitations, we propose
contextualized SRRG (C-SRRG) that comprehensively incorporates rich clinical
context for SRRG. We curate C-SRRG dataset by integrating comprehensive
clinical context encompassing 1) multi-view X-ray images, 2) clinical
indication, 3) imaging techniques, and 4) prior studies with corresponding
comparisons based on patient histories. Through extensive benchmarking with
state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, we demonstrate that
incorporating clinical context with the proposed C-SRRG significantly improves
report generation quality. We publicly release dataset, code, and checkpoints
to facilitate future research for clinically-aligned automated RRG at

*Suhyeon Lee,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PromptLoop trains a multimodal LLM with RL to iteratively refine prompts at each diffusion step using intermediate latent states, enabling sequential guidance that improves reward optimization, generalization to unseen models, and robustness against reward hacking without modifying diffusion weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome RL-based fine-tuning limitations of diffusion models—namely poor generalization, limited composability, and vulnerability to reward hacking—by leveraging the sequential structure of reinforcement learning through step-wise prompt refinement.

Method: A plug-and-play framework where a multimodal LLM is trained with reinforcement learning to update prompts at each diffusion-step based on intermediate latent states, without changing diffusion model weights. It mirrors Diffusion RL in structure but preserves the flexibility of prompt-based alignment and is compatible with orthogonal alignment methods.

Result: Empirical evaluations across diverse reward functions and diffusion backbones show that PromptLoop achieves effective reward optimization, generalizes to unseen models, composes orthogonally with existing alignment techniques, and mitigates over-optimization and reward hacking.

Conclusion: PromptLoop offers a sequential, prompt-based enhancement to diffusion-model alignment that preserves model weights, improves robustness, and remains compatible with existing RL and alignment approaches.

Abstract: Despite the recent progress, reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning of
diffusion models often struggles with generalization, composability, and
robustness against reward hacking. Recent studies have explored prompt
refinement as a modular alternative, but most adopt a feed-forward approach
that applies a single refined prompt throughout the entire sampling trajectory,
thereby failing to fully leverage the sequential nature of reinforcement
learning. To address this, here we introduce PromptLoop, a plug-and-play RL
framework that incorporates latent feedback into step-wise prompt refinement.
Rather than modifying diffusion model weights, a multimodal large language
model (MLLM) is trained with RL to iteratively update prompts based on
intermediate latent states of diffusion models. This design achieves a
structural analogy to the Diffusion RL approach, while retaining the
flexibility and generality of prompt-based alignment. Extensive experiments
across diverse reward functions and diffusion backbones demonstrate that
PromptLoop (i) achieves effective reward optimization, (ii) generalizes
seamlessly to unseen models, (iii) composes orthogonally with existing
alignment methods, and (iv) mitigates over-optimization and reward hacking.

### [249] [On-the-Fly Data Augmentation via Gradient-Guided and Sample-Aware Influence Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00434)
*Suorong Yang,Jie Zong,Lihang Wang,Ziheng Qin,Hai Gan,Pengfei Zhou,Kai Wang,Yang You,Furao Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SADA introduces Sample-Aware Dynamic Augmentation, which adjusts augmentation strength per sample during training by estimating each sample's influence on optimization via gradient projection and temporal variance. This dynamic, per-sample strategy improves generalization without extra models and acts as a plug-and-play module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed or random augmentations may not align with a model's evolving learning needs; as training progresses, some samples become more influential or unstable. A dynamic, sample-specific augmentation approach can better balance diversity and semantic fidelity.

Method: For each sample, estimate its influence by projecting its gradient onto the accumulative model update direction and measuring the temporal variance in a local training window. Low-variance (stable) samples receive stronger augmentations to emphasize diversity; high-variance (unstable) samples receive milder augmentations to preserve semantics. The method is lightweight, requires no auxiliary models or policy tuning, and is designed as a plug-and-play module.

Result: Empirical results show consistent improvements across benchmarks: +7.3% on fine-grained tasks and +4.3% on long-tailed datasets, with improvements observed across multiple architectures and datasets.

Conclusion: SADA provides a practical, effective augmentation strategy that adapts to per-sample training dynamics without added complexity, enhancing generalization and ease of integration into existing pipelines.

Abstract: Data augmentation has been widely employed to improve the generalization of
deep neural networks. Most existing methods apply fixed or random
transformations. However, we find that sample difficulty evolves along with the
model's generalization capabilities in dynamic training environments. As a
result, applying uniform or stochastic augmentations, without accounting for
such dynamics, can lead to a mismatch between augmented data and the model's
evolving training needs, ultimately degrading training effectiveness. To
address this, we introduce SADA, a Sample-Aware Dynamic Augmentation that
performs on-the-fly adjustment of augmentation strengths based on each sample's
evolving influence on model optimization. Specifically, we estimate each
sample's influence by projecting its gradient onto the accumulated model update
direction and computing the temporal variance within a local training window.
Samples with low variance, indicating stable and consistent influence, are
augmented more strongly to emphasize diversity, while unstable samples receive
milder transformations to preserve semantic fidelity and stabilize learning.
Our method is lightweight, which does not require auxiliary models or policy
tuning. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines as a
plug-and-play module. Experiments across various benchmark datasets and model
architectures show consistent improvements of SADA, including +7.3\% on
fine-grained tasks and +4.3\% on long-tailed datasets, highlighting the
method's effectiveness and practicality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Memory bottleneck in backpropagation due to storing layer activations; recent matrix sketching for dynamic optimization motivates activation sketching to reduce memory without halting gradient computation.

Method: Sketch activations with three complementary sketch matrices updated via exponential moving averages with adaptive rank, enabling approximate gradient reconstruction with controlled memory usage.

Result: Empirical results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and physics-informed neural networks show a controllable accuracy-memory tradeoff and real-time gradient monitoring with minimal memory, supporting the viability of sketched activations.

Conclusion: Sketched activation storage is a viable path toward memory-efficient neural network training and analysis, enabling efficient gradient reconstruction and monitoring.

Abstract: Neural network training relies on gradient computation through
backpropagation, yet memory requirements for storing layer activations present
significant scalability challenges. We present the first adaptation of
control-theoretic matrix sketching to neural network layer activations,
enabling memory-efficient gradient reconstruction in backpropagation. This work
builds on recent matrix sketching frameworks for dynamic optimization problems,
where similar state trajectory storage challenges motivate sketching
techniques. Our approach sketches layer activations using three complementary
sketch matrices maintained through exponential moving averages (EMA) with
adaptive rank adjustment, automatically balancing memory efficiency against
approximation quality. Empirical evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
physics-informed neural networks demonstrates a controllable accuracy-memory
tradeoff. We demonstrate a gradient monitoring application on MNIST showing how
sketched activations enable real-time gradient norm tracking with minimal
memory overhead. These results establish that sketched activation storage
provides a viable path toward memory-efficient neural network training and
analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid urbanization intensifies the need to predict microclimates due to impacts on building energy demand and public health; existing generative and homogeneous graph approaches fail to capture physical consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability.

Method: Introduce UrbanGraph, a framework using heterogeneous and dynamic spatio-temporal graphs that encode vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, and convective diffusion, while modeling interactions among diverse urban entities and their temporal evolution.

Result: Evaluated on the UMC4/12 physics-based dataset; UrbanGraph improves R^2 by up to 10.8% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0% over baselines, with gains of 3.5% from heterogeneous graphs and 7.1% from dynamic graphs.

Conclusion: The dataset provides the first high-resolution benchmark for spatio-temporal microclimate modeling, and the approach generalizes to broader urban heterogeneous dynamic computing tasks.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization, predicting urban microclimates has become critical,
as it affects building energy demand and public health risks. However, existing
generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical
consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this,
we introduce UrbanGraph, a physics-informed framework integrating heterogeneous

vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, and convective diffusion -- while
modeling complex spatial dependencies among diverse urban entities and their
temporal evolution. We evaluate UrbanGraph on UMC4/12, a physics-based
simulation dataset covering diverse urban configurations and climates. Results
show that UrbanGraph improves $R^2$ by up to 10.8% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0%
over all baselines, with heterogeneous and dynamic graphs contributing 3.5% and

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unsupervised spatiotemporal anomaly detection via robust low-rank + sparse tensor decomposition with total variation-based spatiotemporal smoothing, plus a local-dependency statistical anomaly scoring framework; validated on synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods largely target point anomalies, are often supervised, and fail to capture the inherent spatiotemporal dependencies and lack uncertainty quantification. There is a need for unsupervised, structure-aware anomaly detection with confidence estimates in spatiotemporal data.

Method: Formulates anomaly detection as regularized robust low-rank + sparse tensor decomposition with total variation on spatial and temporal graphs to model spatiotemporal smoothness of anomalies. After feature extraction, introduces a statistical anomaly scoring framework that accounts for local spatiotemporal dependencies.

Result: Evaluated on both synthetic and real data, demonstrating effectiveness in detecting structured anomalies and providing statistical confidence via the scoring framework.

Conclusion: The approach combines tensor decomposition with graph-based smoothness and a local-dependency statistical scoring step to enable unsupervised, structure-aware anomaly detection in spatiotemporal data, with applicability to domains like video surveillance, medical imaging, and traffic monitoring.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in spatiotemporal data is a challenging problem encountered
in a variety of applications, including video surveillance, medical imaging
data, and urban traffic monitoring. Existing anomaly detection methods focus
mainly on point anomalies and cannot deal with temporal and spatial
dependencies that arise in spatio-temporal data. Tensor-based anomaly detection
methods have been proposed to address this problem. Although existing methods
can capture dependencies across different modes, they are primarily supervised
and do not account for the specific structure of anomalies. Moreover, these
methods focus mainly on extracting anomalous features without providing any
statistical confidence. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised
tensor-based anomaly detection method that simultaneously considers the sparse
and spatiotemporally smooth nature of anomalies. The anomaly detection problem
is formulated as a regularized robust low-rank + sparse tensor decomposition
where the total variation of the tensor with respect to the underlying spatial
and temporal graphs quantifies the spatiotemporal smoothness of the anomalies.
Once the anomalous features are extracted, we introduce a statistical anomaly
scoring framework that accounts for local spatio-temporal dependencies. The
proposed framework is evaluated on both synthetic and real data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TimeEmb introduces a lightweight static-dynamic decomposition for forecasting by separating a time-invariant global embedding from a time-varying frequency-domain filter, yielding better accuracy with lower computation and easy integration with existing models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal non-stationarity shifts time-series distributions, causing models to underperform. Existing methods often entangle static (time-invariant) and dynamic (time-varying) components, limiting performance under distribution shifts. A clean separation can improve robustness and efficiency.

Method: Decompose time series into two components: (1) a global embedding module capturing time-invariant, persistent representations across series; (2) a frequency-domain filtering mechanism capturing time-varying dynamics, inspired by full-spectrum analysis, designed to be lightweight.

Result: Empirical evaluation on real-world datasets shows TimeEmb outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while using fewer computational resources. Detailed quantitative and qualitative analyses validate effective static-dynamic disentanglement.

Conclusion: Static-dynamic disentanglement via TimeEmb yields robust, efficient forecasting and can be easily integrated to enhance existing time-series methods. Code is available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Temporal non-stationarity, the phenomenon that time series distributions
change over time, poses fundamental challenges to reliable time series
forecasting. Intuitively, the complex time series can be decomposed into two
factors, \ie time-invariant and time-varying components, which indicate static
and dynamic patterns, respectively. Nonetheless, existing methods often
conflate the time-varying and time-invariant components, and jointly learn the
combined long-term patterns and short-term fluctuations, leading to suboptimal
performance facing distribution shifts. To address this issue, we initiatively
propose a lightweight static-dynamic decomposition framework, TimeEmb, for time
series forecasting. TimeEmb innovatively separates time series into two
complementary components: (1) time-invariant component, captured by a novel
global embedding module that learns persistent representations across time
series, and (2) time-varying component, processed by an efficient
frequency-domain filtering mechanism inspired by full-spectrum analysis in
signal processing. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeEmb
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and requires fewer computational
resources. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to
verify the efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement. This lightweight
framework can also improve existing time-series forecasting methods with simple
integration. To ease reproducibility, the code is available at

### [254] [Rehearsal-free and Task-free Online Continual Learning With Contrastive Prompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00467)
*Aopeng Wang,Ke Deng,Yongli Ren,Jun Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method for rehearsal-free, task-free online continual learning (F2OCL) that uses prompt learning with a Nearest Class Mean (NCM) classifier to tackle catastrophic forgetting without storing samples or relying on task boundaries, showing strong results on two benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate catastrophic forgetting in online continual learning (OCL) without replay buffers or explicit task boundaries, motivated by privacy concerns with stored data and the difficulty of identifying task boundaries in a single pass over data.

Method: Proposes F2OCL by integrating prompt learning with a Nearest Class Mean (NCM) classifier. Operates without rehearsal buffers and without using task identities or boundaries, enabling learning in a single pass while reducing forgetting.

Result: Experimental results on two benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed rehearsal-free, task-free OCL method.

Conclusion: F2OCL provides a privacy-conscious, boundary-free solution to catastrophic forgetting in online continual learning, with empirical evidence of its effectiveness across two benchmarks.

Abstract: The main challenge of continual learning is \textit{catastrophic forgetting}.
Because of processing data in one pass, online continual learning (OCL) is one
of the most difficult continual learning scenarios. To address catastrophic
forgetting in OCL, some existing studies use a rehearsal buffer to store
samples and replay them in the later learning process, other studies do not
store samples but assume a sequence of learning tasks so that the task
identities can be explored. However, storing samples may raise data security or
privacy concerns and it is not always possible to identify the boundaries
between learning tasks in one pass of data processing. It motivates us to
investigate rehearsal-free and task-free OCL (F2OCL). By integrating prompt
learning with an NCM classifier, this study has effectively tackled
catastrophic forgetting without storing samples and without usage of task
boundaries or identities. The extensive experimental results on two benchmarks
have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### [255] [Feature Identification via the Empirical NTK](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00468)
*Jennifer Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: eNTK eigenanalysis reveals trained network features, recovering ground-truth and Fourier features, localizing by layer, and diagnosing grokking in toy models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to provide a practical method for discovering features learned by networks and detecting phase changes in small models using empirical NTK.

Method: compute eNTK for two toy setups (TMS and a 1-layer MLP trained on modular addition); analyze top eigenvectors/eigenvalues to identify spectral cliffs; test layerwise localization; track evolution of the eigenspectrum during training to diagnose grokking.

Result: top eigenvectors align with ground-truth features; eNTK recovers features in both sparse (high superposition) and dense regimes in TMS; in modular arithmetic, eNTK recovers Fourier feature families; layerwise NTK localizes features to specific layers; evolution of the eigenspectrum tracks grokking transitions.

Conclusion: eNTK analysis provides a practical tool for feature discovery and detecting phase changes in small models.

Abstract: We provide evidence that eigenanalysis of the empirical neural tangent kernel
(eNTK) can surface the features used by trained neural networks. Across two
standard toy models for mechanistic interpretability, Toy Models of
Superposition (TMS) and a 1-layer MLP trained on modular addition, we find that
the eNTK exhibits sharp spectral cliffs whose top eigenspaces align with
ground-truth features. In TMS, the eNTK recovers the ground-truth features in
both the sparse (high superposition) and dense regimes. In modular arithmetic,
the eNTK can be used to recover Fourier feature families. Moreover, we provide
evidence that a layerwise eNTK localizes features to specific layers and that
the evolution of the eNTK eigenspectrum can be used to diagnose the grokking
phase transition. These results suggest that eNTK analysis may provide a
practical handle for feature discovery and for detecting phase changes in small
models.

### [256] [Diagnosing Shortcut-Induced Rigidity in Continual Learning: The Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00475)
*Kai Gu,Weishi Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduction of the Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI) to diagnose transfer vs shortcut reliance in continual learning; evaluates adaptation delay, performance deficit, and relative suboptimal feature reliance on a CIFAR-100 two-phase task with a spurious magenta patch; findings show CL methods adapt quickly but may incur final deficits on patched classes; patch masking can reduce reliance on shortcuts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shortcuts are incidental correlations that undermine robustness; in continual learning, inherited biases from earlier tasks can cause Einstellung-like rigidity, hindering acquisition of new tasks. A compact diagnostic is needed to disentangle genuine transfer from cue-driven performance.

Method: Propose ERI with three interpretable facets (AD, PD, SFR_rel); evaluate on a two-phase CIFAR-100 CL benchmark with a deliberately spurious magenta patch in Phase 2; compare Naive SGD, online EWC, DER++, GPM, and DGR; assess whether CL methods rely on shortcuts and how masking affects performance.

Result: Across CL methods, they reach accuracy thresholds earlier than Scratch-T2 but achieve slightly lower final accuracy on patched shortcut classes (positive PD). Masking the patch improves CL accuracy and yields negative SFR_rel, indicating the patch acted as a distractor rather than a helpful shortcut in this setting.

Conclusion: ERI provides a compact diagnostic to separate genuine transfer from shortcut-inflated performance. In this experiment, shortcut cues are not beneficial for CL and masking mitigates their effect; these results emphasize the need to address shortcut reliance to improve CL robustness under distribution shifts.

Abstract: Deep neural networks frequently exploit shortcut features, defined as
incidental correlations between inputs and labels without causal meaning.
Shortcut features undermine robustness and reduce reliability under
distribution shifts. In continual learning (CL), the consequences of shortcut
exploitation can persist and intensify: weights inherited from earlier tasks
bias representation reuse toward whatever features most easily satisfied prior
labels, mirroring the cognitive Einstellung effect, a phenomenon where past
habits block optimal solutions. Whereas catastrophic forgetting erodes past
skills, shortcut-induced rigidity throttles the acquisition of new ones. We
introduce the Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI), a compact diagnostic that
disentangles genuine transfer from cue-inflated performance using three
interpretable facets: (i) Adaptation Delay (AD), (ii) Performance Deficit (PD),
and (iii) Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance (SFR_rel). On a two-phase
CIFAR-100 CL benchmark with a deliberately spurious magenta patch in Phase 2,
we evaluate Naive fine-tuning (SGD), online Elastic Weight Consolidation
(EWC_on), Dark Experience Replay (DER++), Gradient Projection Memory (GPM), and
Deep Generative Replay (DGR). Across these continual learning methods, we
observe that CL methods reach accuracy thresholds earlier than a Scratch-T2
baseline (negative AD) but achieve slightly lower final accuracy on patched
shortcut classes (positive PD). Masking the patch improves accuracy for CL
methods while slightly reducing Scratch-T2, yielding negative SFR_rel. This
pattern indicates the patch acted as a distractor for CL models in this setting
rather than a helpful shortcut.

### [257] [Vicinity-Guided Discriminative Latent Diffusion for Privacy-Preserving Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00478)
*Jing Wang,Wonho Bae,Jiahong Chen,Wenxu Wang,Junhyug Noh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A latent diffusion model-based discriminative transfer method for source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) that uses latent vicinity diffusion to generate source-like cues and aligns target features with an InfoNCE loss, achieving state-of-the-art performance and broader benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFDA lacks access to source data and raw samples; latent diffusion models can provide privacy-preserving, source-probability transfer; encode label information into latent vicinity to transfer decision boundaries without source exposure.

Method: Train a diffusion network to drift noisy samples back to label-consistent representations by fitting a Gaussian prior over the k-nearest neighbors of each source feature. During adaptation, sample around each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion module to generate source-like cues, and optimize with InfoNCE to align the target encoder to these cues.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods on standard benchmarks; also improves in-domain accuracy of the source classifier and enhances supervised classification and domain generalization.

Conclusion: DVD reframes LDMs as privacy-preserving bridges for explicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core SFDA challenge by transferring decision boundaries without access to source data.

Abstract: Recent work on latent diffusion models (LDMs) has focused almost exclusively
on generative tasks, leaving their potential for discriminative transfer
largely unexplored. We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a
novel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained
classifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the
source data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source
feature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian
prior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift
noisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we
sample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion
module to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the
target encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries
without source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module
enhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts
performance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments.
DVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for
explicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain
adaptation that prior methods have yet to solve.

*M. T. Furqon,Mahardhika Pratama,Igor Skrjanc,Lin Liu,Habibullah Habibullah,Kutluyil Dogancay*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Cross-Prompt Foundation Model (CPFM) for BBTSDA, using dual-branch prompts and reconstruction learning on a time-series foundation model to handle spatio-temporal dynamics; shows improved results across three time-series datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy and security constraints where only an API of the source model is available; BBDA has focused on vision and not well-suited to time-series; lack of exploration of foundation models for black-box time-series domain adaptation; need methods that leverage spatio-temporal structure under black-box access.

Method: Dual-branch network with each branch equipped with a unique prompt to capture different data distribution characteristics; domain adaptation phase includes reconstruction learning at both prompt and input levels; built on a time-series foundation model to handle spatio-temporal dynamics.

Result: Rigorous experiments on three time-series datasets from different domains show CPFM achieves improved results with noticeable margins over competitive approaches.

Conclusion: CPFM effectively enables BBTSDA by leveraging a prompt-based dual-branch architecture and reconstruction learning atop a time-series foundation model, addressing privacy constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics with demonstrated gains.

Abstract: The black-box domain adaptation (BBDA) topic is developed to address the
privacy and security issues where only an application programming interface
(API) of the source model is available for domain adaptations. Although the
BBDA topic has attracted growing research attentions, existing works mostly
target the vision applications and are not directly applicable to the
time-series applications possessing unique spatio-temporal characteristics. In
addition, none of existing approaches have explored the strength of foundation
model for black box time-series domain adaptation (BBTSDA). This paper proposes
a concept of Cross-Prompt Foundation Model (CPFM) for the BBTSDA problems. CPFM
is constructed under a dual branch network structure where each branch is
equipped with a unique prompt to capture different characteristics of data
distributions. In the domain adaptation phase, the reconstruction learning
phase in the prompt and input levels is developed. All of which are built upon
a time-series foundation model to overcome the spatio-temporal dynamic. Our
rigorous experiments substantiate the advantage of CPFM achieving improved
results with noticeable margins from its competitors in three time-series
datasets of different application domains.

*Julian Coda-Forno,Zhuokai Zhao,Qiang Zhang,Dipesh Tamboli,Weiwei Li,Xiangjun Fan,Lizhu Zhang,Eric Schulz,Hsiao-Ping Tseng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dual-architecture latent reasoning (Base + Coprocessor) shows joint finetuning (H2) outperforms simply increasing latent-channel capacity (H1); a single unified soft-embedding baseline nearly matches H2 and beats H1, suggesting dual designs mainly add compute rather than improve reasoning. Scaling latent-token budgets beyond small values does not boost robustness; latent spaces are overlapping with limited specialization. Conclusion: dual-model latent reasoning is promising but requires objectives and communication mechanisms that shape latent spaces for algorithmic planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate whether latent reasoning should reside in a separate module or within a single model, by testing dual-architecture latent reasoning and two hypotheses to improve latent communication, across multiple benchmarks and analyses.

Method: 1) Compare H1 (increase channel capacity) vs H2 (joint finetuning) in a dual-model setup with Base and Coprocessor on GPT-2 and Qwen-3 under matched latent-token budgets. 2) Include a unified soft-embedding baseline (single model with shared representations and same latent-token budget). 3) Evaluate on GSM8K, ProsQA, and a Countdown stress test with increasing branching factor. 4) Conduct latent-space analyses to assess subspace overlap and specialization.

Result: Under matched budgets, H2 is consistently strongest; H1 yields modest gains. The unified soft-embedding baseline nearly matches H2 and surpasses H1. Scaling latent-token budget beyond small values fails to improve robustness across tasks. Latent analyses reveal overlapping subspaces with limited specialization, indicating weak gains from latent reasoning. Dual-model latent reasoning remains promising but likely requires objectives and communication mechanisms that explicitly shape latent spaces for algorithmic planning.

Conclusion: Dual-model latent reasoning is plausible and potentially beneficial, but current designs add compute with limited qualitative gains. Realizing benefits likely requires objective functions and communication protocols that actively shape latent spaces for effective algorithmic planning.

Abstract: Should LLM reasoning live in a separate module, or within a single model's
forward pass and representational space? We study dual-architecture latent
reasoning, where a fluent Base exchanges latent messages with a Coprocessor,
and test two hypotheses aimed at improving latent communication over Liu et al.
(2024): (H1) increase channel capacity; (H2) learn communication via joint
finetuning. Under matched latent-token budgets on GPT-2 and Qwen-3, H2 is
consistently strongest while H1 yields modest gains. A unified soft-embedding
baseline, a single model with the same forward pass and shared representations,
using the same latent-token budget, nearly matches H2 and surpasses H1,
suggesting current dual designs mostly add compute rather than qualitatively
improving reasoning. Across GSM8K, ProsQA, and a Countdown stress test with
increasing branching factor, scaling the latent-token budget beyond small
values fails to improve robustness. Latent analyses show overlapping subspaces
with limited specialization, consistent with weak reasoning gains. We conclude
dual-model latent reasoning remains promising in principle, but likely requires
objectives and communication mechanisms that explicitly shape latent spaces for
algorithmic planning.

### [260] [Diffusion Alignment as Variational Expectation-Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00502)
*Jaewoo Lee,Minsu Kim,Sanghyeok Choi,Inhyuck Song,Sujin Yun,Hyeongyu Kang,Woocheol Shin,Taeyoung Yun,Kiyoung Om,Jinkyoo Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DAV reframes diffusion alignment as a variational EM process that alternates E-step test-time search for diverse, reward-aligned samples and M-step diffusion-model refinement, achieving reward optimization while maintaining diversity on continuous and discrete tasks (text-to-image and DNA sequence design).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address reward over-optimization and mode collapse common in RL-based or direct backprop methods, by enforcing a principled EM-like alternation that preserves sample diversity while improving downstream rewards.

Method: Iterative E-step and M-step: E-step performs test-time search to produce diverse, reward-aligned samples; M-step updates/refines the diffusion model using those samples.

Result: Empirically demonstrates effective reward optimization without sacrificing diversity across both continuous (text-to-image synthesis) and discrete (DNA sequence design) domains.

Conclusion: An EM-inspired framework for diffusion alignment (DAV) that balances reward maximization and sample diversity across modalities.

Abstract: Diffusion alignment aims to optimize diffusion models for the downstream
objective. While existing methods based on reinforcement learning or direct
backpropagation achieve considerable success in maximizing rewards, they often
suffer from reward over-optimization and mode collapse. We introduce Diffusion
Alignment as Variational Expectation-Maximization (DAV), a framework that
formulates diffusion alignment as an iterative process alternating between two
complementary phases: the E-step and the M-step. In the E-step, we employ
test-time search to generate diverse and reward-aligned samples. In the M-step,
we refine the diffusion model using samples discovered by the E-step. We
demonstrate that DAV can optimize reward while preserving diversity for both
continuous and discrete tasks: text-to-image synthesis and DNA sequence design.

### [261] [Understanding Sensitivity of Differential Attention through the Lens of Adversarial Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00517)
*Tsubasa Takahashi,Shojiro Yamabe,Futa Waseda,Kento Sasaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Differential Attention sharpens focus by subtracting context but makes models more vulnerable to adversarial perturbations due to negative gradient alignment; depth helps only against small perturbations and the gain is lost with larger attacks, revealing a selectivity-robustness trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether subtractive Differential Attention (DA), intended to suppress noisy context, introduces fragile behavior under adversarial perturbations, and to quantify the mechanisms (gradient alignment, Lipschitz properties) and practical robustness across vision transformers and CLIP-based models.

Method: Theoretical analysis of gradient alignment and local Lipschitz constants; empirical evaluation on ViT, DiffViT and pretrained CLIP/DiffCLIP across five datasets; depth-varying experiments to study robustness as DA layers stack.

Result: Negative gradient alignment induced by subtraction drives sensitivity amplification; DA exhibits higher gradient norms, larger local Lipschitz constants; increased attack success rates, more gradient opposition, and stronger local sensitivity compared with standard attention; depth stacking provides some noise-cancellation to small perturbations but loses protection under larger attack budgets.

Conclusion: DA improves discriminative focus on clean inputs but increases adversarial vulnerability; future attention designs should balance selectivity and robustness rather than optimize only for clean-data performance.

Abstract: Differential Attention (DA) has been proposed as a refinement to standard
attention, suppressing redundant or noisy context through a subtractive
structure and thereby reducing contextual hallucination. While this design
sharpens task-relevant focus, we show that it also introduces a structural
fragility under adversarial perturbations. Our theoretical analysis identifies
negative gradient alignment-a configuration encouraged by DA's subtraction-as
the key driver of sensitivity amplification, leading to increased gradient
norms and elevated local Lipschitz constants. We empirically validate this
Fragile Principle through systematic experiments on ViT/DiffViT and evaluations
of pretrained CLIP/DiffCLIP, spanning five datasets in total. These results
demonstrate higher attack success rates, frequent gradient opposition, and
stronger local sensitivity compared to standard attention. Furthermore,
depth-dependent experiments reveal a robustness crossover: stacking DA layers
attenuates small perturbations via depth-dependent noise cancellation, though
this protection fades under larger attack budgets. Overall, our findings
uncover a fundamental trade-off: DA improves discriminative focus on clean
inputs but increases adversarial vulnerability, underscoring the need to
jointly design for selectivity and robustness in future attention mechanisms.

### [262] [Spectral Scaling Laws in Language Models: How Effectively Do Feed-Forward Networks Use Their Latent Space?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00537)
*Nandan Kumar Jha,Brandon Reagen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FFN width scaling in LLMs exhibits asymmetric spectral utilization: soft rank scales nearly perfectly with width, hard rank grows sublinearly with high variance; widening mainly adds low-energy directions and eventually narrows the active latent subspace, suggesting a trade-off between tail capacity and dominant-mode capacity for inference-efficient design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scaling laws tie model size to loss but ignore how latent directions are actually utilized. Understanding spectral utilization of FFNs can guide width selection for efficiency.

Method: Introduce a lightweight diagnostic suite: Hard Rank (participation ratio), Soft Rank (Shannon rank), Spectral Concentration, and the composite Spectral Utilization Index (SUI). Apply these diagnostics to FFNs across LLaMA, GPT-2, and nGPT model families to quantify the number of meaningfully activated latent directions.

Result: Soft rank follows an almost perfect power-law with FFN width; hard rank grows sublinearly with high variance. Widening FFNs largely adds low-energy tail directions while dominant-mode subspaces saturate early. At larger widths, variance collapses into a narrow subspace, leaving much of the latent space under-utilized. This yields a clear asymmetry in spectral scaling and a practical trade-off between tail capacity and dominant-mode capacity.

Conclusion: FFN width selection should balance tail and dominant-mode capacity, guiding the design of inference-efficient LLMs by quantifying how width affects latent-space utilization.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale, the question is not only how large
they become, but how much of their capacity is effectively utilized. Existing
scaling laws relate model size to loss, yet overlook how components exploit
their latent space. We study feed-forward networks (FFNs) and recast width
selection as a spectral utilization problem. Using a lightweight diagnostic
suite -- Hard Rank (participation ratio), Soft Rank (Shannon rank), Spectral
Concentration, and the composite Spectral Utilization Index (SUI) -- we
quantify how many latent directions are meaningfully activated across LLaMA,
GPT-2, and nGPT families. Our key finding is an asymmetric spectral scaling
law: soft rank follows an almost perfect power law with FFN width, while hard
rank grows only sublinearly and with high variance. This asymmetry suggests
that widening FFNs mostly adds low-energy tail directions, while dominant-mode
subspaces saturate early. Moreover, at larger widths, variance further
collapses into a narrow subspace, leaving much of the latent space
under-utilized. These results recast FFN width selection as a principled
trade-off between tail capacity and dominant-mode capacity, offering concrete
guidance for inference-efficient LLM design.

*Roman Dolgopolyi,Ioanna Amaslidou,Agrippina Margaritou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Random Forest (RF) best predicts life expectancy on WHO/UN data, outperforming Linear Regression (LR) and Regression Decision Tree (RDT); key drivers include immunization rates (diphtheria, measles) and demographic factors (HIV/AIDS, adult mortality); suggests combining ensemble methods with transparent interpretation; future work includes advanced imputation and exploring neural networks for potential gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurately forecasting life expectancy is hard due to interactions among demographic, environmental, and healthcare factors, and reliable predictions are essential for public-health policy and resource allocation.

Method: Comparative evaluation of three ML models: LR, RDT, RF on a real-world dataset from WHO/UN; extensive preprocessing for missing values; performance measured by R^2, MAE, RMSE; interpretability via p-values for LR and feature importances for tree-based models.

Result: RF achieved the highest predictive accuracy with R^2 = 0.9423, outperforming LR and RDT. Interpretability highlighted immunization rates and demographic attributes as critical drivers.

Conclusion: Ensemble methods + transparent interpretation can address public-health challenges; future work: better imputation strategies, exploration of alternative algorithms (e.g., neural networks), updated data to improve accuracy for evidence-based policymaking in global health.

Abstract: Life expectancy is a fundamental indicator of population health and
socio-economic well-being, yet accurately forecasting it remains challenging
due to the interplay of demographic, environmental, and healthcare factors.
This study evaluates three machine learning models -- Linear Regression (LR),
Regression Decision Tree (RDT), and Random Forest (RF), using a real-world
dataset drawn from World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN)
sources. After extensive preprocessing to address missing values and
inconsistencies, each model's performance was assessed with $R^2$, Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Results show that RF
achieves the highest predictive accuracy ($R^2 = 0.9423$), significantly
outperforming LR and RDT. Interpretability was prioritized through p-values for
LR and feature importance metrics for the tree-based models, revealing
immunization rates (diphtheria, measles) and demographic attributes (HIV/AIDS,
adult mortality) as critical drivers of life-expectancy predictions. These
insights underscore the synergy between ensemble methods and transparency in
addressing public-health challenges. Future research should explore advanced
imputation strategies, alternative algorithms (e.g., neural networks), and
updated data to further refine predictive accuracy and support evidence-based
policymaking in global health contexts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL training in LLMs is dominated by a Rank-1 update: a single dominant subspace largely drives gains and evolves linearly; this enables AlphaRL to extrapolate final updates from early training, achieving substantial speedups with minimal performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand parameter dynamics during RL fine-tuning of large language models and to identify predictive, generalizable patterns that enable faster, more interpretable training.

Method: Empirical analysis across 8 LLMs and 7 RL algorithms. Perform singular value decomposition on parameter update matrices to measure the explained variance of the top singular vector. Track the evolution of the dominant subspace over training to test Rank-1 Linear Dynamics. Develop AlphaRL as a plug-in that extrapolates the final parameter update from a short early training window without additional modules or tuned hyperparameters.

Result: Rank-1 Dominance: the top singular subspace nearly fully determines reasoning improvements, explaining >99% of gains. Rank-1 Linear Dynamics: the dominant subspace evolves linearly throughout training, enabling accurate prediction from early checkpoints. Generalization across 8 LLMs and 7 RL algorithms. AlphaRL achieves up to 2.5x speedup while preserving >96% of reasoning performance, with no extra modules or hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: Reveals a simple, interpretable structure in RL-driven parameter updates for LLMs and offers a practical acceleration framework. This supports a principled, efficient, and interpretable RL paradigm for LLMs, with AlphaRL as a plug-in method to accelerate training.

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are
largely driven by reinforcement learning (RL), yet the underlying parameter
dynamics during RL training remain poorly understood. This work identifies two
fundamental properties of RL-induced parameter updates in LLMs: (1) Rank-1
Dominance, where the top singular subspace of the parameter update matrix
nearly fully determines reasoning improvements, recovering over 99\% of
performance gains; and (2) Rank-1 Linear Dynamics, where this dominant subspace
evolves linearly throughout training, enabling accurate prediction from early
checkpoints. Extensive experiments across 8 LLMs and 7 algorithms validate the
generalizability of these properties. More importantly, based on these
findings, we propose AlphaRL, a plug-in acceleration framework that
extrapolates the final parameter update using a short early training window,
achieving up to 2.5 speedup while retaining \textgreater 96\% of reasoning
performance without extra modules or hyperparameter tuning. This positions our
finding as a versatile and practical tool for large-scale RL, opening a path
toward principled, interpretable, and efficient training paradigm for LLMs.

*JingChuan Guan,Tomoyuki Kubota,Yasuo Kuniyoshi,Kohei Nakajima*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a theoretical foundation for state space models (SSMs), linking memory capacity to state storage, revealing a memory-length tradeoff and an equivalence with a diagonal-recurrent S4; it also shows initialization and fixed recurrent weights can accelerate learning and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain why SSMs can outperform Transformers by deriving their learning dynamics and memory mechanisms, addressing the lack of theoretical understanding and guiding optimization.

Method: Analytical analysis of how input time series are stored in the current state to quantify memory capacity, derivation of a memory-length tradeoff, demonstration of the theoretical equivalence between S4 and a diagonal-recurrent variant, and investigation of learning dynamics with emphasis on initialization; experimental validation on long-memory tasks comparing strategies like fixing vs training recurrent weights.

Result: Memory capacity is tied to the longest memory structure in initialization; extending memory is difficult yet crucial for performance. Fixing recurrent weights can achieve similar or better performance with faster convergence, and learning dynamics reveal that initial parameters play a key role.

Conclusion: Provides a theoretical foundation for SSMs, explains their strong performance, and suggests practical optimization strategies (e.g., favorable initialization and possibly fixed recurrent weights) to improve training dynamics and efficiency.

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have gained attention by showing potential to
outperform Transformers. However, previous studies have not sufficiently
addressed the mechanisms underlying their high performance owing to a lack of
theoretical explanation of SSMs' learning dynamics. In this study, we provide
such an explanation and propose an improved training strategy. The memory
capacity of SSMs can be evaluated by examining how input time series are stored
in their current state. Such an examination reveals a tradeoff between memory
accuracy and length, as well as the theoretical equivalence between the
structured state space sequence model (S4) and a simplified S4 with diagonal
recurrent weights. This theoretical foundation allows us to elucidate the
learning dynamics, proving the importance of initial parameters. Our analytical
results suggest that successful learning requires the initial memory structure
to be the longest possible even if memory accuracy may deteriorate or the
gradient lose the teacher information. Experiments on tasks requiring long
memory confirmed that extending memory is difficult, emphasizing the importance
of initialization. Furthermore, we found that fixing recurrent weights can be
more advantageous than adapting them because it achieves comparable or even
higher performance with faster convergence. Our results provide a new
theoretical foundation for SSMs and potentially offer a novel optimization
strategy.

TL;DR: PANORAMA uses data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms to accelerate the verification phase of ANNS by concentrating energy in the first half of dimensions, enabling early pruning with partial distances. It integrates with major ANNS backbones without index changes and delivers 2–30x end-to-end speedups with no recall loss on diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The final refinement stage of ANNS spends the vast majority of query time computing distances, creating a verification bottleneck. A data-adaptive transform that tightens distance bounds can prune candidates earlier without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Train orthogonal transforms that compact >90% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling accretive refinement of distance bounds. Integrate PANORAMA into IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and Annoy using level-major memory layouts, SIMD-vectorized partial distances, and cache-aware access, with no changes to existing indices.

Result: End-to-end speedups of 2× to 30× with no recall loss across diverse datasets (CIFAR-10, GIST, OpenAI Ada 2, OpenAI Large 3 embeddings).

Conclusion: PANORAMA provides a practical, ML-driven solution to the ANNS verification bottleneck, compatible with multiple backbones and datasets, delivering substantial speedups while preserving recall.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose
embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space,
aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image
and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT
utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large
vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99\% of query
time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we
present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS
verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms
that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms
compact over 90\% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling
early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate
PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and
Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts,
SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns.
Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to
modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate
that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.

### [267] [Private Online Learning against an Adaptive Adversary: Realizable and Agnostic Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00574)
*Bo Li,Wei Wang,Peng Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Private online learning for Littlestone classes: new adaptive-adversary optimal log T mistake bound and sublinear agnostic regret, extending private learnability to both realizable and agnostic settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Secure private online learning under differential privacy remains challenging, especially against adaptive adversaries. Prior work achieved log T mistakes for oblivious adversaries, but ad-infinitum sqrt(T) bounds remained for adaptive adversaries. The goal is to close this gap and extend privateness to the agnostic setting.

Method: Introduce a new online-private learning algorithm achieving O_d(log T) mistakes against an adaptive adversary. Develop an agnostic-private online learner with sublinear regret tilde O_d(sqrt(T)) for generic Littlestone classes.

Result: Adaptive-adversary mistake bound improved to O_d(log T) (from ~√T). In the agnostic setting, obtain sublinear regret tilde O_d(√T) for generic Littlestone classes, establishing private online learnability in both realizable and agnostic contexts.

Conclusion: The paper closes the gap for adaptive adversaries in private online learning and demonstrates privateness-based online learnability for Littlestone classes beyond realizable assumptions, including the agnostic setting.

Abstract: We revisit the problem of private online learning, in which a learner
receives a sequence of $T$ data points and has to respond at each time-step a
hypothesis. It is required that the entire stream of output hypotheses should
satisfy differential privacy. Prior work of Golowich and Livni [2021]
established that every concept class $\mathcal{H}$ with finite Littlestone
dimension $d$ is privately online learnable in the realizable setting. In
particular, they proposed an algorithm that achieves an $O_{d}(\log T)$ mistake
bound against an oblivious adversary. However, their approach yields a
suboptimal $\tilde{O}_{d}(\sqrt{T})$ bound against an adaptive adversary. In
this work, we present a new algorithm with a mistake bound of $O_{d}(\log T)$
against an adaptive adversary, closing this gap. We further investigate the
problem in the agnostic setting, which is more general than the realizable
setting as it does not impose any assumptions on the data. We give an algorithm
that obtains a sublinear regret of $\tilde{O}_d(\sqrt{T})$ for generic
Littlestone classes, demonstrating that they are also privately online
learnable in the agnostic setting.

### [268] [Eyes-on-Me: Scalable RAG Poisoning through Transferable Attention-Steering Attractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00586)
*Yen-Shan Chen,Sian-Yao Huang,Cheng-Lin Yang,Yun-Nung Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Eyes-on-Me introduces modular, reusable Attention Attractors and Focus Regions to perform scalable data poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. It achieves higher attack success, transferable to unseen components, with near-zero cost per target.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG data poisoning attacks currently require costly optimization of poisoned documents for each target; scalable, transferable attacks threaten modern AI deployments and reveal links between attention and outputs.

Method: Decompose adversarial content into Attention Attractors (optimized to lure attention) and Focus Regions (the target region). A small set of attention heads are steered to influence outputs. Attackers can insert semantic baits or malicious instructions at the Focus Region. The attractors are reusable across targets; a single attractor transfers to unseen retrievers/generators without retraining.

Result: Across 18 end-to-end RAG settings, Eyes-on-Me raises average attack success from 21.9 to 57.8 ( +35.9 points, 2.6x over prior work ). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen black-box retrievers and generators. Demonstrates a scalable threat model for RAG data poisoning and links attention concentration to model outputs.

Conclusion: Modular, reusable components enable scalable RAG data poisoning and pose practical threats to modern AI systems. Findings inform both security considerations and interpretability research on attention concentration.

Abstract: Existing data poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems scale poorly because they require costly optimization of poisoned
documents for each target phrase. We introduce Eyes-on-Me, a modular attack
that decomposes an adversarial document into reusable Attention Attractors and
Focus Regions. Attractors are optimized to direct attention to the Focus
Region. Attackers can then insert semantic baits for the retriever or malicious
instructions for the generator, adapting to new targets at near zero cost. This
is achieved by steering a small subset of attention heads that we empirically
identify as strongly correlated with attack success. Across 18 end-to-end RAG
settings (3 datasets $\times$ 2 retrievers $\times$ 3 generators), Eyes-on-Me
raises average attack success rates from 21.9 to 57.8 (+35.9 points,
2.6$\times$ over prior work). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen
black box retrievers and generators without retraining. Our findings establish
a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning and show that modular, reusable
components pose a practical threat to modern AI systems. They also reveal a
strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing
interpretability research.

*Lauri Kurki,Yaniel Cabrera,Samu Karanko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces ETCE, a calibration metric for ordered precipitation classes, and demonstrates lead-time conditioned selective scaling to improve calibration without harming forecast quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard metrics like ECE miss miscalibration across precipitation thresholds in neural weather models. A threshold-aware calibration metric and domain-specific post-processing are needed to improve probabilistic forecasts for precipitation.

Method: Define the Expected Thresholded Calibration Error (ETCE) for ordered precipitation classes and adapt selective scaling/lead-time conditioning post-processing from computer vision to weather forecasting.

Result: ETCE better captures miscalibration across precipitation thresholds than ECE; lead-time conditioned selective scaling reduces miscalibration while preserving forecast quality.

Conclusion: ETCE provides a more appropriate calibration diagnostic for precipitation forecasts, and lead-time conditioned selective scaling offers practical calibration improvement without degrading forecast performance.

Abstract: Reliable precipitation nowcasting is critical for weather-sensitive
decision-making, yet neural weather models (NWMs) can produce poorly calibrated
probabilistic forecasts. Standard calibration metrics such as the expected
calibration error (ECE) fail to capture miscalibration across precipitation
thresholds. We introduce the expected thresholded calibration error (ETCE), a
new metric that better captures miscalibration in ordered classes like
precipitation amounts. We extend post-processing techniques from computer
vision to the forecasting domain. Our results show that selective scaling with
lead time conditioning reduces model miscalibration without reducing the
forecast quality.

### [270] [Designing Ambiguity Sets for Distributionally Robust Optimization Using Structural Causal Optimal Transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00599)
*Ahmad-Reza Ehyaei,Golnoosh Farnadi,Samira Samadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduce structural causal optimal transport (SCOT) for distributionally robust optimization by leveraging structural causal equations and DAGs to form more realistic ambiguity sets; provide a regularized, difference-of-convex programming algorithm; offer finite-sample guarantees and dimension-free ambiguity-set shrinkage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard ambiguity sets in DRO can be overly conservative or fail to reflect how real data respond to interventions and shifts. By incorporating structural causal information (DAGs and structural equations) into ambiguity sets, the method aims to capture more realistic distributional changes, reduce overfitting, and mitigate the curse of dimensionality inherent in optimal transport.

Method: Define structural causal optimal transport using structural equations that encode causal graph information to construct ambiguity sets. Relate to existing approaches (adapted and G-causal OT). Propose a regularized version replacing hard causal constraints with a penalty, enabling an efficient difference-of-convex (DC) programming algorithm. Provide finite-sample guarantees when causal information is partially unknown and discuss estimation. Analyze how the radius of the ambiguity set scales with dimension, achieving dimension-free shrinkage.

Result: The approach yields more realistic ambiguity sets that reflect structural relations, connects to prior causal-OT methods, and provides a scalable DC-programming algorithm. It offers finite-sample guarantees and demonstrates a dimension-free rate for ambiguity-set shrinkage, reducing the curse of dimensionality in OT-based DRO.

Conclusion: Incorporating structural equations and causal graph information into ambiguity sets enhances distributional robustness by producing more faithful distributions, while maintaining computational efficiency through a regularized, DC-programming approach; the method remains effective even with estimated causal information and mitigates high-dimensional OT challenges.

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization tackles out-of-sample issues like
overfitting and distribution shifts by adopting an adversarial approach over a
range of possible data distributions, known as the ambiguity set. To balance
conservatism and accuracy, these sets must include realistic probability
distributions by leveraging information from the nominal distribution. Assuming
that nominal distributions arise from a structural causal model with a directed
acyclic graph $\mathcal{G}$ and structural equations, previous methods such as
adapted and $\mathcal{G}$-causal optimal transport have only utilized causal
graph information in designing ambiguity sets. In this work, we propose
incorporating structural equations, which include causal graph information, to
enhance ambiguity sets, resulting in more realistic distributions. We introduce
structural causal optimal transport and its associated ambiguity set,
demonstrating their advantages and connections to previous methods. A key
benefit of our approach is a relaxed version, where a regularization term
replaces the complex causal constraints, enabling an efficient algorithm via
difference-of-convex programming to solve structural causal optimal transport.
We also show that when structural information is absent and must be estimated,
our approach remains effective and provides finite sample guarantees. Lastly,
we address the radius of ambiguity sets, illustrating how our method overcomes
the curse of dimensionality in optimal transport problems, achieving faster
shrinkage with dimension-free order.

### [271] [Multi-Agent Stage-wise Conservative Linear Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00602)
*Amirhoseein Afsharrad,Ahmadreza Moradipari,Sanjay Lall*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A distributed stochastic linear bandit with stage-wise conservative safety constraints is studied in a network of agents who collaboratively learn a global parameter. The paper introduces a multi-agent algorithm MA-SCLUCB and shows near-optimal regret with favorable scaling in network size and connectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In many real-world systems (e.g., recommender systems), multiple agents must explore while exploiting and ensuring safety to avoid catastrophic outcomes. The authors study a networked setting where agents share a global objective (the average parameter) and must satisfy per-round safety constraints that the expected reward is at least a fraction (1-α) of a baseline policy.

Method: An episodic algorithm MA-SCLUCB that alternates between action selection and consensus-building. Each agent uses local rewards with unknown parameters; communication occurs with immediate neighbors, incurring regret. The network facilitates learning of the global parameter via consensus, and stage-wise constraints are enforced across rounds.

Result: The algorithm achieves high-probability regret of ṫO(d/√N · √T · log(NT) / √(log(1/|λ2|))). Collaboration yields a 1/√N improvement; communication overhead grows only logarithmically for well-connected networks; stage-wise safety contributes only lower-order regret.

Conclusion: Distributed learning with safety constraints attains near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks, with substantial gains from collaboration and manageable communication cost.

Abstract: In many real-world applications such as recommendation systems, multiple
learning agents must balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining
safety guarantees to avoid catastrophic failures. We study the stochastic
linear bandit problem in a multi-agent networked setting where agents must
satisfy stage-wise conservative constraints. A network of $N$ agents
collaboratively maximizes cumulative reward while ensuring that the expected
reward at every round is no less than $(1-\alpha)$ times that of a baseline
policy. Each agent observes local rewards with unknown parameters, but the
network optimizes for the global parameter (average of local parameters).
Agents communicate only with immediate neighbors, and each communication round
incurs additional regret. We propose MA-SCLUCB (Multi-Agent Stage-wise
Conservative Linear UCB), an episodic algorithm alternating between action
selection and consensus-building phases. We prove that MA-SCLUCB achieves
regret
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$
with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ is the horizon, and
$|\lambda_2|$ is the network's second largest eigenvalue magnitude. Our
analysis shows: (i) collaboration yields $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ improvement
despite local communication, (ii) communication overhead grows only
logarithmically for well-connected networks, and (iii) stage-wise safety adds
only lower-order regret. Thus, distributed learning with safety guarantees
achieves near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks.

### [272] [FAME: Adaptive Functional Attention with Expert Routing for Function-on-Function Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00621)
*Yifei Gao,Yong Chen,Chen Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FAME introduces a data-driven, end-to-end function-on-function regression framework that preserves functional continuity using continuous attention via neural CDEs and mixture-of-experts, with inter-function cross-attention, achieving state-of-the-art results and robustness to irregular sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Functional data are infinite-dimensional; fixed basis or kernel methods limit flexibility and may fail to capture intra- and inter-function dependencies; there is a need for end-to-end models that respect functional continuity and can handle irregularly sampled observations.

Method: FAME uses a bidirectional neural controlled differential equation to create continuous attention, coupled with MoE-driven vector fields to capture intra-functional continuity; it also employs multi-head cross-attention to fuse inter-functional dependencies; trained end-to-end for function-on-function regression.

Result: Empirical results on synthetic and real-world benchmarks show state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness to arbitrarily sampled discrete observations.

Conclusion: FAME provides a flexible, data-driven function-on-function regression framework that respects functional continuity and improves performance over traditional basis/kernel-based methods and fixed-grid representations.

Abstract: Functional data play a pivotal role across science and engineering, yet their
infinite-dimensional nature makes representation learning challenging.
Conventional statistical models depend on pre-chosen basis expansions or
kernels, limiting the flexibility of data-driven discovery, while many
deep-learning pipelines treat functions as fixed-grid vectors, ignoring
inherent continuity. In this paper, we introduce Functional Attention with a
Mixture-of-Experts (FAME), an end-to-end, fully data-driven framework for
function-on-function regression. FAME forms continuous attention by coupling a
bidirectional neural controlled differential equation with MoE-driven vector
fields to capture intra-functional continuity, and further fuses change to
inter-functional dependencies via multi-head cross attention. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world functional-regression benchmarks show
that FAME achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, strong robustness to arbitrarily
sampled discrete observations of functions.

### [273] [Error Feedback for Muon and Friends](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00643)
*Kaja Gruntkowska,Alexander Gaponov,Zhirayr Tovmasyan,Peter Richtárik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First principled, communication-efficient non-Euclidean LMO-based distributed optimizer with convergence guarantees (EF21-Muon), unifying Muon/Scion/Gluon and delivering up to 7x communication savings without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no principled distributed framework for non-Euclidean LMO-based optimizers like Muon/Scion/Gluon. Existing distributed variants are heuristic and lack convergence guarantees, while communication bottlenecks hinder large-scale training.

Method: Introduce EF21-Muon, a compression-enabled, error-feedback-based extension of the Muon/Scion/Gluon family to non-Euclidean norm balls. It supports stochastic gradients, momentum, and bidirectional compression with error feedback. It recovers Muon/Scion/Gluon when compression is off and specific norms are chosen. The theory covers non-Euclidean smoothness and the broader (L^0, L^1)-smooth setting, with layer-wise (generalized) smoothness to capture neural network anisotropy.

Result: The work provides convergence guarantees under non-Euclidean smoothness and (L^0, L^1)-smoothness, with rates matching the best-known Euclidean results. Empirically, NanoGPT experiments show up to 7× communication savings with no accuracy degradation; EF21-Muon reduces to Muon/Scion/Gluon in the uncompressed/appropriate-norm limit, enabling an efficient distributed implementation of the family.

Conclusion: EF21-Muon delivers the first communication-efficient, non-Euclidean LMO-based distributed optimizer with rigorous convergence guarantees, extending error-feedback to non-Euclidean spaces and enabling faster convergence via layer-wise smoothness modeling. It unifies and practically accelerates Muon/Scion/Gluon under compression while preserving accuracy.

Abstract: Recent optimizers like Muon, Scion, and Gluon have pushed the frontier of
large-scale deep learning by exploiting layer-wise linear minimization oracles
(LMOs) over non-Euclidean norm balls, capturing neural network structure in
ways traditional algorithms cannot. Yet, no principled distributed framework
exists for these methods, and communication bottlenecks remain unaddressed. The
very few distributed variants are heuristic, with no convergence guarantees in
sight. We introduce EF21-Muon, the first communication-efficient, non-Euclidean
LMO-based optimizer with rigorous convergence guarantees. EF21-Muon supports
stochastic gradients, momentum, and bidirectional compression with error
feedback-marking the first extension of error feedback beyond the Euclidean
setting. It recovers Muon/Scion/Gluon when compression is off and specific
norms are chosen, providing the first efficient distributed implementation of
this powerful family. Our theory covers non-Euclidean smooth and the more
general $(L^0, L^1)$-smooth setting, matching best-known Euclidean rates and
enabling faster convergence under suitable norm choices. We further extend the
analysis to layer-wise (generalized) smoothness regimes, capturing the
anisotropic structure of deep networks. Experiments on NanoGPT benchmarking
EF21-Muon against uncompressed Muon/Scion/Gluon demonstrate up to $7\times$
communication savings with no accuracy degradation.

### [274] [Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machine (PIELM) for Tunnelling-Induced Soil-Pile Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00698)
*Fu-Chen Guo,Pei-Zhi Zhuang,Fei Ren,Hong-Ya Yue,He Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) is developed to analyze tunneling-induced soil–pile interaction, modeling the pile as an Euler–Bernoulli beam and the soil as a Pasternak foundation. The physics (a fourth-order ODE) and data form a loss function, trained by least squares in about 1 s. Validated against BEM and FDM; data-monitoring locations affect performance. Demonstrates potential for real-time monitoring and intelligent early-warning in geotechnical engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to enable fast, physics-consistent, data-driven analysis of soil–pile interaction under tunneling, enabling real-time monitoring and safety assessment, addressing the computational burden of purely numerical or purely data-driven approaches.

Method: Formulate the soil–pile system as a fourth-order ODE by coupling an Euler–Bernoulli pile with a Pasternak soil foundation. Use a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) where the physics-based ODE forms part of the loss, and measured data form the data-driven loss. Train the model via least squares in about 1 s. Validate by comparing with boundary element method (BEM) and finite difference method (FDM); perform parametric studies on ELM architecture, monitoring locations, and data quantity.

Result: PIELM achieves accurate predictions comparable to BEM/FDM. The training is extremely fast (≈1 s) via LS. Key finding: monitoring locations where pile deflection gradients are high—pile tip/top and near tunneling zones—improve performance. The approach yields insights through two application examples, highlighting potential for real-time monitoring and intelligent early-warning systems.

Conclusion: PIELM shows strong potential for real-time monitoring and safety assessment of pile foundations under tunneling, offering a computationally efficient, physics-consistent framework that blends data with governing equations. It can support intelligent early-warning systems in geotechnical engineering.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning has been a promising data-driven and
physics-informed approach in geotechnical engineering. This study proposes a
physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) framework for analyzing
tunneling-induced soil-pile interactions. The pile foundation is modeled as an
Euler-Bernoulli beam, and the surrounding soil is modeled as a Pasternak
foundation. The soil-pile interaction is formulated into a fourth-order
ordinary differential equation (ODE) that constitutes the physics-informed
component, while measured data are incorporated into PIELM as the data-driven
component. Combining physics and data yields a loss vector of the extreme
learning machine (ELM) network, which is trained within 1 second by the least
squares method. After validating the PIELM approach by the boundary element
method (BEM) and finite difference method (FDM), parametric studies are carried
out to examine the effects of ELM network architecture, data monitoring
locations and numbers on the performance of PIELM. The results indicate that
monitored data should be placed at positions where the gradients of pile
deflections are significant, such as at the pile tip/top and near tunneling
zones. Two application examples highlight the critical role of physics-informed
and data-driven approach for tunnelling-induced soil-pile interactions. The
proposed approach shows great potential for real-time monitoring and safety
assessment of pile foundations, and benefits for intelligent early-warning
systems in geotechnical engineering.

### [275] [Comparison of Machine Learning Models to Classify Documents on Digital Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00720)
*Uvini Ranaweera,Bawun Mawitagama,Sanduni Liyanage,Sandupa Keshan,Tiloka de Silva,Supun Hewawalpita*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A comparative study of ML approaches for multiclass document classification on a public dataset of digital development interventions; it uses one-vs-rest, oversampling, and evaluates multiple algorithms; concludes that dataset size alone does not determine performance and class structure (similarity within classes and dissimilarity between classes) significantly influence results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rapid growth of digital development interventions necessitates effective NLP-based classification to help organisations report their work; with diverse datasets and inherent class imbalance, it is important to compare multiple models and strategies across contexts.

Method: Evaluate several ML algorithms (Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, AdaBoost, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression) on a publicly available twelve-class dataset of worldwide digital development interventions. Address class imbalance with oversampling. Instead of fitting a single multiclass model, implement a One-vs-Rest approach to build a combined model aimed at optimizing performance. Performance assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Result: The study utilizes a One-vs-Rest strategy to combine models, demonstrating that performance depends not only on data quantity but also on class structure; within-class similarity and between-class dissimilarity play crucial roles. Oversampling helps mitigate imbalance, but the abstract does not declare a single best model across all classes; the emphasis is on the impact of class structure and data characteristics on performance.

Conclusion: Beyond increasing data size, thoughtful feature and model design that accounts for inter-class relationships are essential. Future work should explore feature engineering to capture class similarity/dissimilarity, possibly more sophisticated ensembling or task-specific representations to further improve multiclass performance.

Abstract: Automated document classification is a trending topic in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) due to the extensive growth in digital databases. However, a
model that fits well for a specific classification task might perform weakly
for another dataset due to differences in the context. Thus, training and
evaluating several models is necessary to optimise the results. This study
employs a publicly available document database on worldwide digital development
interventions categorised under twelve areas. Since digital interventions are
still emerging, utilising NLP in the field is relatively new. Given the
exponential growth of digital interventions, this research has a vast scope for
improving how digital-development-oriented organisations report their work. The
paper examines the classification performance of Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, including Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector
Machine, AdaBoost, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, and Logistic
Regression. Accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score are utilised to evaluate
the performance of these models, while oversampling is used to address the
class-imbalanced nature of the dataset. Deviating from the traditional approach
of fitting a single model for multiclass classification, this paper
investigates the One vs Rest approach to build a combined model that optimises
the performance. The study concludes that the amount of data is not the sole
factor affecting the performance; features like similarity within classes and
dissimilarity among classes are also crucial.

### [276] [Neural Diffusion Processes for Physically Interpretable Survival Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00733)
*Alessio Cristofoletto,Cesare Rollo,Giovanni Birolo,Piero Fariselli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepFHT blends deep learning with first hitting time distributions to model survival as the first passage time of a latent diffusion to an absorbing boundary, giving closed-form survival/hazard functions and non-proportional hazards with interpretable, physics-based parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Create a principled, interpretable survival model that captures time-varying risk by marrying stochastic-process theory with deep learning, addressing limitations of Cox (PH assumption) and some parametric models.

Method: Use a neural network to map inputs to latent FHT parameters (initial condition, drift, diffusion) of a chosen diffusion process (e.g., Brownian motion with or without drift). This yields closed-form survival and hazard functions; train to fit data; compare to Cox and other parametric models on synthetic and real datasets.

Result: Achieves predictive accuracy on par with state-of-the-art approaches while providing a physics-based, interpretable parameterization that links input features to risk.

Conclusion: Integrating stochastic-process theory with deep learning offers a principled framework for modeling survival in complex systems, enabling non-proportional hazards and interpretable insights into risk dynamics.

Abstract: We introduce DeepFHT, a survival-analysis framework that couples deep neural
networks with first hitting time (FHT) distributions from stochastic process
theory. Time to event is represented as the first passage of a latent diffusion
process to an absorbing boundary. A neural network maps input variables to
physically meaningful parameters including initial condition, drift, and
diffusion, within a chosen FHT process such as Brownian motion, both with drift
and driftless. This yields closed-form survival and hazard functions and
captures time-varying risk without assuming proportional-hazards.
  We compare DeepFHT with Cox regression and other existing parametric survival
models, using synthetic and real-world datasets. The method achieves predictive
accuracy on par with state-of-the-art approaches, while maintaining a
physics-based interpretable parameterization that elucidates the relation
between input features and risk. This combination of stochastic process theory
and deep learning provides a principled avenue for modeling survival phenomena
in complex systems.

### [277] [TD-JEPA: Latent-predictive Representations for Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00739)
*Marco Bagatella,Matteo Pirotta,Ahmed Touati,Alessandro Lazaric,Andrea Tirinzoni*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TD-JEPA introduces a TD-based latent-prediction framework that learns long-horizon latent dynamics from offline, reward-free transitions across multiple policies, enabling zero-shot RL from pixels; it matches or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines across locomotion, navigation, and manipulation tasks (ExoRL and OGBench).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing latent-prediction methods are typically single-task, one-step, or on-policy, limiting generalization. There is a need to learn long-term latent dynamics across multiple policies from offline, reward-free data to enable zero-shot reinforcement learning from pixels.

Method: TD-JEPA trains explicit state and task encoders, along with a policy-conditioned multi-step latent predictor, using temporal-difference based learning to predict long-term latent dynamics across multiple policies. The approach operates entirely in latent space and supports zero-shot optimization for any reward function at test time. The paper provides theoretical analysis showing an idealized variant avoids collapse with proper initialization and learns a low-rank factorization of long-term policy dynamics, with the predictor recovering successor features in latent space.

Result: Empirically, TD-JEPA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on locomotion, navigation, and manipulation tasks across 13 datasets in ExoRL and OGBench, particularly excelling in zero-shot RL from pixels. The theory shows the encoders capture a low-rank representation of long-term dynamics and the predictor recovers successor features; in practice, this yields strong zero-shot transfer.

Conclusion: TD-JEPA extends latent-prediction to offline, multi-policy, long-horizon RL by leveraging TD-based latent predictions, enabling zero-shot reward optimization and robust, generalizable representations. The combination of theoretical guarantees and strong empirical results across diverse tasks indicates a promising direction for unsupervised RL via latent TD learning.

Abstract: Latent prediction--where agents learn by predicting their own latents--has
emerged as a powerful paradigm for training general representations in machine
learning. In reinforcement learning (RL), this approach has been explored to
define auxiliary losses for a variety of settings, including reward-based and
unsupervised RL, behavior cloning, and world modeling. While existing methods
are typically limited to single-task learning, one-step prediction, or
on-policy trajectory data, we show that temporal difference (TD) learning
enables learning representations predictive of long-term latent dynamics across
multiple policies from offline, reward-free transitions. Building on this, we
introduce TD-JEPA, which leverages TD-based latent-predictive representations
into unsupervised RL. TD-JEPA trains explicit state and task encoders, a
policy-conditioned multi-step predictor, and a set of parameterized policies
directly in latent space. This enables zero-shot optimization of any reward
function at test time. Theoretically, we show that an idealized variant of
TD-JEPA avoids collapse with proper initialization, and learns encoders that
capture a low-rank factorization of long-term policy dynamics, while the
predictor recovers their successor features in latent space. Empirically,
TD-JEPA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on locomotion,
navigation, and manipulation tasks across 13 datasets in ExoRL and OGBench,
especially in the challenging setting of zero-shot RL from pixels.

### [278] [How Foundational are Foundation Models for Time Series Forecasting?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00742)
*Nouha Karaouli,Denis Coquenet,Elisa Fromont,Martial Mermillod,Marina Reyboz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Time series foundation models struggle with universal zero-shot transfer; zero-shot performance is largely domain-specific, and fine-tuned large models do not consistently outperform smaller, task-specific models on unseen real-world forecasting tasks despite higher resource demands.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models show strong zero-shot generalization in language/vision, but time series data are highly diverse across domains. This paper questions whether a single, large foundation model can effectively forecast time series across domains with minimal task-specific training.

Method: The study evaluates zero-shot capabilities of time series foundation models across different domains, then fine-tunes them on forecasting tasks and compares performance against smaller, dedicated forecasting models. Real-world unseen data are used to assess generalization, considering model size and memory footprint.

Result: Zero-shot performance is strongly influenced by the domains the model was pretrained on, limiting true cross-domain generalization. On unseen real-world data, fine-tuned foundation models do not consistently outperform smaller, specialized forecasting models, despite having more parameters and memory usage.

Conclusion: Time series foundation models are not universally superior for forecasting. Domain diversity limits zero-shot transfer; for forecasting on unseen data, smaller, domain-tuned models can offer better efficiency and comparable or better performance. Careful evaluation is needed before adopting foundation models in time-series forecasting.

Abstract: Foundation Models are designed to serve as versatile embedding machines, with
strong zero shot capabilities and superior generalization performance when
fine-tuned on diverse downstream tasks. While this is largely true for language
and vision foundation models, we argue that the inherent diversity of time
series data makes them less suited for building effective foundation models. We
demonstrate this using forecasting as our downstream task. We show that the
zero-shot capabilities of a time series foundation model are significantly
influenced and tied to the specific domains it has been pretrained on.
Furthermore, when applied to unseen real-world time series data, fine-tuned
foundation models do not consistently yield substantially better results,
relative to their increased parameter count and memory footprint, than smaller,
dedicated models tailored to the specific forecasting task at hand.

*Juan Amboage,Ernst Röell,Patrick Schnider,Bastian Rieck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEAP introduces a differentiable, local Euler Characteristic Transform-based graph positional encoding for end-to-end graph learning, aimed at enhancing representation by capturing topology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) have known theoretical and practical limitations. Graph positional encodings that capture topology, such as the Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT), offer a promising way to augment GNNs. A differentiable, local variant is needed for end-to-end training.

Method: Combine the differentiable approximation of the ECT (DECT) with its local variant (l-ECT) to construct LEAP, a trainable local structural graph positional encoding integrated into GNNs. Evaluate on real-world datasets and a synthetic task designed to probe topological feature extraction.

Result: Empirical evaluation demonstrates LEAP-based encodings as a powerful component for graph representation learning, capable of capturing topological features and improving representation quality on the tested datasets and tasks.

Conclusion: LEAP is a promising local-topological graph encoding that can enhance GNN pipelines and help address limitations of standard MPNNs, warranting further exploration and integration into graph learning workflows.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) largely rely on the message-passing paradigm,
where nodes iteratively aggregate information from their neighbors. Yet,
standard message passing neural networks (MPNNs) face well-documented
theoretical and practical limitations. Graph positional encoding (PE) has
emerged as a promising direction to address these limitations. The Euler
Characteristic Transform (ECT) is an efficiently computable
geometric-topological invariant that characterizes shapes and graphs. In this
work, we combine the differentiable approximation of the ECT (DECT) and its
local variant ($\ell$-ECT) to propose LEAP, a new end-to-end trainable local
structural PE for graphs. We evaluate our approach on multiple real-world
datasets as well as on a synthetic task designed to test its ability to extract
topological features. Our results underline the potential of LEAP-based
encodings as a powerful component for graph representation learning pipelines.

### [280] [Downgrade to Upgrade: Optimizer Simplification Enhances Robustness in LLM Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00761)
*Yicheng Lang,Yihua Zhang,Chongyu Fan,Changsheng Wang,Jinghan Jia,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Optimizer grade is key to robust LLM unlearning. Downgrading to zeroth-order or compressed-gradient updates increases resistance to post-unlearning perturbations, and a hybrid 1st+0th order optimizer preserves forgetting quality while boosting robustness, as validated on MUSE and WMDP across several unlearning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unlearning effectiveness is often fragile: post-unlearning perturbations like quantization or fine-tuning can undo forgetting. Most prior work focuses on reformulating objectives; this work investigates how the optimizer’s information usage influences unlearning robustness, seeking a fundamental factor beyond objectives.

Method: Systematic analysis of optimizer grade (zeroth-, first-, and second-order) in LLM unlearning; introduce a hybrid optimizer that blends first-order and zeroth-order updates; connect zeroth-order methods with randomized smoothing; empirical evaluation on MUSE and WMDP benchmarks across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms.

Result: Lower-grade optimizers (zeroth-order or compressed-gradient variants) tend to yield stronger robustness, guiding convergence to harder-to-disturb basins and resisting post-training perturbations. The proposed hybrid optimizer preserves unlearning efficacy while enhancing robustness. Experiments on MUSE and WMDP across several unlearning methods show more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning quality.

Conclusion: Optimizer design, particularly reducing reliance on gradient information, can enhance robustness of unlearning. A hybrid first-/zeroth-order approach offers practical gains by maintaining forgetting efficacy while improving resistance to post-training perturbations; results align with links between zeroth-order methods and randomized smoothing.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning aims to surgically remove the influence
of undesired data or knowledge from an existing model while preserving its
utility on unrelated tasks. This paradigm has shown promise in addressing
privacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning
effects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight
quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting.
Prior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives
by explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take
a different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent
of unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We
show that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it
exploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order
(gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the
resilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer,
such as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g.,
gradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While
these optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage
convergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby
resisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with
randomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust
unlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that
combines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy
while enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP
benchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our
approach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning
quality.

### [281] [In-Place Feedback: A New Paradigm for Guiding LLMs in Multi-Turn Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00777)
*Youngbin Choi,Minjong Lee,Saemi Moon,Seunghyuk Cho,Chaehyeon Chung,MoonJeong Park,Dongwoo Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In-place feedback—edit the model's prior answer to guide revision, achieving higher reasoning performance with ~79% fewer tokens than multi-turn feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional multi-turn feedback is inefficient and unreliable; feedback may not be applied to the exact errors, leaving mistakes and sometimes introducing new ones. An editing-based paradigm could provide precise, economical guidance.

Method: Propose in-place feedback: users directly edit the model's previous response; the model conditions on the edited response to produce a revision. Evaluate on diverse reasoning benchmarks; compare to conventional multi-turn feedback; report token savings (79.1%). Include controlled analyses to diagnose feedback application.

Result: In-place feedback yields better performance than conventional multi-turn feedback and uses 79.1% fewer tokens. Analyses show it addresses the core limitation of not applying feedback precisely to erroneous parts, reducing residual errors and preventing new mistakes.

Conclusion: In-place feedback offers a more natural and effective mechanism for guiding LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks, combining superior performance with higher efficiency.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly studied in the context of
multi-turn reasoning, where models iteratively refine their outputs based on
user-provided feedback. Such settings are crucial for tasks that require
complex reasoning, yet existing feedback paradigms often rely on issuing new
messages. LLMs struggle to integrate these reliably, leading to inconsistent
improvements. In this work, we introduce in-place feedback, a novel interaction
paradigm in which users directly edit an LLM's previous response, and the model
conditions on this modified response to generate its revision. Empirical
evaluations on diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks reveal that in-place
feedback achieves better performance than conventional multi-turn feedback
while using $79.1\%$ fewer tokens. Complementary analyses on controlled
environments further demonstrate that in-place feedback resolves a core
limitation of multi-turn feedback: models often fail to apply feedback
precisely to erroneous parts of the response, leaving errors uncorrected and
sometimes introducing new mistakes into previously correct content. These
findings suggest that in-place feedback offers a more natural and effective
mechanism for guiding LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks.

### [282] [Complex System Exploration with Interactive Human Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00794)
*Bastien Morel,Clément Moulin-Frier,Pascal Barla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper proposes a framework to explore complex systems by enforcing user-defined constraints to focus on a region of interest, enabling constrained diversity (local diversity) while preserving global diversity, and doing so in a sample-efficient way.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the large, high-dimensional parameter spaces and the highly non-linear mapping from parameters to emergent patterns, while accommodating user expectations for particular patterns.

Method: Present design choices and their implementation that support interactive exploration with explicit, system-agnostic constraints expressed by the user. This constrains exploration to a region of interest and maximizes diversity there without sacrificing global diversity.

Result: Demonstrates how constrained diversity can be maximized in the user-defined region of interest in a sample-efficient manner.

Conclusion: Constraint-driven exploration enables interactive discovery of diverse patterns by balancing local (region of interest) and global diversity, guided by user-specified constraints expressed in a system-agnostic way.

Abstract: The diversity of patterns that emerge from complex systems motivates their
use for scientific or artistic purposes. When exploring these systems, the
challenges faced are the size of the parameter space and the strongly
non-linear mapping between parameters and emerging patterns. In addition,
artists and scientists who explore complex systems do so with an expectation of
particular patterns. Taking these expectations into account adds a new set of
challenges, which the exploration process must address. We provide design
choices and their implementation to address these challenges; enabling the
maximization of the diversity of patterns discovered in the user's region of
interest -- which we call the constrained diversity -- in a sample-efficient
manner. The region of interest is expressed in the form of explicit
constraints. These constraints are formulated by the user in a system-agnostic
way, and their addition enables interactive system exploration leading to
constrained diversity, while maintaining global diversity.

*Gaelle Milon-Harnois,Chaimaa Touhami,Nicolas Gutowski,Benoit Da Mota,Thomas Cauchy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EvoMol-RL uses reinforcement learning guided by Extended Connectivity Fingerprints to steer mutations in EvoMol, yielding more valid, realistic molecules and better optimization than the baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative models often produce unstable or non-synthesizable compounds; there is a need for context-aware, chemically plausible mutation strategies to reduce artifacts and improve pre-filtering realism.

Method: Extend EvoMol with reinforcement learning to guide molecular mutations based on local structural context; use ECFP fingerprints to inform context-aware mutation policies; train policies to prioritize chemically plausible transformations.

Result: Significant improvements in generating valid, realistic molecules; fewer structural artifacts; improved optimization performance; EvoMol-RL consistently outperforms EvoMol baseline in molecular pre-filtering realism.

Conclusion: Combining reinforcement learning with molecular fingerprints is effective for generating chemically relevant molecular structures and enhances chemical space exploration.

Abstract: The efficient exploration of chemical space remains a central challenge, as
many generative models still produce unstable or non-synthesizable compounds.
To address these limitations, we present EvoMol-RL, a significant extension of
the EvoMol evolutionary algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning to
guide molecular mutations based on local structural context. By leveraging
Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFPs), EvoMol-RL learns context-aware
mutation policies that prioritize chemically plausible transformations. This
approach significantly improves the generation of valid and realistic
molecules, reducing the frequency of structural artifacts and enhancing
optimization performance. The results demonstrate that EvoMol-RL consistently
outperforms its baseline in molecular pre-filtering realism. These results
emphasize the effectiveness of combining reinforcement learning with molecular
fingerprints to generate chemically relevant molecular structures.

### [284] [Online Minimization of Polarization and Disagreement via Low-Rank Matrix Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00803)
*Federico Cinus,Yuko Kuroki,Atsushi Miyauchi,Francesco Bonchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A bandit-based framework learns unknown innate opinions in Friedkin–Johsen opinion dynamics to minimize polarization, using a two-stage low-rank matrix bandit that first estimates a low-dimensional subspace and then performs linear bandits in that reduced space; achieves alse, the text shows ~O~(sqrt(T)) regret (up to polylog factors) and outperforms a linear bandit baseline empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Realistic online interventions on social platforms require learning user-by-innate opinions that govern polarization, rather than assuming full knowledge of these opinions in a static setting. The work links social-media interventions with regret-minimization and multi-armed bandits.

Method: Formulates the problem as a two-stage low-rank matrix bandit. Stage 1 performs subspace estimation to reveal an underlying low-dimensional representation of the system; Stage 2 runs a linear bandit algorithm in this reduced space using scalar feedback of overall polarization and disagreement after each intervention.

Result: The proposed algorithm achieves alse(}, the text is messy; I need to be careful. The original: \widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) cumulative regret over horizon T. Empirical results show significant improvement over a linear bandit baseline in cumulative regret and running time.

Conclusion: A scalable, theoretically-grounded approach to learning innate opinions for intervention in social networks, connecting platform-level interventions with bandit theory and enabling efficient, regret-bounded control of polarization.

Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing polarization and disagreement in the
Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model under incomplete information. Unlike
prior work that assumes a static setting with full knowledge of users' innate
opinions, we address the more realistic online setting where innate opinions
are unknown and must be learned through sequential observations. This novel
setting, which naturally mirrors periodic interventions on social media
platforms, is formulated as a regret minimization problem, establishing a key
connection between algorithmic interventions on social media platforms and
theory of multi-armed bandits. In our formulation, a learner observes only a
scalar feedback of the overall polarization and disagreement after an
intervention. For this novel bandit problem, we propose a two-stage algorithm
based on low-rank matrix bandits. The algorithm first performs subspace
estimation to identify an underlying low-dimensional structure, and then
employs a linear bandit algorithm within the compact dimensional representation
derived from the estimated subspace. We prove that our algorithm achieves an $
\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ cumulative regret over any time horizon $T$.
Empirical results validate that our algorithm significantly outperforms a
linear bandit baseline in terms of both cumulative regret and running time.

### [285] [MG2FlowNet: Accelerating High-Reward Sample Generation via Enhanced MCTS and Greediness Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00805)
*Rui Zhu,Xuan Yu,Yudong Zhang,Chen Zhang,Xu Wang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MG2FlowNet: integrates enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with Polynomial Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT) into Generative Flow Networks, plus a controllable greediness mechanism, to boost high-reward sample generation while preserving diversity; shows faster discovery of high-reward regions and sustained high-reward sampling; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GFlowNets aim to sample diverse objects with probabilities proportional to reward, but in large, sparse search spaces they tend to over-explore or struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples. There is a need to improve exploitation of high-reward trajectories without sacrificing diversity.

Method: Incorporate enhanced MCTS-based policy evaluation into the GFlowNet sampling process, use PUCT to balance exploration and exploitation adaptively, and introduce a controllable greediness parameter to regulate how greedily the agent pursues high rewards. This yields a dynamic balance that improves high-reward generation while maintaining distribution diversity.

Result: Experimental results show accelerated discovery of high-reward regions and the ability to continuously generate high-reward samples, with preserving diversity of the generative distribution.

Conclusion: MG2FlowNet effectively enhances exploitation in GFlowNets without sacrificing diversity, providing practical gains in sample quality and diversity; a configurable mechanism to control greediness is valuable for applications like molecular design and combinatorial optimization; code is available at the provided repository.

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have emerged as a powerful tool for
generating diverse and high-reward structured objects by learning to sample
from a distribution proportional to a given reward function. Unlike
conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that prioritize
optimization of a single trajectory, GFlowNets seek to balance diversity and
reward by modeling the entire trajectory distribution. This capability makes
them especially suitable for domains such as molecular design and combinatorial
optimization. However, existing GFlowNets sampling strategies tend to
overexplore and struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples,
particularly in large search spaces with sparse high-reward regions. Therefore,
improving the probability of generating high-reward samples without sacrificing
diversity remains a key challenge under this premise. In this work, we
integrate an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the GFlowNets
sampling process, using MCTS-based policy evaluation to guide the generation
toward high-reward trajectories and Polynomial Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT) to
balance exploration and exploitation adaptively, and we introduce a
controllable mechanism to regulate the degree of greediness. Our method
enhances exploitation without sacrificing diversity by dynamically balancing
exploration and reward-driven guidance. The experimental results show that our
method can not only accelerate the speed of discovering high-reward regions but
also continuously generate high-reward samples, while preserving the diversity
of the generative distribution. All implementations are available at

*Nouha Karaouli,Denis Coquenet,Elisa Fromont,Martial Mermillod,Marina Reyboz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TSFMs exhibit catastrophic forgetting under sequential fine-tuning; a stability–plasticity trade-off governs continual adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether Time Series Foundation Models retain previously learned knowledge when fine-tuned on multiple datasets and quantify forgetting during continual learning.

Method: Create synthetic datasets with varying periodic structure; sequentially fine-tune TSFMs on these datasets; evaluate performance on old and new tasks; analyze forgetting dynamics and trade-offs.

Result: Fine-tuning improves performance on new tasks but causes significant degradation on previously learned tasks; demonstrates a stability-plasticity dilemma in TSFMs during continual adaptation.

Conclusion: Continual adaptation of TSFMs inherently balances plasticity and stability; future work should explore forgetting-mitigation strategies (e.g., regularization, replay, modular architectures) to preserve prior knowledge while adapting to new data.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown promising zero-shot
generalization across diverse forecasting tasks. However, their robustness to
continual adaptation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
extent to which TSFMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned
sequentially on multiple datasets. Using synthetic datasets designed with
varying degrees of periodic structure, we measure the trade-off between
adaptation to new data and retention of prior knowledge. Our experiments reveal
that, while fine-tuning improves performance on new tasks, it often causes
significant degradation on previously learned ones, illustrating a fundamental
stability-plasticity dilemma.

*Alexandre Galashov,Ashwini Pokle,Arnaud Doucet,Arthur Gretton,Mauricio Delbracio,Valentin De Bortoli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Learnable, continuous classifier-free guidance (CFG) weights ω_{c,(s,t)} conditioned on c and denoising timesteps, aiming to better approximate the target conditional distribution; extends CFG to reward-guided sampling for tilted distributions; shows improved FID and CLIP-alignment in image generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static CFG weights often trade perceptual quality for distributional fidelity. By making guidance weights depend on conditioning and timesteps, the method seeks a closer match to the true conditional distribution while preserving quality.

Method: Introduce ω_{c,(s,t)} as a continuous function of conditioning c, the denoising time t, and the target time s. Train by minimizing distributional mismatch between noised samples from the true conditional distribution and samples from the guided diffusion. Extend the framework to reward-guided sampling using a reward function R(x0,c) to tilt the target distribution.

Result: Experiments on toy and high-dimensional image tasks show improved distributional fidelity and perception. In image generation, FID improves; in text-to-image, applying a CLIP-based reward yields better image-prompt alignment.

Conclusion: Learnable, continuous CFG weights can better approximate the target conditional distribution and enable reward-guided sampling, improving both sample quality and alignment with conditioning signals; applicable to diverse diffusion-model scenarios.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for improving the
perceptual quality of samples from conditional diffusion models. It operates by
linearly combining conditional and unconditional score estimates using a
guidance weight $\omega$. While a large, static weight can markedly improve
visual results, this often comes at the cost of poorer distributional
alignment. In order to better approximate the target conditional distribution,
we instead learn guidance weights $\omega_{c,(s,t)}$, which are continuous
functions of the conditioning $c$, the time $t$ from which we denoise, and the
time $s$ towards which we denoise. We achieve this by minimizing the
distributional mismatch between noised samples from the true conditional
distribution and samples from the guided diffusion process. We extend our
framework to reward guided sampling, enabling the model to target distributions
tilted by a reward function $R(x_0,c)$, defined on clean data and a
conditioning $c$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on
low-dimensional toy examples and high-dimensional image settings, where we
observe improvements in Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) for image
generation. In text-to-image applications, we observe that employing a reward
function given by the CLIP score leads to guidance weights that improve
image-prompt alignment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAPO uses curvature-aware data selection to stabilize policy-gradient updates for LLM reasoning, masking unstable samples to improve sample efficiency—achieving up to 30x gains with minimal token rejection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Policy gradient optimization for large-language-model reasoning is often unstable, forcing conservative hyperparameters and expensive training; leveraging second-order geometry could stabilize updates and reduce data needs.

Method: Develop a stochastic policy-gradient framework that tracks curvature information during updates and design CAPO to identify and mask samples that cause instability, with theoretical monotonic-improvement guarantees.

Result: CAPO delivers stable updates under aggressive learning regimes where baselines fail; with less than 8% token rejection, it achieves up to 30x improvement in sample efficiency over standard GRPO on math reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: Incorporating curvature-aware data selection into policy-gradient optimization improves stability and sample efficiency in LLM reasoning, enabling more efficient post-training and scalable training regimes.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning, particularly through policy gradient methods, has
played a central role in enabling reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models. However, the optimization stability of policy gradients in this setting
remains understudied. As a result, existing implementations often resort to
conservative hyperparameter choices to ensure stability, which requires more
training samples and increases computational costs. Hence, developing models
for reliably tracking the underlying optimization dynamics and leveraging them
into training enables more sample-efficient regimes and further unleashes
scalable post-training. We address this gap by formalizing the stochastic
optimization problem of policy gradients with explicit consideration of
second-order geometry. We propose a tractable computational framework that
tracks and leverages curvature information during policy updates. We further
employ this framework to design interventions in the optimization process
through data selection. The resultant algorithm, Curvature-Aware Policy
Optimization (CAPO), identifies samples that contribute to unstable updates and
masks them out. Theoretically, we establish monotonic improvement guarantees
under realistic assumptions. On standard math reasoning benchmarks, we
empirically show that CAPO ensures stable updates under aggressive learning
regimes where baselines catastrophically fail. With minimal intervention
(rejecting fewer than 8% of tokens), CAPO achieves up to 30x improvement in
sample efficiency over standard GRPO for LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Contextual dueling bandits for LLM routing using pairwise preferences, with Category-Calibrated Fine-Tuning embeddings enabling Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for CDB; achieves better regret, convergence, and cost-robustness on RouterBench and MixInstruct.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To optimize per-query model selection under competing objectives (user satisfaction, model expertise, and inference cost) by leveraging label-efficient feedback and dynamic adaptation instead of relying on absolute scores.

Method: Formulate routing as contextual dueling bandits (learning from pairwise preferences). Develop Category-Calibrated Fine-Tuning (CCFT) to derive model embeddings via contrastive fine-tuning with categorical weighting. Use CCFT embeddings to instantiate Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for Contextual Dueling Bandits (FGTS.CDB). Propose four categorical weighting variants that incorporate model quality and cost, and evaluate on RouterBench and MixInstruct against strong baselines.

Result: The proposed methods achieve lower cumulative regret, faster convergence, and improved robustness and balance between performance and cost across both benchmarks, outperforming strong baselines built with a general-purpose OpenAI embedding model.

Conclusion: CCFT-based embeddings and FGTS.CDB provide a label-efficient, dynamically adaptable routing framework that effectively balances user satisfaction, model expertise, and cost in LLM routing.

Abstract: We study LLM routing, the problem of selecting the best model for each query
while balancing user satisfaction, model expertise, and inference cost. We
formulate routing as contextual dueling bandits, learning from pairwise
preference feedback rather than absolute scores, thereby yielding
label-efficient and dynamic adaptation. Building on this formulation, we
introduce Category-Calibrated Fine-Tuning (CCFT), a representation-learning
method that derives model embeddings from offline data using contrastive
fine-tuning with categorical weighting. These embeddings enable the practical
instantiation of Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for Contextual Dueling Bandits
(FGTS.CDB), a theoretically grounded posterior-sampling algorithm. We propose
four variants of the categorical weighting that explicitly integrate model
quality and cost, and we empirically evaluate the proposed methods on the
RouterBench and MixInstruct datasets. Across both benchmarks, our methods
achieve lower cumulative regret and faster convergence, with better robustness
and performance-cost balance than strong baselines built with a general-purpose
OpenAI embedding model.

*Maxime Méloux,Maxime Peyrard,François Portet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Interpretable AI methods should be treated as statistical estimators; the stability of EAP-IG circuit discovery is questionable, as variance and hyperparameter sensitivity undermine robustness; recommends routine stability reporting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To increase rigor in mechanistic interpretability by treating interpretability methods as estimators with variance, moving beyond sole reliance on performance metrics.

Method: Systematic stability analysis of EAP-IG via controlled perturbations: input resampling, prompt paraphrasing, hyperparameter variation, and injected noise within the causal analysis; tested across diverse models and tasks.

Result: Demonstrated high structural variance and sensitivity to hyperparameters; findings are not robust across perturbations or configurations.

Conclusion: Advocates routine reporting of stability metrics and adoption of best-practice guidelines to build a statistically grounded, more reliable science of interpretability.

Abstract: The development of trustworthy artificial intelligence requires moving beyond
black-box performance metrics toward an understanding of models' internal
computations. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to meet this need by
identifying the algorithmic mechanisms underlying model behaviors. Yet, the
scientific rigor of MI critically depends on the reliability of its findings.
In this work, we argue that interpretability methods, such as circuit
discovery, should be viewed as statistical estimators, subject to questions of
variance and robustness. To illustrate this statistical framing, we present a
systematic stability analysis of a state-of-the-art circuit discovery method:
EAP-IG. We evaluate its variance and robustness through a comprehensive suite
of controlled perturbations, including input resampling, prompt paraphrasing,
hyperparameter variation, and injected noise within the causal analysis itself.
Across a diverse set of models and tasks, our results demonstrate that EAP-IG
exhibits high structural variance and sensitivity to hyperparameters,
questioning the stability of its findings. Based on these results, we offer a
set of best-practice recommendations for the field, advocating for the routine
reporting of stability metrics to promote a more rigorous and statistically
grounded science of interpretability.

TL;DR: A WGAN-based population synthesis method trained on incomplete microsamples using a masking approach; validated on a Swedish travel survey; synthetic populations closely match both a model trained on complete data and the actual population.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing data in microsamples due to privacy or data collection constraints motivates developing a method that can learn population structure from incomplete data without discarding samples.

Method: A Wasserstein GAN trained with a mask matrix to represent missing values, enabling learning from incomplete microsamples. The model is compared to a WGAN trained on complete microsamples. Evaluation uses a Swedish national travel survey to generate synthetic populations and benchmark them against the actual population.

Result: The proposed method successfully generates synthetic data that closely resemble both the complete-data model and the actual population, indicating robustness to missing data.

Conclusion: The paper offers a robust solution for population synthesis with incomplete data and highlights the potential of deep generative models to advance population synthesis, with implications for privacy-preserving data analysis and future research directions.

Abstract: This paper presents a population synthesis model that utilizes the
Wasserstein Generative-Adversarial Network (WGAN) for training on incomplete
microsamples. By using a mask matrix to represent missing values, the study
proposes a WGAN training algorithm that lets the model learn from a training
dataset that has some missing information. The proposed method aims to address
the challenge of missing information in microsamples on one or more attributes
due to privacy concerns or data collection constraints. The paper contrasts
WGAN models trained on incomplete microsamples with those trained on complete
microsamples, creating a synthetic population. We conducted a series of
evaluations of the proposed method using a Swedish national travel survey. We
validate the efficacy of the proposed method by generating synthetic
populations from all the models and comparing them to the actual population
dataset. The results from the experiments showed that the proposed methodology
successfully generates synthetic data that closely resembles a model trained
with complete data as well as the actual population. The paper contributes to
the field by providing a robust solution for population synthesis with
incomplete data, opening avenues for future research, and highlighting the
potential of deep generative models in advancing population synthesis
capabilities.

*Thiziri Nait Saada,Louis Bethune,Michal Klein,David Grangier,Marco Cuturi,Pierre Ablin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CQF can improve downstream task performance but does not reliably improve language modeling on the high-quality data; CQF implicitly filters the high-quality dataset, challenging the idea that it captures meaningful data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether classifier-based quality filtering (CQF) truly captures data quality and improves model performance on large-scale pretraining, given that data quality is nuanced and can affect both downstream tasks and language modeling.

Method: Provide an in-depth analysis of CQF, and compare models trained with CQF to those trained on synthetic data of increasing quality (generated by random token permutations). Evaluate on downstream tasks and language-modeling metrics to uncover patterns and potential paradoxes.

Result: CQF improves downstream task performance but does not consistently boost language modeling on the high-quality data; CQF implicitly filters the high-quality dataset as well, which may explain the paradox. Models trained with CQF behave markedly differently from models trained on synthetic data of increasing quality, indicating that CQF does not simply select higher-quality data.

Conclusion: CQF may not capture a meaningful notion of data quality as previously believed. The practice of using CQF to curate pretraining data should be re-evaluated, and alternative data-quality assessment methods or curation strategies may be necessary to avoid unintended filtering of high-quality content.

Abstract: Large-scale models are pretrained on massive web-crawled datasets containing
documents of mixed quality, making data filtering essential. A popular method
is Classifier-based Quality Filtering (CQF), which trains a binary classifier
to distinguish between pretraining data and a small, high-quality set. It
assigns each pretraining document a quality score defined as the classifier's
score and retains only the top-scoring ones. We provide an in-depth analysis of
CQF. We show that while CQF improves downstream task performance, it does not
necessarily enhance language modeling on the high-quality dataset. We explain
this paradox by the fact that CQF implicitly filters the high-quality dataset
as well. We further compare the behavior of models trained with CQF to those
trained on synthetic data of increasing quality, obtained via random token
permutations, and find starkly different trends. Our results challenge the view
that CQF captures a meaningful notion of data quality.

*Tanay Rastogi,Daniel Jonsson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CT-GAN can generate target populations for scenario planning; performs best alone among the tested methods but struggles with multivariate relationships; a hybrid CT-GAN + FBS-CO improves alignment to target marginals; demonstrates potential for integrating deep generative models with traditional synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agent-based transport/urban planning requires base and target population data; deterministic population synthesis struggles with high-dimensional data, scalability, and zero-cell issues, especially for target scenarios.

Method: Compare three approaches: stand-alone CT-GAN, FBS-CO, and a CT-GAN + FBS-CO hybrid. CT-GAN is used to generate a base population from marginal constraints or as input to the hybrid; the hybrid refines the CT-GAN output with FBS-CO to align with target-year marginals. Evaluation uses travel survey data and zonal-level aggregates.

Result: Stand-alone CT-GAN performs best among the three models when evaluated. It can reproduce single-variable distributions well but has difficulty preserving relationships among multiple variables. The hybrid CT-GAN + FBS-CO model yields better performance than FBS-CO alone by leveraging CT-GAN to create a descriptive base population and then refining to match marginals.

Conclusion: CT-GAN is an effective method for generating target populations for scenario planning, and integrating deep generative models with traditional synthesis techniques (CT-GAN + FBS-CO) can enhance performance.

Abstract: Agent-based models used in scenario planning for transportation and urban
planning usually require detailed population information from the base as well
as target scenarios. These populations are usually provided by synthesizing
fake agents through deterministic population synthesis methods. However, these
deterministic population synthesis methods face several challenges, such as
handling high-dimensional data, scalability, and zero-cell issues, particularly
when generating populations for target scenarios. This research looks into how
a deep generative model called Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial
Network (CT-GAN) can be used to create target populations either directly from
a collection of marginal constraints or through a hybrid method that combines
CT-GAN with Fitness-based Synthesis Combinatorial Optimization (FBS-CO). The
research evaluates the proposed population synthesis models against travel
survey and zonal-level aggregated population data. Results indicate that the
stand-alone CT-GAN model performs the best when compared with FBS-CO and the
hybrid model. CT-GAN by itself can create realistic-looking groups that match
single-variable distributions, but it struggles to maintain relationships
between multiple variables. However, the hybrid model demonstrates improved
performance compared to FBS-CO by leveraging CT-GAN ability to generate a
descriptive base population, which is then refined using FBS-CO to align with
target-year marginals. This study demonstrates that CT-GAN represents an
effective methodology for target populations and highlights how deep generative
models can be successfully integrated with conventional synthesis techniques to
enhance their performance.

*Kristoffer Christensen,Bo Nørregaard Jørgensen,Zheng Grace Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A visual analytics dashboard for QA of district heating data identifies anomalies and guides cleaning to improve AI forecasts (LSTM/GRU) of heat demand.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality data is critical for reliable AI in energy. Sensor noise, gaps, and temporal inconsistencies degrade performance. A human-in-the-loop, visual inspection framework is proposed to systematically diagnose and improve data quality.

Method: An interactive web-based dashboard with Python visualizations (time series, heatmaps, box plots, histograms, correlations) and anomaly-sensitive KPIs (skewness, modified z-scores). Enables experts to inspect data and guide cleaning. Demonstrated on four years of hourly data from ~7,000 meters in a Danish district heating network.

Result: Visual analytics reveal systemic data issues and ambiguous data segments; the dashboard can guide targeted data cleaning strategies, potentially improving the accuracy, stability, and generalizability of LSTM/GRU heat-demand forecasts.

Conclusion: The study presents a scalable, generalizable framework for visual data inspection, underscoring the pivotal role of data quality in AI-driven energy management and its impact on model performance.

Abstract: High-quality data is a prerequisite for training reliable Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models in the energy domain. In district heating networks,
sensor and metering data often suffer from noise, missing values, and temporal
inconsistencies, which can significantly degrade model performance. This paper
presents a systematic approach for evaluating and improving data quality using
visual diagnostics, implemented through an interactive web-based dashboard. The
dashboard employs Python-based visualization techniques, including time series
plots, heatmaps, box plots, histograms, correlation matrices, and
anomaly-sensitive KPIs such as skewness and anomaly detection based on the
modified z-scores. These tools al-low human experts to inspect and interpret
data anomalies, enabling a human-in-the-loop strategy for data quality
assessment. The methodology is demonstrated on a real-world dataset from a
Danish district heating provider, covering over four years of hourly data from
nearly 7000 meters. The findings show how visual analytics can uncover systemic
data issues and, in the future, guide data cleaning strategies that enhance the
accuracy, stability, and generalizability of Long Short-Term Memory and Gated
Recurrent Unit models for heat demand forecasting. The study contributes to a
scalable, generalizable framework for visual data inspection and underlines the
critical role of data quality in AI-driven energy management systems.

*Jose I. Mestre,Alberto Fernández-Hernández,Cristian Pérez-Corral,Manuel F. Dolz,Jose Duato,Enrique S. Quintana-Ortí*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GLAI decouples structure from parameters in MLPs by fixing activation-derived structure and learning a path-based, quantitative-weight formulation, yielding faster training (~40% on average) while maintaining or improving accuracy and enabling broader use as a drop-in block for various architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address training inefficiency of MLPs by separating stable structural knowledge (activation patterns) from numerical weights, enabling more efficient optimization without sacrificing universal approximation.

Method: Identify stable ReLU-induced activation structures, fix them, reformulate MLP as a sum of paths where only the quantitative weights are optimized; use GLAI as a drop-in block across architectures (supervised heads, projection layers, few-shot classifiers); claim preserved universality while accelerating convergence.

Result: Consistent matching or surpassing of MLP accuracy with equivalent parameter counts; average training time reduction around 40%; faster convergence across diverse experimental setups.

Conclusion: Proposes a new design principle—decoupled structure and parameters via path-based blocks—for efficient MLPs with potential integration into large-scale architectures like Transformers.

Abstract: In this work we introduce GreenLightningAI (GLAI), a new architectural block
designed as an alternative to conventional MLPs. The central idea is to
separate two types of knowledge that are usually entangled during training: (i)
*structural knowledge*, encoded by the stable activation patterns induced by
ReLU activations; and (ii) *quantitative knowledge*, carried by the numerical
weights and biases. By fixing the structure once stabilized, GLAI reformulates
the MLP as a combination of paths, where only the quantitative component is
optimized. This reformulation retains the universal approximation capabilities
of MLPs, yet achieves a more efficient training process, reducing training time
by ~40% on average across the cases examined in this study. Crucially, GLAI is
not just another classifier, but a generic block that can replace MLPs wherever
they are used, from supervised heads with frozen backbones to projection layers
in self-supervised learning or few-shot classifiers. Across diverse
experimental setups, GLAI consistently matches or exceeds the accuracy of MLPs
with an equivalent number of parameters, while converging faster. Overall, GLAI
establishes a new design principle that opens a direction for future
integration into large-scale architectures such as Transformers, where MLP
blocks dominate the computational footprint.

*Alex Ayoub,David Szepesvári,Alireza Baktiari,Csaba Szepesvári,Dale Schuurmans*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mean absolute error (MAE) as a prediction objective improves control of the policy suboptimality gap in value-based RL, compared to mean squared error (MSE). Cross-entropy losses (binary/categorical for MAE, squared for MSE) align with their respective regression objectives, and empirical results in linear RL show cross-entropy-based methods can outperform squared-loss baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the choice of loss function in value-based reinforcement learning affects the underlying prediction objectives, and how this choice translates into suboptimality guarantees and practical performance.

Method: Theoretical analysis comparing MAE vs MSE as prediction objectives and their compatibility with cross-entropy losses; derivation of alignment between loss types and regression objectives; empirical evaluation in linear reinforcement learning comparing cross-entropy-based losses to squared loss.

Result: The study shows MAE better controls the suboptimality gap than MSE; cross-entropy losses align with the corresponding regression objectives (binary/categorical with MAE, squared with MSE); empirically, algorithms using cross-entropy losses can outperform those based on squared loss in linear RL.

Conclusion: Choosing the loss function in value-based RL matters: MAE paired with appropriate cross-entropy losses provides better theoretical guarantees on suboptimality and can lead to better empirical performance; this motivates reevaluating loss-function design in RL algorithms, particularly for linear settings.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the loss function in value-based
methods for reinforcement learning through an analysis of underlying prediction
objectives. We theoretically show that mean absolute error is a better
prediction objective than the traditional mean squared error for controlling
the learned policy's suboptimality gap. Furthermore, we present results that
different loss functions are better aligned with these different regression
objectives: binary and categorical cross-entropy losses with the mean absolute
error and squared loss with the mean squared error. We then provide empirical
evidence that algorithms minimizing these cross-entropy losses can outperform
those based on the squared loss in linear reinforcement learning.

### [298] [BoMGene: Integrating Boruta-mRMR feature selection for enhanced Gene expression classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00907)
*Bich-Chung Phan,Thanh Ma,Huu-Hoa Nguyen,Thanh-Nghi Do*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BoMGene is a hybrid Boruta-mRMR feature selector for gene expression data that reduces features and maintains or improves classification accuracy across 25 datasets and multiple classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gene expression data are high-dimensional, making feature selection crucial to improve accuracy and reduce computation. While Boruta and mRMR each have strengths, a hybrid approach can leverage relevance, redundancy reduction, and stability.

Method: BoMGene integrates Boruta and mRMR in a two-stage pipeline: first apply Boruta to identify relevant features, then apply mRMR to the reduced set to optimize relevance against redundancy, yielding a compact subset used for classification.

Result: On 25 public gene expression datasets, BoMGene reduces feature counts more than using mRMR alone, accelerates training, and maintains or improves classification accuracy across SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, and GBM, indicating higher accuracy, stability, and practical applicability for multi-class data.

Conclusion: The BoMGene framework successfully combines Boruta and mRMR to produce robust, efficient feature subsets that enhance classifier performance in high-dimensional gene expression analysis.

Abstract: Feature selection is a crucial step in analyzing gene expression data,
enhancing classification performance, and reducing computational costs for
high-dimensional datasets. This paper proposes BoMGene, a hybrid feature
selection method that effectively integrates two popular techniques: Boruta and
Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR). The method aims to optimize the
feature space and enhance classification accuracy. Experiments were conducted
on 25 publicly available gene expression datasets, employing widely used
classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost (XGB),
and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). The results show that using the
Boruta-mRMR combination cuts down the number of features chosen compared to
just using mRMR, which helps to speed up training time while keeping or even
improving classification accuracy compared to using individual feature
selection methods. The proposed approach demonstrates clear advantages in
accuracy, stability, and practical applicability for multi-class gene
expression data analysis

TL;DR: RiskPO replaces mean-based objectives with a risk-aware mix of Value-at-Risk to amplify gradients on hard instances, improving LLM reasoning and code generation beyond GRPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fix entropy collapse and limited gains from overemphasizing high-prob output sequences in policy optimization for verifiable rewards in LLMs; rare but informative reasoning paths are neglected by GRPO.

Method: Introduce a Mixed Value-at-Risk objective with weighted attention over multiple regions of the reward distribution; use a bundling scheme to aggregate multiple questions into bundles; provide theoretical guarantees that risk-averse updates promote exploration; aim for more stable and informative training dynamics.

Result: Consistent and significant improvements in mathematical reasoning, multi-modal reasoning, and code generation benchmarks; surpasses GRPO and its variants on Pass@1 and Pass@k metrics.

Conclusion: Risk-based optimization offers a rigorous and effective paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities by leveraging risk measures to enrich feedback and prevent overconfident convergence.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward has recently emerged as a
central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs); however,
prevailing mean-based methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), suffer from entropy collapse and limited reasoning gains. We argue that
these issues stem from overemphasizing high-probability output sequences while
neglecting rare but informative reasoning paths. To address these challenges,
we propose Risk-based Policy Optimization (RiskPO), which substitutes classical
mean-based objectives with principled risk measures. Specifically, we introduce
a Mixed Value-at-Risk objective that integrates weighted attention over
multiple regions of the reward distribution, thereby amplifying gradient
signals on challenging instances and preventing overconfident convergence. We
further design a bundling scheme that aggregates multiple questions into
bundles, thus enriching the feedback signal and yielding more stable and
informative training dynamics. Theoretically, we prove that the risk-averse
update alleviates entropy collapse and promotes exploration. Numerically,
RiskPO achieves consistent and significant improvements in mathematical
reasoning, multi-modal reasoning, and code generation benchmarks, surpassing
GRPO and its variants on both Pass@1 and Pass@k metrics. Our results
demonstrate that risk-based optimization provides a rigorous and effective
paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

*Xin-Qiang Cai,Wei Wang,Feng Liu,Tongliang Liu,Gang Niu,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two corrections for verifier unreliability in RLVR (reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards) are proposed. A backward correction debiases binary rewards to yield an unbiased policy gradient estimate, and a forward correction reweights score-function terms to align updates with the clean gradient, needing only the false-negative (FN) rate. Implemented as optional hooks in a GRPO-based RLVR pipeline, both improve training over uncorrected baselines; the forward method converges faster and remains stable under heavier noise. An online FN-rate estimator using a lightweight LLM verifier further enhances performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verifier unreliability in RLVR due to asymmetric noise (false negatives and false positives) degrades learning when rewards are collapsed to binary. This leads to biased gradient estimates and unstable training, motivating principled correction methods that account for verifier errors.

Method: Model the verifier as a stochastic reward channel with asymmetric noise. Derive two correction algorithms: 1) backward correction that de-biases observed binary rewards to obtain an unbiased estimator of the clean policy gradient; 2) forward correction that reweights score-function terms so that the expected update matches the clean gradient, requiring only the false-negative rate. Implement as lightweight hooks in a GRPO-based RLVR pipeline and evaluate on math-reasoning models and benchmarks.

Result: Both correction methods improve over uncorrected training across models and datasets. The forward correction converges faster and remains stable under heavier noise. An online practical appeal mechanism estimates the FN rate via a lightweight LLM verifier rechecking rule-based negatives, outperforming several state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Verifer unreliability can be mitigated with principled gradient correction techniques. The backward method provides unbiased policy gradient estimates, while the forward method offers faster, stable improvements with lower information requirements (FN rate only). The approach enables more robust RLVR training and practical online FN-rate estimation.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) trains policies against
automated verifiers to avoid costly human labeling. To reduce vulnerability to
verifier hacking, many RLVR systems collapse rewards to binary $\{0,1\}$ during
training. This choice carries a cost: it introduces \textit{false negatives}
(rejecting correct answers, FNs) and \textit{false positives} (accepting
incorrect ones, FPs). For instance, a rule-based checker may mark the correct
fraction $\frac{12}{36}$ as wrong when compared against the canonical
$\frac{1}{3}$ due to brittle parsing/equivalence rules (FN), while a large
language model (LLM) judges can be gamed by superficial cues or even a single
adversarial token, yielding inflated correctness for wrong solutions (FP). We
formalize verifier unreliability by modeling the verifier as a stochastic
reward channel with asymmetric noise rates. From this abstraction, we derive
two correction algorithms for verifier errors. The first is a \textit{backward}
correction that de-biases the observed binary reward to recover an
\textit{unbiased} estimator of the clean policy gradient. The second is a
\textit{forward} correction that reweights score-function terms so that the
expected update direction aligns with the \textit{clean gradient}; notably, it
requires only the FN rate. We implement both as lightweight hooks in a group
relative policy optimization (GRPO)-based RLVR pipeline and evaluate them on
math-reasoning models and benchmarks. Across models and datasets, both
corrections improve over uncorrected training; the forward variant converges
faster and remains stable under heavier noise. Finally, we show a practical
appeal mechanism in which a lightweight LLM verifier estimates the FN rate
online by rechecking rule-based negatives, obtaining outperformance compared
with other state-of-the-art contenders.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RECAP is a post-training RL method that improves safety alignment for large reasoning models by learning to override flawed reasoning paths via counter-aligned CoT prefills, with no extra training cost beyond vanilla RLHF, boosting safety and jailbreak robustness while preserving reasoning and token budget.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs using chain-of-thought are vulnerable to safety issues, biased premises, and jailbreaking attempts that can derail safe responses. There is a need for a mechanism to override flawed reasoning trajectories and ensure safe, helpful outputs without sacrificing core reasoning abilities.

Method: Train with a mixture of synthetically generated counter-aligned CoT prefills and standard prompts using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The approach teaches models to override flawed reasoning trajectories and redirect to safe responses, without additional training cost beyond vanilla RLHF.

Result: Substantial improvements in safety and jailbreak robustness; reduced overrefusal; preserved core reasoning ability; maintained inference token budget; models exhibit more self-reflection and remain robust under adaptive attacks.

Conclusion: RECAP provides a practical post-training RL-based solution for robust safety alignment of LRMs, enabling safer and more reliable reasoning without sacrificing reasoning capabilities, even under repeated adversarial prompts.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) "think" by generating structured
chain-of-thought (CoT) before producing a final answer, yet they still lack the
ability to reason critically about safety alignment and are easily biased when
a flawed premise is injected into their thought process. We propose RECAP
(Robust Safety Alignment via Counter-Aligned Prefilling), a principled
reinforcement learning (RL) method for post-training that explicitly teaches
models to override flawed reasoning trajectories and reroute to safe and
helpful responses. RECAP trains on a mixture of synthetically generated
counter-aligned CoT prefills and standard prompts, requires no additional
training cost or modifications beyond vanilla reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), and substantially improves safety and jailbreak robustness,
reduces overrefusal, and preserves core reasoning capability -- all while
maintaining inference token budget. Extensive analysis shows that RECAP-trained
models engage in self-reflection more frequently and remain robust under
adaptive attacks, preserving safety even after repeated attempts to override
their reasoning.

TL;DR: 2-GRPO matches 16-GRPO with only 1/8 rollouts, reducing training time by >70% by reframing GRPO as contrastive learning and linking it to DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Question the belief that large group sizes are required for stable GRPO, aiming to reduce computational overhead in post-training LLM alignment.

Method: Theoretically reframe GRPO as contrastive learning and draw rigorous connections to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO); analyze the minimal two-rollout setting (2-GRPO) and validate its feasibility; empirically compare 2-GRPO against 16-GRPO.

Result: 2-GRPO achieves comparable performance to 16-GRPO while using only 1/8 of the rollouts and reducing training time by over 70%.

Conclusion: Two-rollout GRPO is a viable, more efficient alternative for post-training LLM alignment, challenging the assumption that large batch-like groupings are necessary and offering substantial practical speedups.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a prominent reinforcement
learning algorithm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs). It is
commonly believed that GRPO necessitates a large group size to ensure stable
training via precise statistical estimation, which incurs substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we challenge this assumption by reframing
GRPO as a form of contrastive learning, which reveals a fundamental connection
to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Motivated by DPO's empirical success,
we investigate the minimal two-rollout case (2-GRPO), a configuration
previously deemed infeasible. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to
validate 2-GRPO and demonstrate empirically that it achieves performance on par
with 16-GRPO, despite using only 1/8 of the rollouts and reducing training time
by over 70%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First-of-its-kind Riemannian Consistency Model enabling few-step generation on manifolds using covariant derivative and exponential-map parameterization; establishes equivalence between Riemannian consistency distillation (RCD) and Riemannian consistency training (RCT); introduces simplified objective and a kinematics interpretation; demonstrates strong results on flat-tori, spheres, and SO(3).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Consistency models excel in Euclidean spaces but struggle on curved Riemannian manifolds due to intrinsic geometry. There is a need to enable few-step generation that respects manifold constraints.

Method: Leverage covariant derivative and exponential-map parameterization to derive closed-form training objectives for discrete- and continuous-time variants; prove equivalence between RCD and RCT; propose a simplified training objective to avoid complex differential calculations; offer a kinematics-based interpretation.

Result: RCM achieves superior few-step generative quality on non-Euclidean manifolds (flat-tori, spheres, SO(3)) compared to baselines.

Conclusion: RCM extends consistency modeling to Riemannian manifolds, providing theoretical and practical tools (equivalences, simplified training) and broadening applicability of diffusion/flow models to curved spaces.

Abstract: Consistency models are a class of generative models that enable few-step
generation for diffusion and flow matching models. While consistency models
have achieved promising results on Euclidean domains like images, their
applications to Riemannian manifolds remain challenging due to the curved
geometry. In this work, we propose the Riemannian Consistency Model (RCM),
which, for the first time, enables few-step consistency modeling while
respecting the intrinsic manifold constraint imposed by the Riemannian
geometry. Leveraging the covariant derivative and exponential-map-based
parameterization, we derive the closed-form solutions for both discrete- and
continuous-time training objectives for RCM. We then demonstrate theoretical
equivalence between the two variants of RCM: Riemannian consistency
distillation (RCD) that relies on a teacher model to approximate the marginal
vector field, and Riemannian consistency training (RCT) that utilizes the
conditional vector field for training. We further propose a simplified training
objective that eliminates the need for the complicated differential
calculation. Finally, we provide a unique kinematics perspective for
interpreting the RCM objective, offering new theoretical angles. Through
extensive experiments, we manifest the superior generative quality of RCM in
few-step generation on various non-Euclidean manifolds, including flat-tori,
spheres, and the 3D rotation group SO(3).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces S-SWIM, a gradient-free, data-driven training method for Spike Response Model SNNs using Random Feature Methods; enables fast, interpretable end-to-end training and can initialize gradient-based training, achieving strong time-series forecasting performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training SNNs is hampered by non-differentiability and spike sparsity; Random Feature Methods (RFMs) from ANNs offer a gradient-free alternative; the work adapts RFMs to SRM-based SNNs to enable training without gradient approximation.

Method: Develop S-SWIM inspired by SWIM for RFMs in ANNs; employs data-driven random-feature representations within SRM-based SNNs to train end-to-end without requiring gradients through spike nonlinearity; usable as a standalone training method or as an initialization before gradient-based optimization; includes theoretical analysis and numerical experiments; ablation studies compare against random weight sampling.

Result: S-SWIM achieves high accuracy on time-series forecasting as a standalone method and also serves as an effective initialization for subsequent gradient-based training; ablation shows it outperforms random sampling of network weights.

Conclusion: S-SWIM provides a fast, interpretable, and effective gradient-free training pathway for SNNs by leveraging RFMs, broadening training options; it can speed up training and improve performance when used alone or as a initialization prior to backpropagation.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as Machine Learning (ML) models have recently
received a lot of attention as a potentially more energy-efficient alternative
to conventional Artificial Neural Networks. The non-differentiability and
sparsity of the spiking mechanism can make these models very difficult to train
with algorithms based on propagating gradients through the spiking
non-linearity. We address this problem by adapting the paradigm of Random
Feature Methods (RFMs) from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to Spike Response
Model (SRM) SNNs. This approach allows training of SNNs without approximation
of the spike function gradient. Concretely, we propose a novel data-driven,
fast, high-performance, and interpretable algorithm for end-to-end training of
SNNs inspired by the SWIM algorithm for RFM-ANNs, which we coin S-SWIM. We
provide a thorough theoretical discussion and supplementary numerical
experiments showing that S-SWIM can reach high accuracies on time series
forecasting as a standalone strategy and serve as an effective initialisation
strategy before gradient-based training. Additional ablation studies show that
our proposed method performs better than random sampling of network weights.

*Tavor Z. Baharav,Spyros Dragazis,Aldo Pacchiano*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a sequential testing framework for binary disease outcomes under an unknown logistic model, trading off costly diagnostic tests against a fixed misclassification tolerance with high-probability guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the number of expensive medical tests required in screening while ensuring misclassification risk stays below a user-specified threshold, despite unknown model and feature distribution.

Method: An algorithm that interleaves label collection and distribution estimation to learn both the logistic parameter θ* and the context distribution P. It computes a conservative, data-driven threshold τ_t on the logistic score |x_t^T θ| to decide when testing is necessary, balancing information gain with safety.

Result: With probability at least 1−δ, the method keeps the misclassification rate within the tolerance α and incurs only O(√T) excess tests relative to an oracle that knows θ* and P, establishing the first no-regret guarantees for error-constrained logistic testing.

Conclusion: The paper provides theoretically grounded guarantees for cost-efficient, safe logistic testing and demonstrates practical effectiveness via simulations in medical screening contexts.

Abstract: We study the problem of sequentially testing individuals for a binary disease
outcome whose true risk is governed by an unknown logistic model. At each
round, a patient arrives with feature vector $x_t$, and the decision maker may
either pay to administer a (noiseless) diagnostic test--revealing the true
label--or skip testing and predict the patient's disease status based on their
feature vector and prior history. Our goal is to minimize the total number of
costly tests required while guaranteeing that the fraction of
misclassifications does not exceed a prespecified error tolerance $\alpha$,
with probability at least $1-\delta$. To address this, we develop a novel
algorithm that interleaves label-collection and distribution estimation to
estimate both $\theta^{*}$ and the context distribution $P$, and computes a
conservative, data-driven threshold $\tau_t$ on the logistic score
$|x_t^\top\theta|$ to decide when testing is necessary. We prove that, with
probability at least $1-\delta$, our procedure does not exceed the target
misclassification rate, and requires only $O(\sqrt{T})$ excess tests compared
to the oracle baseline that knows both $\theta^{*}$ and the patient feature
distribution $P$. This establishes the first no-regret guarantees for
error-constrained logistic testing, with direct applications to cost-sensitive
medical screening. Simulations corroborate our theoretical guarantees, showing
that in practice our procedure efficiently estimates $\theta^{*}$ while
retaining safety guarantees, and does not require too many excess tests.

*David R. Johnson,Rishabh Anand,Smita Krishnaswamy,Michael Perlmutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A SE(3)-equivariant geometric scattering transform for graphs with scalar/vector features, integrable into geometric GNNs; achieves competitive performance with far fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build symmetry-preserving, parameter-efficient models for 3D geometric graphs by exploiting SE(3) (rotations/translations) equivariance in a scattering framework.

Method: Proposes a novel SE(3)-equivariant geometric scattering transform for graphs with scalar and vector node features, which can be incorporated into a geometric GNN framework.

Result: Empirically, the equivariant scattering-based GNN achieves comparable performance to other equivariant MPNNs while using a fraction of the parameter count.

Conclusion: SE(3)-equivariant scattering offers a compact, effective alternative to existing equivariant GNNs for geometric graph learning and can be integrated into broader GNN pipelines.

Abstract: We introduce a novel version of the geometric scattering transform for
geometric graphs containing scalar and vector node features. This new
scattering transform has desirable symmetries with respect to rigid-body
roto-translations (i.e., $SE(3)$-equivariance) and may be incorporated into a
geometric GNN framework. We empirically show that our equivariant
scattering-based GNN achieves comparable performance to other equivariant
message-passing-based GNNs at a fraction of the parameter count.

### [307] [Meaningless Tokens, Meaningful Gains: How Activation Shifts Enhance LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01032)
*Zeru Shi,Yingjia Wan,Zhenting Wang,Qifan Wang,Fan Yang,Elisa Kreiss,Ruixiang Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Activation Redistribution Module (ARM) explains why inserting meaningless tokens before prompts can boost LLM reasoning: it redistributes activations in MLP layers, reducing near-zero activations and boosting large ones, increasing representational capacity. ARM mimics this effect at inference by adaptively shifting near-zero activations after non-linearities, achieving similar gains with minimal code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the puzzling improvement in LLM reasoning when long streams of meaningless tokens precede the query, and to develop a principled, light-weight method to reproduce those benefits without token injection.

Method: 1) Analyze activation distributions in MLP layers to observe redistribution effects caused by meaningless tokens. 2) Propose Activation Redistribution Module (ARM) that at inference time identifies near-zero activations after the activation function and redistributes them outward, thereby enhancing informative activations without changing the input sequence. 3) Validate ARM across diverse benchmarks and model architectures with minimal code.

Result: ARM consistently improves reasoning performance across tasks, model sizes, and architectures, with only a few lines of code required. The mechanism provides a clear explanation for the benefits of meaningless tokens and demonstrates a simple, effective technique to harness activation redistribution.

Conclusion: The work offers both a mechanistic explanation for why meaningless-token prompts help LLMs and a practical, low-overhead method (ARM) to replicate and potentially amplify those gains by rebalancing activations during inference.

Abstract: Motivated by the puzzling observation that inserting long sequences of
meaningless tokens before the query prompt can consistently enhance LLM
reasoning performance, this work analyzes the underlying mechanism driving this
phenomenon and based on these insights proposes a more principled method that
allows for similar performance gains. First, we find that the improvements
arise from a redistribution of activations in the LLM's MLP layers, where near
zero activations become less frequent while large magnitude activations
increase. This redistribution enhances the model's representational capacity by
suppressing weak signals and promoting stronger, more informative ones.
Building on this insight, we propose the Activation Redistribution Module
(ARM), a lightweight inference-time technique that modifies activations
directly without altering the input sequence. ARM adaptively identifies
near-zero activations after the non-linear function and shifts them outward,
implicitly reproducing the beneficial effects of meaningless tokens in a
controlled manner. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model
architectures clearly show that ARM consistently improves LLM performance on
reasoning tasks while requiring only a few lines of simple code to implement.
Our findings deliver both a clear mechanistic explanation for the unexpected
benefits of meaningless tokens and a simple yet effective technique that
harnesses activation redistribution to further improve LLM performance.

*Yongcheng Zeng,Zexu Sun,Bokai Ji,Erxue Min,Hengyi Cai,Shuaiqiang Wang,Dawei Yin,Haifeng Zhang,Xu Chen,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes CurES, a curriculum-learning method for training large language models that optimizes prompt sampling and rollout allocation via reinforcement-learning gradient optimization, using Bayesian posterior estimation to reduce overhead. Demonstrates faster convergence and higher performance than GRPO on 1.5B and 7B models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies in prompt dataset selection and rollout allocation in curriculum learning for LLMs. The paper posits that the prompt sampling distribution governs gradient descent convergence while rollout allocation affects gradient update stability, and seeks to develop a principled solution.

Method: Introduce CurES, a framework that jointly optimizes the distribution over prompts and the allocation of rollout quantities; employs Bayesian posterior estimation to minimize computational overhead; provides theoretical analysis of convergence and stability; compares against GRPO on 1.5B and 7B LLMs.

Result: CurES outperforms Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by +3.30 points and +4.82 points on 1.5B and 7B models, respectively; shows faster convergence than baselines including GRPO.

Conclusion: CurES offers a principled, efficient training scheme for LLMs under curriculum learning by optimizing prompt selection and rollout allocation with Bayesian estimation, delivering faster convergence and improved performance over GRPO.

Abstract: Curriculum learning plays a crucial role in enhancing the training efficiency
of large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. However, existing methods
often fail to adequately account for variations in prompt difficulty or rely on
simplistic filtering mechanisms to select prompt datasets within a narrow
criterion range, resulting in significant computational waste. In this work, we
approach the problem from the perspective of reinforcement learning gradient
optimization, offering a systematic and theoretical investigation into how to
improve the training efficiency of LLMs. We identify two key factors
influencing training efficiency: the selection of training prompts and the
allocation of rollout quantities across different prompts. Our theoretical
analysis reveals that the sampling distribution of prompts dictates the
convergence rate of gradient descent, while the allocation of the rollout
quantity influences the consistency and stability of overall gradient updates.
Based on these insights, we propose CurES, an efficient training method that
accelerates convergence and employs Bayesian posterior estimation to minimize
computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our CurES outperforms
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by \textbf{+3.30} points and
\textbf{+4.82} points with 1.5B and 7B models, respectively. Additionally,
CurES exhibits faster convergence compared to baselines, including GRPO.

### [309] [Gated X-TFC: Soft Domain Decomposition for Forward and Inverse Problems in Sharp-Gradient PDEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01039)
*Vikas Dwivedi,Enrico Schiassi,Monica Sigovan,Bruno Sixou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gated X-TFC introduces a differentiable logistic gate to enable soft, learned domain decomposition in X-TFC, achieving high accuracy and efficiency for boundary-layer problems; includes operator-conditioned meta-learning for fast warm-start and scales to multi-subdomain and higher dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs struggle with sharp gradients in singularly perturbed boundary value problems and require domain decomposition with interface penalties; while X-TFC enforces exact boundary conditions without multi-objective optimization, it is computationally inefficient for boundary layers and not compatible with decomposition. A soft, learnable domain decomposition aims to combine accuracy, efficiency, and decomposability.

Method: Replace hard interfaces with a differentiable logistic gate that adaptively tunes radial basis function widths across the domain, removing interface penalties. Introduce an operator-conditioned meta-learning layer that maps PDE parameters to optimal gate configurations for fast, uncertainty-aware warm-starts. Apply to forward and inverse problems, demonstrating on a 1D convection-diffusion benchmark and extending to a twin boundary-layer equation and a 2D Poisson problem with a sharp Gaussian source.

Result: On a 1D convection-diffusion benchmark, Gated X-TFC achieves an order-of-magnitude lower error than standard X-TFC, uses 80 percent fewer collocation points, and reduces training time by 66 percent. The approach scales to multiple subdomains and higher dimensions, demonstrated with a twin boundary-layer equation and a 2D Poisson problem with a sharp Gaussian source.

Conclusion: Gated X-TFC provides a simple, accurate, and computationally efficient alternative to PINNs for challenging boundary-layer regimes. The method is scalable to multiple subdomains and higher dimensions, with future work focusing on nonlinear problems.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and related methods struggle to
resolve sharp gradients in singularly perturbed boundary value problems without
resorting to some form of domain decomposition, which often introduce complex
interface penalties. While the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections (X-TFC)
avoids multi-objective optimization by employing exact boundary condition
enforcement, it remains computationally inefficient for boundary layers and
incompatible with decomposition. We propose Gated X-TFC, a novel framework for
both forward and inverse problems, that overcomes these limitations through a
soft, learned domain decomposition. Our method replaces hard interfaces with a
differentiable logistic gate that dynamically adapts radial basis function
(RBF) kernel widths across the domain, eliminating the need for interface
penalties. This approach yields not only superior accuracy but also dramatic
improvements in computational efficiency: on a benchmark one dimensional (1D)
convection-diffusion, Gated X-TFC achieves an order-of-magnitude lower error
than standard X-TFC while using 80 percent fewer collocation points and
reducing training time by 66 percent. In addition, we introduce an
operator-conditioned meta-learning layer that learns a probabilistic mapping
from PDE parameters to optimal gate configurations, enabling fast,
uncertainty-aware warm-starting for new problem instances. We further
demonstrate scalability to multiple subdomains and higher dimensions by solving
a twin boundary-layer equation and a 2D Poisson problem with a sharp Gaussian
source. Overall, Gated X-TFC delivers a simple alternative alternative to PINNs
that is both accurate and computationally efficient for challenging
boundar-layer regimes. Future work will focus on nonlinear problems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GEM is an open-source, OpenAI-Gym-like environment simulator for LLMs that enables experience-based learning via RL-style interactions, offering async vectorized execution, extensible wrappers, a diverse environment suite, and baselines across 24 tasks; it benchmarks PPO, GRPO, and REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization to guide algorithm design and provides an evaluation toolkit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To transition LLM training from static datasets to interactive, environment-based learning. There is a need for a standardized, scalable, and extensible environment-agent interface (like Gym for traditional RL) to accelerate agentic LLM development and enable fair comparisons across methods.

Method: Introduce GEM with asynchronous vectorized execution, a flexible environment-agent interface, and wrappers for five RL frameworks. Provide a diverse set of environments, integrated tools, and one-file scripts. Establish baselines on 24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN) and perform apple-to-apple benchmarking of PPO, GRPO, and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings using GEM.

Result: GEM provides a unified training and evaluation platform for agentic LLM research. Baselines using ReBN are compatible with dense per-turn rewards and show improved credit assignment over some competitors. Benchmarking across PPO, GRPO, and REINFORCE clarifies how algorithmic choices interact with multi-turn, dense-reward settings. The framework also functions as an evaluation toolkit in addition to training environments.

Conclusion: GEM is a scalable, extensible, open-source ecosystem designed to accelerate agentic LLM research by standardizing environment-agent interactions, enabling high-throughput experiments, and offering ready-to-use baselines and evaluation tools across a broad suite of tasks.

Abstract: The training paradigm for large language models (LLMs) is moving from static
datasets to experience-based learning, where agents acquire skills via
interacting with complex environments. To facilitate this transition we
introduce GEM (General Experience Maker), an open-source environment simulator
designed for the age of LLMs. Analogous to OpenAI-Gym for traditional
reinforcement learning (RL), GEM provides a standardized framework for the
environment-agent interface, including asynchronous vectorized execution for
high throughput, and flexible wrappers for easy extensibility. GEM also
features a diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and
single-file example scripts demonstrating using GEM with five popular RL
training frameworks. Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across
24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which
-- unlike GRPO -- is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn
rewards and offers better credit assignment. We further conduct apple-to-apple
benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings
using GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs. Lastly, GEM also functions
as a convenient evaluation toolkit besides a training environment. We hope this
framework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research.

### [311] [Eliciting Secret Knowledge from Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01070)
*Bartosz Cywiński,Emil Ryd,Rowan Wang,Senthooran Rajamanoharan,Neel Nanda,Arthur Conmy,Samuel Marks*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work studies secret elicitation in large language models (LLMs), showing black-box prefill attacks can reveal hidden knowledge in many settings while white-box methods (logit lens, sparse autoencoders) excel in others; they release models/code and establish a public benchmark for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify vulnerabilities where an AI may possess secret knowledge and apply it without verbalizing it, enabling systematic auditing and assessment of LLM safety and transparency.

Method: Train three families of LLMs to encode and apply a secret (e.g., user attributes) while denying knowledge when probed; design and compare black-box (prefill attacks) and white-box (logit lens, sparse autoencoders) secret elicitation techniques; evaluate whether an LLM auditor can infer the secret across settings, against baselines.

Result: Prefill attacks outperform baselines in two of three settings; white-box methods (logit lens and SAEs) are most effective in the remaining setting; overall improvements over simple baselines; authors release models and code to establish a public secret-elicitation benchmark.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates vulnerabilities in LLMs to secret elicitation and provides a public benchmark for evaluating such methods, highlighting when black-box versus white-box approaches are most effective and informing auditing and safety practices.

Abstract: We study secret elicitation: discovering knowledge that an AI possesses but
does not explicitly verbalize. As a testbed, we train three families of large
language models (LLMs) to possess specific knowledge that they apply downstream
but deny knowing when asked directly. For example, in one setting, we train an
LLM to generate replies that are consistent with knowing the user is female,
while denying this knowledge when asked directly. We then design various
black-box and white-box secret elicitation techniques and evaluate them based
on whether they can help an LLM auditor successfully guess the secret
knowledge. Many of our techniques improve on simple baselines. Our most
effective techniques (performing best in 2/3 settings) are based on prefill
attacks, a black-box technique where the LLM reveals secret knowledge when
generating a completion from a predefined prefix. In our remaining setting,
white-box techniques based on logit lens and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are
most effective. We release our models and code, establishing a public benchmark
for evaluating secret elicitation methods.

*Mahyar Mahmoudi,Tieming Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two-level ensemble model using routine laboratory tests achieves strong diabetic retinopathy risk prediction without imaging, via hierarchical stacking of Linear SVC, RF, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost (stage-1) with a Random Forest meta-learner (stage-2).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of image-based DR screening by leveraging readily available lab data, enabling accessible, cost-effective, early detection while maintaining high predictive performance.

Method: Stage 1: tune and internally stack base models (Linear SVC, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost) across configurations. Stage 2: aggregate predictions with a Random Forest meta-learner in a hierarchical stacking framework.

Result: Accuracy 0.9433; F1 0.9425; Recall 0.9207; Precision 0.9653; ROC-AUC 0.9844; AUPRC 0.9875, outperforming one-level stacking and FCN baselines.

Conclusion: Hierarchical stacking enhances generalization and balances multiple performance metrics while remaining computationally efficient compared to deep learning, supporting accurate and interpretable DR risk prediction in clinical settings.

Abstract: Preprint Note: This is the author preprint version of a paper accepted for
presentation at the IISE Annual Conference & Expo 2025. The final version will
appear in the official proceedings.
  Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness in working-age
adults, and current diagnostic methods rely on resource-intensive eye exams and
specialized equipment. Image-based AI tools have shown limitations in
early-stage detection, motivating the need for alternative approaches. We
propose a non-image-based, two-level ensemble model for DR prediction using
routine laboratory test results. In the first stage, base models (Linear SVC,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost) are hyperparameter tuned and
internally stacked across different configurations to optimize metrics such as
accuracy, recall, and precision. In the second stage, predictions are
aggregated using Random Forest as a meta-learner. This hierarchical stacking
strategy improves generalization, balances performance across multiple metrics,
and remains computationally efficient compared to deep learning approaches. The
model achieved Accuracy 0.9433, F1 Score 0.9425, Recall 0.9207, Precision
0.9653, ROC-AUC 0.9844, and AUPRC 0.9875, surpassing one-level stacking and FCN
baselines. These results highlight the model potential for accurate and
interpretable DR risk prediction in clinical settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Multi-Actor Multi-Critic (MAMC) deep deterministic policy learning that uses multiple actors and critics with non-dominated sorting for exploration and a quantile-based ensemble for evaluation, achieving stable learning and improved performance on continuous control benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle large (discrete or continuous) state/action spaces and address value-estimation biases in reinforcement learning by leveraging multiple actors and critics, extending beyond traditional single-actor or single-critic architectures.

Method: Proposes MAMC with three key features: (1) actor selection via non-dominated sorting to balance skill and creativity for exploration, (2) a quantile-based ensemble strategy to evaluate both actors and critics, and (3) exploitation of actors with the best skill factor. The approach includes theoretical analysis showing learning stability and bounded estimation bias.

Result: Empirical evaluation on MuJoCo benchmarks shows MAMC outperforms state-of-the-art deep deterministic RL methods. Component analyses confirm effectiveness of the proposed features and empirical results demonstrate benefits on complex problems. Source code is available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: MAMC provides stable, high-performance deep deterministic RL by combining diverse actors with ensemble critics, effectively addressing exploration and value-estimation challenges in continuous control tasks and enabling better performance on challenging problems.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has gathered much attention in recent years due to its
rapid development and rich applications, especially on control systems and
robotics. When tackling real-world applications with reinforcement learning
method, the corresponded Markov decision process may have huge discrete or even
continuous state/action space. Deep reinforcement learning has been studied for
handling these issues through deep learning for years, and one promising branch
is the actor-critic architecture. Many past studies leveraged multiple critics
to enhance the accuracy of evaluation of a policy for addressing the
overestimation and underestimation issues. However, few studies have considered
the architecture with multiple actors together with multiple critics. This
study proposes a novel multi-actor multi-critic (MAMC) deep deterministic
reinforcement learning method. The proposed method has three main features,
including selection of actors based on non-dominated sorting for exploration
with respect to skill and creativity factors, evaluation for actors and critics
using a quantile-based ensemble strategy, and exploiting actors with best skill
factor. Theoretical analysis proves the learning stability and bounded
estimation bias for the MAMC. The present study examines the performance on a
well-known reinforcement learning benchmark MuJoCo. Experimental results show
that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art deep deterministic
based reinforcement learning methods. Experimental analysis also indicates the
proposed components are effective. Empirical analysis further investigates the
validity of the proposed method, and shows its benefit on complicated problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model dynamical systems with intrinsic noise and stochasticity, existing autoencoder-based approaches struggle to recover latent trajectories and noise; a method that learns both state paths and noise processes is needed for reliable long-horizon predictions.

Method: Proposes a VAE-based approach for dynamical systems that estimates both latent state trajectories and noise time series from observations; supports multi-step evolution; integrates teacher forcing to steer training; compares architecture to deterministic analogs.

Result: Demonstrated performance across six test problems (simulated and experimental data); shows effects of the teacher-forcing interval on internal dynamics; compares favorably to deterministic models with the same architecture.

Conclusion: The framework provides a viable route to learning stochastic dynamics from data, with teacher forcing offering control over the learned internal dynamics and broad applicability demonstrated across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Learning stochastic models of dynamical systems underlying observed data is
of interest in many scientific fields. Here we propose a novel method for this
task, based on the framework of variational autoencoders for dynamical systems.
The method estimates from the data both the system state trajectories and noise
time series. This approach allows to perform multi-step system evolution and
supports a teacher forcing strategy, alleviating limitations of
autoencoder-based approaches for stochastic systems. We demonstrate the
performance of the proposed approach on six test problems, covering simulated
and experimental data. We further show the effects of the teacher forcing
interval on the nature of the internal dynamics, and compare it to the
deterministic models with equivalent architecture.

*George Andriopoulos,Zixuan Dong,Bimarsha Adhikari,Keith Ross*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Intrinsic-dimension perspective explains when neural regression models collapse or not, linking last-layer feature dimension to target dimension to predict generalization; two regimes (over- and under-compressed) determine whether expanding or reducing feature dimensionality helps; offers practical strategies to improve regression generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the geometry of learned representations in neural regression and why neural collapse harms regression while aiding classification; leverage intrinsic dimension to guide model design and training.

Method: Empirically estimate the intrinsic dimension of last-layer features (ID_H) and the intrinsic dimension of targets (ID_Y) across control tasks and synthetic datasets; classify models as collapsed (ID_H < ID_Y) or non-collapsed (ID_H > ID_Y); analyze how performance relates to ID_H, ID_Y, data quantity, noise, and the regimes; identify practical guidelines.

Result: Collapsed models exhibit ID_H < ID_Y, causing over-compression and poor generalization; non-collapsed models have ID_H > ID_Y, with performance depending on data and noise; two regimes—over-compressed and under-compressed—determine when changing feature dimensionality helps; provides geometric insights and actionable strategies for better generalization in neural regression.

Conclusion: Offers a geometric lens to neural regression via intrinsic dimension, explaining when feature expansion or compression benefits generalization and proposing practical guidelines for model design and training to improve regression performance.

Abstract: Neural multivariate regression underpins a wide range of domains such as
control, robotics, and finance, yet the geometry of its learned representations
remains poorly characterized. While neural collapse has been shown to benefit
generalization in classification, we find that analogous collapse in regression
consistently degrades performance. To explain this contrast, we analyze models
through the lens of intrinsic dimension. Across control tasks and synthetic
datasets, we estimate the intrinsic dimension of last-layer features (ID_H) and
compare it with that of the regression targets (ID_Y). Collapsed models exhibit
ID_H < ID_Y, leading to over-compression and poor generalization, whereas
non-collapsed models typically maintain ID_H > ID_Y. For the non-collapsed
models, performance with respect to ID_H depends on the data quantity and noise
levels. From these observations, we identify two regimes (over-compressed and
under-compressed) that determine when expanding or reducing feature
dimensionality improves performance. Our results provide new geometric insights
into neural regression and suggest practical strategies for enhancing
generalization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TsLLM augments an LLM with a patch-based time-series perception module to jointly handle numerical temporal data and natural language, trained on 2M interleaved time series/text examples; achieves integration-enabled NL tasks without aiming to beat traditional time-series models on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel at language but struggle with time-series / numerical data; traditional TS models lack NL reasoning and contextual text integration; need a unified framework enabling natural language interaction with temporal data.

Method: A patch-based encoder-decoder adds time-series perception to an LLM, trained on a large corpus of interleaved time-series and text; diverse tasks include forecasting with context, time-series QA, explanations, NL outputs, and report generation.

Result: TsLLM shows strong performance on tasks requiring integration of TS analysis with NL while not being designed to outperform specialized TS models on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: Introduces a new paradigm bridging numerical computation and NL understanding for time-series analysis, enabling accessible temporal reasoning through natural language.

Abstract: Time series data is fundamental to decision-making in many crucial domains
including healthcare, finance, and environmental science. However, analyzing
this data often requires incorporating unstructured contextual information,
answering domain-specific questions, and generating natural language
explanations -- capabilities that traditional time series models lack due to
their inability to process text. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
contextual reasoning and knowledge integration, they struggle with numerical
time series due to inefficient text-based representations and limited exposure
to temporal data during pretraining. We address this gap by augmenting an LLM
with specialized time series perception through a patch-based encoder-decoder
architecture. We train this Time Series-augmented LLM (TsLLM) on a large corpus
of over 2 million interleaved time series and text examples spanning diverse
analysis tasks: forecasting with contextual information, time series
question-answering, pattern explanation, classification with natural language
outputs, and report generation. This training enables TsLLM to leverage both
its language understanding and newly acquired temporal reasoning capabilities.
While not designed to surpass specialized models on traditional benchmarks,
TsLLM demonstrates strong performance on tasks requiring the integration of
time series analysis with natural language -- capabilities that existing
approaches cannot provide. Our work establishes a new paradigm for time series
analysis that bridges numerical computation and natural language understanding,
democratizing access to sophisticated temporal reasoning through natural
language interaction.

TL;DR: An attention-based federated learning framework (A3-FL) for biometric recognition that handles non-IID data and privacy by weighting client updates, using Siamese-CNN features on fingerprint data, and achieving higher accuracy than standard FL and baselines, even under differential privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biometric data are highly sensitive; centralized training risks privacy leakage. Federated learning offers privacy-preserving decentralized training, but challenges remain in interpretability and handling non-IID data typical in biometrics.

Method: Introduce a server-side attention mechanism to weight local model updates by estimated significance, combined with differential privacy and secure update protocols. Features are extracted via Siamese-CNN from fingerprint data (FVC2004). Evaluate against FedAvg, Local-only, and Centralized baselines; assess accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness.

Result: Attention-based A3-FL achieves 0.8413 accuracy, outperforming FedAvg (0.8164), Local-only (0.7664), and Centralized (0.7997); maintains ~0.8330 accuracy under differential privacy, indicating robustness to privacy constraints.

Conclusion: A scalable, privacy-conscious biometric recognition system for distributed environments; dynamic attention improves accuracy and resilience to non-IID data and privacy protections; demonstrated effectively on fingerprint recognition with Siamese-CNN features.

Abstract: Because biometric data is sensitive, centralized training poses a privacy
risk, even though biometric recognition is essential for contemporary
applications. Federated learning (FL), which permits decentralized training,
provides a privacy-preserving substitute. Conventional FL, however, has trouble
with interpretability and heterogeneous data (non-IID). In order to handle
non-IID biometric data, this framework adds an attention mechanism at the
central server that weights local model updates according to their
significance. Differential privacy and secure update protocols safeguard data
while preserving accuracy. The A3-FL framework is evaluated in this study using
FVC2004 fingerprint data, with each client's features extracted using a Siamese
Convolutional Neural Network (Siamese-CNN). By dynamically modifying client
contributions, the attention mechanism increases the accuracy of the global
model.The accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness of the A3-FL framework
are superior to those of standard FL (FedAvg) and static baselines, according
to experimental evaluations using fingerprint data (FVC2004). The accuracy of
the attention-based approach was 0.8413, while FedAvg, Local-only, and
Centralized approaches were 0.8164, 0.7664, and 0.7997, respectively. Accuracy
stayed high at 0.8330 even with differential privacy. A scalable and
privacy-sensitive biometric system for secure and effective recognition in
dispersed environments is presented in this work.

### [318] [Eliciting Chain-of-Thought Reasoning for Time Series Analysis using Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01116)
*Felix Parker,Nimeesha Chan,Chi Zhang,Kimia Ghobadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COUNTS trains LLMs to perform chain-of-thought reasoning on time-series tasks using reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, leveraging a residual vector-quantized VAE to create discrete tokens integrated into the LLM vocabulary; a two-stage training process (supervised fine-tuning on time-series tasks followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization) yields improved performance across diverse time-series analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable explicit, multi-step reasoning for time-series tasks (e.g., medical diagnosis, weather forecasting), addressing the current gap where LLMs excel at CoT in math/coding but struggle with time-series data and explicit reasoning, by combining CoT with verifiable RL-based training.

Method: Use a Residual Vector-Quantized VAE to generate high-fidelity discrete tokens compatible with an LLM; train in two stages: (1) supervised fine-tuning on time-series analysis tasks to learn representations; (2) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with prompts that elicit explicit reasoning steps before final answers, using verifiable rewards as feedback.

Result: The RL-driven approach with intermediate chain-of-thought reasoning significantly improves LLM performance across multiple time-series analysis tasks compared to baselines.

Conclusion: COUNTS demonstrates that enabling explicit CoT reasoning for time-series tasks via a structured RL framework and discrete token representations can substantially enhance temporal data reasoning and broaden the applicability of LLMs in complex sequential domains.

Abstract: Complex numerical time series analysis often demands multi-step reasoning
capabilities beyond current models' reach. Tasks like medical diagnosis and
weather forecasting require sequential reasoning processes -- including
counterfactual analysis, logical deduction, knowledge application, and
multi-modal contextual integration -- that existing time series models cannot
explicitly perform. While recent research has shown large language models
(LLMs) can achieve sophisticated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning through
reinforcement learning (RL), these advances have primarily focused on
mathematical and coding domains, with LLMs still demonstrating poor performance
on time series tasks. We introduce Chain Of thought for Understanding Numerical
Time Series (COUNTS), the first framework that trains LLMs to perform CoT
reasoning across diverse time series tasks using RL with verifiable rewards.
Our approach employs a Residual Vector-Quantized VAE to create high-fidelity
discrete tokens that seamlessly integrate into a pre-trained LLM's vocabulary.
COUNTS undergoes a two-stage training process: first, supervised fine-tuning on
time series analysis tasks to master our novel representations, followed by
Group Relative Policy Optimization training on verifiable problems using
prompting strategies that encourage explicit reasoning steps before producing
final answers. Our experiments demonstrate that this RL-driven approach with
intermediate CoT reasoning significantly enhances LLM performance across
various time series analysis tasks, opening new possibilities for complex
temporal data reasoning.

*Sarwan Ali,Haris Mansoor,Murray Patterson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Maps genomic sequences to hyperboloid space; builds a kernel matrix via hyperboloid inner products to improve classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Euclidean representations struggle to capture hierarchical and non-Euclidean relationships inherent in genomic sequences. Hyperboloid geometry can preserve such structural information, enabling more meaningful similarity measures.

Method: Transform biological sequences into hyperboloid feature representations; compute a kernel matrix using inner products in hyperboloid space; use kernel-based analysis (e.g., SVM) for classification.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows that hyperboloid-based features capture important sequence correlations and improve classification accuracy compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: Hyperboloid-based sequence representation with a kernel framework is effective for genomic sequence analysis and classification.

Abstract: Genomic sequence analysis plays a crucial role in various scientific and
medical domains. Traditional machine-learning approaches often struggle to
capture the complex relationships and hierarchical structures of sequence data
when working in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. This limitation hinders
accurate sequence classification and similarity measurement. To address these
challenges, this research proposes a method to transform the feature
representation of biological sequences into the hyperboloid space. By applying
a transformation, the sequences are mapped onto the hyperboloid, preserving
their inherent structural information. Once the sequences are represented in
the hyperboloid space, a kernel matrix is computed based on the hyperboloid
features. The kernel matrix captures the pairwise similarities between
sequences, enabling more effective analysis of biological sequence
relationships. This approach leverages the inner product of the hyperboloid
feature vectors to measure the similarity between pairs of sequences. The
experimental evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates its efficacy in
capturing important sequence correlations and improving classification
accuracy.

*Lovish Madaan,Aniket Didolkar,Suchin Gururangan,John Quan,Ruan Silva,Ruslan Salakhutdinov,Manzil Zaheer,Sanjeev Arora,Anirudh Goyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PDR (Parallel-Distill-Refine) improves accuracy with lower latency by decoupling context length from total tokens: generate diverse drafts in parallel, distill to a bounded workspace, then refine conditioned on that workspace. Includes Sequential Refinement (SR) as a 1-d parallelism case; an 8B model trained with RL aligns with PDR. On math tasks (AIME 2024/2025), PDR yields the largest gains (+11%, +9%), surpassing long CoT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the accuracy-cost Pareto trade-off of long chain-of-thought reasoning. While long CoT boosts accuracy, it inflates context length, compute, and latency. The work investigates whether metacognitive strategies can yield better accuracy with lower context/latency.

Method: Propose Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR): (i) generate diverse reasoning drafts in parallel; (ii) distill them into a bounded textual workspace; (iii) refine conditioned on this workspace to produce the final answer, seeding the next round. Control context length via parallelism degree, decoupling it from total tokens. Evaluate a 1-parallelism case (Sequential Refinement, SR) and train an 8B model with RL to align with PDR. Assess on math tasks with verifiable answers, comparing against single-pass and long-CoT baselines.

Result: PDR-based instantiations achieve better accuracy than long-CoT baselines while incurring lower latency. SR, as a special case, outperforms long CoT. On verifiable math benchmarks (AIME 2024/2025), iterative pipelines outperform single-pass baselines at matched budgets, with PDR delivering the largest gains (e.g., +11% on AIME 2024, +9% on AIME 2025).

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates a viable path to shifting the accuracy-cost Pareto frontier for LLM reasoning by decoupling context from computation via parallel reasoning and workspace distillation. Further training could push the frontier further; PDR invites exploration of other inference stratagems and their optimization.

Abstract: Reasoning training incentivizes LLMs to produce long chains of thought (long
CoT), which among other things, allows them to explore solution strategies with
self-checking. This results in higher accuracy, but inflates context length,
token/compute cost, and answer latency. We ask: Can current models leverage
their metacognition to provide other combinations on this Pareto frontier,
e.g., better accuracy with lower context length and/or latency? Abstractly, we
view the model as an improvement operator on its own "thoughts" with a
continuum of possible strategies. We identify an interesting inference family
Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR), which performs the following: (i) generate
diverse drafts in parallel; (ii) distill them into a bounded, textual
workspace; and (iii) refine conditioned on this workspace, producing an output
that seeds the next round. Importantly, context length (hence compute cost) is
controllable via degree of parallelism, and is no longer conflated with the
total number of generated tokens. We report PDR instantiations of current
models that give better accuracy than long CoT while incurring lower latency.
Setting degree of parallelism to 1 yields an interesting subcase, Sequential
Refinement (SR) (iteratively improve a single candidate answer) which provides
performance superior to long CoT. Success of such model orchestrations raises
the question whether further training could shift the Pareto frontier. To this
end, we train an 8B thinking model with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to make it
consistent with PDR as the inference method. On math tasks with verifiable
answers, iterative pipelines surpass single-pass baselines at matched
sequential budgets, with PDR delivering the largest gains (e.g., +11% on AIME
2024 and +9% on AIME 2025).

### [321] [A Practitioner's Guide to Multi-turn Agentic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01132)
*Ruiyi Wang,Prithviraj Ammanabrolu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Empirical study of training LLM agents with multi-turn RL, breaking design into three pillars—environment, reward, and policy—and giving a practical co-design recipe tested on TextWorld, ALFWorld, and SWE-Gym.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no systematic formulation of which design choices matter across tasks in multi-turn agent RL with LLMs; existing frameworks are fragmented. The work aims to identify robust signals across environments and rewards and to guide practical design decisions.

Method: Three-pillar empirical study across domains TextWorld, ALFWorld, and SWE-Gym. Vary environment complexity (state/action space sizes, optimal task length); ablate reward sparsity (dense vs sparse); compare biased (PPO, GRPO) vs unbiased (RLOO) policy gradients; determine an optimal SFT-to-RL training ratio under budget constraints; distill findings into a training recipe.

Result: Findings include: simple environments still provide signals on generalization; dense rewards speed training but stability and performance depend on the RL algorithm; policy choice interacts with reward sparsity; a co-design recipe is distilled for environment, reward, and policy; code availability provided for replication.

Conclusion:  Provides a practical, co-designed training recipe for multi-turn agentic RL, guiding researchers and practitioners in balancing environment design, reward shaping, and policy optimization across tasks; code available at the cited repository.

Abstract: We study what actually works and what doesn't for training large language
models as agents via multi-turn reinforcement learning. Despite rapid progress,
existing frameworks and definitions are fragmented, and there is no systematic
formulation or analysis of which design choices matter across tasks. We address
this gap by first breaking down the design space into three inter-related
pillars -- environment, reward, and policy -- and empirically derive a recipe
for training LLM agents in situated textual domains. In particular, we test
TextWorld and ALFWorld, popular domains for testing situated embodied
reasoning, as well as SWE-Gym for more software engineering style tasks. (i)
For the environment, we analyze the impacts of task complexity in terms of
sizes of the state and action spaces as well as optimal solution length,
finding that even simple environments within a domain can provide signal on how
well an agent can generalize to more complex tasks. (ii) For the reward, we
ablate relative reward sparsity, observing that while dense turn-level rewards
accelerate training, performance and stability is highly dependent on the
choice of RL algorithm. (iii) And for the agent's policy, we explore the
interplay between reward sparsity and biased (PPO, GRPO) and unbiased (RLOO)
policy gradient methods in addition to showing how to find the optimal
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to RL training ratio given a fixed budget. We
distill these findings into a training recipe that guides co-design across the
three pillars, facilitating research and practical efforts in multi-turn
agentic RL. Code: https://github.com/pearls-lab/meow-tea-taro

*Zhaolin Gao,Joongwon Kim,Wen Sun,Thorsten Joachims,Sid Wang,Richard Yuanzhe Pang,Liang Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL) is a lightweight RL method that selects intermediate-difficulty prompts via a concurrently updated value model to post-train LLMs, improving efficiency by avoiding costly rollouts while maintaining or enhancing performance on reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-training LLMs with RL are sensitive to batching and prompt choice; there is a need for efficient, effective prompt selection to steer RL toward informative, difficulty-appropriate prompts that yield better reasoning performance.

Method: An on-policy RL framework where a value model scores prompts (prompt difficulty) and is updated in tandem with the policy. The method identifies intermediate-difficulty prompts for the current policy, balances batch size for generation efficiency and gradient quality, and compares PCL to rollout-based filtering, achieving significant speedups on MATH and DeepScaleR.

Result: PCL achieves higher performance or faster convergence to comparable performance than baselines, and is 12.1x and 16.9x faster at identifying intermediate-difficulty prompts on MATH and DeepScaleR, respectively. The value model accurately predicts prompt difficulty and enables progressively harder prompts during training.

Conclusion: PCL offers a new, efficient methodology for reasoning-focused RL that improves the tradeoff between upper-bound performance and training efficiency by focusing on informative, intermediate-difficulty prompts without costly rollouts.

Abstract: We introduce Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL), a lightweight reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithm that selects intermediate-difficulty prompts using a
learned value model to post-train language models. Since post-training LLMs via
RL remains sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, we first
conduct a series of systematic experiments where we (1) determine the optimal
training batch size that balances generation efficiency and gradient quality
and (2) establish the importance of focusing on prompts of intermediate
difficulty for the policy. We build upon these results to design PCL, which
identifies prompts of intermediate difficulty for the current policy in an
on-policy manner by using a value model that is concurrently updated based on
the current policy. By focusing on informative prompts that yield high
effective ratios, PCL achieves either the highest performance or requires
significantly less time to reach comparable performance to its counterparts.
Compared to rollout-based filtering methods, PCL avoids costly rollouts and
achieves $12.1\times$ and $16.9\times$ faster speed on identifying
intermediate-difficulty prompts when training on MATH and DeepScaleR,
respectively. We further demonstrate that our value model accurately predicts
prompt difficulty and allows PCL to focus on progressively more challenging
prompts during RL. Our results present a new methodology that delivers improved
tradeoff between upper-bound performance and efficiency for reasoning-focused
RL.

*Vincent Ochs,Florentin Bieder,Sidaty el Hadramy,Paul Friedrich,Stephanie Taha-Mehlitz,Anas Taha,Philippe C. Cattin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TabINR introduces an auto-decoder INR framework for tabular data imputation using learnable row and feature embeddings, enabling instance-adaptive imputations without retraining and achieving competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Missing values are pervasive in real-world tabular data and imputation quality directly impacts downstream models. Simple imputation methods can bias distributions; there is a need for high-quality, fast, robust imputers that work across dataset sizes and support instance-adaptive imputations.

Method: The approach models tables as neural functions using anImplicit Neural Representation (INR) with trainable row and feature embeddings. It is an auto-decoder setup that infers embeddings from partial observations, enabling imputations that adapt to each instance without modifying the trained model.

Result: Evaluation on twelve real-world datasets with various missingness mechanisms shows strong imputation accuracy, typically matching or surpassing classical methods (KNN, MICE, MissForest) and deep models (GAIN, ReMasker), with the clearest gains on high-dimensional datasets.

Conclusion: TabINR provides robust, scalable, and instance-adaptive imputations for tabular data by leveraging INRs and learnable embeddings, offering competitive performance across a range of datasets and missingness patterns.

Abstract: Tabular data builds the basis for a wide range of applications, yet
real-world datasets are frequently incomplete due to collection errors, privacy
restrictions, or sensor failures. As missing values degrade the performance or
hinder the applicability of downstream models, and while simple imputing
strategies tend to introduce bias or distort the underlying data distribution,
we require imputers that provide high-quality imputations, are robust across
dataset sizes and yield fast inference. We therefore introduce TabINR, an
auto-decoder based Implicit Neural Representation (INR) framework that models
tables as neural functions. Building on recent advances in generalizable INRs,
we introduce learnable row and feature embeddings that effectively deal with
the discrete structure of tabular data and can be inferred from partial
observations, enabling instance adaptive imputations without modifying the
trained model. We evaluate our framework across a diverse range of twelve
real-world datasets and multiple missingness mechanisms, demonstrating
consistently strong imputation accuracy, mostly matching or outperforming
classical (KNN, MICE, MissForest) and deep learning based models (GAIN,
ReMasker), with the clearest gains on high-dimensional datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A post-processing denoising step using random matrix theory recovers gradient structure in DP-SGD trained LLMs, boosting sample efficiency during fine-tuning with DP, demonstrated on RoBERTa/GLUE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DP-SGD injects noise that destroys gradient low-rank structure, hindering optimization; improving gradient quality could enhance data efficiency without sacrificing privacy.

Method: Post-processing gradients with a random-matrix-theory-based denoising algorithm to restore low-rank structure and better align with the true signal; applied during DP-SGD fine-tuning of RoBERTa on GLUE.

Result: Achieves improved sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art private fine-tuning methods; substantially reduces training time when optimal performance is not required.

Conclusion: Matrix recovery techniques can improve the utility of private language-model training without compromising differential privacy, suggesting broader applicability to private ML.

Abstract: We address the challenge of sample efficiency in differentially private
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) using DP-SGD. While DP-SGD provides
strong privacy guarantees, the added noise significantly increases the entropy
of gradient matrices, disrupting their low-rank structure and slowing
optimization. We propose a post-processing algorithm that leverages random
matrix theory to denoise gradients, restore low-rank structure, and improve
alignment with the original signal. Applied to DP-SGD fine-tuning of RoBERTa on
GLUE tasks, our method improves sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, substantially reducing training time when optimal performance is
not required. This work demonstrates that matrix recovery techniques can
enhance the utility of private language model training without compromising
privacy guarantees.

*Yesom Park,Shu Liu,Mo Zhou,Stanley Osher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Hamilton-Jacobi-based OT framework that yields closed-form, bidirectional transport maps via the method of characteristics, trained by a single neural network in pure minimization, achieving provable optimality with broad cost-support and class-conditional transport, and improved efficiency by avoiding numerical integration and adversarial training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To obtain a unique OT map through viscosity solutions of the HJ equation and to overcome computational bottlenecks in existing OT methods that rely on numerical integration or adversarial training; enable broad applicability across costs and conditional settings with provable optimality.

Method: Formulate OT via viscosity solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi PDE; apply the method of characteristics to obtain closed-form forward and backward transport maps; train a single neural network via a loss derived from the characteristic relations (pure minimization); support diverse cost functions and class conditioning; avoid numerical integration and adversarial training.

Result: Demonstrates accuracy, scalability, and efficiency on diverse datasets; shows that the learned map converges to the optimal OT map with provable optimality; extends naturally to various costs and class-conditioned transport.

Conclusion: Introduces a principled, versatile OT framework with provable optimality, reduced computational complexity, and broad applicability; potential extensions include unbalanced/multi-marginal OT and richer cost structures.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for solving optimal transport (OT) problems
based on the Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) equation, whose viscosity solution uniquely
characterizes the OT map. By leveraging the method of characteristics, we
derive closed-form, bidirectional transport maps, thereby eliminating the need
for numerical integration. The proposed method adopts a pure minimization
framework: a single neural network is trained with a loss function derived from
the method of characteristics of the HJ equation. This design guarantees
convergence to the optimal map while eliminating adversarial training stages,
thereby substantially reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, the
framework naturally extends to a wide class of cost functions and supports
class-conditional transport. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets
demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of the proposed method,
establishing it as a principled and versatile tool for OT applications with
provable optimality.

*Oskar Kviman,Kirill Tamogashev,Nicola Branchini,Víctor Elvira,Jens Lagergren,Nikolay Malkin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ALI-CFM: adversarially learned interpolants for multi-marginal flow matching to infer dynamical vector fields from snapshot data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inferring continuous dynamics from discrete snapshots is challenging; existing multi-marginal approaches struggle to recover trajectories and produce consistent marginals. A method that learns smooth interpolants that align with intermediate distributions can improve trajectory inference.

Method: Propose ALI-CFM, which trains neurally parameterized interpolants between source and target points using a GAN-inspired adversarial loss to ensure the interpolants' intermediate marginals match observed distributions. These interpolants are then marginalized via a flow-matching algorithm to yield the underlying dynamical vector field. The interpolants are argued to be unique under mild assumptions.

Result: The approach outperforms existing baselines on spatial transcriptomics and cell tracking datasets and performs comparably to baselines on single-cell trajectory prediction, demonstrating scalability and versatility with released code.

Conclusion: ALI-CFM offers a flexible, scalable framework that combines adversarial interpolation with flow matching to perform robust multi-marginal trajectory inference, producing smooth, unique trajectories and accurate dynamics across challenging biological datasets.

Abstract: Learning the dynamics of a process given sampled observations at several time
points is an important but difficult task in many scientific applications. When
no ground-truth trajectories are available, but one has only snapshots of data
taken at discrete time steps, the problem of modelling the dynamics, and thus
inferring the underlying trajectories, can be solved by multi-marginal
generalisations of flow matching algorithms. This paper proposes a novel flow
matching method that overcomes the limitations of existing multi-marginal
trajectory inference algorithms. Our proposed method, ALI-CFM, uses a
GAN-inspired adversarial loss to fit neurally parametrised interpolant curves
between source and target points such that the marginal distributions at
intermediate time points are close to the observed distributions. The resulting
interpolants are smooth trajectories that, as we show, are unique under mild
assumptions. These interpolants are subsequently marginalised by a flow
matching algorithm, yielding a trained vector field for the underlying
dynamics. We showcase the versatility and scalability of our method by
outperforming the existing baselines on spatial transcriptomics and cell
tracking datasets, while performing on par with them on single-cell trajectory
prediction.

### [327] [Prosperity before Collapse: How Far Can Off-Policy RL Reach with Stale Data on LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01161)
*Haizhong Zheng,Jiawei Zhao,Bedi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: M2PO introduces a second-moment constraint on importance weights to enable stable off-policy RL for large language models, tolerating high data staleness and matching on-policy performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Asynchronous RL decouples rollout generation from training to improve efficiency, but stale data degrades performance. There is a need for robust off-policy methods that can leverage stale data without collapsing.

Method: M2PO (Second-Moment Trust Policy Optimization) constrains the second moment of importance weights to suppress extreme outliers while preserving informative updates, reducing token clipping under high staleness and enabling stable off-policy training.

Result: M2PO significantly reduces the fraction of clipped tokens under high staleness (1.22% to 0.06%), achieves stable off-policy training with data stale by at least 256 updates across six models (1.7B–32B) and eight benchmarks, and matches on-policy performance.

Conclusion: Controlling the second moment of importance weights is an effective strategy for robust off-policy RL in large language models, enabling scalable asynchronous training without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been central to recent advances in large language
model reasoning, but most algorithms rely on on-policy training that demands
fresh rollouts at every update, limiting efficiency and scalability.
Asynchronous RL systems alleviate this by decoupling rollout generation from
training, yet their effectiveness hinges on tolerating large staleness in
rollout data, a setting where existing methods either degrade in performance or
collapse. We revisit this challenge and uncover a prosperity-before-collapse
phenomenon: stale data can be as informative as on-policy data if exploited
properly. Building on this insight, we introduce M2PO (Second-Moment Trust
Policy Optimization), which constrains the second moment of importance weights
to suppress only extreme outliers while preserving informative updates.
Notably, M2PO sharply reduces the fraction of clipped tokens under high
staleness (from 1.22% to 0.06% over training), precisely masking high-variance
tokens while maintaining stable optimization. Extensive evaluation across six
models (from 1.7B to 32B) and eight benchmarks shows that M2PO delivers stable
off-policy training even with data stale by at least 256 model updates and
matches on-policy performance.

### [328] [How Does the Pretraining Distribution Shape In-Context Learning? Task Selection, Generalization, and Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01163)
*Waïss Azizian,Ali Hasan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theoretical and empirical study linking pretraining data properties to in-context learning efficiency and reliability in LLMs, showing that heavy-tailed, dependent distributions shape sample efficiency, task retrieval, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-context learning remains poorly understood despite effectiveness. Understanding how pretraining data distributions affect ICL on numerical tasks can guide design of more reliable, efficient LLMs.

Method: Develop a theoretical framework that unifies task selection and generalization; extend Bayesian posterior consistency and concentration to heavy-tailed priors and dependent sequences; empirically vary the pretraining distribution on challenging tasks (e.g., stochastic differential equations, memoryful stochastic processes).

Result: Distributional properties of the pretraining data govern sample efficiency, task retrieval, and robustness of ICL. The framework reflects heavier tails and dependencies, improving reflection of LLM pretraining; controlling these properties is key to building reliable ICL-enabled models.

Conclusion: Careful control of statistical properties of the pretraining distribution is essential for developing LLMs with reliable and efficient in-context learning.

Abstract: The emergence of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs)
remains poorly understood despite its consistent effectiveness, enabling models
to adapt to new tasks from only a handful of examples. To clarify and improve
these capabilities, we characterize how the statistical properties of the
pretraining distribution (e.g., tail behavior, coverage) shape ICL on numerical
tasks. We develop a theoretical framework that unifies task selection and
generalization, extending and sharpening earlier results, and show how
distributional properties govern sample efficiency, task retrieval, and
robustness. To this end, we generalize Bayesian posterior consistency and
concentration results to heavy-tailed priors and dependent sequences, better
reflecting the structure of LLM pretraining data. We then empirically study how
ICL performance varies with the pretraining distribution on challenging tasks
such as stochastic differential equations and stochastic processes with memory.
Together, these findings suggest that controlling key statistical properties of
the pretraining distribution is essential for building ICL-capable and reliable
LLMs.

*Yiran Shen,Yu Xia,Jonathan Chang,Prithviraj Ammanabrolu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified, multi-objective alignment framework for large language models that treats rewards as a vector across verifiable, subjective, and interactive objectives and trains using MAH-DPO with standardized PRM training, enabling fine-grained inference-time user control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address that single-scalar objective alignment often fails in multidimensional settings, the paper aims to align models across mathematical accuracy, human values, and multi-turn dialogue while reducing trade-offs and increasing user control.

Method: Introduce standardized process reward model (PRM) training across verifiable and non-verifiable settings; train with Multi-Action-Head Direct Preference Optimization (MAH-DPO); use a vectorized, multi-dimensional reward instead of a single scalar; emphasize supervision of chain-of-thought reasoning and enable inference-time user control.

Result: Empirically improves performance across math reasoning, value alignment, and multi-turn dialogue; reduces cross-objective trade-offs; enables fine-grained user control during inference; code released at the provided repository.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that multi-objective alignment is feasible with a unified framework combining standardized PRM, vectorized rewards, and MAH-DPO, achieving better cross-domain alignment with controllable trade-offs.

Abstract: Aligning large language models to human preferences is inherently
multidimensional, yet most pipelines collapse heterogeneous signals into a
single optimizeable objective. We seek to answer what it would take to
simultaneously align a model across various domains spanning those with:
verifiable rewards (mathematical accuracy), non-verifiable subjective
preferences (human values), and complex interactive scenarios (multi-turn AI
tutoring dialogues). Such multi-objective reinforcement learning setups are
often plagued by the individual objectives being at odds with each other,
resulting in inefficient training and little user control during inference. We
propose a unified framework that: (i) standardizes {process reward model} (PRM)
training across both verifiable and non-verifiable settings to better supervise

*Jože M. Rožanec,Tina Žezlin,Laurentiu Vasiliu,Dunja Mladenić,Radu Prodan,Dumitru Roman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new family of time-series generators (Fiaingen) for finance achieves state-of-the-art overlap with real data, strong downstream task performance, and rapid generation times, addressing financial data scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity in finance hampers reliable ML models; synthetic data with realistic properties and fast generation is needed to augment limited real-world data.

Method: Introduce novel time-series generation techniques named Fiaingen and evaluate them on three criteria: (a) real-vs-synthetic overlap in reduced-dimensional space, (b) downstream ML task performance, and (c) runtime efficiency.

Result: Fiaingen methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across all three criteria: synthetic data closely mirrors real data in reduced space, improves or matches downstream task performance, and can be generated in sub-second to seconds with scalable throughput.

Conclusion: Fiaingen provides effective, scalable synthetic financial time-series data generation that mitigates data shortages and enables near-real performance in ML models trained on synthetic data.

Abstract: Data is vital in enabling machine learning models to advance research and
practical applications in finance, where accurate and robust models are
essential for investment and trading decision-making. However, real-world data
is limited despite its quantity, quality, and variety. The data shortage of
various financial assets directly hinders the performance of machine learning
models designed to trade and invest in these assets. Generative methods can
mitigate this shortage. In this paper, we introduce a set of novel techniques
for time series data generation (we name them Fiaingen) and assess their
performance across three criteria: (a) overlap of real-world and synthetic data
on a reduced dimensionality space, (b) performance on downstream machine
learning tasks, and (c) runtime performance. Our experiments demonstrate that
the methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across the three criteria
listed above. Synthetic data generated with Fiaingen methods more closely
mirrors the original time series data while keeping data generation time close
to seconds - ensuring the scalability of the proposed approach. Furthermore,
models trained on it achieve performance close to those trained with real-world
data.

*Yudong Wei,Liang Zhang,Bingcong Li,Niao He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Generalized weight normalization with Riemannian optimization achieves linear convergence in overparameterized matrix sensing, giving exponential speedup over non-WN methods and polynomial gains in iteration and sample complexity as overparameterization grows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the theoretical benefits of normalization techniques, specifically weight normalization, in overparameterized matrix sensing and to characterize how overparameterization interacts with WN to accelerate convergence.

Method: Theoretical analysis using generalized weight normalization combined with Riemannian optimization for the matrix sensing problem, proving linear convergence and deriving iteration and sample complexity bounds that depend on the level of overparameterization.

Result: Proves linear convergence with exponential speedup over standard (non-WN) methods; shows iteration and sample complexity improve polynomially with increased overparameterization; provides the first characterization of how WN leverages overparameterization for faster convergence in matrix sensing.

Conclusion: Weight normalization, when combined with Riemannian optimization, accelerates convergence in overparameterized matrix sensing and yields favorable complexity scaling, offering new theoretical insights into normalization's benefits for such problems.

Abstract: While normalization techniques are widely used in deep learning, their
theoretical understanding remains relatively limited. In this work, we
establish the benefits of (generalized) weight normalization (WN) applied to
the overparameterized matrix sensing problem. We prove that WN with Riemannian
optimization achieves linear convergence, yielding an exponential speedup over
standard methods that do not use WN. Our analysis further demonstrates that
both iteration and sample complexity improve polynomially as the level of
overparameterization increases. To the best of our knowledge, this work
provides the first characterization of how WN leverages overparameterization
for faster convergence in matrix sensing.

### [332] [COM-BOM: Bayesian Exemplar Search for Efficiently Exploring the Accuracy-Calibration Pareto Frontier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01178)
*Gaoxiang Luo,Aryan Deshwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COM-BOM provides a Pareto-optimal set of exemplars that balance predictive accuracy and calibration in in-context learning, outperforming baselines on unsaturated MMLU-Pro tasks with fewer API calls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exemplar selection for in-context learning traditionally optimizes accuracy but ignores calibration, a key factor for trustworthy and safe deployment.

Method: Formulates exemplar selection as a multi-objective optimization problem and solves it with a sample-efficient Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization (COM-BOM) to obtain the Pareto front that trades off accuracy and calibration (via expected calibration error).

Result: COM-BOM beats or matches baselines in jointly optimizing accuracy and calibration across multiple tasks from the unsaturated MMLU-Pro benchmark, while requiring a minimal number of LLM API calls.

Conclusion: Multi-objective exemplar selection with explicit calibration optimization is feasible and beneficial; COM-BOM offers a principled, data-efficient approach to improve trustworthiness in in-context learning without excessive API usage.

Abstract: Selecting an optimal set of exemplars is critical for good performance of
in-context learning. However, prior exemplar search methods narrowly optimize
for predictive accuracy, critically neglecting model calibration--a key
determinant of trustworthiness and safe deployment. In this paper, we formulate
exemplar selection as a multi-objective optimization problem, explicitly
targeting both the maximization of predictive accuracy and the minimization of
expected calibration error. We solve this problem with a sample-efficient
Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization algorithm (COM-BOM) to find the Pareto
front that optimally trades off the two objectives of accuracy and calibration.
We evaluate COM-BOM on multiple tasks from unsaturated MMLU-Pro benchmark and
find that COM-BOM beats or matches the baselines at jointly optimizing the two
objectives, while requiring a minimal number of LLM API calls.

### [333] [TOUCAN: Synthesizing 1.5M Tool-Agentic Data from Real-World MCP Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01179)
*Zhangchen Xu,Adriana Meza Soria,Shawn Tan,Anurag Roy,Ashish Sunil Agrawal,Radha Poovendran,Rameswar Panda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Toucan is the largest publicly available tool-agentic dataset (1.5M trajectories from ~500 real MCPs) for training LLM agents, emphasizing multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. It uses a multi-stage pipeline (query generation, quality filtering, agentic trajectory generation with three teachers and two frameworks, plus validation) and offers extension mechanisms to diversify tasks. Models trained on Toucan outperform larger closed-source baselines and push leading performance on MCP benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a paucity of high-quality, permissively licensed tool-agentic training data. Existing datasets lack diversity, realism, and complexity, especially for multi-tool usage and multi-turn interactions, hindering open-source progress in building capable LLM agents.

Method: Construct Toucan by (1) sourcing ~500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs); (2) generating a broad set of tool-use queries with five models; (3) applying model-based quality filtering; (4) creating agentic trajectories using three teacher models across two agentic frameworks; (5) applying rigorous rule-based and model-based validation; (6) adding three extension mechanisms to diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn conversations.

Result: Toucan yields 1.5 million trajectories and demonstrates that models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and achieve a stronger Pareto frontier on the MCP-Universe Bench.

Conclusion: Toucan substantially advances open-source tool-agentic data resources by providing a large, diverse, and realistic dataset with robust validation, enabling the development of more capable, multi-tool LLM agents and facilitating progress on established MCP benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are rapidly emerging as powerful systems
for automating tasks across domains. Yet progress in the open-source community
is constrained by the lack of high quality permissively licensed tool-agentic
training data. Existing datasets are often limited in diversity, realism, and
complexity, particularly regarding multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. To
address this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available
tool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized
from nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work,
Toucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and
challenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline
first produces a broad spectrum of tool-use queries using five distinct models,
applies model-based quality filtering, and then generates agentic trajectories
with three teacher models using two agentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and
model-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three
extension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn
conversations. Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source
counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and push the Pareto frontier forward on
MCP-Universe Bench.

### [334] [BroRL: Scaling Reinforcement Learning via Broadened Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01180)
*Jian Hu,Mingjie Liu,Ximing Lu,Fang Wu,Zaid Harchaoui,Shizhe Diao,Yejin Choi,Pavlo Molchanov,Jun Yang,Jan Kautz,Yi Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BroR—scaling RL by vastly increasing per-example rollouts yields continuous gains and overcomes ProRL's performance plateau by expanding exploration; theory (mass-balance) aligns with empirical improvements on 1.5B models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve scaling of RL for LLMs beyond training-step increases; explore whether exploration via more rollouts can sustain performance gains where ProRL saturates.

Method: Theoretical mass-balance analysis for token probability during one-step RL; show rollout tokens always contribute to correct-mass expansion; simulations under relaxed conditions; empirical training with high rollout counts; compare to ProRL on 1.5B models across benchmarks.

Result: Large rollout size N ensures dominated improvement from rollout tokens; increased probability mass for correct tokens; BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL steps; achieves state-of-the-art on 1.5B model across benchmarks; continuous improvements with no observed saturation.

Conclusion: Expanding exploration through high-rate rollouts is a viable dimension to scale RL for LLMs, complementing step-based scaling, and can prevent saturation while delivering robust gains; requires substantial compute but yields strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
ingredient for unlocking complex reasoning capabilities in large language
models. Recent work ProRL has shown promise in scaling RL by increasing the
number of training steps. However, performance plateaus after thousands of
steps, with clear diminishing returns from allocating more computation to
additional training. In this work, we investigate a complementary paradigm for
scaling RL, BroR-Lincreasing the number of rollouts per example to hundreds to
exhaustively Broaden exploration, which yields continuous performance gains
beyond the saturation point observed in ProRL when scaling the number of
training steps. Our approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis
allowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct
and incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process. We show that under a
one-step RL assumption, sampled rollout tokens always contribute to
correct-mass expansion, while unsampled tokens outside rollouts may lead to
gains or losses depending on their distribution and the net reward balance.
Importantly, as the number of rollouts per example N increases, the effect of
unsampled terms diminishes, ensuring overall correct-mass expansion. To
validate our theoretical analysis, we conduct simulations under more relaxed
conditions and find that a sufficiently large rollout size N-corresponding to
ample exploration-guarantees an increase in the probability mass of all correct
tokens. Empirically, BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training
steps and demonstrates robust, continuous improvement, achieving
state-of-the-art results for the 1.5B model across diverse benchmarks.

### [335] [Temporal Score Rescaling for Temperature Sampling in Diffusion and Flow Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01184)
*Yanbo Xu,Yu Wu,Sungjae Park,Zhizhuo Zhou,Shubham Tulsiani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple, model-agnostic method to steer sampling diversity in diffusion and flow-based models by rescaling their learned score functions to adjust a local sampling temperature, enabling sharper or broader distributions without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To control the fidelity-diversity trade-off in generative and predictive tasks by sampling from distributions that are sharper or flatter than the training data, without retraining or changing training procedures. This can improve task-specific performance across diverse domains.

Method: Rescale the learned score functions of noisy data distributions to adjust a local sampling temperature. This manipulation is applied to off-the-shelf diffusion and flow-matching models and works with both deterministic and stochastic samplers; no finetuning or training changes are required.

Result: Validated on toy 2D data and applied across five tasks (image generation, pose estimation, depth prediction, robot manipulation, protein design). The approach enables sampling from sharper or flatter distributions; depth prediction benefits from sharper sampling, image generation benefits from slightly flatter sampling, demonstrating task-dependent performance gains without retraining.

Conclusion: A simple, model-agnostic mechanism to control sampling diversity via local temperature rescaling of score functions, enabling improved task-specific performance across domains without modifying training or architecture.

Abstract: We present a mechanism to steer the sampling diversity of denoising diffusion
and flow matching models, allowing users to sample from a sharper or broader
distribution than the training distribution. We build on the observation that
these models leverage (learned) score functions of noisy data distributions for
sampling and show that rescaling these allows one to effectively control a
`local' sampling temperature. Notably, this approach does not require any
finetuning or alterations to training strategy, and can be applied to any
off-the-shelf model and is compatible with both deterministic and stochastic
samplers. We first validate our framework on toy 2D data, and then demonstrate
its application for diffusion models trained across five disparate tasks --
image generation, pose estimation, depth prediction, robot manipulation, and
protein design. We find that across these tasks, our approach allows sampling
from sharper (or flatter) distributions, yielding performance gains e.g., depth
prediction models benefit from sampling more likely depth estimates, whereas
image generation models perform better when sampling a slightly flatter
distribution. Project page: https://temporalscorerescaling.github.io

### [336] [Dirichlet-Prior Shaping: Guiding Expert Specialization in Upcycled MoEs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01185)
*Leyla Mirvakhabova,Babak Ehteshami Bejnordi,Gaurav Kumar,Hanxue Liang,Wanru Zhao,Paul Whatmough*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL) regularizes MoE routers to match a Dirichlet prior, improving expert balance and specialization when upcycling dense models into sparse MoEs; generalizable to any module generating categorical distributions; empirical gains on upcycled vision-language MoEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Upcycling dense models into sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) often yields poor expert specialization due to naive weight replication, low-confidence routing, and weak differentiation even with standard regularization; a router regularizer that actively shapes routing distributions and encodes inductive biases is needed.

Method: Introduce Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL), a regularization term that shapes router output probabilities to align with a target Dirichlet prior, providing fine-grained control over expert balance and specialization; can encode biases toward modalities or tasks; applicable to any module that outputs categorical probability distributions.

Result: DPSL consistently outperforms upcycling strategies and existing regularizers on vision-language benchmarks using upcycled MoEs with backbones like Qwen2, Phi3, and Llama3.2, by improving expert specialization and overall performance.

Conclusion: DPSL is a general, effective router regularizer for MoEs that can be applied beyond MoEs to any module producing categorical distributions, enabling controlled specialization and higher performance in upcycled models.

Abstract: Upcycling pre-trained dense models into sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs)
efficiently increases model capacity but often suffers from poor expert
specialization due to naive weight replication. Our analysis reveals that
upcycled MoEs, even with conventional regularization, exhibit low-confidence,
weakly differentiated routing, hindering performance. We introduce
Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL), a novel router regularization technique
that directly shapes routing probability distributions by matching expert
assignments to a target Dirichlet prior. DPSL offers fine-grained control over
expert balance and specialization, and enables encoding of inductive biases
such as encouraging experts to focus on specific modalities or tasks, without
requiring manual intervention; notably, DPSL is a general tool applicable to
any module that outputs categorical probability distributions, extending its
utility beyond MoE training. Experiments on upcycled MoE vision-language models
(with Qwen2, Phi3, Llama3.2 LLM backbones) show DPSL consistently outperforms
upcycling strategies and regularization techniques across standard
vision-language benchmarks, addressing the critical issue of poor
specialization and fostering more adaptive, higher-performing models.
