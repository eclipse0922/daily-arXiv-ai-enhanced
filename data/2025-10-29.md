*Aryan Mathur,Asaduddin Ahmed,Pushti Amit Vasoya,Simeon Kandan Sonar,Yasir Z,Madesh Kuppusamy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An explainable, efficient system combining a lightweight CNN and a vision-language model to detect, localize, and explain artifacts in low-res AI-generated images, achieving high accuracy and edge deployment viability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI-generated imagery becomes more realistic, verifying authenticity and providing explanations becomes harder, especially for small images. The work aims to enable interpretable detection via visual and linguistic reasoning on edge devices.

Method: Fuse a lightweight classifier 'Faster-Than-Lies' with Qwen2-VL-7B VLM to classify and localize artifacts in 32x32 images. Use autoencoder reconstruction error maps to generate artifact localization heatmaps. Group 70 artifact types into eight semantic categories and produce explainable text for detected anomalies.

Result: 96.5% accuracy on extended CiFAKE with adversarial perturbations; 175 ms inference on 8-core CPUs; suitable for local/edge deployment; interpretable heatmaps; text explanations for anomalies; supports cross-domain applications.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of combining visual and linguistic reasoning for interpretable authenticity detection in low-resolution imagery and suggests cross-domain uses in forensics, industrial inspection, and social media moderation.

Abstract: The increasing realism of AI-generated imagery poses challenges for verifying
visual authenticity. We present an explainable image authenticity detection
system that combines a lightweight convolutional classifier
("Faster-Than-Lies") with a Vision-Language Model (Qwen2-VL-7B) to classify,
localize, and explain artifacts in 32x32 images. Our model achieves 96.5%
accuracy on the extended CiFAKE dataset augmented with adversarial
perturbations and maintains an inference time of 175ms on 8-core CPUs, enabling
deployment on local or edge devices. Using autoencoder-based reconstruction
error maps, we generate artifact localization heatmaps, which enhance
interpretability for both humans and the VLM. We further categorize 70 visual
artifact types into eight semantic groups and demonstrate explainable text
generation for each detected anomaly. This work highlights the feasibility of
combining visual and linguistic reasoning for interpretable authenticity
detection in low-resolution imagery and outlines potential cross-domain
applications in forensics, industrial inspection, and social media moderation.

### [2] [CountFormer: A Transformer Framework for Learning Visual Repetition and Structure in Class-Agnostic Object Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23785)
*Md Tanvir Hossain,Akif Islam,Mohd Ruhul Ameen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountFormer adapts a CounTR-like transformer to use DINOv2 features and positional fusion for class-agnostic counting, achieving competitive results and improved accuracy on complex, densely packed scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans count by recognizing visual repetition and structural coherence; current counting models often miscount when objects have complex shapes, symmetry, or overlap. The work aims to emulate human-like structural perception in a general, exemplar-free counting framework.

Method: Replace CounTR's visual encoder with DINOv2 (self-supervised) to obtain richer, spatially consistent features; add positional embedding fusion to preserve geometry; use a lightweight convolutional decoder to map features to density maps; evaluate on FSC-147.

Result: The model achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods and shows superior accuracy on structurally intricate or densely packed scenes, indicating that foundation-model features help approach human-like counting.

Conclusion: Integrating foundation models such as DINOv2 enables more general, exemplar-free counting by emphasizing repetition and structural coherence, advancing toward human-like counting capabilities.

Abstract: Humans can effortlessly count diverse objects by perceiving visual repetition
and structural relationships rather than relying on class identity. However,
most existing counting models fail to replicate this ability; they often
miscount when objects exhibit complex shapes, internal symmetry, or overlapping
components. In this work, we introduce CountFormer, a transformer-based
framework that learns to recognize repetition and structural coherence for
class-agnostic object counting. Built upon the CounTR architecture, our model
replaces its visual encoder with the self-supervised foundation model DINOv2,
which produces richer and spatially consistent feature representations. We
further incorporate positional embedding fusion to preserve geometric
relationships before decoding these features into density maps through a
lightweight convolutional decoder. Evaluated on the FSC-147 dataset, our model
achieves performance comparable to current state-of-the-art methods while
demonstrating superior accuracy on structurally intricate or densely packed
scenes. Our findings indicate that integrating foundation models such as DINOv2
enables counting systems to approach human-like structural perception,
advancing toward a truly general and exemplar-free counting paradigm.

### [3] [A geometric and deep learning reproducible pipeline for monitoring floating anthropogenic debris in urban rivers using in situ cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23798)
*Gauthier Grimmer,Romain Wenger,Cl√©ment Flint,Germain Forestier,Gilles Rixhon,Valentin Chardon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fixed-camera deep learning pipeline for continuous river debris monitoring, with model comparison under complex conditions and a projective-geometry size estimation scheme; emphasizes dataset design and leakage handling for robust, low-cost automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Floating debris harms biodiversity, water quality, navigation, and recreation. Current monitoring is limited and costly; there is a need for continuous, automatic debris monitoring using inexpensive fixed cameras in urban aquatic environments.

Method: Deploy fixed, in-situ cameras to capture debris; evaluate multiple deep learning models for debris detection with attention to accuracy and inference speed under diverse environmental conditions; examine data leakage biases and dataset design, including negative images and temporal leakage; implement a geometric model using camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters to estimate actual object size from 2D detections; apply regression corrections to improve size estimates.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility of metric (size) estimation from image data via projective geometry with corrections; identifies the importance of dataset constitution, including negative samples and temporal leakage, and selects suitable models balancing accuracy and speed under varying conditions.

Conclusion: The framework supports robust, low-cost, automated debris monitoring in urban aquatic environments, enabling continuous quantification and sizing of floating debris with scalable deployment.

Abstract: The proliferation of floating anthropogenic debris in rivers has emerged as a
pressing environmental concern, exerting a detrimental influence on
biodiversity, water quality, and human activities such as navigation and
recreation. The present study proposes a novel methodological framework for the
monitoring the aforementioned waste, utilising fixed, in-situ cameras. This
study provides two key contributions: (i) the continuous quantification and
monitoring of floating debris using deep learning and (ii) the identification
of the most suitable deep learning model in terms of accuracy and inference
speed under complex environmental conditions. These models are tested in a
range of environmental conditions and learning configurations, including
experiments on biases related to data leakage. Furthermore, a geometric model
is implemented to estimate the actual size of detected objects from a 2D image.
This model takes advantage of both intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of
the camera. The findings of this study underscore the significance of the
dataset constitution protocol, particularly with respect to the integration of
negative images and the consideration of temporal leakage. In conclusion, the
feasibility of metric object estimation using projective geometry coupled with
regression corrections is demonstrated. This approach paves the way for the
development of robust, low-cost, automated monitoring systems for urban aquatic
environments.

### [4] [RareFlow: Physics-Aware Flow-Matching for Cross-Sensor Super-Resolution of Rare-Earth Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23816)
*Forouzan Fallah,Wenwen Li,Chia-Yu Hsu,Hyunho Lee,Yezhou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A physics-aware dual-conditioning SR framework (RareFlow) for remote sensing under out-of-distribution conditions, combining Gate ControlNet for geometry and text prompts for semantics, with spectral/radiometric losses and stochastic uncertainty, achieving near-ground-truth fidelity and ~40% FID reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SR in remote sensing under diverse sensors and rare geomorphic features suffers hallucinations; need physically plausible outputs and uncertainty estimation under domain shift; enable robust, data-scarce scientific imaging.

Method: Dual-conditioning network: Gate ControlNet preserves geometry from LR input; textual prompts guide semantic content. Multifold loss enforcing spectral/radiometric consistency with sensor properties. Stochastic forward passes to quantify predictive uncertainty; outputs variance identifies unfamiliar inputs.

Result: Expert blind evaluations rate outputs close to ground truth and surpass baselines; quantitative perceptual metrics improve; ~40% reduction in FID; validation on new multi-sensor satellite benchmark.

Conclusion: RareFlow provides robust, physics-aware SR under severe domain shift, enabling controlled generation and uncertainty quantification in data-scarce scientific domains.

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) for remote sensing imagery often fails under
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions, such as rare geomorphic features captured
by diverse sensors, producing visually plausible but physically inaccurate
results. We present RareFlow, a physics-aware SR framework designed for OOD
robustness. RareFlow's core is a dual-conditioning architecture. A Gated
ControlNet preserves fine-grained geometric fidelity from the low-resolution
input, while textual prompts provide semantic guidance for synthesizing complex
features. To ensure physically sound outputs, we introduce a multifaceted loss
function that enforces both spectral and radiometric consistency with sensor
properties. Furthermore, the framework quantifies its own predictive
uncertainty by employing a stochastic forward pass approach; the resulting
output variance directly identifies unfamiliar inputs, mitigating feature
hallucination. We validate RareFlow on a new, curated benchmark of multi-sensor
satellite imagery. In blind evaluations, geophysical experts rated our model's
outputs as approaching the fidelity of ground truth imagery, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. This qualitative superiority is
corroborated by quantitative gains in perceptual metrics, including a nearly
40\% reduction in FID. RareFlow provides a robust framework for high-fidelity
synthesis in data-scarce scientific domains and offers a new paradigm for
controlled generation under severe domain shift.

### [5] [TRELLISWorld: Training-Free World Generation from Object Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23880)
*Hanke Chen,Yuan Liu,Minchen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free, tile-based diffusion approach to language-driven 3D scene generation using 3D object priors as modular generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable, coherent 3D scene synthesis without scene-level datasets or retraining, addressing limitations of single-object generation and restricted viewability while supporting language-driven control.

Method: Partition the scene into overlapping 3D tiles and generate each tile independently with pre-trained text-to-3D object diffusion models acting as modular generators. Blend overlapping tiles via weighted averaging to ensure seamless transitions. No scene-level retraining is required; relies on general object priors and minimal heuristics to produce large, coherent scenes with 360-degree viewability and editable components.

Result: Demonstrates diverse scene layouts, efficient generation, and flexible editing. Produces scalable, coherent 3D scenes that preserve local semantics and support 360-degree viewability without scene-level training.

Conclusion: A simple yet powerful tile-based, training-free framework for general-purpose, language-driven 3D scene construction. It obviates scene-level datasets and retraining and provides a flexible foundation for future enhancements and broader applications.

Abstract: Text-driven 3D scene generation holds promise for a wide range of
applications, from virtual prototyping to AR/VR and simulation. However,
existing methods are often constrained to single-object generation, require
domain-specific training, or lack support for full 360-degree viewability. In
this work, we present a training-free approach to 3D scene synthesis by
repurposing general-purpose text-to-3D object diffusion models as modular tile
generators. We reformulate scene generation as a multi-tile denoising problem,
where overlapping 3D regions are independently generated and seamlessly blended
via weighted averaging. This enables scalable synthesis of large, coherent
scenes while preserving local semantic control. Our method eliminates the need
for scene-level datasets or retraining, relies on minimal heuristics, and
inherits the generalization capabilities of object-level priors. We demonstrate
that our approach supports diverse scene layouts, efficient generation, and
flexible editing, establishing a simple yet powerful foundation for
general-purpose, language-driven 3D scene construction.

### [6] [Improving Visual Discriminability of CLIP for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23894)
*Jinxin Zhou,Jiachen Jiang,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LHT-CLIP is a training-free framework that boosts CLIP-based semantic segmentation by rebalancing discriminability across layers, heads, and tokens, achieving state-of-the-art results without extra training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP's image-level pretraining aligns poorly with pixel-level dense prediction, and the final layers' emphasis on image-text alignment can degrade visual discriminability. The paper investigates internal CLIP representations to identify components that retain discriminability for segmentation.

Method: Three complementary techniques‚Äîsemantic-spatial reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement‚Äîare applied in a training-free manner based on analysis showing: (i) final layers emphasize image-text alignment at the expense of visual discriminability; (ii) a subset of attention heads consistently exhibit strong visual discriminability; (iii) abnormal tokens have sparse, consistent activation patterns. No additional training or external networks are used.

Result: Extensive experiments on 8 semantic segmentation benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenarios without any training or extra networks, demonstrating practicality for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: By exploiting intra-CLIP discriminability across layers, heads, and tokens, LHT-CLIP closes the gap between CLIP pretraining and dense segmentation tasks in a training-free manner, offering an effective and practical solution for real-world semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Extending CLIP models to semantic segmentation remains challenging due to the
misalignment between their image-level pre-training objectives and the
pixel-level visual understanding required for dense prediction. While prior
efforts have achieved encouraging results by reorganizing the final layer and
features, they often inherit the global alignment bias of preceding layers,
leading to suboptimal segmentation performance. In this work, we propose
LHT-CLIP, a novel training-free framework that systematically exploits the
visual discriminability of CLIP across layer, head, and token levels. Through
comprehensive analysis, we reveal three key insights: (i) the final layers
primarily strengthen image-text alignment with sacrifice of visual
discriminability (e.g., last 3 layers in ViT-B/16 and 8 layers in ViT-L/14),
partly due to the emergence of anomalous tokens; (ii) a subset of attention
heads (e.g., 10 out of 144 in ViT-B/16) display consistently strong visual
discriminability across datasets; (iii) abnormal tokens display sparse and
consistent activation pattern compared to normal tokens. Based on these
findings, we propose three complementary techniques: semantic-spatial
reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement to
effectively restore visual discriminability and improve segmentation
performance without any additional training, auxiliary pre-trained networks, or
extensive hyperparameter tuning. Extensive experiments on 8 common semantic
segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that LHT-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance across diverse scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and
practicality for real-world deployment.

### [7] [DynaStride: Dynamic Stride Windowing with MMCoT for Instructional Multi-Scene Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23907)
*Eddison Pham,Prisha Priyadarshini,Adrian Maliackel,Kanishk Bandi,Cristian Meo,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynaStride yields coherent scene-level captions for instructional videos without manual scene segmentation, via adaptive sampling, multimodal reasoning, and dynamic stride fusion, and outperforms strong baselines on BLEU, METEOR, BERTScore, and CLIPScore.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Captions that miss temporal structure can hinder learning; there is a need to align visual cues with textual guidance to support procedural learning and multimodal reasoning in instructional videos.

Method: The pipeline leverages YouCookII scene annotations to perform adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing to capture key scene transitions, uses a multimodal chain-of-thought to generate multiple action-object pairs, refines and fuses these with a dynamic stride window selection algorithm that balances temporal context and redundancy, and produces a final scene-level caption integrating visual semantics and temporal reasoning.

Result: Empirical evaluations against strong baselines (e.g., VLLaMA3 and GPT-4o) show consistent gains on BLEU, METEOR, BERTScore, and CLIPScore; qualitative analyses indicate improved temporal coherence and informativeness of the captions.

Conclusion: DynaStride is a promising direction for AI-powered instructional content generation, enabling coherent scene-level captions without manual segmentation and better aligning visuals with textual guidance for instructional learning.

Abstract: Scene-level captioning in instructional videos can enhance learning by
requiring an understanding of both visual cues and temporal structure. By
aligning visual cues with textual guidance, this understanding supports
procedural learning and multimodal reasoning, providing a richer context for
skill acquisition. However, captions that fail to capture this structure may
lack coherence and quality, which can create confusion and undermine the
video's educational intent. To address this gap, we introduce DynaStride, a
pipeline to generate coherent, scene-level captions without requiring manual
scene segmentation. Using the YouCookII dataset's scene annotations, DynaStride
performs adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing to capture key
transitions within each scene. It then employs a multimodal chain-of-thought
process to produce multiple action-object pairs, which are refined and fused
using a dynamic stride window selection algorithm that adaptively balances
temporal context and redundancy. The final scene-level caption integrates
visual semantics and temporal reasoning in a single instructional caption.
Empirical evaluations against strong baselines, including VLLaMA3 and GPT-4o,
demonstrate consistent gains on both N-gram-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR) and
semantic similarity measures (BERTScore, CLIPScore). Qualitative analyses
further show that DynaStride produces captions that are more temporally
coherent and informative, suggesting a promising direction for improving
AI-powered instructional content generation.

### [8] [TurboPortrait3D: Single-step diffusion-based fast portrait novel-view synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23929)
*Emily Kim,Julieta Martinez,Timur Bagautdinov,Jessica Hodgins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TurboPortrait3D blends an image-to-3D avatar pipeline with a single-step image-space diffusion refinement to produce low-latency, multi-view-consistent portrait renders, trained with synthetic pretraining and real-image fine-tuning, claiming state-of-the-art quality and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing image-to-3D portrait methods suffer from artifacts, detail loss, and identity drift; diffusion models offer high-quality outputs but are expensive and not inherently 3D-consistent. A hybrid approach aims to combine 3D grounding with diffusion-based refinement to achieve better quality, identity preservation, and low latency.

Method: Generate an initial 3D representation and noisy renders from a single frontal image using a feedforward image-to-avatar pipeline. Refine these renders with a single-step, view-conditioned diffusion model trained to enforce multi-view consistency and realism. Training strategy: pre-train on synthetic multi-view data, then fine-tune on high-quality real images. Output is a refined, multi-view-consistent 3D portrait with low latency.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative improvements over current state-of-the-art in portrait novel-view synthesis. Demonstrates better detail, identity preservation, and consistency, with efficient runtime suited for practical use.

Conclusion: A practical, efficient framework for 3D-aware portrait synthesis that leverages diffusion-based refinement to enhance image-to-3D outputs, achieving superior quality and 3D consistency while maintaining low latency.

Abstract: We introduce TurboPortrait3D: a method for low-latency novel-view synthesis
of human portraits. Our approach builds on the observation that existing
image-to-3D models for portrait generation, while capable of producing
renderable 3D representations, are prone to visual artifacts, often lack of
detail, and tend to fail at fully preserving the identity of the subject. On
the other hand, image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images,
but besides being computationally expensive, are not grounded in 3D and thus
are not directly capable of producing multi-view consistent outputs. In this
work, we demonstrate that image-space diffusion models can be used to
significantly enhance the quality of existing image-to-avatar methods, while
maintaining 3D-awareness and running with low-latency. Our method takes a
single frontal image of a subject as input, and applies a feedforward
image-to-avatar generation pipeline to obtain an initial 3D representation and
corresponding noisy renders. These noisy renders are then fed to a single-step
diffusion model which is conditioned on input image(s), and is specifically
trained to refine the renders in a multi-view consistent way. Moreover, we
introduce a novel effective training strategy that includes pre-training on a
large corpus of synthetic multi-view data, followed by fine-tuning on
high-quality real images. We demonstrate that our approach both qualitatively
and quantitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art for portrait novel-view
synthesis, while being efficient in time.

### [9] [PlanarGS: High-Fidelity Indoor 3D Gaussian Splatting Guided by Vision-Language Planar Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23930)
*Xirui Jin,Renbiao Jin,Boying Li,Danping Zou,Wenxian Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PlanarGS enhances 3D Gaussian Splatting for indoor scenes by injecting language-guided planar priors and geometric cues, yielding accurate, high-detail surfaces and large gains over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photometric loss in 3D Gaussian Splatting struggles in large, low-texture indoor regions, producing ambiguous geometry; there is a need for explicit priors to guide surface reconstruction.

Method: Introduce LP3 (Language-Prompted Planar Priors) using a pretrained vision-language segmentation model to propose planar regions, refined via cross-view fusion and geometric priors. Optimize 3D Gaussians with two additional supervision terms: planar prior supervision enforcing planar consistency, and geometric prior supervision aligning depth and normals with the Gaussians.

Result: Extensive experiments on standard indoor benchmarks show PlanarGS reconstructs accurate and detailed 3D surfaces and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

Conclusion: PlanarGS demonstrates that incorporating planar priors and geometric cues into 3D Gaussian Splatting is effective for indoor scene reconstruction, suggesting a promising direction for integrating high-level priors into neural implicit representations.

Abstract: Three-dimensional Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an
efficient representation for novel-view synthesis, achieving impressive visual
quality. However, in scenes dominated by large and low-texture regions, common
in indoor environments, the photometric loss used to optimize 3DGS yields
ambiguous geometry and fails to recover high-fidelity 3D surfaces. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce PlanarGS, a 3DGS-based framework tailored for
indoor scene reconstruction. Specifically, we design a pipeline for
Language-Prompted Planar Priors (LP3) that employs a pretrained vision-language
segmentation model and refines its region proposals via cross-view fusion and
inspection with geometric priors. 3D Gaussians in our framework are optimized
with two additional terms: a planar prior supervision term that enforces planar
consistency, and a geometric prior supervision term that steers the Gaussians
toward the depth and normal cues. We have conducted extensive experiments on
standard indoor benchmarks. The results show that PlanarGS reconstructs
accurate and detailed 3D surfaces, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by a large margin. Project page: https://planargs.github.io

### [10] [Adaptive Training of INRs via Pruning and Densification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23943)
*Diana Aldana,Jo√£o Paulo Lima,Daniel Csillag,Daniel Perazzo,Haoan Feng,Luiz Velho,Tiago Novello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIRe is an adaptive training scheme for implicit neural representations (INRs) that prunes neurons and densifies input frequencies during training to reduce model size while maintaining or improving reconstruction quality in low-dimensional signal modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: INRs for encoding coordinates suffer from redundancy in parameters and a need to hand-tune input frequencies and architectures; current approaches rely on heuristics and expensive hyperparameter optimization. An adaptive method could automatically balance model size and expressiveness.

Method: AIRe uses a two-stage adaptive training process: (1) pruning stage identifies less-contributory neurons and applies targeted weight decay to transfer their information to remaining neurons, followed by structured pruning to remove redundancies; (2) densification stage adds input frequencies to spectrum regions where the signal underfits, expanding the representational basis. The scheme refines the INR architecture during optimization to optimize the size-quality trade-off.

Result: Experiments on images and signed distance functions (SDFs) show AIRe reduces model size while preserving or improving reconstruction quality compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Adaptive pruning and input frequency densification during training yield more efficient INRs, achieving a better size-to-quality trade-off; code and pretrained models are planned for release.

Abstract: Encoding input coordinates with sinusoidal functions into multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) has proven effective for implicit neural representations
(INRs) of low-dimensional signals, enabling the modeling of high-frequency
details. However, selecting appropriate input frequencies and architectures
while managing parameter redundancy remains an open challenge, often addressed
through heuristics and heavy hyperparameter optimization schemes. In this
paper, we introduce AIRe ($\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{I}$mplicit neural
$\textbf{Re}$presentation), an adaptive training scheme that refines the INR
architecture over the course of optimization. Our method uses a neuron pruning
mechanism to avoid redundancy and input frequency densification to improve
representation capacity, leading to an improved trade-off between network size
and reconstruction quality. For pruning, we first identify less-contributory
neurons and apply a targeted weight decay to transfer their information to the
remaining neurons, followed by structured pruning. Next, the densification
stage adds input frequencies to spectrum regions where the signal underfits,
expanding the representational basis. Through experiments on images and SDFs,
we show that AIRe reduces model size while preserving, or even improving,
reconstruction quality. Code and pretrained models will be released for public
use.

### [11] [Neural USD: An object-centric framework for iterative editing and control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23956)
*Alejandro Escontrela,Shrinu Kushagra,Sjoerd van Steenkiste,Yulia Rubanova,Aleksander Holynski,Kelsey Allen,Kevin Murphy,Thomas Kipf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neural USD introduces a structured, USD-inspired scene descriptor for per-object editing in generative models, enabling disentangled control over appearance, geometry, and pose via fine-tuning, supporting iterative workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address imprecise editing and unintended global changes when conditioning generative models, and to enable fine-grained, per-object control in a flexible, hierarchical representation.

Method: Propose Neural USD: a hierarchical, object-centric scene representation inspired by USD; supports diverse conditioning signals; aims to minimize model-specific constraints; implement fine-tuning to disentangle control signals across appearance, geometry, and pose; evaluate design choices and demonstrate iterative, incremental editing workflows.

Result: Through design considerations and experiments, the approach demonstrates that Neural USD can support iterative, per-object editing workflows with disentangled controls, enabling more precise edits without widespread unintended changes.

Conclusion: Neural USD provides a practical framework for structured, per-object controllable generation, combining a USD-like scene graph with targeted fine-tuning to disentangle controls, facilitating iterative editing pipelines.

Abstract: Amazing progress has been made in controllable generative modeling,
especially over the last few years. However, some challenges remain. One of
them is precise and iterative object editing. In many of the current methods,
trying to edit the generated image (for example, changing the color of a
particular object in the scene or changing the background while keeping other
elements unchanged) by changing the conditioning signals often leads to
unintended global changes in the scene. In this work, we take the first steps
to address the above challenges. Taking inspiration from the Universal Scene
Descriptor (USD) standard developed in the computer graphics community, we
introduce the "Neural Universal Scene Descriptor" or Neural USD. In this
framework, we represent scenes and objects in a structured, hierarchical
manner. This accommodates diverse signals, minimizes model-specific
constraints, and enables per-object control over appearance, geometry, and
pose. We further apply a fine-tuning approach which ensures that the above
control signals are disentangled from one another. We evaluate several design
considerations for our framework, demonstrating how Neural USD enables
iterative and incremental workflows. More information at:

### [12] [SafeVision: Efficient Image Guardrail with Robust Policy Adherence and Explainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23960)
*Peiyang Xu,Minzhou Pan,Zhaorun Chen,Shuang Yang,Chaowei Xiao,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafeVision is a dynamic, policy-aligned image guardrail with explainable reasoning and a high-quality harm dataset; it avoids retraining, adapts to new threats, and outperforms baseline models while being faster.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current guardrails rely on static features and predefined categories, leading to misclassification and poor adaptability to emerging threats; need for transparency and policy-driven adaptability without retraining.

Method: Data collection/generation framework, policy-following training pipeline, customized loss, diverse QA generation/training strategy, and inference-time policy alignment; introduces VisionHarm-T and VisionHarm-C datasets; performance evaluations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on VisionHarm benchmarks; outperforms GPT-4o by 8.6% (VisionHarm-T) and 15.5% (VisionHarm-C) and is over 16x faster.

Conclusion: SafeVision provides a comprehensive, explainable, policy-following image guardrail that dynamically adapts to evolving threats without retraining.

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of digital media, the need for efficient and
transparent safeguards against unsafe content is more critical than ever.
Traditional image guardrail models, constrained by predefined categories, often
misclassify content due to their pure feature-based learning without semantic
reasoning. Moreover, these models struggle to adapt to emerging threats,
requiring costly retraining for new threats. To address these limitations, we
introduce SafeVision, a novel image guardrail that integrates human-like
reasoning to enhance adaptability and transparency. Our approach incorporates
an effective data collection and generation framework, a policy-following
training pipeline, and a customized loss function. We also propose a diverse QA
generation and training strategy to enhance learning effectiveness. SafeVision
dynamically aligns with evolving safety policies at inference time, eliminating
the need for retraining while ensuring precise risk assessments and
explanations. Recognizing the limitations of existing unsafe image benchmarks,
which either lack granularity or cover limited risks, we introduce VisionHarm,
a high-quality dataset comprising two subsets: VisionHarm Third-party
(VisionHarm-T) and VisionHarm Comprehensive(VisionHarm-C), spanning diverse
harmful categories. Through extensive experiments, we show that SafeVision
achieves state-of-the-art performance on different benchmarks. SafeVision
outperforms GPT-4o by 8.6% on VisionHarm-T and by 15.5% on VisionHarm-C, while
being over 16x faster. SafeVision sets a comprehensive, policy-following, and
explainable image guardrail with dynamic adaptation to emerging threats.

Motivation: Address opacity and lack of stepwise reasoning in medical VLMs. Provide transparent, auditable reasoning aligned with radiologist workflow to improve trust, safety, and human-AI collaboration.

Method: Two-stage training: (1) reasoning-style supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to encode expert-like reasoning, and (2) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards over a defined list of X-ray abnormalities. The model performs high-fidelity visual encoding and outputs chain-of-thought style reasoning traces that reflect radiologists' systematic approach, uncertainty, and differential diagnoses.

Result: In-distribution multi-label classification is competitive; interpretability and auditability improved. A reader study with expert radiologists showed full reasoning traces increased confidence, aided error auditing, and reduced time to finalize reports.

Conclusion: NV-Reason-CXR-3B released to support explainable AI in chest radiography; demonstrates that reasoning quality complements prediction quality and can extend to other medical imaging tasks where explainability and auditability are crucial.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong promise for medical image
analysis, but most remain opaque, offering predictions without the transparent,
stepwise reasoning clinicians rely on. We present a framework that brings
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by
reasoning-first training paradigms, our approach is designed to learn how
experts reason, not just what they conclude, by aligning intermediate steps
with observable image evidence and radiology workflow. Beyond accuracy, the
explicit reasoning traces support clinical auditability: they reveal why a
conclusion was reached, which alternatives were considered, and where
uncertainty remains, enabling quality assurance, error analysis, and safer
human-AI collaboration.
  Our model couples high-fidelity visual encoding with a two-stage training
recipe: a reasoning-style supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by
reinforcement learning (RL) that uses verifiable rewards over a list of X-ray
abnormalities. The model outputs reasoning that mirrors radiologists systematic
thought process, uncertainty, and differential diagnosis. In
out-of-distribution evaluation, the approach achieves competitive multi-label
classification while improving interpretability. In a reader study with expert
radiologists, full reasoning traces increased confidence, supported error
auditing, and reduced time to finalize reports. We release code and the model
NV-Reason-CXR-3B to support community progress toward trustworthy, explainable
AI in chest radiography and other medical imaging tasks where reasoning quality
is as critical as prediction quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Jointly predicting multiple Fourier components for CQ-controllable arbitrary-scale SR improves quality and efficiency over independent predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The CQ controllability problem in arbitrary-scale super-resolution is important, but existing RNN-based methods that predict Fourier components one by one suffer performance degradation and inefficiency due to independent predictions.

Method: Predict multiple Fourier components jointly rather than predicting them sequentially.

Result: The approach aims to improve both reconstruction quality and computational efficiency by joint prediction of components.

Conclusion: Jointly predicting multiple Fourier components is a promising approach to enhance cost-and-quality controllability in arbitrary-scale super-resolution.

Abstract: Cost-and-Quality (CQ) controllability in arbitrary-scale super-resolution is
crucial. Existing methods predict Fourier components one by one using a
recurrent neural network. However, this approach leads to performance
degradation and inefficiency due to independent prediction. This paper proposes
predicting multiple components jointly to improve both quality and efficiency.

*Jiaqi Yan,Ruilong Ren,Jingren Liu,Shuning Xu,Ling Wang,Yiheng Wang,Yun Wang,Long Zhang,Xiangyu Chen,Changzhi Sun,Jixiang Luo,Dell Zhang,Hao Sun,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TeleEgo introduces a long-duration, streaming, omni-modal benchmark for egocentric AI assistants, featuring 14 hours per participant of synchronized video, audio, and text across four real-world domains, with 12 diagnostic subtasks and 3,291 QA items evaluated in a streaming setting. Two metrics, Real-Time Accuracy and Memory Persistence Time, measure correctness, responsiveness, and long-term retention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks evaluate egocentric AI components in isolation and lack realistic streaming, long-term memory integration in daily-life contexts; there is a need for a unified benchmark that tests memory, understanding, and cross-memory reasoning over extended periods.

Method: Data collection of long-duration egocentric multimodal recordings with human-refined visual narrations and transcripts; alignment on a global timeline; formulation of 12 diagnostic subtasks across Memory, Understanding, and Cross-Memory Reasoning; generation of 3,291 QA items in multiple formats; development of two streaming-oriented evaluation metrics (Real-Time Accuracy, Memory Persistence Time).

Result: Proposes TeleEgo dataset and evaluation protocol for egocentric AI in streaming settings; introduces 12 subtasks and 3,291 QA items; defines Real-Time Accuracy and Memory Persistence Time metrics; no experimental results reported in abstract.

Conclusion: TeleEgo offers a realistic, comprehensive benchmark to drive development of practical egocentric AI assistants capable of multi-modal processing, real-time response, and long-term memory integration in everyday contexts.

Abstract: Egocentric AI assistants in real-world settings must process multi-modal
inputs (video, audio, text), respond in real time, and retain evolving
long-term memory. However, existing benchmarks typically evaluate these
abilities in isolation, lack realistic streaming scenarios, or support only
short-term tasks. We introduce \textbf{TeleEgo}, a long-duration, streaming,
omni-modal benchmark for evaluating egocentric AI assistants in realistic daily
contexts. The dataset features over 14 hours per participant of synchronized
egocentric video, audio, and text across four domains: work \& study, lifestyle
\& routines, social activities, and outings \& culture. All data is aligned on
a unified global timeline and includes high-quality visual narrations and
speech transcripts, curated through human refinement.TeleEgo defines 12
diagnostic subtasks across three core capabilities: Memory (recalling past
events), Understanding (interpreting the current moment), and Cross-Memory
Reasoning (linking distant events). It contains 3,291 human-verified QA items
spanning multiple question formats (single-choice, binary, multi-choice, and
open-ended), evaluated strictly in a streaming setting. We propose two key
metrics -- Real-Time Accuracy and Memory Persistence Time -- to jointly assess
correctness, temporal responsiveness, and long-term retention. TeleEgo provides
a realistic and comprehensive evaluation to advance the development of
practical AI assistants.

*Heethanjan Kanagalingam,Thenukan Pathmanathan,Mokeeshan Vathanakumar,Tharmakulasingam Mukunthan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdvBlur uses adversarial blur augmentation and a dual-loss objective to improve domain generalization in diabetic retinopathy (DR) classification, achieving competitive performance on unseen external datasets and demonstrating robustness across varied imaging conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DR DL models struggle with distributional shifts due to device differences, demographics, and imaging conditions; robust generalization to unseen data is required for reliable DR screening.

Method: Inject adversarially blurred images into the training dataset and optimize with a dual-loss framework to enhance cross-domain generalization.

Result: Demonstrates mitigation of unseen distributional variations and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art domain-generalization DR models on external datasets; supported by ablation studies on blur, loss functions, camera types, image quality, and dataset size.

Conclusion: AdvBlur is an effective approach for robust DR classification under distribution shifts, validated by comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and ablation studies.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, yet
early and accurate detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes.
While numerous Deep learning (DL) models have been developed to predict DR from
fundus images, many face challenges in maintaining robustness due to
distributional variations caused by differences in acquisition devices,
demographic disparities, and imaging conditions. This paper addresses this
critical limitation by proposing a novel DR classification approach, a method
called AdvBlur. Our method integrates adversarial blurred images into the
dataset and employs a dual-loss function framework to address domain
generalization. This approach effectively mitigates the impact of unseen
distributional variations, as evidenced by comprehensive evaluations across
multiple datasets. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to explore
the effects of factors such as camera type, low-quality images, and dataset
size. Furthermore, we perform ablation studies on blurred images and the loss
function to ensure the validity of our choices. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization DR models on
unseen external datasets.

TL;DR: Mars-Bench is the first standardized benchmark for Mars ML tasks, featuring 20 datasets across classification, segmentation, and object detection; baseline results suggest Mars-specific foundation models may outperform general-domain models; data, models, and code are available at mars-bench.github.io.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standardized benchmarks for Mars science, which hampers progress in developing foundation models and enabling systematic evaluation across Mars-related tasks.

Method: Assemble 20 datasets spanning orbital and surface imagery focused on key geologic features (craters, cones, boulders, frost); provide ready-to-use datasets and baselines using models pre-trained on natural images, Earth satellite data, and vision-language models.

Result: Initial analyses indicate Mars-specific foundation models may offer advantages over general-domain counterparts, highlighting the value of domain-adapted pre-training.

Conclusion: Mars-Bench provides a standardized platform for developing and comparing ML models for Mars science and encourages domain-specific pre-training; data, models, and code are publicly available at the project site.

Abstract: Foundation models have enabled rapid progress across many specialized domains
by leveraging large-scale pre-training on unlabeled data, demonstrating strong
generalization to a variety of downstream tasks. While such models have gained
significant attention in fields like Earth Observation, their application to
Mars science remains limited. A key enabler of progress in other domains has
been the availability of standardized benchmarks that support systematic
evaluation. In contrast, Mars science lacks such benchmarks and standardized
evaluation frameworks, which have limited progress toward developing foundation
models for Martian tasks. To address this gap, we introduce Mars-Bench, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate models across a broad range
of Mars-related tasks using both orbital and surface imagery. Mars-Bench
comprises 20 datasets spanning classification, segmentation, and object
detection, focused on key geologic features such as craters, cones, boulders,
and frost. We provide standardized, ready-to-use datasets and baseline
evaluations using models pre-trained on natural images, Earth satellite data,
and state-of-the-art vision-language models. Results from all analyses suggest
that Mars-specific foundation models may offer advantages over general-domain
counterparts, motivating further exploration of domain-adapted pre-training.

### [19] [AutoPrompt: Automated Red-Teaming of Text-to-Image Models via LLM-Driven Adversarial Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24034)
*Yufan Liu,Wanqian Zhang,Huashan Chen,Lin Wang,Xiaojun Jia,Zheng Lin,Weiping Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces APT, a black-box red-teaming framework that uses LLMs to craft human-readable adversarial suffixes for benign prompts, bypassing safety filters through dual-evasion (perplexity-based constraint and banned-token penalties) and alternating optimization/LLM fine-tuning; shows strong red-teaming performance and cross-model transferability, including to commercial APIs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current safety testing of text-to-image models relies on white-box access or prompts that are semantically meaningless and easily blocked by filters. There is a need for scalable, black-box red-teaming that yields human-readable adversarial prompts and transfers across models.

Method: An alternating optimization-finetuning pipeline between adversarial suffix optimization and fine-tuning the LLM with the optimized suffix. A dual-evasion strategy: (1) constrain the LLM via an auxiliary perplexity scoring to keep prompts human-readable (avoiding gibberish); (2) apply banned-token penalties to suppress explicit generation of blacklist terms. Operates in a black-box setting and evaluates transferability across unseen prompts and models.

Result: Experiments show that the proposed prompts are highly effective at red-teaming, remain human-readable and resistant to filters, and transfer zero-shot to unseen prompts and models, exposing vulnerabilities even in commercial APIs (e.g., Leonardo.Ai).

Conclusion: APT provides a practical black-box red-teaming framework for T2I safety evaluation using LLM-generated adversarial suffixes. It highlights the security risks of current API ecosystems and suggests directions for more robust defenses and improved filtering.

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, their safety
mechanisms are vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which maliciously generate
unsafe images. Current red-teaming methods for proactively assessing such
vulnerabilities usually require white-box access to T2I models, and rely on
inefficient per-prompt optimization, as well as inevitably generate
semantically meaningless prompts easily blocked by filters. In this paper, we
propose APT (AutoPrompT), a black-box framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to automatically generate human-readable adversarial suffixes for
benign prompts. We first introduce an alternating optimization-finetuning
pipeline between adversarial suffix optimization and fine-tuning the LLM
utilizing the optimized suffix. Furthermore, we integrates a dual-evasion
strategy in optimization phase, enabling the bypass of both perplexity-based
filter and blacklist word filter: (1) we constrain the LLM generating
human-readable prompts through an auxiliary LLM perplexity scoring, which
starkly contrasts with prior token-level gibberish, and (2) we also introduce
banned-token penalties to suppress the explicit generation of banned-tokens in
blacklist. Extensive experiments demonstrate the excellent red-teaming
performance of our human-readable, filter-resistant adversarial prompts, as
well as superior zero-shot transferability which enables instant adaptation to
unseen prompts and exposes critical vulnerabilities even in commercial APIs
(e.g., Leonardo.Ai.).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Residual Networks enable training of very deep CNNs by using skip connections, achieving higher accuracy and faster, more stable training on CIFAR-10 (ResNet-18 at 89.9% vs 84.1% for a comparable-depth baseline).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the vanishing/exploding gradient problem that makes training very deep CNNs difficult, aiming to train networks with hundreds of layers.

Method: Introduce residual blocks with identity-based skip connections (ResNet); implement ResNet-18 and evaluate on CIFAR-10, comparing against a traditional deep CNN of similar depth.

Result: On CIFAR-10, ResNet-18 achieves 89.9% accuracy, outperforming a traditional deep CNN of similar depth which achieves 84.1%; training converges faster and more stably.

Conclusion: Skip connections enable training of substantially deeper networks and yield better performance and training dynamics on standard vision benchmarks.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has revolutionized computer vision, but
training very deep networks has been challenging due to the vanishing gradient
problem. This paper explores Residual Networks (ResNet), introduced by He et
al. (2015), which overcomes this limitation by using skip connections. ResNet
enables the training of networks with hundreds of layers by allowing gradients
to flow directly through shortcut connections that bypass intermediate layers.
In our implementation on the CIFAR-10 dataset, ResNet-18 achieves 89.9%
accuracy compared to 84.1% for a traditional deep CNN of similar depth, while
also converging faster and training more stably.

### [21] [Kernelized Sparse Fine-Tuning with Bi-level Parameter Competition for Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24037)
*Shufan Shen,Junshu Sun,Shuhui Wang,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SNELLA is a one-stage, memory-efficient sparse fine-tuning method for vision models that merges weight updates into a sparse matrix via low-rank learnable components and nonlinear kernels, with adaptive bi-level sparsity to locate task-relevant weights; achieves state-of-the-art results with substantial memory savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two-stage sparse tuning methods overlook parameter updates during fine-tuning and incur high memory usage due to storing full-precision optimizer state and weight matrices. There is a need for an end-to-end, memory-efficient one-stage approach that accounts for parameter updates and efficiently locates task-relevant weights.

Method: 1) Memory-efficient update: merge the target weight matrix with another sparse matrix formed by two low-rank learnable matrices, extended by nonlinear kernel functions to increase rank and reduce interdependency among updates. 2) Adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation: end-to-end mechanism that allows weights to compete across and within layers based on importance scores to locate task-relevant weights.

Result: Extensive experiments across classification, segmentation, and generation on various pre-trained vision models show SNELLA achieves state-of-the-art performance with lower memory usage. It achieves a 1.8% absolute Top-1 accuracy gain on FGVC benchmark compared to SPT-LoRA (91.9% vs 90.1%). Relative to prior methods, SNELLA reduces memory by 31.1%-39.9% across models ranging from 86M to 632M parameters.

Conclusion: SNELLA provides a competitive, memory-efficient one-stage alternative to existing PEFT methods, delivering higher accuracy with significantly reduced memory. Source code is available at the provided GitHub URL.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) aims to adapt pre-trained vision
models to downstream tasks. Among PEFT paradigms, sparse tuning achieves
remarkable performance by adjusting only the weights most relevant to
downstream tasks, rather than densely tuning the entire weight matrix. Current
methods follow a two-stage paradigm. First, it locates task-relevant weights by
gradient information, which overlooks the parameter adjustments during
fine-tuning and limits the performance. Second, it updates only the located
weights by applying a sparse mask to the gradient of the weight matrix, which
results in high memory usage due to the storage of all weight matrices in the
optimizer. In this paper, we propose a one-stage method named SNELLA to
overcome the above limitations. For memory usage, SNELLA selectively updates
the weight matrix by adding it to another sparse matrix that is merged by two
low-rank learnable matrices. We extend the low-rank decomposition by
introducing nonlinear kernel functions, thereby increasing the rank of the
resulting merged matrix to prevent the interdependency among weight updates,
enabling better adaptation to downstream tasks. For locating task-relevant
weights, we propose an adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation mechanism that
encourages weights to compete across and inside layers based on their
importance scores in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted
on classification, segmentation, and generation tasks using different
pre-trained vision models. The results show that SNELLA achieves SOTA
performance with low memory usage. Notably, SNELLA obtains 1.8% (91.9% v.s.
90.1%) higher Top-1 accuracy on the FGVC benchmark compared to SPT-LoRA.
Compared to previous methods, SNELLA achieves a memory reduction of 31.1%-39.9%
across models with parameter scales from 86M to 632M. Our source codes are

### [22] [Enhancing CLIP Robustness via Cross-Modality Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24038)
*Xingyu Zhu,Beier Zhu,Shuo Wang,Kesen Zhao,Hanwang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COLA is a training-free, optimal transport‚Äìbased cross-modal alignment framework that defends CLIP-style models against adversarial perturbations by projecting image embeddings into a class-text subspace and refining image-text alignment via OT, achieving notable robustness with minimal clean-accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models like CLIP generalize well in zero-shot settings but suffer from a misalignment between image and text features that worsens under adversarial perturbations, causing severe performance degradation.

Method: 1) Project adversarial image embeddings onto a subspace spanned by class text features to filter non-semantic distortions while preserving discriminative information. 2) Model images and texts as discrete distributions over multiple augmented views and refine their alignment via optimal transport (OT), with the subspace projection integrated into the OT cost. The approach is training-free and compatible with existing fine-tuned models.

Result: Extensive evaluations over 14 zero-shot benchmarks show COLA provides an average improvement of 6.7% on ImageNet and variants under PGD adversarial attacks, while maintaining high accuracy on clean samples.

Conclusion: COLA delivers stable cross-modal alignment under adversarial conditions by combining subspace filtering with OT-based alignment, offering robustness without retraining and be readily plugged into existing models.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong generalization
in zero-shot classification but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations. Existing methods primarily focus on adversarial fine-tuning or
prompt optimization; they often overlook the gaps in CLIP's encoded features,
which is shown as the text and image features lie far apart from each other.
This misalignment is significantly amplified under adversarial perturbations,
leading to severe degradation in classification performance. To address this
problem, we propose Cross-modality Alignment, dubbed COLA, an optimal
transport-based framework that explicitly addresses adversarial misalignment by
restoring both global image-text alignment and local structural consistency in
the feature space. (1) COLA first projects adversarial image embeddings onto a
subspace spanned by class text features, effectively filtering out non-semantic
distortions while preserving discriminative information. (2) It then models
images and texts as discrete distributions over multiple augmented views and
refines their alignment via OT, with the subspace projection seamlessly
integrated into the cost computation. This design ensures stable cross-modal
alignment even under adversarial conditions. COLA is training-free and
compatible with existing fine-tuned models. Extensive evaluations across 14
zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of COLA,
especially with an average improvement of 6.7% on ImageNet and its variants
under PGD adversarial attacks, while maintaining high accuracy on clean
samples.

*William Yang,Xindi Wu,Zhiwei Deng,Esin Tureci,Olga Russakovsky*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fine-tuning strategy (BOB) for text-to-image models that uses class-agnostic attribute conditioning during fine-tuning and marginalization during generation to improve low-shot fine-grained classification by producing more diverse, less overfit synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge of creating effective synthetic training data for fine-grained classification when only a few real examples are available, where naive fine-tuning can cause overfitting and loss of diversity.

Method: From a small real set, extract class-agnostic attributes (e.g., scene background, object pose). Condition the T2I model on these attributes during fine-tuning, then marginalize them out during image generation to preserve the model's generative priors and reduce spurious inter-class associations. Evaluate across multiple T2I models/backbones/datasets, comparing to prior methods.

Result: BOB achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-shot fine-grained classification with synthetic data. Notably, on Aircraft, it beats DataDream by 7.4% (57.4% vs 50.0%) using 5 real images plus 100 synthetic images. In 3 of 4 benchmarks, 5 real images with BOB outperform 10 real images without BOB. Across 24 settings, BOB outperforms prior work in 18 settings with many >2% accuracy gains.

Conclusion: Conditioning on extracted attributes during fine-tuning and marginalizing them during generation improves data efficiency for low-shot FG classification, reduces overfitting and unintended inter-class associations, and yields robust improvements across models, backbones, and datasets.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly used for synthetic dataset
generation, but generating effective synthetic training data for classification
remains challenging. Fine-tuning a T2I model with a few real examples can help
improve the quality of synthetic training data; however, it may also cause
overfitting and reduce diversity in the generated samples. We propose a
fine-tuning strategy BOB (BeyondOBjects) to mitigate these concerns for
fine-grained classification. Given a small set of real examples, we first
extract class-agnostic attributes such as scene background and object pose. We
then explicitly condition on these attributes during fine-tuning of the T2I
model and marginalize them out during generation. This design mitigates
overfitting, preserves the T2I model's generative prior, reduces estimation
errors, and further minimizes unintended inter-class associations. Extensive
experiments across multiple T2I models, backbones, and datasets show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-shot fine-grained
classification when augmented with synthetic data. Concretely, BOB outperforms
DataDream by 7.4% on the Aircraft dataset (from 50.0% to 57.4% when fine-tuning
a CLIP classifier with five real images augmented with 100 synthetic images).
In three of the four benchmarks, fine-tuning downstream models with 5 real
images augmented with BOB achieves better performance than fine-tuning with 10
real images. Collectively, BOB outperforms prior art in 18 of 24 experimental
settings, with 2+% accuracy improvements in 14 of these settings.

*Agus Gunawan,Samuel Teodoro,Yun Chen,Soo Ye Kim,Jihyong Oh,Munchurl Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniText is a training-free generalist for diverse Text Image Manipulation (TIM) tasks, solving text removal and style/content control by leveraging self-attention inversion and cross-attention redistribution, with novel latent-losses; introduces OmniText-Bench and achieves state-of-the-art results across TIM tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome persistent limitations of text inpainting for TIM: (i) inability to remove text, (ii) lack of control over rendered text style, and (iii) text hallucination/letter duplication, enabling a single generalist framework for varied TIM tasks.

Method: Investigate cross- and self-attention mechanics in diffusion-based text inpainting. Use self-attention inversion to suppress surrounding-text focus for text removal. Redistribute cross-attention to bias tokens and reduce hallucinations. Introduce latent optimization with two losses: cross-attention content loss (improves text rendering accuracy) and self-attention style loss (enables style control). Propose OmniText-Bench as a benchmark for diverse TIM tasks.

Result: OmniText achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple TIM tasks and metrics compared to existing text-inpainting methods and is competitive with specialist methods.

Conclusion: A training-free generalist framework capable of broad TIM tasks, delivering controllable text content and style while mitigating text hallucinations, and supported by a dedicated benchmark for evaluation.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based text synthesis have demonstrated
significant performance in inserting and editing text within images via
inpainting. However, despite the potential of text inpainting methods, three
key limitations hinder their applicability to broader Text Image Manipulation
(TIM) tasks: (i) the inability to remove text, (ii) the lack of control over
the style of rendered text, and (iii) a tendency to generate duplicated
letters. To address these challenges, we propose OmniText, a training-free
generalist capable of performing a wide range of TIM tasks. Specifically, we
investigate two key properties of cross- and self-attention mechanisms to
enable text removal and to provide control over both text styles and content.
Our findings reveal that text removal can be achieved by applying
self-attention inversion, which mitigates the model's tendency to focus on
surrounding text, thus reducing text hallucinations. Additionally, we
redistribute cross-attention, as increasing the probability of certain text
tokens reduces text hallucination. For controllable inpainting, we introduce
novel loss functions in a latent optimization framework: a cross-attention
content loss to improve text rendering accuracy and a self-attention style loss
to facilitate style customization. Furthermore, we present OmniText-Bench, a
benchmark dataset for evaluating diverse TIM tasks. It includes input images,
target text with masks, and style references, covering diverse applications
such as text removal, rescaling, repositioning, and insertion and editing with
various styles. Our OmniText framework is the first generalist method capable
of performing diverse TIM tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple tasks and metrics compared to other text inpainting methods and

### [25] [Enhancing Pre-trained Representation Classifiability can Boost its Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24105)
*Shufan Shen,Zhaobo Qi,Junshu Sun,Qingming Huang,Qi Tian,Shuhui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) to quantify how interpretable pre-trained visual representations are, and finds a positive link between interpretability and classifiability, enabling jointly improving both via interpretabiliy-aware fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To answer whether pre-trained representations can be simultaneously highly interpretable and discriminative, and to quantify interpretability in a way that aligns with downstream success.

Method: Define IIS based on information loss and ratio of interpretable semantics in representations; evaluate interpretability across representations with varying classifiability; analyze correlation; provide code.

Result: IIS captures information loss and interpretable semantics; reveal a positive correlation between interpretability and classifiability; higher classifiability corresponds to more interpretable semantics; interpretability-driven fine-tuning improves classifiability with less accuracy loss; code available.

Conclusion: Practitioners can pursue joint improvements in interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models; the method enables interpretable predictions with maintained performance.

Abstract: The visual representation of a pre-trained model prioritizes the
classifiability on downstream tasks, while the widespread applications for
pre-trained visual models have posed new requirements for representation
interpretability. However, it remains unclear whether the pre-trained
representations can achieve high interpretability and classifiability
simultaneously. To answer this question, we quantify the representation
interpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable
semantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations,
only the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas
the uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we
propose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the
information loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies
the representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation
interpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that
the interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e.,
representations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable
semantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further
supports two benefits to the pre-trained representations. First, the
classifiability of representations can be further improved by fine-tuning with
interpretability maximization. Second, with the classifiability improvement for
the representations, we obtain predictions based on their interpretations with
less accuracy degradation. The discovered positive correlation and
corresponding applications show that practitioners can unify the improvements
in interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models. Codes
are available at https://github.com/ssfgunner/IIS.

### [26] [UHKD: A Unified Framework for Heterogeneous Knowledge Distillation via Frequency-Domain Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24116)
*Fengming Yu,Haiwei Pan,Kejia Zhang,Jian Guan,Haiying Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cross-architecture knowledge distillation framework (UHKD) uses frequency-domain intermediate features with a Feature Transformation Module and a Feature Alignment Module to enable KD between heterogeneous models, achieving notable gains on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Architectural diversity causes semantic discrepancies in intermediate representations, making existing KD methods (which mostly target logits or homogeneous models) less effective for heterogeneous teacher‚Äìstudent pairs. There is a need to leverage intermediate features across architectures to improve transfer.

Method: Apply Fourier transform to teacher and student features to capture global information and reduce representational mismatch. A Feature Transformation Module (FTM) converts teacher features into compact frequency-domain representations. A learnable Feature Alignment Module (FAM) projects and aligns student features via multi-level matching. Training uses a joint objective combining mean squared error on intermediate features and KL divergence on logits.

Result: Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K show improvements over the latest method: 5.59 percentage points on CIFAR-100 and 0.83 percentage points on ImageNet-1K.

Conclusion: UHKD demonstrates that unifying heterogeneous representations via frequency-domain intermediate features enables effective cross-architecture KD, enabling efficient use of visual knowledge.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective model compression technique that
transfers knowledge from a high-performance teacher to a lightweight student,
reducing cost while maintaining accuracy. In visual applications, where
large-scale image models are widely used, KD enables efficient deployment.
However, architectural diversity introduces semantic discrepancies that hinder
the use of intermediate representations. Most existing KD methods are designed
for homogeneous models and degrade in heterogeneous scenarios, especially when
intermediate features are involved. Prior studies mainly focus on the logits
space, making limited use of the semantic information in intermediate layers.
To address this limitation, Unified Heterogeneous Knowledge Distillation (UHKD)
is proposed as a framework that leverages intermediate features in the
frequency domain for cross-architecture transfer. Fourier transform is applied
to capture global feature information, alleviating representational
discrepancies between heterogeneous teacher-student pairs. A Feature
Transformation Module (FTM) produces compact frequency-domain representations
of teacher features, while a learnable Feature Alignment Module (FAM) projects
student features and aligns them via multi-level matching. Training is guided
by a joint objective combining mean squared error on intermediate features with
Kullback-Leibler divergence on logits. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate gains of 5.59% and 0.83% over the latest method, highlighting UHKD
as an effective approach for unifying heterogeneous representations and
enabling efficient utilization of visual knowledge

Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing dog motion datasets‚Äînamely the lack of multi-view and real 3D data, limited scale and diversity‚Äîand to enable systematic, cross-modal evaluation of dog motion recovery across monocular/multi-view and RGB/RGB-D inputs.

Method: Collect 1.2k motion sequences from 10 dogs with multi-view RGB-D data, define four motion-recovery benchmark settings (monocular vs. multi-view, RGB vs. RGB-D), and propose a three-stage instance-specific optimization pipeline to fit the SMAL model: coarse alignment, dense correspondence supervision, and temporal regularization.

Result: Provides a principled dataset and method for dog motion recovery, enabling systematic evaluation across input modalities and view configurations, and a practical SMAL-fitting pipeline to recover motion sequences.

Conclusion: DogMo advances dog motion modeling by supplying a diverse, multi-view RGB-D dataset and a targeted optimization pipeline, fostering research at the intersection of computer vision, graphics, and animal behavior modeling.

Abstract: We present DogMo, a large-scale multi-view RGB-D video dataset capturing
diverse canine movements for the task of motion recovery from images. DogMo
comprises 1.2k motion sequences collected from 10 unique dogs, offering rich
variation in both motion and breed. It addresses key limitations of existing
dog motion datasets, including the lack of multi-view and real 3D data, as well
as limited scale and diversity. Leveraging DogMo, we establish four motion
recovery benchmark settings that support systematic evaluation across monocular
and multi-view, RGB and RGB-D inputs. To facilitate accurate motion recovery,
we further introduce a three-stage, instance-specific optimization pipeline
that fits the SMAL model to the motion sequences. Our method progressively
refines body shape and pose through coarse alignment, dense correspondence
supervision, and temporal regularization. Our dataset and method provide a
principled foundation for advancing research in dog motion recovery and open up
new directions at the intersection of computer vision, computer graphics, and
animal behavior modeling.

### [28] [ETC: training-free diffusion models acceleration with Error-aware Trend Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24129)
*Jiajian Xie,Hubery Yin,Chen Li,Zhou Zhao,Shengyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free diffusion-speedup method called ETC that uses an error-aware trend predictor and a model-specific tolerance search to accelerate sampling while preserving trajectory consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are powerful but slow due to iterative sampling. Training-free speedups reuse model outputs but neglect denoising trends and lack per-model error control, causing trajectory deviations and inconsistencies across multi-step reuse.

Method: ETC introduces a consistent trend predictor that leverages the smooth continuity of diffusion trajectories to project historical denoising patterns into stable future directions and progressively distribute them across multiple approximation steps. It also implements a model-specific error tolerance search to identify corrective thresholds by locating transition points from volatile semantic planning to stable quality refinement.

Result: The method achieves about 2.65x acceleration over FLUX with a negligible SSIM degradation of about 0.074 points, indicating preserved consistency.

Conclusion: ETC provides a principled, training-free framework for accelerating diffusion sampling that maintains trajectory consistency through trend-based prediction and error-aware thresholding, outperforming prior reuse-based approaches like FLUX.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable generative quality but remain
bottlenecked by costly iterative sampling. Recent training-free methods
accelerate diffusion process by reusing model outputs. However, these methods
ignore denoising trends and lack error control for model-specific tolerance,
leading to trajectory deviations under multi-step reuse and exacerbating
inconsistencies in the generated results. To address these issues, we introduce
Error-aware Trend Consistency (ETC), a framework that (1) introduces a
consistent trend predictor that leverages the smooth continuity of diffusion
trajectories, projecting historical denoising patterns into stable future
directions and progressively distributing them across multiple approximation
steps to achieve acceleration without deviating; (2) proposes a model-specific
error tolerance search mechanism that derives corrective thresholds by
identifying transition points from volatile semantic planning to stable quality
refinement. Experiments show that ETC achieves a 2.65x acceleration over FLUX
with negligible (-0.074 SSIM score) degradation of consistency.

*Minsuk Ji,Sanghyeok Lee,Namhyuk Ahn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free approach that improves layout faithfulness in text-to-image generation by using LLM-generated explicit layouts and an object-centric VLM to iteratively rerank candidates, achieving better prompt alignment without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern text-to-image models struggle with compositionality, including object counts, attributes, and spatial relations; a training-free solution to enforce layout constraints is desirable.

Method: 1) Use large language models to synthesize explicit layouts from input prompts; 2) inject these layouts into image generation; 3) employ an object-centric vision-language model to judge and rerank multiple candidate outputs for prompt alignment; 4) apply iterative self-refinement at inference time to scale results.

Result: The approach yields stronger scene alignment with prompts and better layout fidelity compared to recent text-to-image models, while preserving aesthetic quality.

Conclusion: Explicit layout grounding combined with self-refinement at inference improves compositionality without training; the method is training-free and scalable; code is available.

Abstract: Despite their impressive realism, modern text-to-image models still struggle
with compositionality, often failing to render accurate object counts,
attributes, and spatial relations. To address this challenge, we present a
training-free framework that combines an object-centric approach with
self-refinement to improve layout faithfulness while preserving aesthetic
quality. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to synthesize
explicit layouts from input prompts, and we inject these layouts into the image
generation process, where a object-centric vision-language model (VLM) judge
reranks multiple candidates to select the most prompt-aligned outcome
iteratively. By unifying explicit layout-grounding with self-refine-based
inference-time scaling, our framework achieves stronger scene alignment with
prompts compared to recent text-to-image models. The code are available at

Conclusion: Tailoring captions for T2V training improves video generation; VC4VG offers a practical framework and resources to advance caption-aware video synthesis research.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation highlight the critical role
of high-quality video-text pairs in training models capable of producing

video captions specifically for T2V training remain underexplored. In this
paper, we introduce VC4VG (Video Captioning for Video Generation), a
comprehensive caption optimization framework tailored to the needs of T2V
models.We begin by analyzing caption content from a T2V perspective,
decomposing the essential elements required for video reconstruction into
multiple dimensions, and proposing a principled caption design methodology. To
support evaluation, we construct VC4VG-Bench, a new benchmark featuring
fine-grained, multi-dimensional, and necessity-graded metrics aligned with
T2V-specific requirements.Extensive T2V fine-tuning experiments demonstrate a
strong correlation between improved caption quality and video generation
performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. We release all

TL;DR: A four-component, prompt-driven VLM framework for autonomous driving evaluation that uses task-specific prompts, spatial grounding, and a visual assembly module, achieving ~71% average accuracy on both clean and corrupted data in RoboSense IROS 2025 challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance Vision-Language Models for safety-critical autonomous driving tasks by reducing prompt interference across diverse questions, incorporating explicit spatial reasoning, and improving robustness to data corruption.

Method: 1) Mixture-of-Prompts router to classify questions and route to task-specific prompts. 2) Task-specific prompts embedding coordinate systems, spatial rules, role-playing, chain-of-thought/tree-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot examples per task. 3) Visual assembly module composing multi-view images with object crops, magenta markers, and adaptive historical frames per question. 4) Per-task inference configuration (temperature, top-p, message roles). Implemented on Qwen2.5-VL-72B.

Conclusion: Structured, task-aware prompting plus spatial grounding can enhance VLM performance and robustness in autonomous driving contexts; the approach is reproducible with public code (GitHub link) and emphasizes careful prompt routing, per-task reasoning strategies, and multimodal input assembly.

Abstract: This technical report presents our solution for the RoboSense Challenge at
IROS 2025, which evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on autonomous driving
scene understanding across perception, prediction, planning, and corruption
detection tasks. We propose a systematic framework built on four core
components. First, a Mixture-of-Prompts router classifies questions and
dispatches them to task-specific expert prompts, eliminating interference
across diverse question types. Second, task-specific prompts embed explicit
coordinate systems, spatial reasoning rules, role-playing,
Chain-of-Thought/Tree-of-Thought reasoning, and few-shot examples tailored to
each task. Third, a visual assembly module composes multi-view images with
object crops, magenta markers, and adaptive historical frames based on question
requirements. Fourth, we configure model inference parameters (temperature,
top-p, message roles) per task to optimize output quality. Implemented on
Qwen2.5-VL-72B, our approach achieves 70.87% average accuracy on Phase-1 (clean
data) and 72.85% on Phase-2 (corrupted data), demonstrating that structured

*Ziqi Zhou,Yifan Hu,Yufei Song,Zijing Li,Shengshan Hu,Leo Yu Zhang,Dezhong Yao,Long Zheng,Hai Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces UAP-SAM2, a cross-prompt universal adversarial attack for SAM2 that uses dual semantic deviation to attack both within-frame semantics and cross-frame temporal consistency, achieving superior transferability and effectiveness across six datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2‚Äôs robustness and cross-model attack transferability are not well understood. The key architectural differences‚Äîprompt-driven directional guidance and semantic entanglement across frames‚Äîpose unique challenges not addressed by existing SAM attacks.

Method: Propose UAP-SAM2 with a cross-prompt target-scanning strategy that splits each frame into k regions with randomly assigned prompts to reduce prompt dependency. Introduce a dual semantic deviation framework to craft a universal perturbation that distorts intra-frame semantics and disrupts inter-frame semantic consistency.

Result: Extensive experiments on six datasets across two segmentation tasks demonstrate that UAP-SAM2 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art attacks.

Conclusion: UAP-SAM2 reveals and exploits vulnerabilities in SAM2 by addressing both cross-prompt transferability and temporal semantic entanglement, showing strong effectiveness and raising robustness concerns for SAM2 in video segmentation.

Abstract: Recent studies reveal the vulnerability of the image segmentation foundation
model SAM to adversarial examples. Its successor, SAM2, has attracted
significant attention due to its strong generalization capability in video
segmentation. However, its robustness remains unexplored, and it is unclear
whether existing attacks on SAM can be directly transferred to SAM2. In this
paper, we first analyze the performance gap of existing attacks between SAM and
SAM2 and highlight two key challenges arising from their architectural
differences: directional guidance from the prompt and semantic entanglement
across consecutive frames. To address these issues, we propose UAP-SAM2, the
first cross-prompt universal adversarial attack against SAM2 driven by dual
semantic deviation. For cross-prompt transferability, we begin by designing a
target-scanning strategy that divides each frame into k regions, each randomly
assigned a prompt, to reduce prompt dependency during optimization. For
effectiveness, we design a dual semantic deviation framework that optimizes a
UAP by distorting the semantics within the current frame and disrupting the
semantic consistency across consecutive frames. Extensive experiments on six
datasets across two segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method for SAM2. The comparative results show that UAP-SAM2
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks by a large margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLFSeg is an encoder-decoder segmentation model that fuses a Fuzzy-Convolutional module with standard CNN layers to improve polyp and cardiac segmentation by reducing uncertainty, handling boundary regions, and addressing class imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art results on four public datasets with efficient computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional CNN-based medical segmentation models struggle with generalizability, robustness, and uncertainty in boundary regions and noisy data. There is a need for a framework that can capture both local and global features while reducing ambiguity to enable reliable clinical decisions and enable real-world deployment.

Method: CLFSeg uses an encoder-decoder architecture augmented with a Fuzzy-Convolutional (FC) module that blends convolutional layers with fuzzy logic to better identify local and global features and reduce boundary noise. It addresses class imbalance by using a combined Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) and Dice loss. The approach emphasizes computational efficiency and focuses on tiny/boundary regions.

Result: The model demonstrates exceptional performance on four public datasets (CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, EtisLaribPolypDB, ACDC), surpassing state-of-the-art methods and showing robustness and efficiency in identifying regions of interest.

Conclusion: CLFSeg offers a robust, efficient solution for accurate polyp and cardiac segmentation, with strong potential for real-world clinical deployment and diagnostic support; a project page provides further details.

Abstract: Accurate polyp and cardiac segmentation for early detection and treatment is
essential for the diagnosis and treatment planning of cancer-like diseases.
Traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) based models have represented
limited generalizability, robustness, and inability to handle uncertainty,
which affects the segmentation performance. To solve these problems, this paper
introduces CLFSeg, an encoder-decoder based framework that aggregates the
Fuzzy-Convolutional (FC) module leveraging convolutional layers and fuzzy
logic. This module enhances the segmentation performance by identifying local
and global features while minimizing the uncertainty, noise, and ambiguity in
boundary regions, ensuring computing efficiency. In order to handle class
imbalance problem while focusing on the areas of interest with tiny and
boundary regions, binary cross-entropy (BCE) with dice loss is incorporated.
Our proposed model exhibits exceptional performance on four publicly available
datasets, including CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, EtisLaribPolypDB, and ACDC.
Extensive experiments and visual studies show CLFSeg surpasses the existing
SOTA performance and focuses on relevant regions of interest in anatomical

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free, lossless parallel decoding for autoregressive visual generation via MC-SJD; couples to increase draft-token consensus and achieves up to 4.2x image and 13.3x video speedups without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive visual generation suffers from slow per-token decoding; need faster, lossless decoding without retraining.

Method: MC-SJD extends Speculative Jacobi Decoding using a coupling-based, information-theoretic approach to maximize identical draft tokens across iterations; a minimal one-line modification to SJD; training-free and lossless.

Result: Delivers up to ~4.2x acceleration for image generation and ~13.3x for video generation over standard AR decoding, with no degradation in output quality.

Conclusion: MC-SJD provides a simple, effective method to significantly accelerate AR-based visual generation while preserving output quality; potential broad impact on real-time or high-throughput generative systems.

Abstract: While autoregressive (AR) modeling has recently emerged as a new paradigm in
visual generation, its practical adoption is severely constrained by the slow
inference speed of per-token generation, which often requires thousands of
steps to produce a single sample. To address this challenge, we propose MC-SJD,
a training-free, lossless parallel decoding framework designed to accelerate AR
visual generation by extending the recently introduced Speculative Jacobi
Decoding (SJD). Although SJD shows strong potential for accelerating AR
generation, we demonstrate that token instability across iterations
significantly reduces the acceptance rate, a limitation that primarily arises
from the independent sampling process used during draft token generation. To
overcome this, we introduce MC-SJD, an information-theoretic approach based on
coupling, which substantially accelerates standard SJD by maximizing the
probability of sampling identical draft tokens across consecutive iterations,
all while preserving its lossless property. Remarkably, this method requires
only a single-line modification to the existing algorithm, yet achieves
substantial performance gains, delivering up to a ~4.2x acceleration in image
generation and ~13.3x acceleration in video generation compared to standard AR
decoding, without any degradation in output quality.

### [35] [Beyond Inference Intervention: Identity-Decoupled Diffusion for Face Anonymization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24213)
*Haoxin Yang,Yihong Lin,Jingdan Kang,Xuemiao Xu,Yue Li,Cheng Xu,Shengfeng He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ID^2Face is a training-centric face anonymization framework that learns a disentangled latent space for identity and non-identity features, enabling inference-time anonymization without post-hoc optimization; it uses an Identity-Decoupled Latent Recomposer, Identity-Guided Latent Harmonizer, and Orthogonal Identity Mapping, trained with a recomposition-based reconstruction loss to achieve better visual quality, stronger identity suppression, and preserved utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference-time interventions in diffusion models (e.g., negative guidance, energy-based methods) introduce distribution shifts, entangle identity with other attributes, and hurt fidelity. A training-centric approach aiming to disentangle identity from non-identity within the latent space can enable cleaner anonymization at inference.

Method: Propose ID^2Face: a conditional diffusion model with an identity-masked learning scheme. Identity-Decoupled Latent Recomposer uses an Identity Variational Autoencoder to model identity features, while non-identity attributes come from same-identity pairs and are aligned through bidirectional latent alignment. Identity-Guided Latent Harmonizer fuses representations via soft-gating conditioned on noisy feature prediction. Trained with a recomposition-based reconstruction loss to enforce disentanglement. At inference, anonymization is achieved by sampling a random identity vector from the learned identity space. Orthogonal Identity Mapping enforces orthogonality between sampled and source identity vectors to suppress leakage.

Result: Empirical results show that ID^2Face outperforms existing methods in visual quality, identity suppression, and utility preservation.

Conclusion: A training-centric framework successfully disentangles identity from non-identity in a structured latent space, enabling direct anonymization at inference without costly post-training optimizations and providing stronger leakage suppression via orthogonal identity mapping.

Abstract: Face anonymization aims to conceal identity information while preserving
non-identity attributes. Mainstream diffusion models rely on inference-time
interventions such as negative guidance or energy-based optimization, which are
applied post-training to suppress identity features. These interventions often
introduce distribution shifts and entangle identity with non-identity
attributes, degrading visual fidelity and data utility. To address this, we
propose \textbf{ID\textsuperscript{2}Face}, a training-centric anonymization
framework that removes the need for inference-time optimization. The rationale
of our method is to learn a structured latent space where identity and
non-identity information are explicitly disentangled, enabling direct and
controllable anonymization at inference. To this end, we design a conditional
diffusion model with an identity-masked learning scheme. An Identity-Decoupled
Latent Recomposer uses an Identity Variational Autoencoder to model identity
features, while non-identity attributes are extracted from same-identity pairs
and aligned through bidirectional latent alignment. An Identity-Guided Latent
Harmonizer then fuses these representations via soft-gating conditioned on
noisy feature prediction. The model is trained with a recomposition-based
reconstruction loss to enforce disentanglement. At inference, anonymization is
achieved by sampling a random identity vector from the learned identity space.
To further suppress identity leakage, we introduce an Orthogonal Identity
Mapping strategy that enforces orthogonality between sampled and source
identity vectors. Experiments demonstrate that ID\textsuperscript{2}Face
outperforms existing methods in visual quality, identity suppression, and
utility preservation.

*Jinhong Deng,Wen Li,Joey Tianyi Zhou,Yang He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE uses saliency-coverage to prune visual tokens in MLLMs, preserving semantic completeness while reducing computation, and outperforms prior pruning methods on LLaVA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To alleviate the high computational cost of processing dense visual tokens in multimodal LLMs while avoiding semantic incompleteness caused by token pruning.

Method: Define a set-coverage over selected tokens based on token relationships, compute a token-coverage gain for each unselected token, integrate saliency into this gain to form the SCOPE score, and iteratively select the token with the highest score.

Result: Extensive experiments on vision-language benchmarks with LLaVA-1.5 and LLaVA-Next show that SCOPE consistently outperforms prior token pruning approaches.

Conclusion: SCOPE effectively balances saliency and coverage to preserve semantic completeness while reducing token count, enabling more efficient MLLMs; code is released.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically process a large number of
visual tokens, leading to considerable computational overhead, even though many
of these tokens are redundant. Existing visual token pruning methods primarily
focus on selecting the most salient tokens based on attention scores, resulting
in the semantic incompleteness of the selected tokens. In this paper, we
propose a novel visual token pruning strategy, called
\textbf{S}aliency-\textbf{C}overage \textbf{O}riented token \textbf{P}runing
for \textbf{E}fficient MLLMs (SCOPE), to jointly model both the saliency and
coverage of the selected visual tokens to better preserve semantic
completeness. Specifically, we introduce a set-coverage for a given set of
selected tokens, computed based on the token relationships. We then define a
token-coverage gain for each unselected token, quantifying how much additional
coverage would be obtained by including it. By integrating the saliency score
into the token-coverage gain, we propose our SCOPE score and iteratively select
the token with the highest SCOPE score. We conduct extensive experiments on
multiple vision-language understanding benchmarks using the LLaVA-1.5 and
LLaVA-Next models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms prior approaches. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces an event-based microsaccade dataset rendered with Blender, transformed into event streams via v2e, and evaluated with Spiking-VGG variants including an optical-flow-enhanced Spiking-VGG16Flow. Achieves ~90% average accuracy in classifying angular displacement across seven classes, independent of event count or duration, establishing a benchmark for event-based vision with spiking neural networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional microsaccade research relies on eye trackers or frame-based methods that are precise but costly, less scalable, and limited in temporal resolution. Event-based sensing offers high-speed, low-latency data capture. There is a need for a public benchmark dataset and SNN-capable models to explore fine eye-movement dynamics in cognitive computing.

Method: Create a synthetic microsaccade dataset using Blender to render high-fidelity eye movements. Simulate microsaccades with angular displacements from 0.5¬∞ to 2.0¬∞ across seven classes. Convert sequences to event streams using the v2e framework, preserving micro-temporal dynamics with durations from 0.25 ms to 2.25 ms. Evaluate on Spiking-VGG11/13/16, and propose Spiking-VGG16Flow (optical-flow-enhanced) implemented in SpikingJelly.

Result: The models achieve around 90% average accuracy in classifying microsaccades by angular displacement, independent of event count or duration, demonstrating effective fine-motion recognition with spiking networks and establishing a benchmark for event-based vision research.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates the feasibility and value of event-based datasets and spiking neural networks for precise, high-temporal-resolution motion analysis in microsaccades, and provides publicly available data, code, and trained models to advance research in cognitive computing.

Abstract: Microsaccades are small, involuntary eye movements vital for visual
perception and neural processing. Traditional microsaccade studies typically
use eye trackers or frame-based analysis, which, while precise, are costly and
limited in scalability and temporal resolution. Event-based sensing offers a
high-speed, low-latency alternative by capturing fine-grained spatiotemporal
changes efficiently. This work introduces a pioneering event-based microsaccade
dataset to support research on small eye movement dynamics in cognitive
computing. Using Blender, we render high-fidelity eye movement scenarios and
simulate microsaccades with angular displacements from 0.5 to 2.0 degrees,
divided into seven distinct classes. These are converted to event streams using
v2e, preserving the natural temporal dynamics of microsaccades, with durations
ranging from 0.25 ms to 2.25 ms. We evaluate the dataset using Spiking-VGG11,
Spiking-VGG13, and Spiking-VGG16, and propose Spiking-VGG16Flow, an
optical-flow-enhanced variant implemented in SpikingJelly. The models achieve
around 90 percent average accuracy, successfully classifying microsaccades by
angular displacement, independent of event count or duration. These results
demonstrate the potential of spiking neural networks for fine motion
recognition and establish a benchmark for event-based vision research. The
dataset, code, and trained models will be publicly available at

*Qing Zhao,Weijian Deng,Pengxu Wei,ZiYi Dong,Hannan Lu,Xiangyang Ji,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LR-YOLO is a Lipschitz-regularized detector that integrates image restoration into detector training to harmonize the Lipschitz properties of restoration and detection, improving robustness under haze and low-light conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a functional mismatch between restoration (smooth transformations) and detection (highly discontinuous decision boundaries). This mismatch can cause instability, gradient-flow disruption, and poor optimization in cascade restoration-detection pipelines under adverse conditions.

Method: Propose Lipschitz-regularized object detection (LROD) implemented as LR-YOLO, embedding restoration into the detector's feature learning and enforcing Lipschitz continuity to align both tasks. The approach is designed to extend to existing YOLO detectors.

Result: Extensive experiments on haze and low-light benchmarks show that LR-YOLO improves detection stability, optimization smoothness, and overall accuracy compared to traditional cascaded pipelines.

Conclusion: Aligning Lipschitz continuity between restoration and detection yields more stable and effective detection under adverse conditions; LR-YOLO is simple to implement and generalizes to existing YOLO detectors.

Abstract: To improve detection robustness in adverse conditions (e.g., haze and low
light), image restoration is commonly applied as a pre-processing step to
enhance image quality for the detector. However, the functional mismatch
between restoration and detection networks can introduce instability and hinder
effective integration -- an issue that remains underexplored. We revisit this
limitation through the lens of Lipschitz continuity, analyzing the functional
differences between restoration and detection networks in both the input space
and the parameter space. Our analysis shows that restoration networks perform
smooth, continuous transformations, while object detectors operate with
discontinuous decision boundaries, making them highly sensitive to minor
perturbations. This mismatch introduces instability in traditional cascade
frameworks, where even imperceptible noise from restoration is amplified during
detection, disrupting gradient flow and hindering optimization. To address
this, we propose Lipschitz-regularized object detection (LROD), a simple yet
effective framework that integrates image restoration directly into the
detector's feature learning, harmonizing the Lipschitz continuity of both tasks
during training. We implement this framework as Lipschitz-regularized YOLO
(LR-YOLO), extending seamlessly to existing YOLO detectors. Extensive
experiments on haze and low-light benchmarks demonstrate that LR-YOLO
consistently improves detection stability, optimization smoothness, and overall
accuracy.

*Zhaotong Yang,Yi Chen,Yanying Li,Shengfeng He,Yangyang Xu,Junyu Dong,Jian Yang,Yong Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A shadow-removal framework (DeshadowMamba) combines a selective state-space model (Mamba) with CrossGate directional modulation and ColorShift regularization to achieve state-of-the-art performance by propagating global context while preserving structure and color fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current attention-based shadow-removal models rely on fixed attention patterns that can mix illumination cues from irrelevant regions, causing structural distortion and color inconsistency. There is a need to exploit global context with preserved spatial continuity while being shadow-aware.

Method: Replace standard attention with Mamba to propagate global context through directional state transitions. Introduce CrossGate, a directional modulation mechanism that injects shadow-aware similarity into Mamba's input gate to selectively incorporate relevant context along transition axes. Add ColorShift regularization, a contrastive objective driven by global color statistics, synthesizing structured informative negatives to suppress color contamination and improve color restoration.

Result: Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show DeshadowMamba achieves state-of-the-art visual quality and strong quantitative performance, validating its effectiveness in maintaining structural integrity and chromatic consistency.

Conclusion: Adapting sequence-modeling approaches to shadow removal can yield robust, high-fidelity restorations by ensuring effective global context propagation with shadow-aware gating and color-preserving regularization.

Abstract: Recent deep models for image shadow removal often rely on attention-based
architectures to capture long-range dependencies. However, their fixed
attention patterns tend to mix illumination cues from irrelevant regions,
leading to distorted structures and inconsistent colors. In this work, we
revisit shadow removal from a sequence modeling perspective and explore the use
of Mamba, a selective state space model that propagates global context through
directional state transitions. These transitions yield an efficient global
receptive field while preserving positional continuity. Despite its potential,
directly applying Mamba to image data is suboptimal, since it lacks awareness
of shadow-non-shadow semantics and remains susceptible to color interference
from nearby regions. To address these limitations, we propose CrossGate, a
directional modulation mechanism that injects shadow-aware similarity into
Mamba's input gate, allowing selective integration of relevant context along
transition axes. To further ensure appearance fidelity, we introduce ColorShift
regularization, a contrastive learning objective driven by global color
statistics. By synthesizing structured informative negatives, it guides the
model to suppress color contamination and achieve robust color restoration.
Together, these components adapt sequence modeling to the structural integrity
and chromatic consistency required for shadow removal. Extensive experiments on
public benchmarks demonstrate that DeshadowMamba achieves state-of-the-art
visual quality and strong quantitative performance.

*Toan Van Nguyen,Rasmus G. K. Christiansen,Dirk Kraft,Leon Bodenhagen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenTrack presents a hybrid stochastic-deterministic multi-object tracking framework that uses PSO with custom fitness for robust ID maintenance under unknown/variable scene targets, enhanced by social interactions and a redefined MOT baseline; it provides public code with three variants, and shows superior performance over state-of-the-art trackers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address tracking with unknown/time-varying target counts, occlusions, weak detectors, and nonlinear dynamics while preserving ID consistency, by integrating stochastic optimization, social cues, and a comprehensive state/observation model.

Method: A hybrid tracking approach combining stochastic PSO-guided particles and deterministic updates; fitness measures steer particles toward target distribution modes; incorporate social interactions among targets; redefine MOT baseline with space consistency, appearance, detection confidence, track penalties, and social scores; provide three variants (GenTrack Basic, PSO, PSO-Social); release public source code with minimal dependencies.

Result: Empirical results show GenTrack achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks and real-world scenarios compared to state-of-the-art trackers; provides integrated baselines for fair comparison.

Conclusion: GenTrack advances MOT by bridging stochastic optimization with social-informed tracking and a comprehensive model, with public code and directions for future work.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-object tracking (MOT) method, dubbed
GenTrack, whose main contributions include: a hybrid tracking approach
employing both stochastic and deterministic manners to robustly handle unknown
and time-varying numbers of targets, particularly in maintaining target
identity (ID) consistency and managing nonlinear dynamics, leveraging particle
swarm optimization (PSO) with some proposed fitness measures to guide
stochastic particles toward their target distribution modes, enabling effective
tracking even with weak and noisy object detectors, integration of social
interactions among targets to enhance PSO-guided particles as well as improve
continuous updates of both strong (matched) and weak (unmatched) tracks,
thereby reducing ID switches and track loss, especially during occlusions, a
GenTrack-based redefined visual MOT baseline incorporating a comprehensive
state and observation model based on space consistency, appearance, detection
confidence, track penalties, and social scores for systematic and efficient
target updates, and the first-ever publicly available source-code reference
implementation with minimal dependencies, featuring three variants, including
GenTrack Basic, PSO, and PSO-Social, facilitating flexible reimplementation.
Experimental results have shown that GenTrack provides superior performance on
standard benchmarks and real-world scenarios compared to state-of-the-art
trackers, with integrated implementations of baselines for fair comparison.
Potential directions for future work are also discussed. The source-code

### [41] [UtilGen: Utility-Centric Generative Data Augmentation with Dual-Level Task Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24262)
*Jiyu Guo,Shuo Yang,Yiming Huang,Yancheng Long,Xiaobo Xia,Xiu Su,Bo Zhao,Zeke Xie,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A utility-centric data augmentation framework (UtilGen) optimizes synthetic data for downstream tasks using task feedback, achieving ~3.87% average accuracy gain over SOTA across eight benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While most augmentation methods optimize visual fidelity and diversity, they ignore task-specific needs; different tasks and architectures require different data distributions; there is a gap to align augmentation with downstream utility.

Method: Introduces a weight allocation network to estimate per-sample utility; uses dual-level optimization: model-level to tailor the generator to the task, and instance-level to adjust generation policies (e.g., prompt embeddings, initial noise) each round.

Result: Empirical results show consistent performance gains; average accuracy improvement of 3.87% over previous SOTA across eight datasets; data influence analyses show synthetic data is more impactful and task-relevant when using UtilGen.

Conclusion: Shifts augmentation paradigm from visual-centric to task-utility-centric data generation; UtilGen produces high-utility synthetic data that better supports downstream tasks.

Abstract: Data augmentation using generative models has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for enhancing performance in computer vision tasks. However, most existing
augmentation approaches primarily focus on optimizing intrinsic data attributes
-- such as fidelity and diversity -- to generate visually high-quality
synthetic data, while often neglecting task-specific requirements. Yet, it is
essential for data generators to account for the needs of downstream tasks, as
training data requirements can vary significantly across different tasks and
network architectures. To address these limitations, we propose UtilGen, a
novel utility-centric data augmentation framework that adaptively optimizes the
data generation process to produce task-specific, high-utility training data
via downstream task feedback. Specifically, we first introduce a weight
allocation network to evaluate the task-specific utility of each synthetic
sample. Guided by these evaluations, UtilGen iteratively refines the data
generation process using a dual-level optimization strategy to maximize the
synthetic data utility: (1) model-level optimization tailors the generative
model to the downstream task, and (2) instance-level optimization adjusts
generation policies -- such as prompt embeddings and initial noise -- at each
generation round. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets of varying
complexity and granularity demonstrate that UtilGen consistently achieves
superior performance, with an average accuracy improvement of 3.87% over
previous SOTA. Further analysis of data influence and distribution reveals that
UtilGen produces more impactful and task-relevant synthetic data, validating
the effectiveness of the paradigm shift from visual characteristics-centric to
task utility-centric data augmentation.

### [42] [A Hybrid Approach for Visual Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24410)
*Toan Van Nguyen,Rasmus G. K. Christiansen,Dirk Kraft,Leon Bodenhagen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid visual multi-object tracker that combines stochastic (particle filter with PSO-guided sampling) and deterministic data association to maintain consistent identities under unknown/variable target counts and nonlinear dynamics, with occlusion handling and velocity-informed sampling; claims state-of-the-art performance and provides open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To robustly track multiple targets when the number of targets is time-varying and unknown, dynamics are nonlinear and noisy, and identities must be preserved through occlusions and interactions.

Method: Stochastic branch: particle filter for nonlinear, non-Gaussian dynamics; PSO guides particles toward distribution modes; novel fitness terms for motion consistency, appearance similarity, and social-interaction cues. Deterministic branch: a cost-based association using spatial consistency between particles and detections, detection confidences, and track penalties. Additional contributions: a smooth state-update scheme to preserve identities during weak or occluded tracks and velocity regression from past states to provide trend-based velocity seeds for better sampling. Applicable to both offline videos and live streams without future frames. Code available on GitHub.

Result: Experimental results indicate superior performance over state-of-the-art trackers; open-source reference implementations provided.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid stochastic-deterministic tracker improves identity preservation and robustness in scenarios with unknown/variable target counts and occlusions, while remaining applicable to both offline and live settings; the accompanying open-source code supports reproducibility.

Abstract: This paper proposes a visual multi-object tracking method that jointly
employs stochastic and deterministic mechanisms to ensure identifier
consistency for unknown and time-varying target numbers under nonlinear
dynamics. A stochastic particle filter addresses nonlinear dynamics and
non-Gaussian noise, with support from particle swarm optimization (PSO) to
guide particles toward state distribution modes and mitigate divergence through
proposed fitness measures incorporating motion consistency, appearance
similarity, and social-interaction cues with neighboring targets. Deterministic
association further enforces identifier consistency via a proposed cost matrix
incorporating spatial consistency between particles and current detections,
detection confidences, and track penalties. Subsequently, a novel scheme is
proposed for the smooth updating of target states while preserving their
identities, particularly for weak tracks during interactions with other targets
and prolonged occlusions. Moreover, velocity regression over past states
provides trend-seed velocities, enhancing particle sampling and state updates.
The proposed tracker is designed to operate flexibly for both pre-recorded
videos and camera live streams, where future frames are unavailable.
Experimental results confirm superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
trackers. The source-code reference implementations of both the proposed method
and compared-trackers are provided on GitHub:

*Pietro Bongini,Valentina Molinari,Andrea Costanzo,Benedetta Tondi,Mauro Barni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a training-free one-shot method for attributing synthetic image sources via resynthesis, and introduces a challenging dataset; the resynthesis approach outperforms existing few-shot baselines in low-data regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity in synthetic image source attribution, enabling reliable few-shot or zero-shot classification across diverse generative models.

Method: For a given image, generate a descriptive prompt, resynthesize the image using each candidate source, then attribute to the source whose resynthesized image is closest to the original in a chosen feature space.

Result: On a new dataset of faces from commercial and open-source text-to-image generators, the resynthesis method outperforms state-of-the-art few-shot methods and baselines when little training data is available; the dataset is challenging and suitable as a benchmark.

Conclusion: Resynthesis-based attribution is effective in few-shot/zero-shot settings and the dataset provides a valuable benchmark to develop and evaluate future attribution methods across synthetic-image sources.

Abstract: Synthetic image source attribution is a challenging task, especially in data
scarcity conditions requiring few-shot or zero-shot classification
capabilities. We present a new training-free one-shot attribution method based
on image resynthesis. A prompt describing the image under analysis is
generated, then it is used to resynthesize the image with all the candidate
sources. The image is attributed to the model which produced the resynthesis
closest to the original image in a proper feature space. We also introduce a
new dataset for synthetic image attribution consisting of face images from
commercial and open-source text-to-image generators. The dataset provides a
challenging attribution framework, useful for developing new attribution models
and testing their capabilities on different generative architectures. The
dataset structure allows to test approaches based on resynthesis and to compare
them to few-shot methods. Results from state-of-the-art few-shot approaches and
other baselines show that the proposed resynthesis method outperforms existing
techniques when only a few samples are available for training or fine-tuning.
The experiments also demonstrate that the new dataset is a challenging one and
represents a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating future few-shot
and zero-shot methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ViPER, a two-stage coarse-to-fine learning framework that self-critiques and self-predicts to improve fine-grained visual perception in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Demonstrates that internal data synthesis and a closed-loop RL paradigm yield consistent gains on Qwen2.5-VL (Qwen-Viper series) and seven benchmarks, highlighting a reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the bottleneck of fine-grained visual perception in VLMs, hindered by limited high-quality data and the drawbacks of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). The goal is to enhance perceptual ability without sacrificing general capabilities.

Method: Introduce a two-stage coarse-to-fine task for visual perception; develop ViPER, a self-bootstrapping framework with self-critique and self-prediction. Combine image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage reinforcement learning strategy to create a closed-loop where synthetic data from the model itself fuels perceptual improvement. Applied to Qwen2.5-VL to produce the Qwen-Viper series.

Result: Average improvement of 1.7% across seven benchmarks; up to 6.0% gains on fine-grained perception. Qwen-Viper series shows improved performance across varying VLM tasks while maintaining generalizability.

Conclusion: The work provides evidence for a reciprocal link between generation and understanding in VLMs and demonstrates that self-bootstrapping via ViPER can autonomously enhance perceptual capabilities, pushing toward more capable and autonomous VLMs.

Abstract: The limited capacity for fine-grained visual perception presents a critical
bottleneck for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world applications.
Addressing this is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality data and the
limitations of existing methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often compromises
general capabilities, while reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) prioritizes textual
reasoning over visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
two-stage task that structures visual perception learning as a coarse-to-fine
progressive process. Based on this task formulation, we develop ViPER, a
self-bootstrapping framework specifically designed to enable iterative
evolution through self-critiquing and self-prediction. By synergistically
integrating image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy, ViPER establishes a closed-loop training
paradigm, where internally synthesized data directly fuel the enhancement of
perceptual ability. Applied to the Qwen2.5-VL family, ViPER produces the
Qwen-Viper series. With an average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive
benchmarks spanning various tasks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception,
Qwen-Viper consistently demonstrates superior performance across different
vision-language scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Beyond enabling
self-improvement in perceptual capabilities, ViPER provides concrete evidence
for the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding, a
breakthrough to developing more autonomous and capable VLMs.

*Ivica Dimitrovski,Vlatko Spasev,Ivan Kitanovski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prompt learning is an effective, scalable adaptation for few-shot remote sensing scene classification, outperforming zero-shot CLIP and linear probes; self-regulating, semantically guided prompts offer the strongest cross-domain robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing suffers from scarce labeled data and domain shifts across geographic and sensor modalities. While CLIP-like vision-language models offer transferable representations, domain gaps to RS tasks necessitate task-specific semantic adaptation.

Method: Systematic evaluation of four prompt-learning schemes‚ÄîContext Optimization, Conditional Context Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints‚Äîagainst zero-shot CLIP with handcrafted prompts and a linear probe on frozen CLIP features. Extensive experiments on multiple RS benchmarks, including cross-dataset generalization.

Result: Prompt-learning methods consistently outperform the baselines in few-shot scenarios; the Self-Regulating Constraints approach yields the most robust cross-domain performance.

Conclusion: Prompt learning provides a scalable, efficient path to bridge domain gaps in satellite and aerial imagery, establishing a solid foundation for future remote-sensing‚Äìfocused vision-language adaptation.

Abstract: Remote sensing applications increasingly rely on deep learning for scene
classification. However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity
of labeled data and the high cost of annotation across diverse geographic and
sensor domains. While recent vision-language models like CLIP have shown
promise by learning transferable representations at scale by aligning visual
and textual modalities, their direct application to remote sensing remains
suboptimal due to significant domain gaps and the need for task-specific
semantic adaptation. To address this critical challenge, we systematically
explore prompt learning as a lightweight and efficient adaptation strategy for
few-shot remote sensing image scene classification. We evaluate several
representative methods, including Context Optimization, Conditional Context
Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating
Constraints. These approaches reflect complementary design philosophies: from
static context optimization to conditional prompts for enhanced generalization,
multi-modal prompts for joint vision-language adaptation, and semantically
regularized prompts for stable learning without forgetting. We benchmark these
prompt-learning methods against two standard baselines: zero-shot CLIP with
hand-crafted prompts and a linear probe trained on frozen CLIP features.
Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets,
including cross-dataset generalization tests, we demonstrate that prompt
learning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios.
Notably, Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieves the most robust
cross-domain performance. Our findings underscore prompt learning as a scalable
and efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial
imagery, providing a strong foundation for future research in this field.

TL;DR: Switching Dual-Student with Loss-Aware EMA improves semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation by dynamically selecting the most reliable student and using EMA to transfer rich information to the teacher, reducing error reinforcement and enhancing pseudo-label quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional teacher-student methods suffer from strong correlation and error reinforcement between teacher and student, limiting learning from limited labeled data in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Method: Introduce a Switching Dual-Student architecture that, at each iteration, selects the most reliable student to collaborate with the teacher, and apply a Loss-Aware Exponential Moving Average to adaptively absorb informative signals from students into the teacher, yielding higher-quality pseudo-labels. The framework is plug-and-play and evaluated on 3D medical image segmentation datasets.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods on 3D medical image segmentation under limited supervision, demonstrating improved segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed Switching Dual-Student with Loss-Aware EMA enhances learning dynamics by preventing error reinforcement and delivering meaningful pseudo-labels, leading to superior performance in semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Teacher-student frameworks have emerged as a leading approach in
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, demonstrating strong performance
across various tasks. However, the learning effects are still limited by the
strong correlation and unreliable knowledge transfer process between teacher
and student networks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel
switching Dual-Student architecture that strategically selects the most
reliable student at each iteration to enhance dual-student collaboration and
prevent error reinforcement. We also introduce a strategy of Loss-Aware
Exponential Moving Average to dynamically ensure that the teacher absorbs
meaningful information from students, improving the quality of pseudo-labels.
Our plug-and-play framework is extensively evaluated on 3D medical image
segmentation datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised
methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving segmentation accuracy
under limited supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: W2-Net decouples counting and localization with a dual-query mechanism (what-to-count and where-to-see) and a Subclass Separable Matching strategy, achieving state-of-the-art results on Referring Expression Counting (REC-8K).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotation points are typically placed on class-representative locations (e.g., heads), causing models to overemphasize class-level features and neglect attribute information from other regions necessary for fine-grained subclass discrimination.

Method: Introduce a dual-query framework: what-to-count (w2c) queries localize the object, and where-to-see (w2s) queries extract features from attribute-specific regions to capture distinguishing attributes. Also propose Subclass Separable Matching (SSM) with a repulsive force to improve inter-subclass separability during label assignment.

Result: Significant gains on REC-8K: counting error reduced by 22.5% on validation and 18.0% on test; localization F1 improved by 7% and 8% respectively. Code will be available.

Conclusion: Decoupling counting and viewing via the dual-query W2-Net, together with SSM, enhances fine-grained counting and localization by leveraging attribute-specific regions and stronger inter-subclass discrimination, achieving state-of-the-art performance on REC-8K.

Abstract: Referring Expression Counting (REC) extends class-level object counting to
the fine-grained subclass-level, aiming to enumerate objects matching a textual
expression that specifies both the class and distinguishing attribute. A
fundamental challenge, however, has been overlooked: annotation points are
typically placed on class-representative locations (e.g., heads), forcing
models to focus on class-level features while neglecting attribute information
from other visual regions (e.g., legs for "walking"). To address this, we
propose W2-Net, a novel framework that explicitly decouples the problem into
"what to count" and "where to see" via a dual-query mechanism. Specifically,
alongside the standard what-to-count (w2c) queries that localize the object, we
introduce dedicated where-to-see (w2s) queries. The w2s queries are guided to
seek and extract features from attribute-specific visual regions, enabling
precise subclass discrimination. Furthermore, we introduce Subclass Separable
Matching (SSM), a novel matching strategy that incorporates a repulsive force
to enhance inter-subclass separability during label assignment. W2-Net
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on the REC-8K dataset, reducing
counting error by 22.5% (validation) and 18.0% (test), and improving
localization F1 by 7% and 8%, respectively. Code will be available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A modular StrokeSeg framework decouples preprocessing, inference, and postprocessing to create deployable stroke lesion segmentation tools; using ONNX with Float16 halves model size and matches PyTorch performance on 300 subjects, available as Python scripts and a Windows executable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art brain lesion segmentation models (e.g., nnU-Net) are powerful but hard to deploy clinically due to heavy dependencies and monolithic designs; there is a need for portable, clinician-friendly tools.

Method: Decouple pipeline: preprocessing via Anima toolbox with BIDS-compliant outputs; inference with ONNX Runtime using Float16 quantisation to reduce size; postprocessing integrated as needed; provide GUI and CLI interfaces; distribution as Python scripts and a standalone Windows executable.

Result: On a held-out set of 300 sub-acute and chronic stroke subjects, segmentation performance was equivalent to the original PyTorch pipeline (Dice difference < 0.001); model size reduced by ~50% due to quantisation.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that high-performing research pipelines can be transformed into portable, clinically usable tools, enabling deployment of state-of-the-art stroke lesion segmentation in clinical settings.

Abstract: Deep learning frameworks such as nnU-Net achieve state-of-the-art performance
in brain lesion segmentation but remain difficult to deploy clinically due to
heavy dependencies and monolithic design. We introduce \textit{StrokeSeg}, a
modular and lightweight framework that translates research-grade stroke lesion
segmentation models into deployable applications. Preprocessing, inference, and
postprocessing are decoupled: preprocessing relies on the Anima toolbox with
BIDS-compliant outputs, and inference uses ONNX Runtime with \texttt{Float16}
quantisation, reducing model size by about 50\%. \textit{StrokeSeg} provides
both graphical and command-line interfaces and is distributed as Python scripts
and as a standalone Windows executable. On a held-out set of 300 sub-acute and
chronic stroke subjects, segmentation performance was equivalent to the
original PyTorch pipeline (Dice difference $<10^{-3}$), demonstrating that
high-performing research pipelines can be transformed into portable, clinically
usable tools.

*Zhuangfan Huang,Xiaosong Li,Gao Wang,Tao Ye,Haishu Tan,Huafeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A luminance-aware multi-scale network (MLSN) fuses polarized images (S0 and DOLP) to reveal surface texture and material properties under complex lighting. It introduces a brightness-driven encoder, global-local fusion via windowed self-attention, and a brightness-enhancement decoder, plus MSP, a 1000-image polarization dataset for 17 lighting scenes. It reports state-of-the-art gains on MSP, PIF, and GAND datasets, with notable MS-SSIM and SD improvements, and provides code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Polarization images carry complementary texture cues but fusion is challenged by varying luminance and contrast across images. There is a scarcity of high-quality polarized fusion datasets; a robust, luminance-aware fusion model is needed to preserve texture and material properties under diverse lighting.

Method: An encoder-decoder network (MLSN) with: (1) a brightness-branch that produces a multi-scale spatial weight matrix to inject luminance into feature maps; (2) a global-local feature fusion mechanism at the bottleneck using windowed self-attention with residual connections; (3) a Brightness-Enhancement module in the decoder that maps luminance distribution to texture features for nonlinear luminance correction; (4) MSP dataset of 1000 polarized image pairs across 17 indoor/outdoor lighting scenarios providing four-direction polarization raw maps; (5) training/evaluation on MSP, PIF, and GAND datasets with MS-SSIM and SD as metrics.

Result: The MLSN approach outperforms state-of-the-art polarization image fusion methods on subjective and objective evaluations. Reported improvements include MS-SSIM, SD and other metrics with percentage gains (e.g., 8.57%, 60.64%, 10.26%, 63.53%, 22.21%, 54.31% across metrics). MSP dataset is introduced to address data scarcity and enable robust evaluation.

Conclusion: MLSN effectively integrates luminance cues and multi-scale context for robust polarization image fusion under complex lighting. The MSP dataset helps advance evaluation in this domain, and the accompanying code is publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Polarization image fusion combines S0 and DOLP images to reveal surface
roughness and material properties through complementary texture features, which
has important applications in camouflage recognition, tissue pathology
analysis, surface defect detection and other fields. To intergrate
coL-Splementary information from different polarized images in complex
luminance environment, we propose a luminance-aware multi-scale network (MLSN).
In the encoder stage, we propose a multi-scale spatial weight matrix through a
brightness-branch , which dynamically weighted inject the luminance into the
feature maps, solving the problem of inherent contrast difference in polarized
images. The global-local feature fusion mechanism is designed at the bottleneck
layer to perform windowed self-attention computation, to balance the global
context and local details through residual linking in the feature dimension
restructuring stage. In the decoder stage, to further improve the adaptability
to complex lighting, we propose a Brightness-Enhancement module, establishing
the mapping relationship between luminance distribution and texture features,
realizing the nonlinear luminance correction of the fusion result. We also
present MSP, an 1000 pairs of polarized images that covers 17 types of indoor
and outdoor complex lighting scenes. MSP provides four-direction polarization
raw maps, solving the scarcity of high-quality datasets in polarization image
fusion. Extensive experiment on MSP, PIF and GAND datasets verify that the
proposed MLSN outperms the state-of-the-art methods in subjective and objective
evaluations, and the MS-SSIM and SD metircs are higher than the average values
of other methods by 8.57%, 60.64%, 10.26%, 63.53%, 22.21%, and 54.31%,
respectively. The source code and dataset is avalable at

### [50] [When are radiology reports useful for training medical image classifiers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24385)
*Herman Bergstr√∂m,Zhongqi Yue,Fredrik D. Johansson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A study on using radiology reports to train medical image classifiers, showing that reports help during pre-training only when labels are well represented in text; explicit image-text alignment can hurt otherwise. Fine-tuning with reports often yields substantial gains, sometimes more than pre-training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiology reports contain rich expert annotations that could improve image-based predictions, but leveraging them at scale requires understanding when they are beneficial and how best to use them during pre-training and fine-tuning across diagnostic and prognostic tasks.

Method: Systematic study comparing pre-training (with and without image-text alignment) and fine-tuning using reports, across diagnostic and prognostic tasks (e.g., 12-month readmission), and under varying training set sizes.

Result: Pre-training with reports benefits downstream tasks only when labels are well-represented in text; explicit image-text alignment can be detrimental when the text-label relationship is weak. Fine-tuning with reports yields significant improvements and can surpass pre-training in some settings.

Conclusion: Provides actionable guidance on when and how to leverage privileged radiology text data: use reports to enhance fine-tuning, exercise caution with image-text alignment during pre-training, and identify task-label/text correlations to maximize gains, while noting gaps for future research.

Abstract: Medical images used to train machine learning models are often accompanied by
radiology reports containing rich expert annotations. However, relying on these
reports as inputs for clinical prediction requires the timely manual work of a
trained radiologist. This raises a natural question: when can radiology reports
be leveraged during training to improve image-only classification? Prior works
are limited to evaluating pre-trained image representations by fine-tuning them
to predict diagnostic labels, often extracted from reports, ignoring tasks with
labels that are weakly associated with the text. To address this gap, we
conduct a systematic study of how radiology reports can be used during both
pre-training and fine-tuning, across diagnostic and prognostic tasks (e.g.,
12-month readmission), and under varying training set sizes. Our findings
reveal that: (1) Leveraging reports during pre-training is beneficial for
downstream classification tasks where the label is well-represented in the
text; however, pre-training through explicit image-text alignment can be
detrimental in settings where it's not; (2) Fine-tuning with reports can lead
to significant improvements and even have a larger impact than the pre-training
method in certain settings. These results provide actionable insights into when
and how to leverage privileged text data to train medical image classifiers
while highlighting gaps in current research.

*Youwan Mah√©,Elise Bannier,St√©phanie Leplaideur,Elisa Fromont,Francesca Galassi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised flow-based anomaly detection (REFLECT) trained on healthy brains (IXI) outperforms stroke-lesion-free training (ATLAS) for detecting post-stroke focal and non-lesional abnormalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-stroke MRI reveals focal lesions and secondary structural changes; such abnormalities are important biomarkers but poorly captured by supervised segmentation. The study assesses whether a flow-based unsupervised detector can uncover both focal and non-lesional abnormalities and how training data (healthy vs stroke- lesion-free brains) affects performance.

Method: REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, used for unsupervised anomaly detection. Dual-expert central-slice annotations on ATLAS; object-level evaluation with Free-Response ROC for anomaly maps. Two models trained on lesion-free slices from stroke patients (ATLAS) and on healthy controls (IXI); tested on ATLAS subjects.

Result: On ATLAS test subjects, the IXI-trained model achieved higher lesion segmentation Dice (0.37) than the ATLAS-trained model (0.27) and improved sensitivity to non-lesional abnormalities (FROC 0.62 vs 0.43).

Conclusion: Training on fully healthy anatomy improves modelling of normal variability, enabling broader and more reliable detection of structural abnormalities after stroke.

Abstract: Post-stroke MRI not only delineates focal lesions but also reveals secondary
structural changes, such as atrophy and ventricular enlargement. These
abnormalities, increasingly recognised as imaging biomarkers of recovery and
outcome, remain poorly captured by supervised segmentation methods. We evaluate
REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, for unsupervised detection of both
focal and non-lesional abnormalities in post-stroke patients. Using dual-expert
central-slice annotations on ATLAS data, performance was assessed at the object
level with Free-Response ROC analysis for anomaly maps. Two models were trained
on lesion-free slices from stroke patients (ATLAS) and on healthy controls
(IXI) to test the effect of training data. On ATLAS test subjects, the
IXI-trained model achieved higher lesion segmentation (Dice = 0.37 vs 0.27) and
improved sensitivity to non-lesional abnormalities (FROC = 0.62 vs 0.43).
Training on fully healthy anatomy improves the modelling of normal variability,
enabling broader and more reliable detection of structural abnormalities.

*Ali Ahmad Faour,Nabil Amacha,Ali J. Ghandour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sensor-free, satellite-based framework estimating reservoir volume from surface area using water-segmentation and SVR, achieving high accuracy and enabling near real-time, sensor-independent monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses unreliable ground sensors, limited maintenance, and need for long-term storage-volume data for water management, climate research, and disaster resilience. A cost-effective, scalable solution for continuous reservoir monitoring.

Method: Process Sentinel-2 and Landsat imagery; delineate surface water with a new water segmentation index; train an SVR model on a bathymetry-informed dataset (water surface area, water level, volume) to predict volume from surface area alone; use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning; aim for near real-time, sensor-free estimates.

Result: Water segmentation aligns with ground truth for >95% of shoreline. Optimized SVR yields error <1.5% of full reservoir capacity and R^2 > 0.98. Demonstrates robustness, cost-effectiveness, and replicability; supports 50 years of time-series data for climate/environmental studies.

Conclusion: The approach provides a sensor-independent, scalable method for continuous reservoir storage monitoring that can be replicated for other water bodies and supports long-term analyses of climate change impacts and hydrological patterns.

Abstract: The sustainable management of the Qaraaoun Reservoir, the largest surface
water body in Lebanon located in the Bekaa Plain, depends on reliable
monitoring of its storage volume despite frequent sensor malfunctions and
limited maintenance capacity. This study introduces a sensor-free approach that
integrates open-source satellite imagery, advanced water-extent segmentation,
and machine learning to estimate the reservoir surface area and volume in near
real time. Sentinel-2 and Landsat images are processed, where surface water is
delineated using a newly proposed water segmentation index. A machine learning
model based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) is trained on a curated dataset
that includes water surface area, water level, and water volume calculations
using a reservoir bathymetry survey. The model is then able to estimate
reservoir volume relying solely on surface area extracted from satellite
imagery, without the need for ground measurements. Water segmentation using the
proposed index aligns with ground truth for more than 95 percent of the
shoreline. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV yields an optimized SVR
performance with error under 1.5 percent of full reservoir capacity and
coefficients of determination exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate the
robustness and cost-effectiveness of the method, offering a practical solution
for continuous, sensor-independent monitoring of reservoir storage. The
proposed methodology can be replicated for other water bodies, and the
resulting 50 years of time-series data is valuable for research on climate
change and environmental patterns.

### [53] [XAI Evaluation Framework for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24414)
*Reem Hammoud,Abdul karim Gizzini,Ali J. Ghandour*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework for evaluating XAI in semantic segmentation using pixel-level metrics and CAM-based schemes; demonstrates robustness and reliability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic segmentation requires spatial and contextual interpretability; existing XAI evaluation centers on classification, lacking rigorous, fine‚Äëgrained tools for segmentation in safety-critical contexts.

Method: Proposes a systematic evaluation framework with pixel-level evaluation strategies and tailored metrics for segmentation; adapts CAM-based XAI methods for segmentation; validates via simulations.

Result: Delivers fine-grained interpretability insights and shows the framework's efficiency, robustness, and reliability in assessing XAI for semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: Advances transparent, trustworthy semantic segmentation by providing a rigorous, fine-grained evaluation framework for XAI methods, enabling better trade-offs and accountability.

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in artificial intelligence (AI) models is
essential, particularly as they are increasingly applied in safety-critical and
high-stakes domains. Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a promising approach
to address this challenge, yet the rigorous evaluation of XAI methods remains
crucial for optimizing the trade-offs between model complexity, predictive
performance, and interpretability. While extensive progress has been achieved
in evaluating XAI techniques for classification tasks, evaluation strategies
tailored to semantic segmentation remain relatively underexplored. This work
introduces a comprehensive and systematic evaluation framework specifically
designed for assessing XAI in semantic segmentation, explicitly accounting for
both spatial and contextual task complexities. The framework employs
pixel-level evaluation strategies and carefully designed metrics to provide
fine-grained interpretability insights. Simulation results using recently
adapted class activation mapping (CAM)-based XAI schemes demonstrate the
efficiency, robustness, and reliability of the proposed methodology. These
findings contribute to advancing transparent, trustworthy, and accountable
semantic segmentation models.

### [54] [Deeply-Conditioned Image Compression via Self-Generated Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24437)
*Zhineng Zhao,Zhihai He,Zikun Zhou,Siwei Ma,Yaowei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces DCIC-sgp, a learned image compression method using a self-generated prior to deeply condition the entire pipeline, especially the analysis transform, enabling disentangled representation of global structure and local textures to reduce geometric deformation at low bitrates, achieving BD-rate reductions of ~14‚Äì15% against VTM-12.1 on Kodak, CLIC, and Tecnick.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional learned image compression (LIC) struggles to model complex correlations in natural images, particularly the entanglement of invariant global structures with transient local textures within a single monolithic representation, causing geometric deformation at low bitrates.

Method: Encode a strong self-generated prior that captures the image's structural backbone and use it to condition the entire compression pipeline (deep conditioning), especially the analysis transform, so it allocates capacity to residual high-entropy details, enabling hierarchical, dependency-driven information streams.

Result: Empirical results show visual improvements with reduced geometric deformation artifacts at low bitrates and quantitative BD-rate reductions of 14.4% (Kodak), 15.7% (CLIC), and 15.1% (Tecnick) against VVC test model VTM-12.1.

Conclusion: Deep conditioning with self-generated priors enables effective disentanglement of structure and texture in LIC, yielding competitive rate-distortion performance and alleviating geometric deformation issues at low bitrates.

Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) has shown great promise for achieving high
rate-distortion performance. However, current LIC methods are often limited in
their capability to model the complex correlation structures inherent in
natural images, particularly the entanglement of invariant global structures
with transient local textures within a single monolithic representation. This
limitation precipitates severe geometric deformation at low bitrates. To
address this, we introduce a framework predicated on functional decomposition,
which we term Deeply-Conditioned Image Compression via self-generated priors
(DCIC-sgp). Our central idea is to first encode a potent, self-generated prior
to encapsulate the image's structural backbone. This prior is subsequently
utilized not as mere side-information, but to holistically modulate the entire
compression pipeline. This deep conditioning, most critically of the analysis
transform, liberates it to dedicate its representational capacity to the
residual, high-entropy details. This hierarchical, dependency-driven approach
achieves an effective disentanglement of information streams. Our extensive
experiments validate this assertion; visual analysis demonstrates that our
method substantially mitigates the geometric deformation artifacts that plague
conventional codecs at low bitrates. Quantitatively, our framework establishes
highly competitive performance, achieving significant BD-rate reductions of
14.4%, 15.7%, and 15.1% against the VVC test model VTM-12.1 on the Kodak, CLIC,
and Tecnick datasets.

*Pablo Acuaviva,Aram Davtyan,Mariam Hassan,Sebastian Stapf,Ahmad Rahimi,Alexandre Alahi,Paolo Favaro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video diffusion models pretrained on spatiotemporal data show strong inductive biases for structure and dynamics, enabling higher data efficiency and broader task adaptability in vision tasks compared to language-model-based approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to bridge the gap between the success of large language models in the language domain and their limited transfer to the visual domain by exploring how video pretraining can provide architectural priors and inductive biases that improve visual problem solving and sample efficiency.

Method: The authors design a controlled evaluation by pairing pretrained LLMs and pretrained VDMs with lightweight adapters and testing them on tasks in their natural modalities across benchmarks such as ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games, route planning, and cellular automata to compare data efficiency and adaptability.

Result: VDMs demonstrate higher data efficiency than language models in the evaluated tasks, supporting the hypothesis that video pretraining supplies inductive biases conducive to broader visual task adaptability.

Conclusion: Video pretraining offers inductive biases for structure and dynamics that can advance visual foundation models, suggesting a productive direction for cross-domain generality and sample-efficient visual reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that large-scale pretraining
enables systems to adapt rapidly to new problems with little supervision in the
language domain. This success, however, has not translated as effectively to
the visual domain, where models, including LLMs, continue to struggle with
compositional understanding, sample efficiency, and general-purpose
problem-solving. We investigate Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) as a promising
direction for bridging this gap. Pretraining on spatiotemporal data endows
these models with strong inductive biases for structure and dynamics, which we
hypothesize can support broad task adaptability. To test this, we design a
controlled evaluation in which both a pretrained LLM and a pretrained VDM are
equipped with lightweight adapters and presented with tasks in their natural
modalities. Across benchmarks including ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games,
route planning, and cellular automata, VDMs demonstrate higher data efficiency
than their language counterparts. Taken together, our results indicate that
video pretraining offers inductive biases that support progress toward visual
foundation models.

### [57] [Kineo: Calibration-Free Metric Motion Capture From Sparse RGB Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24464)
*Charles Javerliat,Pierre Raimbaud,Guillaume Lavou√©*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Kineo is a fully automatic, calibration-free multi-view markerless mocap pipeline for unsynchronized, uncalibrated consumer RGB cameras that achieves metric-scale 3D reconstruction using 2D keypoints, with a robust confidence-based sampling and graph optimization, plus a pairwise reprojection score; it shows large accuracy gains and real-world efficiency, with code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calibration-free markerless motion capture is appealing for accessibility and in-the-wild captures, but existing calibration-free methods suffer from high computational cost and reduced reconstruction accuracy; Kineo aims to remove calibration requirements while delivering metric-scale accuracy at fixed computational cost.

Method: Kineo uses 2D keypoints from off-the-shelf detectors to jointly calibrate cameras (including Brown-Conrady distortion coefficients) and reconstruct 3D keypoints and dense scene maps at metric scale. It employs a confidence-driven spatio-temporal keypoint sampling strategy and graph-based global optimization, ensuring robust calibration with a computational cost independent of sequence length, and introduces a pairwise reprojection consensus score to assess 3D reconstruction reliability.

Result: On EgoHumans and Human3.6M, Kineo yields substantial improvements over prior calibration-free methods, reducing camera translation error by ~83‚Äì85%, camera angular error by ~86‚Äì92%, and world MPJPE by ~83‚Äì91%. It is also efficient in real-world usage, processing multi-view sequences faster than their duration (e.g., 36 minutes to process 1 hour 20 minutes). The full pipeline and evaluation code are publicly released.

Conclusion: Kineo enables practical, robust calibration-free markerless mocap at metric scale with strong accuracy and efficiency gains, supporting reproducibility and broad adoption.

Abstract: Markerless multiview motion capture is often constrained by the need for
precise camera calibration, limiting accessibility for non-experts and
in-the-wild captures. Existing calibration-free approaches mitigate this
requirement but suffer from high computational cost and reduced reconstruction
accuracy.
  We present Kineo, a fully automatic, calibration-free pipeline for markerless
motion capture from videos captured by unsynchronized, uncalibrated,
consumer-grade RGB cameras. Kineo leverages 2D keypoints from off-the-shelf
detectors to simultaneously calibrate cameras, including Brown-Conrady
distortion coefficients, and reconstruct 3D keypoints and dense scene point
maps at metric scale. A confidence-driven spatio-temporal keypoint sampling
strategy, combined with graph-based global optimization, ensures robust
calibration at a fixed computational cost independent of sequence length. We
further introduce a pairwise reprojection consensus score to quantify 3D
reconstruction reliability for downstream tasks.
  Evaluations on EgoHumans and Human3.6M demonstrate substantial improvements
over prior calibration-free methods. Compared to previous state-of-the-art
approaches, Kineo reduces camera translation error by approximately 83-85%,
camera angular error by 86-92%, and world mean-per-joint error (W-MPJPE) by
83-91%.
  Kineo is also efficient in real-world scenarios, processing multi-view
sequences faster than their duration in specific configuration (e.g., 36min to
process 1h20min of footage). The full pipeline and evaluation code are openly
released to promote reproducibility and practical adoption at

### [58] [Decoupled MeanFlow: Turning Flow Models into Flow Maps for Accelerated Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24474)
*Kyungmin Lee,Sihyun Yu,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Decoupled MeanFlow converts pretrained flow models into flow-map decoders without changing architecture, enabling 1-4 step fast sampling with state-of-the-art 1-step FID on ImageNet and dramatic 100x inference speed-up; training flow models then converting is more efficient than training flow maps from scratch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce sampling cost in denoising generative models while preserving compatibility with pretrained flow models by decoupling training from architecture.

Method: Introduce Decoupled MeanFlow decoding strategy: modify final blocks of diffusion transformers to condition on the next timestep, allowing pretrained flow models to be repurposed as flow maps; pair with enhanced training techniques.

Result: Achieves 1-step FID of 2.16 (256x256) and 2.12 (512x512); 4-step FID of 1.51 and 1.68, nearly matching flow models with over 100x faster inference; training flow models then converting is more efficient than training flow maps from scratch.

Conclusion: Decoupled MeanFlow enables efficient, high-quality fast sampling without architectural changes, leveraging pretrained flow models to match flow-map performance with minimal steps and major speedups.

Abstract: Denoising generative models, such as diffusion and flow-based models, produce
high-quality samples but require many denoising steps due to discretization
error. Flow maps, which estimate the average velocity between timesteps,
mitigate this error and enable faster sampling. However, their training
typically demands architectural changes that limit compatibility with
pretrained flow models. We introduce Decoupled MeanFlow, a simple decoding
strategy that converts flow models into flow map models without architectural
modifications. Our method conditions the final blocks of diffusion transformers
on the subsequent timestep, allowing pretrained flow models to be directly
repurposed as flow maps. Combined with enhanced training techniques, this
design enables high-quality generation in as few as 1 to 4 steps. Notably, we
find that training flow models and subsequently converting them is more
efficient and effective than training flow maps from scratch. On ImageNet
256x256 and 512x512, our models attain 1-step FID of 2.16 and 2.12,
respectively, surpassing prior art by a large margin. Furthermore, we achieve
FID of 1.51 and 1.68 when increasing the steps to 4, which nearly matches the
performance of flow models while delivering over 100x faster inference.

*Tinsae G. Dulecha,Leonardo Righetto,Ruggero Pintus,Enrico Gobbetti,Andrea Giachetti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A knowledge-distillation-based approach (DisK-NeuralRTI) to reduce rendering cost of NeuralRTI while preserving quality for interactive full-resolution RTI relighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RTI methods like PTM/HSH are fast but lack full reflectance fidelity; NeuralRTI improves quality but with high per-frame cost due to a large decoder. Smaller networks previously failed to provide valid results, creating a cost bottleneck for interactive, high-resolution relighting on limited hardware.

Method: Introduce a knowledge distillation framework: train a compact student network to imitate a high-capacity teacher NeuralRTI decoder, yielding DisK-NeuralRTI with lower inference cost but similar visual fidelity.

Result: The proposed approach aims to substantially reduce computational cost and enable interactive relighting at full resolution on modest hardware, addressing the primary bottleneck of NeuralRTI.

Conclusion: Distilling a powerful neural RTI decoder into a compact model is a viable path to practical, real-time RTI systems (DisK-NeuralRTI).

Abstract: Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) is very popular for its ability to
visually analyze surfaces by enhancing surface details through interactive
relighting, starting from only a few tens of photographs taken with a fixed
camera and variable illumination. Traditional methods like Polynomial Texture
Maps (PTM) and Hemispherical Harmonics (HSH) are compact and fast, but struggle
to accurately capture complex reflectance fields using few per-pixel
coefficients and fixed bases, leading to artifacts, especially in highly
reflective or shadowed areas. The NeuralRTI approach, which exploits a neural
autoencoder to learn a compact function that better approximates the local
reflectance as a function of light directions, has been shown to produce
superior quality at comparable storage cost. However, as it performs
interactive relighting with custom decoder networks with many parameters, the
rendering step is computationally expensive and not feasible at full resolution
for large images on limited hardware. Earlier attempts to reduce costs by
directly training smaller networks have failed to produce valid results. For
this reason, we propose to reduce its computational cost through a novel
solution based on Knowledge Distillation (DisK-NeuralRTI). ...

### [60] [Latent Sketchpad: Sketching Visual Thoughts to Elicit Multimodal Reasoning in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24514)
*Huanyu Zhang,Wenshan Wu,Chengzu Li,Ning Shang,Yan Xia,Yangyu Huang,Yifan Zhang,Li Dong,Zhang Zhang,Liang Wang,Tieniu Tan,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Latent Sketchpad adds an internal visual scratchpad to Multimodal LLMs by generating visual latent representations during autoregressive reasoning and rendering them into sketches, enabling visual thinking and interpretability while maintaining or improving reasoning performance. Evaluated on MazePlanning, it generalizes across frontier models (Gemma3, Qwen2.5-VL).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans use sketches as a form of visual thinking to develop and communicate ideas. MLLMs excel at perception but struggle with complex planning that benefits from mental visualization. The work aims to fuse visual generation with reasoning to enhance planning capabilities and interpretability.

Method: Integrates two components into frontier MLLMs: (1) a Context-Aware Vision Head that autoregressively produces visual representations (latent sketches) aligned with the ongoing textual reasoning, and (2) a pretrained Sketch Decoder that renders these latents into human-interpretable sketch images. The visual latents are interleaved with, and influence, the model's autoregressive reasoning. Evaluation is conducted on a new MazePlanning dataset across multiple MLLMs (e.g., Gemma3, Qwen2.5-VL).

Result: The Latent Sketchpad framework achieves comparable or superior reasoning performance to the backbone models and generalizes to different frontier LLMs (Gemma3, Qwen2.5-VL). The latent visuals can be translated into sketch images, providing interpretable insight into the model‚Äôs thought process without compromising reasoning ability.

Conclusion: Extending textual reasoning with an internal visual thinking process broadens the scope of human‚Äìcomputer interaction and potential applications. The approach is model-agnostic across frontier MLLMs and offers a pathway to richer, more interpretable AI that combines planning with visualization.

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding,
they often struggle in complex scenarios that require visual planning and
imagination. Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking
to develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework
that equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual
representations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual
understanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without
compromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach
integrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive
reasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the
generation of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process
and can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this,
we introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively
produces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these
into human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset
MazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad

### [61] [OSWorld-MCP: Benchmarking MCP Tool Invocation In Computer-Use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24563)
*Hongrui Jia,Jitong Liao,Xi Zhang,Haiyang Xu,Tianbao Xie,Chaoya Jiang,Ming Yan,Si Liu,Wei Ye,Fei Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OSWorld-MCP introduces a comprehensive, fair benchmark for evaluating multimodal agents on tool invocation, GUI interaction, and decision-making in real-world settings, using a large catalog of validated MCP-enabled tools; results show MCP tools boost task success but tool usage remains relatively low, highlighting room for progress and the benchmark's challenge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of fair, integrated evaluation of tool invocation capabilities in multimodal agents, which commonly focus only on GUI interactions, thereby misrepresenting overall agent competence in real-world tool usage.

Method: Developed OSWorld-MCP with an automated pipeline that generates tools and curates 158 high-quality MCP-enabled tools across 7 applications. Conducted manual validation and extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal agents, measuring task success and tool invocation rates at various step counts.

Result: Tool-enabled interactions improved performance (e.g., OpenAI o3: 8.3%‚Üí20.4% at 15 steps; Claude 4 Sonnet: 40.1%‚Üí43.3% at 50 steps). Overall tool invocation rate among strongest models was 36.3%, indicating substantial room for improvement; the benchmark reveals the importance and difficulty of evaluating tool usage in real-world tasks.

Conclusion: OSWorld-MCP sets a new standard for evaluating complex, tool-assisted decision-making in multimodal agents, highlighting the need to measure tool invocation explicitly and encouraging further advancement in model capabilities and benchmark design; the authors provide code, environment, and data publicly.

Abstract: With advances in decision-making and reasoning capabilities, multimodal
agents show strong potential in computer application scenarios. Past
evaluations have mainly assessed GUI interaction skills, while tool invocation
abilities, such as those enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), have been
largely overlooked. Comparing agents with integrated tool invocation to those
evaluated only on GUI interaction is inherently unfair. We present OSWorld-MCP,
the first comprehensive and fair benchmark for assessing computer-use agents'
tool invocation, GUI operation, and decision-making abilities in a real-world
environment. We design a novel automated code-generation pipeline to create
tools and combine them with a curated selection from existing tools. Rigorous
manual validation yields 158 high-quality tools (covering 7 common
applications), each verified for correct functionality, practical
applicability, and versatility. Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art
multimodal agents on OSWorld-MCP show that MCP tools generally improve task
success rates (e.g., from 8.3% to 20.4% for OpenAI o3 at 15 steps, from 40.1%
to 43.3% for Claude 4 Sonnet at 50 steps), underscoring the importance of
assessing tool invocation capabilities. However, even the strongest models have
relatively low tool invocation rates, Only 36.3%, indicating room for
improvement and highlighting the benchmark's challenge. By explicitly measuring
MCP tool usage skills, OSWorld-MCP deepens understanding of multimodal agents
and sets a new standard for evaluating performance in complex, tool-assisted
environments. Our code, environment, and data are publicly available at

*Xu Jiang,Huiying Pan,Ligen Shi,Jianing Sun,Wenfeng Xu,Xing Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning‚Äìbased scatter artifact correction for CBCT that models the point scatter function with Gaussian radial basis functions and a Kolmogorov‚ÄìArnold Network layer, leveraging rotational symmetry; validated on synthetic and real data with superior quantitative performance over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT scatter causes CT value bias and reduced tissue contrast, harming diagnostic accuracy; a physics-informed DL approach can better represent scatter and restore image quality.

Method: Model point scatter with Gaussian RBFs; integrate into a Kolmogorov‚ÄìArnold Network to enable nonlinear mapping; exploit rotational symmetry in projection domain; validate on synthetic and real-scan datasets.

Result: Demonstrates effective scatter correction in reconstructed images and outperforms current methods on quantitative metrics.

Conclusion: The proposed physics-informed DL framework improves CBCT scatter correction, combining physical priors with powerful nonlinear learning, and generalizes to both synthetic and real data.

Abstract: Cone-beam CT (CBCT) employs a flat-panel detector to achieve
three-dimensional imaging with high spatial resolution. However, CBCT is
susceptible to scatter during data acquisition, which introduces CT value bias
and reduced tissue contrast in the reconstructed images, ultimately degrading
diagnostic accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning-based
scatter artifact correction method inspired by physical prior knowledge.
Leveraging the fact that the observed point scatter probability density
distribution exhibits rotational symmetry in the projection domain. The method
uses Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to model the point scatter function
and embeds it into the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) layer, which provides
efficient nonlinear mapping capabilities for learning high-dimensional scatter
features. By incorporating the physical characteristics of the scattered photon
distribution together with the complex function mapping capacity of KAN, the
model improves its ability to accurately represent scatter. The effectiveness
of the method is validated through both synthetic and real-scan experiments.
Experimental results show that the model can effectively correct the scatter
artifacts in the reconstructed images and is superior to the current methods in
terms of quantitative metrics.

*Xin Zhang,Yuqi Song,Fei Zuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-branch RGB+frequency CNN with channel attention and FSC Loss for robust face forgery detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the DiFF benchmark and surpassing average human accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rapid advances in generative AI enable highly realistic forged faces, threatening AI security, digital media integrity, and public trust. There is an urgent need for robust, generalizable face forgery detectors as a key component of AI security infrastructure.

Method: A dual-branch convolutional neural network. The RGB branch captures semantic information; the frequency branch targets high-frequency artifacts that are hard for generative models to suppress. A channel attention module adaptively fuses these heterogeneous features. A unified FSC Loss combines focal loss, supervised contrastive loss, and a frequency center margin loss to improve class separability and robustness.

Result: The model achieves strong performance across all DiFF categories (text-to-image, image-to-image, face swap, face edit) and outperforms average human accuracy on the benchmark.

Conclusion: The proposed approach is effective and generalizable for face forgery detection, contributing to AI security infrastructure by enabling robust detection of diverse forgery techniques.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly
realistic forged facial images, posing significant threats to AI security,
digital media integrity, and public trust. Face forgery techniques, ranging
from face swapping and attribute editing to powerful diffusion-based image
synthesis, are increasingly being used for malicious purposes such as
misinformation, identity fraud, and defamation. This growing challenge
underscores the urgent need for robust and generalizable face forgery detection
methods as a critical component of AI security infrastructure. In this work, we
propose a novel dual-branch convolutional neural network for face forgery
detection that leverages complementary cues from both spatial and frequency
domains. The RGB branch captures semantic information, while the frequency
branch focuses on high-frequency artifacts that are difficult for generative
models to suppress. A channel attention module is introduced to adaptively fuse
these heterogeneous features, highlighting the most informative channels for
forgery discrimination. To guide the network's learning process, we design a
unified loss function, FSC Loss, that combines focal loss, supervised
contrastive loss, and a frequency center margin loss to enhance class
separability and robustness. We evaluate our model on the DiFF benchmark, which
includes forged images generated from four representative methods:
text-to-image, image-to-image, face swap, and face edit. Our method achieves
strong performance across all categories and outperforms average human
accuracy. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness and its potential
contribution to safeguarding AI ecosystems against visual forgery attacks.

TL;DR: PathoGaze1.0 is a large multimodal behavioral dataset of pathologists diagnosing cancer on giga-pixel WSIs, enabling study of gaze and decision processes and potential AI‚Äìhuman collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of behavioral data to explain diagnostic errors and inconsistencies in WSI interpretation; aims to improve training for pathologists and to support AI systems that assist human experts, with ecological validity through an application-grounded testbed.

Method: Data were collected from 19 pathologists interpreting 397 whole-slide images (WSIs) using the PTAH testbed, recording 18.69 hours of multimodal data (eye-tracking, mouse interactions, stimulus tracking, viewport navigation, and diagnostic decisions). The study was preregistered, and the complete dataset and analysis code are public.

Result: The dataset comprises 171,909 fixations, 263,320 saccades, and 1,867,362 mouse interaction events, across 19 participants and 397 WSIs, providing a rich resource for analyzing diagnostic behavior and training AI or human-in-the-loop systems.

Conclusion: PathoGaze1.0 offers a comprehensive, ecologically valid resource to understand diagnostic variability and to support education and AI-assisted pathology, with public availability of data and code for reproducible research.

Abstract: Interpretation of giga-pixel whole-slide images (WSIs) is an important but
difficult task for pathologists. Their diagnostic accuracy is estimated to
average around 70%. Adding a second pathologist does not substantially improve
decision consistency. The field lacks adequate behavioral data to explain
diagnostic errors and inconsistencies. To fill in this gap, we present
PathoGaze1.0, a comprehensive behavioral dataset capturing the dynamic visual
search and decision-making processes of the full diagnostic workflow during
cancer diagnosis. The dataset comprises 18.69 hours of eye-tracking, mouse
interaction, stimulus tracking, viewport navigation, and diagnostic decision
data (EMSVD) collected from 19 pathologists interpreting 397 WSIs. The data
collection process emphasizes ecological validity through an
application-grounded testbed, called PTAH. In total, we recorded 171,909
fixations, 263,320 saccades, and 1,867,362 mouse interaction events. In
addition, such data could also be used to improve the training of both
pathologists and AI systems that might support human experts. All experiments

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAG introduces Group Relative Attention Guidance to continuously control editing intensity in diffusion-based image editing by reweighting token deltas in DiT's MM-Attention, achieving smoother, more precise edits with minimal code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-in-transformer editing methods lack fine-grained control over editing strength, limiting customization of results.

Method: Investigate MM-Attention bias: Query/Key share a layer-dependent bias; interpret as inherent editing behavior; delta between token and bias encodes content-specific edit signals. Propose GRAG to reweight token deltas, modulating focus relative to editing instruction without tuning.

Result: GRAG can be plugged in with as few as four lines of code, improves editing quality, and provides smoother/more precise control compared with classifier-free guidance.

Conclusion: GRAG is a simple, effective mechanism for continuous editing control in diffusion-based image editing and can be broadly integrated; code will be released.

Abstract: Recently, image editing based on Diffusion-in-Transformer models has
undergone rapid development. However, existing editing methods often lack
effective control over the degree of editing, limiting their ability to achieve
more customized results. To address this limitation, we investigate the
MM-Attention mechanism within the DiT model and observe that the Query and Key
tokens share a bias vector that is only layer-dependent. We interpret this bias
as representing the model's inherent editing behavior, while the delta between
each token and its corresponding bias encodes the content-specific editing
signals. Based on this insight, we propose Group Relative Attention Guidance, a
simple yet effective method that reweights the delta values of different tokens
to modulate the focus of the model on the input image relative to the editing
instruction, enabling continuous and fine-grained control over editing
intensity without any tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on existing image
editing frameworks demonstrate that GRAG can be integrated with as few as four
lines of code, consistently enhancing editing quality. Moreover, compared to
the commonly used Classifier-Free Guidance, GRAG achieves smoother and more
precise control over the degree of editing. Our code will be released at

### [66] [SAGE: Structure-Aware Generative Video Transitions between Diverse Clips](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24667)
*Mia Kan,Yilin Liu,Niloy Mitra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot structure-aware video transition framework (SAGE) that uses line-map and motion-flow guidance with generative synthesis to produce coherent, semantically consistent intermediate frames between diverse clips, without fine-tuning, outperforming classical and generative baselines in both quantitative metrics and user studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video transitions often suffer from artifacts when using simple blending or when bridging clips with large temporal gaps or semantic differences. Existing methods (cross-fades, morphing, frame interpolation, and some generative inbetweening) struggle to maintain structure and perceptual continuity across diverse content, creating a gap for content-aware, visually coherent transitions.

Method: Introduce SAGE (Structure-Aware Generative vidEo transitions), a zero-shot approach that combines structural guidance (line maps and motion flow) with generative synthesis to produce transitions. It leverages alignment of silhouettes and interpolation of salient features to preserve structure without requiring fine-tuning on new clips.

Result: Extensive experiments and comparisons against FILM, TVG, DiffMorpher, VACE, and GI show that SAGE achieves superior performance on quantitative metrics and user studies for transitions between diverse clips.

Conclusion: SAGE demonstrates that explicit structural guidance paired with generative synthesis enables smooth, semantically consistent video transitions across diverse content without fine-tuning, indicating strong potential for professional workflows; code will be released on acceptance.

Abstract: Video transitions aim to synthesize intermediate frames between two clips,
but naive approaches such as linear blending introduce artifacts that limit
professional use or break temporal coherence. Traditional techniques
(cross-fades, morphing, frame interpolation) and recent generative inbetweening
methods can produce high-quality plausible intermediates, but they struggle
with bridging diverse clips involving large temporal gaps or significant
semantic differences, leaving a gap for content-aware and visually coherent
transitions. We address this challenge by drawing on artistic workflows,
distilling strategies such as aligning silhouettes and interpolating salient
features to preserve structure and perceptual continuity. Building on this, we
propose SAGE (Structure-Aware Generative vidEo transitions) as a zeroshot
approach that combines structural guidance, provided via line maps and motion
flow, with generative synthesis, enabling smooth, semantically consistent
transitions without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments and comparison with
current alternatives, namely [FILM, TVG, DiffMorpher, VACE, GI], demonstrate
that SAGE outperforms both classical and generative baselines on quantitative
metrics and user studies for producing transitions between diverse clips. Code

*Yun Zhang,Zhaoliang Zheng,Johnson Liu,Zhiyu Huang,Zewei Zhou,Zonglin Meng,Tianhui Cai,Jiaqi Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIC-BEV is a Transformer-based BEV perception framework for infrastructure-based multi-camera 3D object detection that handles flexible camera counts and heterogeneous camera parameters, with a graph-enhanced fusion module. It introduces the synthetic M2I dataset and achieves state-of-the-art results on M2I and RoScenes, including robustness under extreme weather and sensor degradation; code and data are released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Infrastructure-based intelligent transportation systems require global situational awareness and cooperative perception, but camera-based detectors struggle with multi-view infrastructure setups, varied camera configurations, degraded visual inputs, and diverse road layouts. A robust, flexible fusion approach across heterogeneous cameras is needed, along with datasets that cover realistic variations.

Method: MIC-BEV uses a Transformer-based BEV perception backbone. It features a graph-enhanced fusion module that fuses multi-view image features into BEV space by exploiting geometric relationships between cameras and BEV cells and leveraging latent visual cues. The system supports a variable number of cameras with heterogeneous intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. It additionally introduces M2I, a synthetic dataset with diverse camera configurations, road layouts, and environmental conditions for infrastructure-based object detection.

Result: MIC-BEV achieves state-of-the-art 3D object detection performance on both the synthetic M2I dataset and the real-world RoScenes dataset. It maintains robustness under challenging conditions, including extreme weather and sensor degradation.

Conclusion: MIC-BEV demonstrates that flexible, Transformer-based BEV perception with graph-enhanced fusion is viable for real-world infrastructure-based deployment. The synthetic M2I dataset complements real data to cover diverse configurations. The work provides a promising path toward robust, scalable infrastructure-based perception, with code and data available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Infrastructure-based perception plays a crucial role in intelligent
transportation systems, offering global situational awareness and enabling
cooperative autonomy. However, existing camera-based detection models often
underperform in such scenarios due to challenges such as multi-view
infrastructure setup, diverse camera configurations, degraded visual inputs,
and various road layouts. We introduce MIC-BEV, a Transformer-based
bird's-eye-view (BEV) perception framework for infrastructure-based
multi-camera 3D object detection. MIC-BEV flexibly supports a variable number
of cameras with heterogeneous intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and
demonstrates strong robustness under sensor degradation. The proposed
graph-enhanced fusion module in MIC-BEV integrates multi-view image features
into the BEV space by exploiting geometric relationships between cameras and
BEV cells alongside latent visual cues. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce M2I, a synthetic dataset for infrastructure-based object detection,
featuring diverse camera configurations, road layouts, and environmental
conditions. Extensive experiments on both M2I and the real-world dataset
RoScenes demonstrate that MIC-BEV achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D
object detection. It also remains robust under challenging conditions,
including extreme weather and sensor degradation. These results highlight the
potential of MIC-BEV for real-world deployment. The dataset and source code are

### [68] [Does Object Binding Naturally Emerge in Large Pretrained Vision Transformers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24709)
*Yihao Li,Saeed Salehi,Lyle Ungar,Konrad P. Kording*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised Vision Transformers show emergent object binding (IsSameObject): patches belonging to the same object can be decoded from layer-wise patch embeddings with over 90% accuracy; this binding guides attention and is weak in ImageNet-supervised models, indicating it arises from pretraining objectives, not architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether object binding naturally emerges in pre-trained ViTs and whether it depends on pretraining objectives (self-supervised vs supervised) rather than architecture alone.

Method: Decode a patch-level IsSameObject signal from ViT embeddings across layers using a similarity probe. Compare self-supervised (DINO, MAE, CLIP) versus ImageNet-supervised models. Analyze the dimensionality of the IsSameObject subspace, visualize its influence on attention, and perform ablations removing IsSameObject to assess impact on downstream performance and training objective alignment.

Result: IsSameObject decoded with >90% accuracy; emergent in self-supervised ViTs but weaker in supervised ones; encoded in a low-dimensional subspace atop object features and actively guides attention; ablating it degrades downstream performance and misaligns with the pretraining objective.

Conclusion: ViTs naturally develop object binding, challenging the claim that binding requires explicit object-centric architectures; the emergent binding appears as a beneficial byproduct of self-supervised pretraining and is instrumental for attention and downstream tasks.

Abstract: Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that
collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human
cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object
representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in
memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While
prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention)
explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability
naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they
could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for
downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic
nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two
patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode
IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe,
which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability
emerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker
in ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial
architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining
objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a
low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal
actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations
degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective,
implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining
objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and
highlight how symbolic knowledge of "which parts belong together" emerges
naturally in a connectionist system.

*Yujie Wei,Shiwei Zhang,Hangjie Yuan,Yujin Han,Zhekai Chen,Jiayu Wang,Difan Zou,Xihui Liu,Yingya Zhang,Yu Liu,Hongming Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProMoE introduces a two-step vision MoE with conditional and prototypical routing, plus a routing-contrastive loss, achieving state-of-the-art results on ImageNet with diffusion-based training (Rectified Flow and DDPM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE scaling has boosted language models, but vision MoEs underperform due to fundamental token differences: visual tokens exhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity, hindering expert specialization. Explicit routing guidance is needed to promote specialization in vision models.

Method: A two-step router: (1) conditional routing partitions image tokens into conditional vs unconditional sets by functional role; (2) prototypical routing refines conditional token assignments using learnable prototypes based on semantic content. A similarity-based expert allocation via prototypes and a routing contrastive loss further enhances intra-expert coherence and inter-expert diversity.

Result: Extensive ImageNet experiments show ProMoE surpasses state-of-the-art methods under both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives.

Conclusion: Explicit semantic guidance is crucial for effective vision MoE. ProMoE demonstrates that structured routing and prototypical routing can unlock gains in vision MoE; code and models will be released.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling model
capacity while preserving computational efficiency. Despite its notable success
in large language models (LLMs), existing attempts to apply MoE to Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs) have yielded limited gains. We attribute this gap to
fundamental differences between language and visual tokens. Language tokens are
semantically dense with pronounced inter-token variation, while visual tokens
exhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity, hindering expert
specialization in vision MoE. To this end, we present ProMoE, an MoE framework
featuring a two-step router with explicit routing guidance that promotes expert
specialization. Specifically, this guidance encourages the router to partition
image tokens into conditional and unconditional sets via conditional routing
according to their functional roles, and refine the assignments of conditional
image tokens through prototypical routing with learnable prototypes based on
semantic content. Moreover, the similarity-based expert allocation in latent
space enabled by prototypical routing offers a natural mechanism for
incorporating explicit semantic guidance, and we validate that such guidance is
crucial for vision MoE. Building on this, we propose a routing contrastive loss
that explicitly enhances the prototypical routing process, promoting
intra-expert coherence and inter-expert diversity. Extensive experiments on
ImageNet benchmark demonstrate that ProMoE surpasses state-of-the-art methods
under both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives. Code and models will be
made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: URSA reframes video generation as iterative refinement over discrete spatiotemporal tokens, using Linearized Metric Path and Resolution-dependent Timestep Shifting to scale discrete diffusion to high-resolution, long-duration video with fewer steps; adds asynchronous temporal fine-tuning to support interpolation and image-to-video tasks; outperforms existing discrete methods and rivals continuous diffusion, with code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete diffusion models suffer from error accumulation and long-context inconsistency and lag behind continuous approaches in video generation. A scalable, high-quality discrete framework is needed to close this gap and enable long-horizon, high-resolution video synthesis.

Method: The method treats video generation as iterative global refinement of discrete tokens. It introduces a Linearized Metric Path and a Resolution-dependent Timestep Shifting mechanism to enable efficient scaling to high-resolution images and long-duration videos, with fewer inference steps. An asynchronous temporal fine-tuning strategy unifies tasks like interpolation and image-to-video within a single model.

Result: URSA outperforms existing discrete methods on challenging video and image generation benchmarks and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art continuous diffusion methods, while requiring significantly fewer inference steps.

Conclusion: URSA bridges the gap between discrete and continuous video diffusion, offering a scalable, flexible framework for high-quality, long-duration video generation and multi-task capabilities, with public code and models.

Abstract: Continuous-space video generation has advanced rapidly, while discrete
approaches lag behind due to error accumulation and long-context inconsistency.
In this work, we revisit discrete generative modeling and present Uniform
discRete diffuSion with metric pAth (URSA), a simple yet powerful framework
that bridges the gap with continuous approaches for the scalable video
generation. At its core, URSA formulates the video generation task as an
iterative global refinement of discrete spatiotemporal tokens. It integrates
two key designs: a Linearized Metric Path and a Resolution-dependent Timestep
Shifting mechanism. These designs enable URSA to scale efficiently to
high-resolution image synthesis and long-duration video generation, while
requiring significantly fewer inference steps. Additionally, we introduce an
asynchronous temporal fine-tuning strategy that unifies versatile tasks within
a single model, including interpolation and image-to-video generation.
Extensive experiments on challenging video and image generation benchmarks
demonstrate that URSA consistently outperforms existing discrete methods and
achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
methods. Code and models are available at https://github.com/baaivision/URSA

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GVS enables parallel sampling of an entire video sequence to enforce adherence to a predefined camera trajectory, achieving stable, collision-free, and temporally coherent camera-guided video generation via diffusion stitching and Omni Guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive video diffusion struggles to incorporate future conditioning, causing collisions and collapsed generations when following fixed camera paths; there is need for long-range coherence and loop-closure.

Method: Propose Generative View Stitching (GVS) that samples the sequence in parallel using a diffusion stitching approach adapted from robot planning; compatible with any Diffusion Forcing video model; introduce Omni Guidance to condition on past and future for better temporal consistency; implement loop-closing mechanism to maintain long-range coherence.

Result: Produces camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free, frame-to-frame consistent, and capable of closing loops for various predefined camera paths (e.g., Oscar Reutersv√§rd's Impossible Staircase). Results are showcased on a project site.

Conclusion: GVS offers a practical, model-agnostic approach to long-range, camera-conditioned video generation, improving stability and coherence without retraining; expands possibilities for scripted cinematic sequences; potential trade-offs include computational cost and stitching-induced artifacts.

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models are capable of long rollouts that are
stable and consistent with history, but they are unable to guide the current
generation with conditioning from the future. In camera-guided video generation
with a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with
the generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address
this, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire
sequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of
the predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm
that extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video
generation. While such stitching methods usually require a specially trained
model, GVS is compatible with any off-the-shelf video model trained with
Diffusion Forcing, a prevalent sequence diffusion framework that we show
already provides the affordances necessary for stitching. We then introduce
Omni Guidance, a technique that enhances the temporal consistency in stitching
by conditioning on both the past and future, and that enables our proposed
loop-closing mechanism for delivering long-range coherence. Overall, GVS
achieves camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free,
frame-to-frame consistent, and closes loops for a variety of predefined camera
paths, including Oscar Reutersv\"ard's Impossible Staircase. Results are best

Result: About 2x the success rate over prior SOTA on open-world Minecraft tasks; approaching human generality in unseen web 3D games; outperforms GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet in FPS benchmarks. Scaling confirms sustained gains when expanding to cross-game and multimodal data.

Conclusion: Simple, scalable action representations combined with large-scale pre-training offer a promising path toward generalist agents with broad computer-use abilities.

Abstract: We present Game-TARS, a generalist game agent trained with a unified,
scalable action space anchored to human-aligned native keyboard-mouse inputs.
Unlike API- or GUI-based approaches, this paradigm enables large-scale
continual pre-training across heterogeneous domains, including OS, web, and
simulation games. Game-TARS is pre-trained on over 500B tokens with diverse
trajectories and multimodal data. Key techniques include a decaying continual
loss to reduce causal confusion and an efficient Sparse-Thinking strategy that
balances reasoning depth and inference cost. Experiments show that Game-TARS
achieves about 2 times the success rate over the previous sota model on
open-world Minecraft tasks, is close to the generality of fresh humans in
unseen web 3d games, and outperforms GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet
in FPS benchmarks. Scaling results on training-time and test-time confirm that
the unified action space sustains improvements when scaled to cross-game and
multimodal data. Our results demonstrate that simple, scalable action
representations combined with large-scale pre-training provide a promising path
toward generalist agents with broad computer-use abilities.

### [73] [AI and the Decentering of Disciplinary Creativity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23734)
*Eamon Duede*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI can both enhance and threaten disciplinary creativity: computation can extend problem-solving within a field, but some AI approaches risk displacing domain-specific expertise and potentially diminishing scientific value.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify how creativity should be understood in science by distinguishing creative approaches from products and introducing disciplinary creativity, then assess how AI affects this in mathematics.

Method: Philosophical analysis drawing on recent work on creativity, plus two mathematical case studies to compare computational and AI-driven approaches to problem-solving.

Result: Computation can extend disciplinary creativity; however, certain AI approaches may displace it, potentially altering or diminishing the value of scientific pursuit.

Conclusion: AI's impact is dual‚Äîaugmentation and displacement. The value of scientific inquiry depends on integrating AI tools in ways that preserve and enhance disciplinary creativity rather than erode it.

Abstract: This paper examines the role of artificial intelligence in scientific
problem-solving, with a focus on its implications for disciplinary creativity.
Drawing on recent work in the philosophy of creativity, I distinguish between
creative approaches and creative products, and introduce the concept of
disciplinary creativity -the creative application of discipline-specific
expertise to a valued problem within that field. Through two cases in
mathematics, I show that while computation can extend disciplinary creativity,
certain approaches involving AI can serve to displace it. This displacement has
the potential to alter (and, perhaps, diminish) the value of scientific
pursuit.

### [74] [Multi-Environment POMDPs: Discrete Model Uncertainty Under Partial Observability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23744)
*Eline M. Bovy,Caleb Probine,Marnix Suilen,Ufuk Topcu,Nils Jansen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes robust planning under model uncertainty by extending POMDPs to multiple environments (ME-POMDPs) and adversarial-belief POMDPs (AB-POMDPs); develops reductions between variants and offers exact and approximate algorithms to compute robust policies, validated on standard benchmarks extended to multi-environment settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world problems often involve disagreement among domain experts leading to varied models. A single policy that performs well under worst-case model selection is desirable.

Method: Introduce AB-POMDPs with adversarial belief sets; prove reductions showing ME-POMDPs can be transformed to restricted variants (varying only transitions/rewards or only observations/rewards); develop exact and point-based approximate algorithms to compute robust policies; extend standard POMDP benchmarks to multi-environment settings.

Result: Formal framework for robust policies under model uncertainty; reductions that preserve optimal policies; algorithms (exact and point-based) to compute policies; empirical demonstrations on standard benchmarks extended to multiple environments.

Conclusion: The work generalizes ME-POMDPs to AB-POMDPs, enabling robust policy computation under structured model uncertainty, with practical algorithms and empirical validation on benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-environment POMDPs (ME-POMDPs) extend standard POMDPs with discrete
model uncertainty. ME-POMDPs represent a finite set of POMDPs that share the
same state, action, and observation spaces, but may arbitrarily vary in their
transition, observation, and reward models. Such models arise, for instance,
when multiple domain experts disagree on how to model a problem. The goal is to
find a single policy that is robust against any choice of POMDP within the set,
i.e., a policy that maximizes the worst-case reward across all POMDPs. We
generalize and expand on existing work in the following way. First, we show
that ME-POMDPs can be generalized to POMDPs with sets of initial beliefs, which
we call adversarial-belief POMDPs (AB-POMDPs). Second, we show that any
arbitrary ME-POMDP can be reduced to a ME-POMDP that only varies in its
transition and reward functions or only in its observation and reward
functions, while preserving (optimal) policies. We then devise exact and
approximate (point-based) algorithms to compute robust policies for AB-POMDPs,
and thus ME-POMDPs. We demonstrate that we can compute policies for standard
POMDP benchmarks extended to the multi-environment setting.

### [75] [Test-Time Tuned Language Models Enable End-to-end De Novo Molecular Structure Generation from MS/MS Spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23746)
*Laura Mismetti,Marvin Alberts,Andreas Krause,Mara Graziani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A test-time tuned transformer framework enables end-to-end de novo molecular structure generation directly from tandem MS data and molecular formulas, surpassing DiffMS on NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym with notable gains and robustness to novel spectra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tandem MS-based identification relies on database matching or multi-step pipelines, which struggle for compounds not in reference databases. There is a need for end-to-end de novo generation from spectra (and formulas) without intermediate annotations.

Method: Pre-trained transformer model subjected to test-time tuning using tandem mass spectra and molecular formulae to generate molecular structures directly, bypassing fragment/fingerprint prediction and manual annotations; evaluated on NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym.

Result: Outperforms the de facto state-of-the-art DiffMS by 100% on NPLIB1 and 20% on MassSpecGym; test-time tuning yields a 62% relative gain over conventional fine-tuning on MassSpecGym; generated candidates remain structurally accurate when not exact, aiding human interpretation.

Conclusion: Test-time tuning improves end-to-end de novo molecular structure generation from tandem MS data, reducing reliance on databases, and providing robust, structurally accurate candidates to assist identification in metabolomics, natural product discovery, and environmental analysis.

Abstract: Tandem Mass Spectrometry enables the identification of unknown compounds in
crucial fields such as metabolomics, natural product discovery and
environmental analysis. However, current methods rely on database matching from
previously observed molecules, or on multi-step pipelines that require
intermediate fragment or fingerprint prediction. This makes finding the correct
molecule highly challenging, particularly for compounds absent from reference
databases. We introduce a framework that, by leveraging test-time tuning,
enhances the learning of a pre-trained transformer model to address this gap,
enabling end-to-end de novo molecular structure generation directly from the
tandem mass spectra and molecular formulae, bypassing manual annotations and
intermediate steps. We surpass the de-facto state-of-the-art approach DiffMS on
two popular benchmarks NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym by 100% and 20%, respectively.
Test-time tuning on experimental spectra allows the model to dynamically adapt
to novel spectra, and the relative performance gain over conventional
fine-tuning is of 62% on MassSpecGym. When predictions deviate from the ground
truth, the generated molecular candidates remain structurally accurate,
providing valuable guidance for human interpretation and more reliable
identification.

### [77] [Why Foundation Models in Pathology Are Failing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23807)
*Hamid R. Tizhoosh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Foundations models in computational pathology underperform due to seven root causes tied to tissue complexity, calling for a paradigm rethink.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To diagnose why generic foundation modeling fails in pathology and to guide principled improvements aligned with tissue morphology.

Method: Conceptual critique that identifies and enumerates seven interrelated causes behind observed weaknesses.

Result: Seven root causes: biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization, excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation, insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size. These causes explain low accuracy, poor robustness, geometric instability, high compute, and safety concerns, indicating misalignment with tissue morphology.

Conclusion: Current pathology foundation models are conceptually misaligned with tissue morphology, necessitating a fundamental paradigm rethink rather than incremental fixes.

Abstract: In non-medical domains, foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized computer
vision and language processing through large-scale self-supervised and
multimodal learning. Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational
pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis,
prognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic
evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor
robustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning
safety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues
that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions
underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic
complexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified:
biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization,
excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation,
insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size.
These findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain
conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a
fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself.

### [78] [ReCAP: Recursive Context-Aware Reasoning and Planning for Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23822)
*Zhenyu Zhang,Tianyi Chen,Weiran Xu,Alex Pentland,Jiaxin Pei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hierarchical, context-aware planning framework (ReCAP) for LLMs that uses plan-ahead decomposition, recursive context reinjection, and memory-efficient execution to improve long-horizon reasoning, achieving notable gains on Robotouille tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon tasks that require multi-step reasoning suffer from context drift, loss of goal information, and recurrent failure cycles when using sequential prompting. Hierarchical prompting often breaks cross-level continuity or incurs high runtime overhead. There is a need for a framework that preserves context across recursion while maintaining efficiency.

Method: ReCAP introduces three mechanisms: (i) plan-ahead decomposition: generate a full subtask list, execute the first item, and refine the remainder; (ii) structured re-injection of parent plans: maintain consistent multi-level context during recursive return; (iii) memory-efficient execution: bound the active prompt so costs scale linearly with task depth. The framework also emphasizes shared context for reasoning and planning and aims to align high-level goals with low-level actions.

Result: Experiments show substantial improvements in subgoal alignment and success rates on long-horizon benchmarks: a 32% gain on the synchronous Robotouille task and a 29% improvement on the asynchronous Robotouille task under the strict pass@1 protocol.

Conclusion: ReCAP effectively aligns high-level goals with low-level actions, reduces redundant prompting, and preserves coherent context updates across recursion. It is memory-efficient and scales with task depth, demonstrating strong performance gains on challenging long-horizon reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and dynamic re-planning
remain challenging for large language models (LLMs). Sequential prompting
methods are prone to context drift, loss of goal information, and recurrent
failure cycles, while hierarchical prompting methods often weaken cross-level
continuity or incur substantial runtime overhead. We introduce ReCAP (Recursive
Context-Aware Reasoning and Planning), a hierarchical framework with shared
context for reasoning and planning in LLMs. ReCAP combines three key
mechanisms: (i) plan-ahead decomposition, in which the model generates a full
subtask list, executes the first item, and refines the remainder; (ii)
structured re-injection of parent plans, maintaining consistent multi-level
context during recursive return; and (iii) memory-efficient execution, bounding
the active prompt so costs scale linearly with task depth. Together these
mechanisms align high-level goals with low-level actions, reduce redundant
prompting, and preserve coherent context updates across recursion. Experiments
demonstrate that ReCAP substantially improves subgoal alignment and success
rates on various long-horizon reasoning benchmarks, achieving a 32% gain on
synchronous Robotouille and a 29% improvement on asynchronous Robotouille under
the strict pass@1 protocol.

### [79] [Decentralized Multi-Agent Goal Assignment for Path Planning using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23824)
*Murad Ismayilov,Edwin Meriaux,Shuo Wen,Gregory Dudek*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Decentralized goal assignment in multi-agent path planning via rank-based preferences and fixed conflict resolution, where LLM-based agents‚Äîgiven well-structured prompts and quantitative info‚Äîachieve near-optimal makespans and outperform traditional heuristics in grid-world settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of coordinating many autonomous agents without centralized negotiation by enabling decentralized goal assignment through local reasoning, explicit goal preferences, and deterministic conflict resolution; also assess the value of language models in MAPF decision-making.

Method: Agents generate ranked goal preferences from structured environment representations (grid visualizations and scenario data). They exchange these rankings and assign goals via a fixed, deterministic conflict-resolution rule (e.g., agent index ordering). The study compares greedy heuristics, optimal assignment, and large language model (LLM)-based agents in fully observable grid-worlds, using prompts augmented with relevant quantitative information.

Result: LLM-based agents, with well-designed prompts and relevant data, achieve near-optimal makespans and consistently outperform traditional heuristics; the quality of information structure substantially influences performance.

Conclusion: Language models are promising for decentralized goal assignment in multi-agent path planning, but success hinges on careful information structuring and prompt design; further exploration of LLM-based decentralized planning is warranted.

Abstract: Coordinating multiple autonomous agents in shared environments under
decentralized conditions is a long-standing challenge in robotics and
artificial intelligence. This work addresses the problem of decentralized goal
assignment for multi-agent path planning, where agents independently generate
ranked preferences over goals based on structured representations of the
environment, including grid visualizations and scenario data. After this
reasoning phase, agents exchange their goal rankings, and assignments are
determined by a fixed, deterministic conflict-resolution rule (e.g., agent
index ordering), without negotiation or iterative coordination. We
systematically compare greedy heuristics, optimal assignment, and large
language model (LLM)-based agents in fully observable grid-world settings. Our
results show that LLM-based agents, when provided with well-designed prompts
and relevant quantitative information, can achieve near-optimal makespans and
consistently outperform traditional heuristics. These findings underscore the
potential of language models for decentralized goal assignment in multi-agent
path planning and highlight the importance of information structure in such
systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IBM's Computer Using Generalist Agent (CUGA) shows promise for enterprise-scale generalist agents: open-sourced, hierarchical planner‚Äìexecutor design, strong benchmarks (AppWorld/WebArena), and a pilot in BPO talent acquisition (BPO-TA) with a 26-task analytics benchmark. Preliminary results approach specialized agents in accuracy and hint at reduced development effort, with lessons toward enterprise-grade deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enterprises struggle to move from prototypes to deployed, measurable AI systems amid fragmented frameworks, slow development, and lacking standardized evaluation; there is a need for scalable, auditable, safe, governance-friendly, generalist agents in production.

Method: Develop and open-source CUGA with a hierarchical planner‚Äìexecutor architecture; evaluate on academic benchmarks (AppWorld and WebArena); pilot in Business-Process-Outsourcing Talent Acquisition (BPO-TA) domain; create a 26-task BPO-TA benchmark spanning 13 analytics endpoints.

Result: CUGA achieves state-of-the-art performance on AppWorld and WebArena; in a BPO-TA pilot, its accuracy approaches that of specialized agents; suggests potential to reduce development time and cost; introduces the 26-task BPO-TA benchmark and reports enterprise-focused evaluation.

Conclusion: First evidence that generalist agents can operate at enterprise scale; extracts technical and organizational lessons from the pilot; outlines requirements and next steps to evolve research-grade architectures like CUGA into robust, enterprise-ready systems.

Abstract: Agents are rapidly advancing in automating digital work, but enterprises face
a harder challenge: moving beyond prototypes to deployed systems that deliver
measurable business value. This path is complicated by fragmented frameworks,
slow development, and the absence of standardized evaluation practices.
Generalist agents have emerged as a promising direction, excelling on academic
benchmarks and offering flexibility across task types, applications, and
modalities. Yet, evidence of their use in production enterprise settings
remains limited. This paper reports IBM's experience developing and piloting
the Computer Using Generalist Agent (CUGA), which has been open-sourced for the
community (https://github.com/cuga-project/cuga-agent). CUGA adopts a
hierarchical planner--executor architecture with strong analytical foundations,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on AppWorld and WebArena. Beyond
benchmarks, it was evaluated in a pilot within the Business-Process-Outsourcing
talent acquisition domain, addressing enterprise requirements for scalability,
auditability, safety, and governance. To support assessment, we introduce
BPO-TA, a 26-task benchmark spanning 13 analytics endpoints. In preliminary
evaluations, CUGA approached the accuracy of specialized agents while
indicating potential for reducing development time and cost. Our contribution
is twofold: presenting early evidence of generalist agents operating at
enterprise scale, and distilling technical and organizational lessons from this
initial pilot. We outline requirements and next steps for advancing
research-grade architectures like CUGA into robust, enterprise-ready systems.

Motivation: Address the integration of physics-based, data-driven, and hybrid modeling with traditional and AI-driven controllers for dynamical systems. Evaluate trade-offs under interpolation and extrapolation using a controlled test platform (miniature greenhouse).

Method: Develop four predictive models (Linear, Physics-Based Modeling PBM, Long Short-Term Memory LSTM, and Hybrid Analysis and Modeling HAM) and three controllers (Model Predictive Control MPC, Reinforcement Learning RL, and a Large Language Model (LLM) based controller). Evaluate performance under interpolation and extrapolation scenarios, focusing on accuracy, generalization, computational efficiency, adaptability, and implementation effort.

Conclusion: Hybrid HAM modeling is a favorable compromise for digital twins in dynamical system control, delivering balanced accuracy and efficiency with good generalization. LSTM is suitable for precision but incurs higher costs; MPC remains a strong default for robustness; RL and LLM-based approaches hold promise for adaptability and human-in-the-loop control, respectively.

Abstract: This work investigates the use of digital twins for dynamical system modeling

TL;DR: Reformulates LVLM chain-of-thought as posterior inference, using amortized variational inference and diversity-seeking RL with sparse token-level rewards; employs Bayesian marginal likelihood ranking to select rationales and answers; yields improved effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability across seven reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CoT training methods (SFT, PPO, GRPO) struggle to generalize to unseen reasoning tasks and rely on biased reward models; a scalable, robust training framework for reasoning in LVLMs is needed.

Method: Formulate reasoning as posterior inference and optimize via amortized variational inference. Introduce diversity-seeking reinforcement learning with a sparse token-level reward to encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent CoT while avoiding deterministic sampling pitfalls and reward hacking. Replace costly Best-of-N/Beam Search with a Bayesian inference-scaling strategy that ranks rationales and answers using marginal likelihood.

Result: Empirically demonstrate state-of-the-art improvements for LVLMs on seven reasoning benchmarks in effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed variational-inference-based, diversity-aware LVLM training framework provides scalable, robust improvements in reasoning performance and interpretability, reducing reliance on biased rewards and sampling bottlenecks.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning is critical for improving the
interpretability and reliability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs).
However, existing training algorithms such as SFT, PPO, and GRPO may not
generalize well across unseen reasoning tasks and heavily rely on a biased
reward model. To address this challenge, we reformulate reasoning in LVLMs as
posterior inference and propose a scalable training algorithm based on
amortized variational inference. By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement
learning algorithms, we introduce a novel sparse reward function for
token-level learning signals that encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent
CoT, overcoming deterministic sampling limitations and avoiding reward hacking.
Additionally, we implement a Bayesian inference-scaling strategy that replaces
costly Best-of-N and Beam Search with a marginal likelihood to efficiently rank
optimal rationales and answers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed
method enhances the state-of-the-art LVLMs on seven reasoning benchmarks, in
terms of effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.

### [85] [Decentralized Causal Discovery using Judo Calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23942)
*Sridhar Mahadevan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A theory and implementation of judo calculus for intuitionistic, decentralized causal discovery using j-do-calculus in a topos of sheaves, enabling regime-specific local truths and j-stability; integrates with standard discovery methods and reports efficiency and improved accuracy across synthetic and real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal effects depend on regime (age, country, dose, genotype, lab protocol). Global causal claims are unreliable; a formal, regime-aware framework is needed, leveraging topos theory and intuitionistic logic to model local truths and decentralization.

Method: Formalize judo calculus on j-do-calculus within a topos of sheaves, using a Lawvere‚ÄìTierney modal operator j to select relevant regimes and enforce j-stability (constructed truth across covers). Implement a decentralized framework that combines judo with score-based, constraint-based, and gradient-based causal discovery methods; provide algorithmic and software implementation; evaluate on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: Decentralized, sheaf-theoretic approach yields computational efficiency and improved performance over classical causal discovery methods; effective across domains from biology to economics, handling regime-dependent causal claims.

Conclusion: The judo calculus offers a rigorous, scalable framework for regime-aware causal discovery, uniting intuitionistic logic, topos theory, and standard discovery techniques; future work may broaden applicability, refine scalability, and explore broader logical foundations.

Abstract: We describe a theory and implementation of an intuitionistic decentralized
framework for causal discovery using judo calculus, which is formally defined
as j-stable causal inference using j-do-calculus in a topos of sheaves. In
real-world applications -- from biology to medicine and social science --
causal effects depend on regime (age, country, dose, genotype, or lab
protocol). Our proposed judo calculus formalizes this context dependence
formally as local truth: a causal claim is proven true on a cover of regimes,
not everywhere at once. The Lawvere-Tierney modal operator j chooses which
regimes are relevant; j-stability means the claim holds constructively and
consistently across that family. We describe an algorithmic and implementation
framework for judo calculus, combining it with standard score-based,
constraint-based, and gradient-based causal discovery methods. We describe
experimental results on a range of domains, from synthetic to real-world
datasets from biology and economics. Our experimental results show the
computational efficiency gained by the decentralized nature of sheaf-theoretic
causal discovery, as well as improved performance over classical causal

### [86] [The Sign Estimator: LLM Alignment in the Face of Choice Heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23965)
*Aymane El Gadarri,Ali Aouad,Vivek F. Farias*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A simple, consistent estimator for LLM alignment called the sign estimator uses binary classification loss in aggregation instead of cross-entropy, yielding provable consistency and finite-sample guarantees for ordinal alignment under heterogeneous preferences, with strong simulated performance gains over standard RLHF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional LLM alignment with pairwise data and naive probabilistic models yields inconsistent estimates of population-average utility due to heterogeneity in human preferences. A simple, provably consistent method is needed that can handle heterogeneity while remaining easy to implement.

Method: Introduce the sign estimator that substitutes binary classification loss for cross-entropy in the aggregation step when fitting to pairwise comparison data. Prove consistency under mild assumptions and establish polynomial finite-sample error bounds. Validate via simulations with digital-twin personas to model heterogeneous users.

Result: The sign estimator substantially reduces preference distortion in simulations, cutting angular estimation error by about 35% and lowering disagreement with true population preferences from 12% to 8% compared with standard RLHF. It also outperforms panel-data heuristics that model user heterogeneity and require tracking individual-level data, all while preserving the simplicity of existing LLM alignment pipelines.

Conclusion: The sign estimator offers a simple, provably consistent approach to ordinal alignment under heterogeneous preferences, with finite-sample guarantees and notable practical gains in simulated settings, making it a strong candidate for incorporation into LLM alignment workflows.

Abstract: Traditional LLM alignment methods are vulnerable to heterogeneity in human
preferences. Fitting a na\"ive probabilistic model to pairwise comparison data
(say over prompt-completion pairs) yields an inconsistent estimate of the
population-average utility -a canonical measure of social welfare. We propose a
new method, dubbed the sign estimator, that provides a simple, provably
consistent, and efficient estimator by replacing cross-entropy with binary
classification loss in the aggregation step. This simple modification recovers
consistent ordinal alignment under mild assumptions and achieves the first
polynomial finite-sample error bounds in this setting. In realistic simulations
of LLM alignment using digital twins, the sign estimator substantially reduces
preference distortion over a panel of simulated personas, cutting (angular)
estimation error by nearly 35% and decreasing disagreement with true population
preferences from 12% to 8% compared to standard RLHF. Our method also compares
favorably to panel data heuristics that explicitly model user heterogeneity and
require tracking individual-level preference data-all while maintaining the
implementation simplicity of existing LLM alignment pipelines.

### [87] [Learning Individual Movement Shifts After Urban Disruptions with Social Infrastructure Reliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23989)
*Shangde Gao,Zelin Xu,Zhe Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A conditioned deep learning model incorporating individuals' social infrastructure resilience (SIR) and local spatial context to predict post-disruption movement patterns from sparse, large-scale data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shifts in individual movement after disruptive events reveal resource demands, but predicting these shifts is hard due to lack of measures for heterogeneous SIR, limited features, complex movement‚Äìspace interactions, and sparse data at the individual level.

Method: Develop a conditioned deep learning model that inputs individuals' SIR and local spatial context to capture nonlinear relationships between pre- and post-event movement patterns in large-scale, sparse datasets.

Result: Experiments indicate that incorporating SIR and spatial context improves post-event movement prediction and enables the model to capture divergent shifts among individuals with similar pre-event patterns but differing SIR.

Conclusion: Integrating heterogeneous SIR with spatial context in a conditioned model enhances predictive performance and understanding of mobility responses to disruptive events.

Abstract: Shifts in individual movement patterns following disruptive events can reveal
changing demands for community resources. However, predicting such shifts
before disruptive events remains challenging for several reasons. First,
measures are lacking for individuals' heterogeneous social infrastructure
resilience (SIR), which directly influences their movement patterns, and
commonly used features are often limited or unavailable at scale, e.g.,
sociodemographic characteristics. Second, the complex interactions between
individual movement patterns and spatial contexts have not been sufficiently
captured. Third, individual-level movement may be spatially sparse and not
well-suited to traditional decision-making methods for movement predictions.
This study incorporates individuals' SIR into a conditioned deep learning model
to capture the complex relationships between individual movement patterns and
local spatial context using large-scale, sparse individual-level data. Our
experiments demonstrate that incorporating individuals' SIR and spatial context
can enhance the model's ability to predict post-event individual movement
patterns. The conditioned model can capture the divergent shifts in movement
patterns among individuals who exhibit similar pre-event patterns but differ in
SIR.

### [88] [Discovering Heuristics with Large Language Models (LLMs) for Mixed-Integer Programs: Single-Machine Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24013)
*ƒ∞brahim Oƒüuz √áetinkaya,ƒ∞. Esra B√ºy√ºktahtakƒ±n,Parshin Shojaee,Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-discovered SMTT heuristics (EDD Challenger and MDD Challenger) outperform classical rules and rival exact methods on large instances, demonstrating effective human‚ÄìLLM collaboration for NP-hard scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the NP-hard single-machine total tardiness problem by exploring whether LLM-driven rule discovery can yield scalable, high-quality heuristics beyond simple heuristics.

Method: Develop two LLM-discovered heuristics, EDDC and MDDC, inspired by EDD and MDD. Evaluate against state-of-the-art heuristics and exact methods via MIP/DP across job sizes 20, 100, 200, 500, using optimality gaps and runtimes.

Result: EDD C improves upon EDD; MDD C outperforms traditional heuristics and remains competitive with exact methods on larger instances; exact methods become intractable beyond ~100 jobs. Performance measured by optimality gaps and solution times.

Conclusion: Human‚ÄìLLM collaboration can yield scalable, high-performing heuristics for NP-hard constrained optimization under resource constraints.

Abstract: Our study contributes to the scheduling and combinatorial optimization
literature with new heuristics discovered by leveraging the power of Large
Language Models (LLMs). We focus on the single-machine total tardiness (SMTT)
problem, which aims to minimize total tardiness by sequencing n jobs on a
single processor without preemption, given processing times and due dates. We
develop and benchmark two novel LLM-discovered heuristics, the EDD Challenger
(EDDC) and MDD Challenger (MDDC), inspired by the well-known Earliest Due Date
(EDD) and Modified Due Date (MDD) rules. In contrast to prior studies that
employed simpler rule-based heuristics, we evaluate our LLM-discovered
algorithms using rigorous criteria, including optimality gaps and solution time
derived from a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation of SMTT. We compare
their performance against state-of-the-art heuristics and exact methods across
various job sizes (20, 100, 200, and 500 jobs). For instances with more than
100 jobs, exact methods such as MIP and dynamic programming become
computationally intractable. Up to 500 jobs, EDDC improves upon the classic EDD
rule and another widely used algorithm in the literature. MDDC consistently
outperforms traditional heuristics and remains competitive with exact
approaches, particularly on larger and more complex instances. This study shows
that human-LLM collaboration can produce scalable, high-performing heuristics
for NP-hard constrained combinatorial optimization, even under limited
resources when effectively configured.

### [89] [OneCast: Structured Decomposition and Modular Generation for Cross-Domain Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24028)
*Tingyue Pan,Mingyue Cheng,Shilong Zhang,Zhiding Liu,Xiaoyu Tao,Yucong Luo,Jintao Zhang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OneCast is a modular cross-domain time-series forecasting framework that decouples seasonal and trend components using interpretable basis functions and a discrete-token diffusion model, delivering strong cross-domain performance across eight domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-domain forecasting across heterogeneous time series suffers from domain-specific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic patterns. Treating series as a single undifferentiated sequence fails to capture structural components, hindering generalization.

Method: Decompose time series into two branches: (1) seasonal component via a lightweight projection module that reconstructs periodic patterns using interpretable basis functions; (2) trend component via a semantic-aware tokenizer that encodes segment-level discrete tokens, inferred with a masked discrete diffusion mechanism. The two outputs are fused for the final forecast.

Result: Empirical evaluation across eight domains shows OneCast mostly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: A structurally decomposed, modular approach that explicitly models seasonal and trend components improves cross-domain forecasting performance and generalization.

Abstract: Cross-domain time series forecasting is a valuable task in various web
applications. Despite its rapid advancement, achieving effective generalization
across heterogeneous time series data remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods have made progress by extending single-domain models, yet often fall
short when facing domain-specific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic
patterns. We argue that a key limitation lies in treating temporal series as
undifferentiated sequence, without explicitly decoupling their inherent
structural components. To address this, we propose OneCast, a structured and
modular forecasting framework that decomposes time series into seasonal and
trend components, each modeled through tailored generative pathways.
Specifically, the seasonal component is captured by a lightweight projection
module that reconstructs periodic patterns via interpretable basis functions.
In parallel, the trend component is encoded into discrete tokens at segment
level via a semantic-aware tokenizer, and subsequently inferred through a
masked discrete diffusion mechanism. The outputs from both branches are
combined to produce a final forecast that captures seasonal patterns while
tracking domain-specific trends. Extensive experiments across eight domains
demonstrate that OneCast mostly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

*Peng Cai,Reza Ryan,Nickson M. Karie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A modular, clustering-based log-analysis chatbot (LMMLogAnalyzer) boosts log analysis by combining LLMs with ML to overcome context and structured-text limitations, achieving large gains over baselines and strong robustness across multi-domain logs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Analyzing diverse, voluminous security logs is costly and requires specialized expertise. LLMs struggle with context windows and structured text; there is a need for a reliable, user-friendly tool to streamline summarization, pattern extraction, and anomaly detection in logs.

Method: A modular architecture with components: router, log recognizer, log parser, and search tools. Uses clustering-based log analysis in conjunction with LLMs/ML to improve structured-text understanding and robustness. Evaluated on four domain logs across multiple tasks, comparing against state-of-the-art LLM chatbots (ChatGPT, ChatPDF, NotebookLM).

Result: Reported 39‚Äì68% performance gains over baselines across tasks; 93% reduction in IQR for ROUGE-1 scores, indicating lower variability. Demonstrates improved summarization, pattern extraction, and anomaly detection.

Conclusion: The framework enhances LLM capabilities for structured log analysis, improving accuracy and robustness, and is valuable for cybersecurity professionals and non-technical users alike.

Abstract: System logs are a cornerstone of cybersecurity, supporting proactive breach
prevention and post-incident investigations. However, analyzing vast amounts of
diverse log data remains significantly challenging, as high costs, lack of
in-house expertise, and time constraints make even basic analysis difficult for
many organizations. This study introduces LLMLogAnalyzer, a clustering-based
log analysis chatbot that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine
Learning (ML) algorithms to simplify and streamline log analysis processes.
This innovative approach addresses key LLM limitations, including context
window constraints and poor structured text handling capabilities, enabling
more effective summarization, pattern extraction, and anomaly detection tasks.
LLMLogAnalyzer is evaluated across four distinct domain logs and various tasks.
Results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art
LLM-based chatbots, including ChatGPT, ChatPDF, and NotebookLM, with consistent
gains ranging from 39% to 68% across different tasks. The system also exhibits
strong robustness, achieving a 93% reduction in interquartile range (IQR) when
using ROUGE-1 scores, indicating significantly lower result variability. The
framework's effectiveness stems from its modular architecture comprising a
router, log recognizer, log parser, and search tools. This design enhances LLM
capabilities for structured text analysis while improving accuracy and
robustness, making it a valuable resource for both cybersecurity experts and
non-technical users.

### [91] [Modeling Electric Vehicle Car-Following Behavior: Classical vs Machine Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24085)
*Md. Shihab Uddin,Md Nazmus Shakib,Rahul Bhadani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A study compares classical car-following models (IDM, OVM, OVRV, simplified CACC) with a Random Forest regressor for EV driving behavior using a real-world EV-ICE following dataset. The ML model achieves markedly lower RMSEs than physics-based models, with RFRMSEs of 0.0046 (medium gap), 0.0016 (long gap), and 0.0025 (extra long gap); among physics models, CACC is the best for long gaps (RMSE 2.67).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand EV driving behavior for safety and smart driving system development, and to compare traditional physics-based models with machine learning on EV car-following tasks in mixed-autonomy traffic.

Method: Calibrate classical model parameters by RMSE minimization against real data. Train a Random Forest Regressor to predict acceleration from spacing, speed, and gap type using a real-world EV-ICE following dataset under varied conditions. Evaluate models by RMSE across gap types (medium, long, extra long).

Result: Machine learning (Random Forest) achieves higher accuracy than physics-based models across all gap types. RF RMSEs are very low (<0.01) for all gaps, while the best physics model (CACC) yields RMSE 2.67 for long gaps.

Conclusion: ML-based approaches offer superior predictive accuracy for EV car-following and are valuable for simulating EV behavior and analyzing mixed-autonomy traffic in EV-integrated environments; physics-based models can still provide reasonable baselines, with CACC performing best among them for long gaps.

Abstract: The increasing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates an
understanding of their driving behavior to enhance traffic safety and develop
smart driving systems. This study compares classical and machine learning
models for EV car following behavior. Classical models include the Intelligent
Driver Model (IDM), Optimum Velocity Model (OVM), Optimal Velocity Relative
Velocity (OVRV), and a simplified CACC model, while the machine learning
approach employs a Random Forest Regressor. Using a real world dataset of an EV
following an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle under varied driving
conditions, we calibrated classical model parameters by minimizing the RMSE
between predictions and real data. The Random Forest model predicts
acceleration using spacing, speed, and gap type as inputs. Results demonstrate
the Random Forest's superior accuracy, achieving RMSEs of 0.0046 (medium gap),
0.0016 (long gap), and 0.0025 (extra long gap). Among physics based models,
CACC performed best, with an RMSE of 2.67 for long gaps. These findings
highlight the machine learning model's performance across all scenarios. Such
models are valuable for simulating EV behavior and analyzing mixed autonomy
traffic dynamics in EV integrated environments.

### [92] [HistoLens: An Interactive XAI Toolkit for Verifying and Mitigating Flaws in Vision-Language Models for Histopathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24115)
*Sandeep Vissapragada,Vikrant Sahu,Gagan Raj Gupta,Vandita Singh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HistoLens provides a transparent, question-driven AI assistant for histopathology that answers plain-English queries, generates structured reports, and offers visual 'proof' heatmaps to show the AI's reasoning while focusing on the patient's tissue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Doctors often distrust opaque AI systems; they want to understand the AI's reasoning and have verifiable explanations to consult alongside their expertise, similar to consulting a colleague.

Method: The system translates plain-English questions into precise AI queries, returns structured reports, and supplies visual proofs (heatmaps) showing the exact cells/regions used. It emphasizes focusing on patient tissue by ignoring background noise, enabling the pathologist to supervise while the AI assists.

Result: A transparent, collaborative AI workflow in pathology where the pathologist remains in control, can verify insights with heatmap proofs, and achieve faster, more confident diagnoses.

Conclusion: Transparent, explainable AI in pathology can build trust and efficiency by enabling interactive questioning and visual proof, positioning AI as a trustworthy partner rather than a black box.

Abstract: For doctors to truly trust artificial intelligence, it can't be a black box.
They need to understand its reasoning, almost as if they were consulting a
colleague. We created HistoLens1 to be that transparent, collaborative partner.
It allows a pathologist to simply ask a question in plain English about a
tissue slide--just as they would ask a trainee. Our system intelligently
translates this question into a precise query for its AI engine, which then
provides a clear, structured report. But it doesn't stop there. If a doctor
ever asks, "Why?", HistoLens can instantly provide a 'visual proof' for any
finding--a heatmap that points to the exact cells and regions the AI used for
its analysis. We've also ensured the AI focuses only on the patient's tissue,
just like a trained pathologist would, by teaching it to ignore distracting
background noise. The result is a workflow where the pathologist remains the
expert in charge, using a trustworthy AI assistant to verify their insights and
make faster, more confident diagnoses.

*Yu Luo,Jiamin Jiang,Jingfei Feng,Lei Tao,Qingliang Zhang,Xidao Wen,Yongqian Sun,Shenglin Zhang,Jielong Huang,Nan Qi,Dan Pei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpsAgent is a training-free, self-evolving multi-agent system for incident management that converts heterogeneous observability data into structured text, offers transparent collaborative inference, and achieves state-of-the-art results on OPENRCA with generalizability, interpretability, cost-efficiency, and continual self-evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual incident management is labor-intensive and error-prone in the face of massive heterogeneous observability data; existing automated IM lacks generalization, interpretability, and deployability, hindering real-world adoption.

Method: A lightweight, training-free data processor to convert observability data to structured textual descriptions; a multi-agent collaboration framework for transparent, auditable inference; a dual self-evolution mechanism that integrates internal model updates with external experience accumulation to close the deployment loop.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on OPENRCA; OpsAgent is generalizable, interpretable, cost-efficient, and self-evolving; demonstrates practical deployability for long-term operation in real-world cloud systems.

Conclusion: OpsAgent provides a practical, scalable solution for long-term incident management in large-scale cloud systems, combining transparency, adaptability, and cost-efficiency to support continual capability growth and deployment.

Abstract: Incident management (IM) is central to the reliability of large-scale cloud
systems. Yet manual IM, where on-call engineers examine metrics, logs, and
traces is labor-intensive and error-prone in the face of massive and
heterogeneous observability data. Existing automated IM approaches often
struggle to generalize across systems, provide limited interpretability, and
incur high deployment costs, which hinders adoption in practice. In this paper,
we present OpsAgent, a lightweight, self-evolving multi-agent system for IM
that employs a training-free data processor to convert heterogeneous
observability data into structured textual descriptions, along with a
multi-agent collaboration framework that makes diagnostic inference transparent
and auditable. To support continual capability growth, OpsAgent also introduces
a dual self-evolution mechanism that integrates internal model updates with
external experience accumulation, thereby closing the deployment loop.
Comprehensive experiments on the OPENRCA benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance and show that OpsAgent is generalizable, interpretable,
cost-efficient, and self-evolving, making it a practically deployable and
sustainable solution for long-term operation in real-world cloud systems.

*Bingsen Qiu,Zijian Liu,Xiao Liu,Haoshen Yang,Zeren Gao,Bingjie Wang,Feier Zhang,Yixuan Qin,Chunyan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An automated framework to generate high-difficulty training-ready multi-hop QA data from semi-structured sources, enabling scalable SFT/RL training and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current hard multi-hop QA resources are scarce and often designed only for evaluation; manual curation for training data is costly and not scalable; there is a need for scalable, retrievable, verifiable data to train retrieval-and-reasoning models.

Method: 1) Build diverse, logically labeled evidence clusters via NLI-based relation typing and diversity-aware expansion. 2) Apply reverse question construction to create oblique cues so that isolated signals are underinformative but their combination uniquely identifies the target. 3) Two-step quality filter: multi-model consensus filtering plus structured constraint decomposition and evidence-based matching.

Result: Produces scalable, complex, retrieval-resistant yet verifiable questions suitable for SFT/RL training and challenging evaluation, substantially reducing human curation effort while preserving the difficulty profile of strong benchmarks.

Conclusion: An automated generation framework can supply training-ready, high-difficulty multi-hop QA data, narrowing the gap between evaluation benchmarks and training resources and enabling scalable training of retrieval-and-reasoning models.

Abstract: Building training-ready multi-hop question answering (QA) datasets that truly
stress a model's retrieval and reasoning abilities remains highly challenging
recently. While there have been a few recent evaluation datasets that capture
the characteristics of hard-to-search but easy-to-verify problems -- requiring
the integration of ambiguous, indirect, and cross-domain cues -- these data
resources remain scarce and are mostly designed for evaluation, making them
unsuitable for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL).
Meanwhile, manually curating non-trivially retrievable questions -- where
answers cannot be found through a single direct query but instead require
multi-hop reasoning over oblique and loosely connected evidence -- incurs
prohibitive human costs and fails to scale, creating a critical data bottleneck
for training high-capability retrieval-and-reasoning agents.
  To address this, we present an automated framework for generating
high-difficulty, training-ready multi-hop questions from semi-structured
knowledge sources. The system (i) grows diverse, logically labeled evidence
clusters through Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based relation typing and
diversity-aware expansion; (ii) applies reverse question construction to
compose oblique cues so that isolated signals are underinformative but their
combination uniquely identifies the target entity; and (iii) enforces quality
with a two-step evaluation pipeline that combines multi-model consensus
filtering with structured constraint decomposition and evidence-based matching.
The result is a scalable process that yields complex, retrieval-resistant yet
verifiable questions suitable for SFT/RL training as well as challenging
evaluation, substantially reducing human curation effort while preserving the
difficulty profile of strong evaluation benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BLM1 is a multimodal spatial foundation model that bridges digital and physical spaces, cross-embodiment generalization, and high-level embodied reasoning via a two-stage training paradigm; it outperforms MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, and GMLMs with ~6% digital and ~3% physical gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs and embodied models struggle to generalize across digital-to-physical spaces and different embodiments. A unified model with robust cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and cross-embodiment generalization is needed to enable reliable reasoning and control in both digital and real-world environments.

Method: Two-stage training. Stage I injects embodied knowledge into the MLLM via curated digital corpora while preserving language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an intent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to guide control without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. A self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spans four robot embodiments and six tasks.

Result: On digital and physical benchmarks, a single BLM1 instance outperforms four model families (MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, GMLMs), achieving approximately 6% gains in digital tasks and 3% gains in physical tasks.

Conclusion: BLM1 demonstrates cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and cross-embodiment generalization, enabling robust cross-embodiment control while preserving instruction following and reasoning. It offers a unified approach to operate across digital and physical spaces with improved generalization across embodiments.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced vision-language
reasoning and are increasingly deployed in embodied agents. However,
significant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical
spaces and embodiments; vision-language-action models (VLAs) produce low-level
actions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large
language models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor
generalization to the physical world. Thus, unified models that operate
seamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across
embodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \textbf{Boundless Large
Model (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves
instruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and
supports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key
capabilities -- \textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and
cross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I
injects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while
maintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an
intent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to
guide control, without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. This process is supported
by a self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot
embodiments and six progressively challenging tasks. Evaluations across digital
and physical benchmarks show that a single BLM$_1$ instance outperforms four
model families -- MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, and GMLMs -- achieving
$\sim\!\textbf{6%}$ gains in digital tasks and $\sim\!\textbf{3%}$ in physical
tasks.

*Xin Yang,Yuhang Zhang,Wei Li,Xin Lin,Wenbin Zou,Chen Xu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniPlanner enables cross-dataset autonomous vehicle planning by introducing three innovations‚ÄîHistory-Future Trajectory Dictionary Network (HFTDN), Gradient-Free Trajectory Mapper (GFTM), and Sparse-to-Dense (S2D)‚Äîto transfer planning priors across multiple datasets and improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current planning methods are generally trained on a single dataset, limiting robustness to distribution shifts. The authors observe consistency in vehicular trajectory distributions and history-future correlations across datasets, motivating unified cross-dataset learning.

Method: Three synergistic components: (1) History-Future Trajectory Dictionary Network (HFTDN) aggregates history-future trajectory pairs from multiple datasets, using historical similarity to retrieve futures and provide cross-dataset guidance. (2) Gradient-Free Trajectory Mapper (GFTM) learns robust history-future correlations from multiple datasets to transform histories into universal planning priors, using gradient-free optimization to safely transfer knowledge. (3) Sparse-to-Dense (S2D) paradigm applies adaptive dropout during training to suppress priors for robust learning, while allowing full prior usage during inference to maximize performance.

Result: The abstract presents a conceptual framework with claims of unified cross-dataset learning and improved cross-dataset transfer of planning priors; it does not report empirical results or quantitative benchmarks.

Conclusion: UniPlanner is positioned as the first planning framework for multi-dataset integration in autonomous vehicle decision-making, enabling transferable planning priors across diverse datasets and potentially improving planning robustness and performance.

Abstract: Motion planning is a critical component of autonomous vehicle decision-making
systems, directly determining trajectory safety and driving efficiency. While
deep learning approaches have advanced planning capabilities, existing methods
remain confined to single-dataset training, limiting their robustness in
planning.
  Through systematic analysis, we discover that vehicular trajectory
distributions and history-future correlations demonstrate remarkable
consistency across different datasets. Based on these findings, we propose
UniPlanner, the first planning framework designed for multi-dataset integration
in autonomous vehicle decision-making. UniPlanner achieves unified
cross-dataset learning through three synergistic innovations.
  First, the History-Future Trajectory Dictionary Network (HFTDN) aggregates
history-future trajectory pairs from multiple datasets, using historical
trajectory similarity to retrieve relevant futures and generate cross-dataset
planning guidance.
  Second, the Gradient-Free Trajectory Mapper (GFTM) learns robust
history-future correlations from multiple datasets, transforming historical
trajectories into universal planning priors. Its gradient-free design ensures
the introduction of valuable priors while preventing shortcut learning, making
the planning knowledge safely transferable. Third, the Sparse-to-Dense (S2D)
paradigm implements adaptive dropout to selectively suppress planning priors
during training for robust learning, while enabling full prior utilization
during inference to maximize planning performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MGA introduces an observe-first, memory-augmented GUI agent that treats each interaction as an independent state (screenshot, spatial cues, memory), yielding better robustness and generalization than history-heavy methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address persistent GUI-agent challenges: (1) error propagation from relying on long historical trajectories, and (2) local exploration bias that under-utilizes interface cues.

Method: Propose Memory-Driven GUI Agent (MGA) that reformulates GUI interaction as a sequence of independent, context-rich states represented by a triad: current screenshot, task-agnostic spatial information, and a dynamically updated structured memory. The agent follows an observe-first, then-decide paradigm, updating memory at each step and making decisions without depending on full task histories. Evaluation spans OSworld benchmarks, real desktop apps (Chrome, VSCode, VLC), and cross-task transfer.

Result: MGA achieves substantial gains in robustness, generalization, and efficiency compared with state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrated on OSworld and real applications, with positive cross-task transfer.

Conclusion: The observe-first, memory-augmented framework effectively addresses key GUI-agent limitations, offering improved robustness and generalization across diverse interfaces and tasks; code is publicly available.

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal
extensions (MLLMs) has enabled agentic systems capable of perceiving and acting
across diverse environments. A challenging yet impactful frontier is the
development of GUI agents, which must navigate complex desktop and web
interfaces while maintaining robustness and generalization. Existing paradigms
typically model tasks as long-chain executions, concatenating historical
trajectories into the context. While approaches such as Mirage and GTA1 refine
planning or introduce multi-branch action selection, they remain constrained by
two persistent issues: Dependence on historical trajectories, which amplifies
error propagation. And Local exploration bias, where "decision-first,
observation-later" mechanisms overlook critical interface cues. We introduce
the Memory-Driven GUI Agent (MGA), which reframes GUI interaction around the
principle of observe first, then decide. MGA models each step as an
independent, context-rich environment state represented by a triad: current
screenshot, task-agnostic spatial information, and a dynamically updated
structured memory. Experiments on OSworld benchmarks, real desktop applications
(Chrome, VSCode, VLC), and cross-task transfer demonstrate that MGA achieves
substantial gains in robustness, generalization, and efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art baselines. The code is publicly available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MCP-Flow automates a web-agent-driven pipeline to scale MCP data collection and training, enabling large-scale discovery of servers/tools and generation of instruction-function call pairs and trajectories, improving MCP tool selection and function-call generation for real-world LLM agent deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs increasingly rely on external tools, but MCP research is limited in scale, relies on manual curation, and lacks training support. There is a need for automated, scalable data collection and training to enable real-world MCP-enabled agents.

Method: An automated web-agent-driven pipeline that discovers servers, synthesizes data, and trains models. It collects and filters data from 1166 servers and 11536 tools, producing 68733 instruction-function call pairs and 6439 trajectories to train and evaluate MCP-enabled agents.

Result: MCP-Flow achieves superior MCP tool selection, better function-call generation, and enhanced agentic task performance, outperforming prior work in scale and diversity; public code available at GitHub.

Conclusion: MCP-Flow provides a scalable foundation for advancing LLM agents in real-world MCP environments and serves as a robust data/training platform for MCP-enabled agents.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on external tools to perform
complex, realistic tasks, yet their ability to utilize the rapidly expanding
Model Contextual Protocol (MCP) ecosystem remains limited. Existing MCP
research covers few servers, depends on costly manual curation, and lacks
training support, hindering progress toward real-world deployment. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce MCP-Flow, an automated web-agent-driven
pipeline for large-scale server discovery, data synthesis, and model training.
MCP-Flow collects and filters data from 1166 servers and 11536 tools, producing
68733 high-quality instruction-function call pairs and 6439 trajectories, far
exceeding prior work in scale and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
MCP-Flow's effectiveness in driving superior MCP tool selection, function-call
generation, and enhanced agentic task performance. MCP-Flow thus provides a
scalable foundation for advancing LLM agents' proficiency in real-world MCP
environments. MCP-Flow is publicly available at

### [99] [Investigating Intra-Abstraction Policies For Non-exact Abstraction Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24297)
*Robin Schm√∂cker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This work analyzes intra-abstraction policies for MCTS to fix tiebreak issues when multiple actions share an abstract node, showing several informed policies beat random tiebreaks in most environments and settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCTS abstractions improve sample efficiency by sharing information, but existing tiebreak under MCTS abstractions (like pruned OGA) uses a random tie-break when multiple actions map to the same abstract node, potentially harming performance.

Method: Propose several alternative intra-abstraction policies and empirically evaluate them against the baseline random tiebreak across multiple environments and parameter settings.

Result: Some intra-abstraction policies outperform the random tiebreak in the majority of tested environments and parameter settings.

Conclusion: Careful design of intra-abstraction tiebreak policies can improve MCTS performance and should be preferred over random tiebreaks in abstractions such as pruned OGA.

Abstract: One weakness of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency which
can be addressed by building and using state and/or action abstractions in
parallel to the tree search such that information can be shared among nodes of
the same layer. The primary usage of abstractions for MCTS is to enhance the
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) value during the tree policy by aggregating visits
and returns of an abstract node. However, this direct usage of abstractions
does not take the case into account where multiple actions with the same parent
might be in the same abstract node, as these would then all have the same UCB
value, thus requiring a tiebreak rule. In state-of-the-art abstraction
algorithms such as pruned On the Go Abstractions (pruned OGA), this case has
not been noticed, and a random tiebreak rule was implicitly chosen. In this
paper, we propose and empirically evaluate several alternative
intra-abstraction policies, several of which outperform the random policy
across a majority of environments and parameter settings.

### [100] [Verifying Large Language Models' Reasoning Paths via Correlation Matrix Rank](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24299)
*Jiayu Liu,Wei Dai,Zhenya Huang,Ning Miao,Enhong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Self-Indicator uses the rank of the correlation matrix between the input problem and the LLM's reasoning path as an internal credibility signal, reweighting candidate reasoning paths to improve correctness with low overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current verification methods rely on external verifiers or elaborate prompts, which are computationally expensive and domain-specific. There is a need for a lightweight, internal cue derived from the LLM's own behavior.

Method: Compute the correlation matrix between the input problem and each candidate reasoning path; take the rank as a robust indicator of reasoning correctness; plug-and-play Self-Indicator reweights candidate paths based on this indicator, avoiding training a separate verifier.

Result: The approach achieves over 75% accuracy in distinguishing correct versus incorrect reasoning paths and improves the accuracies on three reasoning benchmarks by more than 8%, across multiple LLMs and model families.

Conclusion: Self-Indicator provides a simple, efficient, and domain-agnostic mechanism to assess and improve LLM reasoning without external verifiers, showing robust performance across models.

Abstract: Despite the strong reasoning ability of large language models~(LLMs), they
are prone to errors and hallucinations. As a result, how to check their outputs
effectively and efficiently has become a critical problem in their
applications. Existing checking methods heavily rely on external resources,
such as trained verifiers (e.g., process/outcome reward models) or elaborate
prompts, which lead to high computational overhead and are only applicable to
specific domains. In this paper, we investigate whether the internal behaviors
of LLMs have already implied the credibility of their reasoning paths.
Specifically, we find that the rank of the correlation matrix between the input
problem and the output reasoning path is a robust indicator of reasoning
correctness. Different from other correctness indicators for LLMs, the
calculation of the correlation matrix only relies on the LLM itself, which
avoids the hassle of training a separate model or designing complicated
prompts. Based on it, we design a simple, plug-and-play Self-Indicator method
to reweight candidate reasoning paths, which achieves significant performance
improvements than other voting and verification methods with very few
computational overhead. Our experiments across multiple LLMs of varying scales
and model families have further shown the effectiveness of Self-Indicator. It
achieves over 75% accuracy in distinguishing correct reasoning paths from
incorrect ones, and, in turn, improves the accuracies on three reasoning
benchmarks by more than 8%.

### [101] [Retrieval and Argumentation Enhanced Multi-Agent LLMs for Judgmental Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24303)
*Deniz Gorur,Antoni Rago,Francesca Toni*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent, LLM-based claim verification framework uses quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs) to aggregate diverse evidence from ArgLLM, RbAM, and RAG-ArgLLM agents. Experiments on judgmental forecasting datasets show that combining three agents improves forecast accuracy and provides explainable evidence integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Judgmental forecasting can be framed as claim verification; disagreements among agents can be harnessed with structured evidence to improve accuracy and transparency. QBAFs offer a principled way to represent for/against arguments from multiple sources.

Method: Propose a multi-agent framework where agents generate QBAFs for claims. Instantiate with three agent types: ArgLLM (existing claim verification via QBAFs), RbAM (LLM-powered relation-based argument mining from external sources), and RAG-ArgLLM (ArgLLM enhanced with Retrieval-Augmented Generation). Evaluate on two standard judgmental forecasting datasets using two to three agents and six base LLMs. Assess forecast accuracy and explainability of the evidence fusion.

Result: Combining evidence across agents improves forecasting accuracy, especially with three agents; the approach yields an explainable combination of evidence for claim verification.

Conclusion: A multi-agent QBAF-based framework is a promising approach for claim verification in judgmental forecasting, leveraging diverse LLMs and external sources to boost accuracy and provide transparent, explainable evidence fusion.

Abstract: Judgmental forecasting is the task of making predictions about future events
based on human judgment. This task can be seen as a form of claim verification,
where the claim corresponds to a future event and the task is to assess the
plausibility of that event. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent
framework for claim verification, whereby different agents may disagree on
claim veracity and bring specific evidence for and against the claims,
represented as quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs). We then
instantiate the framework for supporting claim verification, with a variety of
agents realised with Large Language Models (LLMs): (1) ArgLLM agents, an
existing approach for claim verification that generates and evaluates QBAFs;
(2) RbAM agents, whereby LLM-empowered Relation-based Argument Mining (RbAM)
from external sources is used to generate QBAFs; (3) RAG-ArgLLM agents,
extending ArgLLM agents with a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) of
arguments from external sources. Finally, we conduct experiments with two
standard judgmental forecasting datasets, with instances of our framework with
two or three agents, empowered by six different base LLMs. We observe that
combining evidence from agents can improve forecasting accuracy, especially in
the case of three agents, while providing an explainable combination of
evidence for claim verification.

### [102] [Generative Large Language Models (gLLMs) in Content Analysis: A Practical Guide for Communication Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24337)
*Daria Kravets-Meinke,Hannah Schmid-Petri,Sonja Niemann,Ute Schmid*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A synthesis and best-practice guide for employing generative LLMs in quantitative content analysis within communication research, addressing seven methodological challenges to improve validity, reliability, reproducibility, and ethics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage gLLMs' efficiency and ability to infer latent meaning, while addressing gaps in methodological integration and quality assurance.

Method: Review of recent work on gLLM-assisted content analysis; analysis of seven challenges; proposition of best-practice guidelines and a decision framework.

Result: A structured guide for researchers; recommended procedures for codebook development, prompting, model and parameter choices, iterative refinement, and validation; emphasis on ethics and replicability.

Conclusion: gLLMs offer transformative potential for content analysis when integrated with rigorous methods and standards; adoption requires discipline-wide guidelines.

Abstract: Generative Large Language Models (gLLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly
being used in communication research for content analysis. Studies show that
gLLMs can outperform both crowd workers and trained coders, such as research
assistants, on various coding tasks relevant to communication science, often at
a fraction of the time and cost. Additionally, gLLMs can decode implicit
meanings and contextual information, be instructed using natural language,
deployed with only basic programming skills, and require little to no annotated
data beyond a validation dataset - constituting a paradigm shift in automated
content analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of gLLMs into the
methodological toolkit of communication research remains underdeveloped. In
gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis, researchers must address at least
seven critical challenges that impact result quality: (1) codebook development,
(2) prompt engineering, (3) model selection, (4) parameter tuning, (5)
iterative refinement, (6) validation of the model's reliability, and
optionally, (7) performance enhancement. This paper synthesizes emerging
research on gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis and proposes a
comprehensive best-practice guide to navigate these challenges. Our goal is to
make gLLM-based content analysis more accessible to a broader range of
communication researchers and ensure adherence to established disciplinary
quality standards of validity, reliability, reproducibility, and research
ethics.

*Yunxuan Jiang,Silan Hu,Xiaoning Wang,Yuanyuan Zhang,Xiangyu Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VDSAgents is a PCS-guided multi-agent data science system that modularly handles cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation, with perturbation analysis, unit testing, and model validation; it outperforms AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter on nine datasets using GPT-4o/DeepSeek-V3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To inject scientific principles (predictability, computability, stability) into LLM-driven data science to improve trustworthiness and robustness on noisy real-world data.

Method: A modular, multi-agent workflow guided by PCS; each phase managed by a specialized agent, incorporating perturbation analysis, unit tests, and model validation; evaluation against baselines (AutoKaggle, DataInterpreter) using DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o backends.

Result: VDSAgents consistently outperforms AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter on nine datasets, demonstrating feasibility of PCS-guided LLM-driven data science automation.

Conclusion: Embedding PCS principles into LLM-driven data science pipelines enhances auditability, reliability, and robustness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into data science
workflows for automated system design. However, these LLM-driven data science
systems rely solely on the internal reasoning of LLMs, lacking guidance from
scientific and theoretical principles. This limits their trustworthiness and
robustness, especially when dealing with noisy and complex real-world datasets.
This paper provides VDSAgents, a multi-agent system grounded in the
Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) principles proposed in the
Veridical Data Science (VDS) framework. Guided by PCS principles, the system
implements a modular workflow for data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling,
and evaluation. Each phase is handled by an elegant agent, incorporating
perturbation analysis, unit testing, and model validation to ensure both
functionality and scientific auditability. We evaluate VDSAgents on nine
datasets with diverse characteristics, comparing it with state-of-the-art
end-to-end data science systems, such as AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, using
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o as backends. VDSAgents consistently outperforms the
results of AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, which validates the feasibility of
embedding PCS principles into LLM-driven data science automation.

Motivation:

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: For decades, neuroscientists and computer scientists have pursued a shared
ambition: to understand intelligence and build it. Modern artificial neural
networks now rival humans in language, perception, and reasoning, yet it is
still largely unknown whether these artificial systems organize information as
the brain does. Existing brain-AI alignment studies have shown the striking
correspondence between the two systems, but such comparisons remain bound to
specific inputs and tasks, offering no common ground for comparing how AI
models with different kinds of modalities-vision, language, or multimodal-are
intrinsically organized. Here we introduce a groundbreaking concept of
Brain-like Space: a unified geometric space in which every AI model can be
precisely situated and compared by mapping its intrinsic spatial attention
topological organization onto canonical human functional brain networks,
regardless of input modality, task, or sensory domain. Our extensive analysis
of 151 Transformer-based models spanning state-of-the-art large vision models,
large language models, and large multimodal models uncovers a continuous
arc-shaped geometry within this space, reflecting a gradual increase of
brain-likeness; different models exhibit distinct distribution patterns within
this geometry associated with different degrees of brain-likeness, shaped not
merely by their modality but by whether the pretraining paradigm emphasizes
global semantic abstraction and whether the positional encoding scheme
facilitates deep fusion across different modalities. Moreover, the degree of
brain-likeness for a model and its downstream task performance are not
"identical twins". The Brain-like Space provides the first unified framework
for situating, quantifying, and comparing intelligence across domains,
revealing the deep organizational principles that bridge machines and the
brain.

*Pedram Fard,Alaleh Azhir,Neguine Rezaii,Jiazi Tian,Hossein Estiri*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent N-of-1 decision-support architecture for medical AI emphasizing individual reliability and equity, with organ-system/population/modality-agent clusters, a shared model/library, and a coordination layer delivering transparent, uncertainty-aware decision packets; validation focused on low-density regions; anticipated challenges include compute, automation bias, and regulatory fit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI in medicine optimizes aggregate accuracy but tends to perform poorly at the margins (rare variants, multimorbidity, underrepresented groups), eroding equity and trust. An individual-centered paradigm is needed.

Method: Design of a multi-agent ecosystem where agents cluster by organ systems, patient populations, and analytic modalities. They draw on a shared library of models and evidence synthesis tools. A coordination layer weighs reliability, uncertainty, and data density to produce a clinician-facing decision-support packet with calibrated risk estimates, outlier flags, and linked evidence.

Result: Conceptual framework and proposed validation strategy. Emphasis on evaluating individual reliability, calibration in small data regimes, and risk‚Äìcoverage trade-offs rather than population averages; no empirical results yet.

Conclusion: Shifts from monolithic models to orchestrated intelligence to align medical AI with the core medical principle of care‚Äîtransparent, equitable, and centered on the individual‚Äîwhile anticipating challenges like computation, automation bias, and regulatory alignment.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in medicine is built to serve the average patient. By
minimizing error across large datasets, most systems deliver strong aggregate
accuracy yet falter at the margins: patients with rare variants,
multimorbidity, or underrepresented demographics. This average patient fallacy
erodes both equity and trust. We propose a different design: a multi-agent
ecosystem for N-of-1 decision support. In this environment, agents clustered by
organ systems, patient populations, and analytic modalities draw on a shared
library of models and evidence synthesis tools. Their results converge in a
coordination layer that weighs reliability, uncertainty, and data density
before presenting the clinician with a decision-support packet: risk estimates
bounded by confidence ranges, outlier flags, and linked evidence. Validation
shifts from population averages to individual reliability, measured by error in
low-density regions, calibration in the small, and risk--coverage trade-offs.
Anticipated challenges include computational demands, automation bias, and
regulatory fit, addressed through caching strategies, consensus checks, and
adaptive trial frameworks. By moving from monolithic models to orchestrated
intelligence, this approach seeks to align medical AI with the first principle
of medicine: care that is transparent, equitable, and centered on the
individual.

### [106] [Policy Cards: Machine-Readable Runtime Governance for Autonomous AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24383)
*Juraj Mavraƒçiƒá*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Policy Cards provide a machine-readable governance layer that encodes constraints, obligations, and assurance mappings, enabling runtime enforcement, validation, and cross-framework compliance for AI agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for verifiable, enforceable governance at runtime to ensure AI agents comply with regulatory, ethical, and operational constraints across deployments and multi-agent ecosystems.

Method: Introduce Policy Cards as a normative extension to existing transparency artifacts (Model/Data/System Cards). They encode allow/deny rules, obligations, evidentiary requirements, and crosswalk mappings to frameworks like NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, and EU AI Act; support automatic validation, version control, and linkage to runtime enforcement and continuous audits; enable distributed assurance in multi-agent ecosystems.

Result: A practical mechanism that makes governance actionable at deployment, enabling verifiable compliance, enforcement, and continuous auditing of autonomous agents; integrates governance with engineering practice and supports accountable autonomy at scale.

Conclusion: Policy Cards offer a concrete bridge between high-level governance and hands-on engineering, facilitating trustworthy, scalable autonomous systems through a normative, machine-readable constraint layer.

Abstract: Policy Cards are introduced as a machine-readable, deployment-layer standard
for expressing operational, regulatory, and ethical constraints for AI agents.
The Policy Card sits with the agent and enables it to follow required
constraints at runtime. It tells the agent what it must and must not do. As
such, it becomes an integral part of the deployed agent. Policy Cards extend
existing transparency artifacts such as Model, Data, and System Cards by
defining a normative layer that encodes allow/deny rules, obligations,
evidentiary requirements, and crosswalk mappings to assurance frameworks
including NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001, and the EU AI Act. Each Policy Card can
be validated automatically, version-controlled, and linked to runtime
enforcement or continuous-audit pipelines. The framework enables verifiable
compliance for autonomous agents, forming a foundation for distributed
assurance in multi-agent ecosystems. Policy Cards provide a practical mechanism
for integrating high-level governance with hands-on engineering practice and
enabling accountable autonomy at scale.

### [107] [Improving LLM Reasoning via Dependency-Aware Query Decomposition and Logic-Parallel Content Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24390)
*Xianjun Gao,Jianchun Liu,Hongli Xu,Liusheng Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Orion is a two-phase reasoning framework for real-time web apps that uses dependency-aware query decomposition and content-parallel expansion to achieve high-quality reasoning with low latency and high throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a fundamental tension in real-time Web services between requiring high-quality, complex reasoning and meeting strict latency and throughput. Current LLM reasoning relies on sequential generation and rigid strategies, creating bottlenecks and forcing trade-offs between efficiency and quality.

Method: Orion decomposes reasoning into two phases: (1) key point generation via retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting to distill structured key points, and (2) content parallel expansion that elaborates on these points in parallel following a dependency graph to preserve logical consistency. A pipeline scheduling mechanism balances GPU generation pressure and GPU memory usage, enabling cross-query parallelism across multiple queries.

Result: Empirical results show Orion achieves up to 4.33x faster token generation, 3.42x lower answer latency, and up to 18.75% improvement in reasoning quality by explicitly modeling inter-point dependencies.

Conclusion: Orion offers an efficient and high-quality reasoning framework for real-time Web services by combining dependency-aware query decomposition, parallel content expansion, and cross-query scheduling, addressing both latency and reasoning quality requirements.

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into real-time Web
applications, such as AI-powered search and conversational agents, presents a
fundamental Web infrastructure challenge: reconciling the demand for
high-quality, complex reasoning with the stringent low-latency and
high-throughput requirements of interactive services. Current LLM reasoning,
hindered by computationally inefficient sequential generation and rigid
reasoning strategies, creates a critical bottleneck for the Web services.
Existing approaches typically optimize the LLM reasoning for either efficiency
or quality but struggle to achieve both, and thus fail to meet the dual
requirements of modern Web platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Orion, a novel and efficient reasoning framework that enables dependency-aware
query decomposition and logic-parallel content expansion. Concretely, Orion
decomposes a single query reasoning process into two synergistic phases: (1)
\textit{key point generation}, which distills logically structured key points
through retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting, and (2) \textit{content
parallel expansion}, which concurrently elaborates on these points based on a
dependency graph to ensure logical consistency. Furthermore, Orion introduces a
pipeline scheduling mechanism that exploits the complementary computational
characteristics of the two phases (generation imposes pressure on GPU computing
and expansion stresses on GPU memory) across multiple queries, enabling
cross-query parallelism and dramatically improving reasoning performance (\ie,
efficiency and quality). Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that Orion not
only delivers up to 4.33x higher token generation speed and 3.42x lower answer
latency over the baselines but also improves reasoning quality by up to 18.75%
through explicitly modeling inter-point dependencies.

### [108] [APTBench: Benchmarking Agentic Potential of Base LLMs During Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24397)
*Jiarui Qin,Yunjia Xi,Junjie Huang,Renting Rui,Di Yin,Weiwen Liu,Yong Yu,Weinan Zhang,Xing Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: APTBench is a lightweight pre-training benchmark that turns real-world agent tasks into multiple-choice or text-completion prompts to evaluate agentic potential during pre-training, aiming to better predict downstream agent performance with lower cost than post-training evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap between static pre-training benchmarks (focusing on isolated skills) and post-training agent benchmarks (requiring multi-turn skills). A predictive, lightweight tool is needed to guide pre-training toward developing agentic capabilities.

Method: Convert real-world agent tasks and successful trajectories into multiple-choice or text-completion prompts tailored for base models, emphasizing planning and action across key agent domains such as software engineering and deep research.

Result: The abstract proposes the framework and argues it provides a predictive signal of downstream agent performance and is more cost-effective than full post-training, but it does not report empirical results.

Conclusion: APTBench fills a methodological gap by enabling evaluation of agentic potential during pre-training and guiding training to improve downstream agent performance while remaining lightweight compared with end-to-end post-training evaluations.

Abstract: With the rapid development of LLM-based agents, there is a growing trend to
incorporate agent-specific data into the pre-training stage of LLMs, aiming to
better align LLMs with real-world autonomous task execution. However, current
pre-training benchmarks primarily focus on isolated and static skills, e.g.,
common knowledge or mathematical/code reasoning, and fail to reflect model's
agentic capabilities. On the other hand, agent benchmarks are typically
designed for post-trained models, requiring multi-turn task execution abilities
that base models struggle to support. Thus, there is a compelling need for a
benchmark that can evaluate agentic potentials during pre-training and guide
the model training more effectively. To address this gap, we propose APTBench,
a framework that converts real-world agent tasks and successful trajectories
into multiple-choice or text completion questions tailored for base models. It
focuses on core agentic abilities, e.g., planning and action, and covers key
agent scenarios, software engineering and deep research. Compared to existing
general-purpose benchmarks, APTBench offers a more predictive signal of a
model's downstream performance as an agent, while remaining significantly more
lightweight and cost-effective than full-scale, end-to-end agent evaluations
after post-training.

TL;DR: Dynamic safety evaluation for Vision-Language Model-powered mobile agents using MobileRisk-Live sandbox and OS-Sentinel detector.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address underexplored safety risks of mobile agents operating in complex, real-world environments; need a benchmark and effective detection framework.

Method: Create MobileRisk-Live sandbox with realistic trajectories and fine-grained annotations; develop OS-Sentinel, combining a Formal Verifier for explicit violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge for contextual risks.

Result: OS-Sentinel yields 10-30% improvements over existing approaches across multiple metrics; provides insights for safer autonomous mobile agents.

Conclusion: Establishes a foundation for mobile agent safety research and guides the development of safer, more reliable autonomous mobile agents.

Abstract: Computer-using agents powered by Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have
demonstrated human-like capabilities in operating digital environments like
mobile platforms. While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital
automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise
and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety
concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments
presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To
establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce
MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety
detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained
annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety
detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for
detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge
for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that
OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across
multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the
development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents.

### [110] [Adaptive Surrogate Gradients for Sequential Reinforcement Learning in Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24461)
*Korneel Van den Berghe,Stein Stroobants,Vijay Janapa Reddi,G. C. H. E. de Croon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Analyzes surrogate gradient slopes in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for neuromorphic control, finds shallower/scheduled slopes improve RL performance; introduces a privileged guiding policy to bootstrap learning with online interactions; demonstrates adaptive slope schedules on a real-world drone task, surpassing Baselines (e.g., Behavioral Cloning, TD3BC) in average return.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackling two main challenges in SNNs for control: (i) non-differentiable spikes requiring surrogate gradients with unclear optimization properties, and (ii) stateful, sequence-based learning in RL limited by short early training sequences and warm-up dynamics.

Method: Systematically analyze surrogate gradient slope settings, comparing fixed vs. scheduled slopes and their effects on gradient magnitude and alignment; examine both supervised learning and RL; propose a training method that uses a privileged guiding policy to bootstrap learning while continuing online interaction with the spiking policy; apply an adaptive slope schedule to a real-world drone position control task.

Result: In RL, shallower or scheduled slopes yield ~2.1x improvement in both training and deployed performance. On a real-world drone task with an adaptive slope schedule, average return reaches 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques such as Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC (‚â§ -200 points under the same conditions).

Conclusion: Provides a deeper theoretical understanding of surrogate gradient learning in SNNs and demonstrates practical training strategies for neuromorphic controllers in real robotic systems, including a novel privileged-guided bootstrap and adaptive slope scheduling that improves RL performance.

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing systems are set to revolutionize energy-constrained
robotics by achieving orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains, while enabling
native temporal processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a
promising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to
complex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable
nature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear
optimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training
on sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited
sequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging
its warm-up period.
  We address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient
slope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in
deeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning,
we find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much
more pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead
to a 2.1x improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we
propose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to
bootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment
interactions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive
slope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an
average return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques,
including Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most --200 points

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond surface language tasks and assess whether LLMs truly understand information, can perform inferences, and draw logical conclusions.

Method: Compare logical and abstract reasoning abilities of multiple LLMs on eight specially designed questions, against human performance on the same set, analyzing where deductions succeed or fail.

Result: There are significant differences between LLMs and human test-takers, with performance varying by model. LLMs struggle with deduction in several items, indicating gaps in current reasoning abilities despite language proficiency.

Conclusion: Current LLMs exhibit limitations in deductive and abstract reasoning; the study highlights areas for improvement and guides future work in enhancing genuine reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Evaluating reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs) is important for
advancing artificial intelligence, as it transcends mere linguistic task
performance. It involves understanding whether these models truly understand
information, perform inferences, and are able to draw conclusions in a logical
and valid way. This study compare logical and abstract reasoning skills of
several LLMs - including GPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok, Llama, Mistral,
Perplexity, and Sabi\'a - using a set of eight custom-designed reasoning
questions. The LLM results are benchmarked against human performance on the
same tasks, revealing significant differences and indicating areas where LLMs

*Yiding Wang,Yuxuan Chen,Fanxu Meng,Xifan Chen,Xiaolei Yang,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based agents (Law in Silico) can simulate legal systems; macro crime trends align with real-world data; transparency and adaptivity improve protection of vulnerable individuals, suggesting utility for theory and administration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world legal experiments are costly/infeasible; simulating legal societies with AI can verify legal theory and support legal administration; LLMs' world knowledge and role-playing capabilities make them suitable for simulating legal decision-making and institutions.

Method: Develop Law in Silico: an LLM-based agent framework with individual decision-making and institutional mechanisms for legislation, adjudication, and enforcement; run simulations; compare macro crime rates to real-world data; analyze micro-level rights protection.

Result: Simulated macro-level crime trends largely reproduce real-world trends; framework yields insights aligned with observations; micro-level simulations show that a well-functioning, transparent, and adaptive legal system better protects the rights of vulnerable individuals.

Conclusion: LLM-based simulations of legal societies are feasible and informative for theory verification and policy design; highlights the importance of transparency and adaptability in protecting vulnerable groups, and suggests broader potential for AI-assisted legal research and administration.

Abstract: Since real-world legal experiments are often costly or infeasible, simulating
legal societies with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems provides an effective
alternative for verifying and developing legal theory, as well as supporting
legal administration. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their world knowledge
and role-playing capabilities, are strong candidates to serve as the foundation
for legal society simulation. However, the application of LLMs to simulate
legal systems remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Law in Silico,
an LLM-based agent framework for simulating legal scenarios with individual
decision-making and institutional mechanisms of legislation, adjudication, and
enforcement. Our experiments, which compare simulated crime rates with
real-world data, demonstrate that LLM-based agents can largely reproduce
macro-level crime trends and provide insights that align with real-world
observations. At the same time, micro-level simulations reveal that a
well-functioning, transparent, and adaptive legal system offers better
protection of the rights of vulnerable individuals.

*Habtom Kahsay Gidey,Niklas Huber,Alexander Lenz,Alois Knoll*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A two-pattern pattern-language for world modeling from structured data, combining DOM Transduction to compress verbose DOM into a compact, task-relevant world model and Hypermedia Affordances Recognition to dynamically enrich models by interpreting semantic service descriptions at runtime, enabling scalable, adaptive web automation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome (1) the verbosity of raw HTML/structured data that makes direct use by foundation models inefficient, and (2) the static, hardcoded API integrations that hinder agents from adapting to evolving services.

Method: Proposes a pattern-language with two complementary architectural patterns: (a) DOM Transduction Pattern that distills verbose DOM into a compact, task-focused world model; (b) Hypermedia Affordances Recognition Pattern that parses standardized semantic descriptions to discover and integrate capabilities of unknown web services at runtime.

Result: A robust framework for engineering agents to construct and maintain an accurate and scalable world model, enabling adaptive and interoperable automation across the web and its resources.

Conclusion: The two patterns together offer a scalable, dynamic approach to world modeling from structured data, allowing agents to reason efficiently with a compact internal representation and to discover new service capabilities on the fly, thereby enhancing autonomy and interoperability.

Abstract: The autonomy of software agents is fundamentally dependent on their ability
to construct an actionable internal world model from the structured data that
defines their digital environment, such as the Document Object Model (DOM) of
web pages and the semantic descriptions of web services. However, constructing
this world model from raw structured data presents two critical challenges: the
verbosity of raw HTML makes it computationally intractable for direct use by
foundation models, while the static nature of hardcoded API integrations
prevents agents from adapting to evolving services.
  This paper introduces a pattern language for world modeling from structured
data, presenting two complementary architectural patterns. The DOM Transduction
Pattern addresses the challenge of web page complexity by distilling} a
verbose, raw DOM into a compact, task-relevant representation or world model
optimized for an agent's reasoning core. Concurrently, the Hypermedia
Affordances Recognition Pattern enables the agent to dynamically enrich its
world model by parsing standardized semantic descriptions to discover and
integrate the capabilities of unknown web services at runtime. Together, these
patterns provide a robust framework for engineering agents that can efficiently
construct and maintain an accurate world model, enabling scalable, adaptive,
and interoperable automation across the web and its extended resources.

### [114] [From Cross-Task Examples to In-Task Prompts: A Graph-Based Pseudo-Labeling Framework for In-context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24528)
*Zihan Chen,Song Wang,Xingbo Fu,Chengshuai Shi,Zhenyu Lei,Cong Shen,Jundong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A cost-efficient two-stage pipeline for constructing in-task demonstrations for in-context learning by using cross-task LLM prompts to pseudo-label a small set of target instances, followed by graph-based label propagation to label the rest, enabling LLM-free data generation with reduced labeling effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce labeling cost and dependence on large language models for creating high-quality in-context learning demonstrations, by combining cross-task supervision with scalable propagation techniques.

Method: Stage 1: Prompt an LLM with cross-task examples to pseudo-label a small subset of target task instances. Stage 2: Apply a graph-based label propagation algorithm to spread labels to the remaining target examples without further LLM queries. Use the fully pseudo-labeled data to construct in-task demonstrations for ICL.

Result: Experiments across five tasks show strong performance and reduced labeling costs compared to baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed pipeline.

Conclusion: A hybrid strategy that blends cross-task supervision with LLM-free propagation can efficiently generate useful in-task demonstrations for ICL, lowering labeling costs while preserving performance.

Abstract: The capability of in-context learning (ICL) enables large language models
(LLMs) to perform novel tasks without parameter updates by conditioning on a
few input-output examples. However, collecting high-quality examples for new or
challenging tasks can be costly and labor-intensive. In this work, we propose a
cost-efficient two-stage pipeline that reduces reliance on LLMs for data
labeling. Our approach first leverages readily available cross-task examples to
prompt an LLM and pseudo-label a small set of target task instances. We then
introduce a graph-based label propagation method that spreads label information
to the remaining target examples without additional LLM queries. The resulting
fully pseudo-labeled dataset is used to construct in-task demonstrations for
ICL. This pipeline combines the flexibility of cross-task supervision with the
scalability of LLM-free propagation. Experiments across five tasks demonstrate
that our method achieves strong performance while lowering labeling costs.

TL;DR: A data-centric paradigm for GenAI in healthcare that treats the medical data ecosystem as the foundation for all GenAI activities, enabling high-quality data supply, retrieval, and deployment for clinical tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GenAI has transformative potential in healthcare but requires deep understanding of tasks and data, necessitating an integrated data lifecycle and ecosystem to ensure quality, access, and safety.

Method: Reframe the data lifecycle as the core substrate; design a medical data ecosystem that supports integration, representation, and retrieval of heterogeneous data; deploy semantic vector search and contextual querying to support upstream models and downstream clinical applications.

Result: The ecosystem provides high-quality multimodal data for large-scale pretraining and domain-specific fine-tuning, and acts as a knowledge retrieval backend to support task-specific inference via an agentic layer, enabling effective GenAI deployment in healthcare.

Conclusion: A data-centric healthcare GenAI paradigm can sustainably enable accurate, efficient, and safe AI-assisted clinical care by tightly coupling data infrastructure with model and inference layers.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is taking the world by storm. It
promises transformative opportunities for advancing and disrupting existing
practices, including healthcare. From large language models (LLMs) for clinical
note synthesis and conversational assistance to multimodal systems that
integrate medical imaging, electronic health records, and genomic data for
decision support, GenAI is transforming the practice of medicine and the
delivery of healthcare, such as diagnosis and personalized treatments, with
great potential in reducing the cognitive burden on clinicians, thereby
improving overall healthcare delivery. However, GenAI deployment in healthcare
requires an in-depth understanding of healthcare tasks and what can and cannot
be achieved. In this paper, we propose a data-centric paradigm in the design
and deployment of GenAI systems for healthcare. Specifically, we reposition the
data life cycle by making the medical data ecosystem as the foundational
substrate for generative healthcare systems. This ecosystem is designed to
sustainably support the integration, representation, and retrieval of diverse
medical data and knowledge. With effective and efficient data processing
pipelines, such as semantic vector search and contextual querying, it enables
GenAI-powered operations for upstream model components and downstream clinical
applications. Ultimately, it not only supplies foundation models with
high-quality, multimodal data for large-scale pretraining and domain-specific
fine-tuning, but also serves as a knowledge retrieval backend to support
task-specific inference via the agentic layer. The ecosystem enables the
deployment of GenAI for high-quality and effective healthcare delivery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes FunReason-MT, a data-synthesis framework for real-world multi-turn function calling, to generate high-quality training data and improve agentic LLM performance; achieves state-of-the-art results on BFCL benchmarks for 4B models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the need for high-quality, multi-turn FC training data and the three practical challenges: targeted model training, isolation of tool architecture, and multi-turn dependencies.

Method: 1) Environment-API Graph Interactions for diverse trajectories; 2) Advanced Tool-Query Synthesis to ease hard queries; 3) Guided Iterative Chain for enhanced CoT generation.

Result: 4B model trained on FunReason-MT attains state-of-the-art among comparable-sized models on BFCLv3; surpasses many close-source models; BFCLv4 results confirm robustness.

Conclusion: FunReason-MT is a reliable, robust data source to advance agentic learning in real-world, multi-turn tool use.

Abstract: Function calling (FC) empowers large language models (LLMs) and autonomous
agents to interface with external tools, a critical capability for solving
complex, real-world problems. As this ability becomes increasingly central to
advanced AI systems, the need for high-quality, multi-turn training data to
develop and refine it cannot be overstated. Existing data synthesis methods,
such as random environment sampling or multi-agent role-playing, are not
powerful enough to generate high-quality data in real-world environments.
Practical challenges come in three folds: targeted model training, isolation of
tool architecture, and multi-turn logical dependency. To address these
structural deficiencies, we present FunReason-MT, a novel data synthesis
framework for real-world multi-turn tool use. FunReason-MT resolves the
complexity barrier in multi-turn FC data by employing 1) Environment-API Graph
Interactions to gather varied high-quality trajectories, 2) Advanced Tool-Query
Synthesis to simplify hard query construction, and 3) Guided Iterative Chain
for sophisticated CoT generation. Evaluations on Berkeley Function-Calling
Leaderboard (BFCLv3) demonstrate the power of our framework: a 4B model built
upon FunReason-MT generated data achieves state-of-the-art performance among
comparable-sized models, outperforming most close-source models. Further
performance improvements on BFCLv4 confirm that FunReason-MT provides a
reliable and robust source for agentic learning.

*Nitin Rai,Daeun,Choi,Nathan S. Boyd,Arnold W. Schumann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Foundation models (FMs) enable new, integrated approaches for site-specific disease management (SSDM) in crops, merging vision and language to interpret symptoms, reason about management, and support interactive QA. VLMs lead in publications (vs LLMs), with RL/AL still nascent for field spraying. Digital twins with RL offer virtual spray simulation; sim-to-real gap and limited human-in-the-loop collaboration remain key challenges. The field is rapidly growing (2023‚Äì24), with multi-modal FMs and real-time feedback poised to drive next-gen SSDM. A community resource at the AgriPathogenDatabase is highlighted for sharing papers, code, and data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The abstract addresses the demand for accurate, adaptive disease management in crops and the limitations of traditional ML pipelines. Foundation models promise to fuse visual and textual cues, interpret symptoms, and reason about management decisions, enabling more scalable and interactive SSDM for growers, educators, and researchers.

Method: A literature review of ~40 articles on FM applications to SSDM, with a focus on large-language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). The review discusses adaptive learning (AL), reinforcement learning (RL), and digital twin frameworks for targeted spraying, and provides a synthesis of trends, gaps, and future directions.

Result: Key findings include: (a) rapid growth of FM literature in 2023‚Äì24; (b) VLMs outpace LLMs by a factor of 5‚Äì10x in publications; (c) RL and AL are still nascent for smart spraying; (d) digital twins with RL can virtually simulate targeted spraying; (e) sim-to-real gap is critical for deployment; (f) human‚Äìrobot collaboration remains limited, especially in human-in-the-loop settings; (g) multi-modal FMs with real-time feedback are shaping next-gen SSDM.

Conclusion: The field is rapidly evolving toward integrated, multi-modal, interactive SSDM. To transition to real-world use, efforts must address sim-to-real transfer, robust field validation, and increased human-in-the-loop collaboration. The review highlights community resources (e.g., AgriPathogenDatabase) and anticipates that multi-modal FMs with real-time feedback will drive future SSDM developments.

Abstract: Site-specific disease management (SSDM) in crops has advanced rapidly through
machine and deep learning (ML and DL) for real-time computer vision. Research
evolved from handcrafted feature extraction to large-scale automated feature
learning. With foundation models (FMs), crop disease datasets are now processed
in fundamentally new ways. Unlike traditional neural networks, FMs integrate
visual and textual data, interpret symptoms in text, reason about
symptom-management relationships, and support interactive QA for growers and
educators. Adaptive and imitation learning in robotics further enables
field-based disease management. This review screened approx. 40 articles on FM
applications for SSDM, focusing on large-language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), and discussing their role in adaptive learning
(AL), reinforcement learning (RL), and digital twin frameworks for targeted
spraying. Key findings: (a) FMs are gaining traction with surging literature in
2023-24; (b) VLMs outpace LLMs, with a 5-10x increase in publications; (c) RL
and AL are still nascent for smart spraying; (d) digital twins with RL can
simulate targeted spraying virtually; (e) addressing the sim-to-real gap is
critical for real-world deployment; (f) human-robot collaboration remains
limited, especially in human-in-the-loop approaches where robots detect early
symptoms and humans validate uncertain cases; (g) multi-modal FMs with
real-time feedback will drive next-gen SSDM. For updates, resources, and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the complexity of multi-turn tool interactions by encoding tool executions as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with controllable complexity, providing a challenging benchmark and a graph-informed reward.

Method: Develop OrchDAG, a data-generation pipeline that creates DAG-structured tool-use sequences with tunable complexity; evaluate model performance on this dataset; propose a graph-based reward function; test with GRPO-style RL training.

Result: The dataset is challenging yet solvable; the graph-based reward improves RLVR performance when combined with GRPO-style algorithms; highlights the value of leveraging topological structure and data complexity in multi-turn tool use.

Conclusion: Topology-aware data generation and DAG-based representations are beneficial for training models in multi-turn tool use; synthetic DAG datasets can drive improvements in RLVR when paired with graph-informed rewards and GRPO-like training. 

Abstract: Agentic tool use has gained traction with the rise of agentic tool calling,
yet most existing work overlooks the complexity of multi-turn tool
interactions. We introduce OrchDAG, a synthetic data generation pipeline that
models tool execution as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with controllable
complexity. Using this dataset, we benchmark model performance and propose a
graph-based reward to enhance RLVR training. Experiments show that the dataset
presents a challenging but solvable benchmark, and the proposed reward is
effective when combined with GRPO-style algorithms, highlighting the importance
of leveraging topological structure and data complexity in multi-turn tool use.

TL;DR: A framework to model dependencies between tools and documents via knowledge graphs to improve exemplar artifact generation, using a fused tool graph and domain knowledge graph and deep-sparse integration for planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance exemplar artifact generation and planning by capturing dependencies among tools and documents, enabling tool-augmented reasoning and addressing the limitations of isolated tool schemas.

Method: Build a tool knowledge graph from tool schemas (descriptions, arguments, and outputs) using a DeepResearch-inspired analysis; concurrently derive a knowledge graph from internal documents and SOPs; fuse the tool graph with the domain knowledge graph; use a deep-sparse integration strategy to align tool dependencies with procedural knowledge for exemplar plan generation.

Result: Experiments show the unified framework effectively models tool interactions and improves plan generation, highlighting the benefits of linking tool graphs with domain knowledge graphs for tool-augmented reasoning and planning.

Conclusion: Linking tool graphs with domain knowledge graphs enhances tool-augmented reasoning and planning; the framework provides a unified approach to model dependencies and improve exemplar artifact generation.

Abstract: We present a framework for uncovering and exploiting dependencies among tools
and documents to enhance exemplar artifact generation. Our method begins by
constructing a tool knowledge graph from tool schemas,including descriptions,
arguments, and output payloads, using a DeepResearch-inspired analysis. In
parallel, we derive a complementary knowledge graph from internal documents and
SOPs, which is then fused with the tool graph. To generate exemplar plans, we
adopt a deep-sparse integration strategy that aligns structural tool
dependencies with procedural knowledge. Experiments demonstrate that this
unified framework effectively models tool interactions and improves plan
generation, underscoring the benefits of linking tool graphs with domain
knowledge graphs for tool-augmented reasoning and planning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces BERT-ViT-EF for early fused multimodal sentiment analysis using BERT and ViT, extended by DTCN with a post-BERT Transformer and contrastive learning; achieves top results on TumEmo and competitive results on MVSA-Single.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve multimodal sentiment analysis by enabling deeper cross-modal interactions and richer textual context through transformer-based architectures and alignment between modalities.

Method: 1) BERT-ViT-EF uses early fusion of text (BERT) and image (ViT) features. 2) DTCN adds an additional Transformer layer after BERT to refine textual context before fusion and employs a contrastive objective to align text and image representations.

Result: On TumEmo, 78.4% accuracy and 78.3% F1; on MVSA-Single, 76.6% accuracy and 75.9% F1. DTCN achieves best results on TumEmo and competitive performance on MVSA-Single.

Conclusion: Early fusion and deeper contextual modeling in Transformer-based MSA yield improved performance, with cross-modal alignment via contrastive learning enhancing multimodal feature learning.

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) seeks to understand human emotions by
jointly analyzing data from multiple modalities typically text and images
offering a richer and more accurate interpretation than unimodal approaches. In
this paper, we first propose BERT-ViT-EF, a novel model that combines powerful
Transformer-based encoders BERT for textual input and ViT for visual input
through an early fusion strategy. This approach facilitates deeper cross-modal
interactions and more effective joint representation learning. To further
enhance the model's capability, we propose an extension called the Dual
Transformer Contrastive Network (DTCN), which builds upon BERT-ViT-EF. DTCN
incorporates an additional Transformer encoder layer after BERT to refine
textual context (before fusion) and employs contrastive learning to align text
and image representations, fostering robust multimodal feature learning.
Empirical results on two widely used MSA benchmarks MVSA-Single and TumEmo
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. DTCN achieves best accuracy
(78.4%) and F1-score (78.3%) on TumEmo, and delivers competitive performance on
MVSA-Single, with 76.6% accuracy and 75.9% F1-score. These improvements
highlight the benefits of early fusion and deeper contextual modeling in
Transformer-based multimodal sentiment analysis.

### [121] [Speeding Up MACE: Low-Precision Tricks for Equivarient Force Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23621)
*Alexandre Benoit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Evaluates how low-precision arithmetic and GPU backends affect MACE SO(3)-equivariant ML force fields for MD. Finds cuEquivariance plus selective BF16/FP16 on linear layers can dramatically speed up inference with negligible loss in MD fidelity; training with half-precision harms force accuracy. Provides a practical deployment policy and points to further gains on newer GPUs and kernel optimizations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the computational cost of machine-learning force fields (MD) while preserving physical fidelity, especially for SO(3)-equivariant models like MACE, and assess the impact of precision and backend choices.

Method: Profile MACE end-to-end and per block; compare e3nn versus NVIDIA cuEquivariance backends; evaluate FP64/FP32/BF16/FP16 (with FP32 accumulation) for inference, short NVT and long NPT water MD, and toy training runs, under reproducible timing; analyze results.

Result: cuEquivariance reduces inference latency by ~3x. Casting only linear layers to BF16/FP16 within an FP32 model yields ~4x additional speedups; MD observables remain within run-to-run variability. Training with half-precision weights degrades force RMSE. Mixing e3nn and cuEq modules without adapters causes representation mismatches. Fused equivariant kernels and mixed-precision inference can substantially accelerate state-of-the-art force fields with negligible impact on MD. Practical policy: use cuEquivariance with FP32 by default and enable BF16/FP16 for linear layers (with FP32 accumulations); training remains FP32. Additional gains expected on Ampere/Hopper GPUs (TF32/BF16) and from kernel-level FP16/BF16 paths and pipeline fusion.

Conclusion: The study provides a practical set of guidelines to accelerate MACE-driven MD workflows with minimal fidelity loss, highlights the trade-offs of reduced-precision training, and points to hardware and kernel optimizations as a route for further speedups.

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields can deliver accurate molecular dynamics (MD) at
high computational cost. For SO(3)-equivariant models such as MACE, there is
little systematic evidence on whether reduced-precision arithmetic and
GPU-optimized kernels can cut this cost without harming physical fidelity. This
thesis aims to make MACE cheaper and faster while preserving accuracy by
identifying computational bottlenecks and evaluating low-precision execution
policies. We profile MACE end-to-end and per block, compare the e3nn and NVIDIA
cuEquivariance backends, and assess FP64/FP32/BF16/FP16 settings (with FP32
accumulation) for inference, short NVT and long NPT water simulations, and toy
training runs under reproducible, steady-state timing. cuEquivariance reduces
inference latency by about $3\times$. Casting only linear layers to BF16/FP16
within an FP32 model yields roughly 4x additional speedups, while energies and
thermodynamic observables in NVT/NPT MD remain within run-to-run variability.
Half-precision weights during training degrade force RMSE. Mixing e3nn and cuEq
modules without explicit adapters causes representation mismatches. Fused
equivariant kernels and mixed-precision inference can substantially accelerate
state-of-the-art force fields with negligible impact on downstream MD. A
practical policy is to use cuEquivariance with FP32 by default and enable
BF16/FP16 for linear layers (keeping FP32 accumulations) for maximum
throughput, while training remains in FP32. Further gains are expected on
Ampere/Hopper GPUs (TF32/BF16) and from kernel-level FP16/BF16 paths and
pipeline fusion.

TL;DR: Adversarial attacks threaten healthcare AI systems by causing dangerous misclassifications; defenses offer partial mitigation but degrade performance on clean data; calls for a holistic, ethics-informed resilience approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safeguard patient safety and equity in AI-based healthcare by understanding vulnerabilities and strengthening defenses.

Method: Empirical study on a dermatological dataset with adversarial attacks; includes threat modeling, benchmarking, and model evaluation; assesses defenses such as adversarial training and distillation.

Result: Adversarial methods substantially reduce classification accuracy; defenses lower attack success but at cost to clean-data performance; defenses are only partially effective, highlighting trade-offs between robustness and accuracy.

Conclusion: Advocates integrated technical, ethical, and policy-based strategies to build more resilient and equitable healthcare AI.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a severe risk to AI systems used in healthcare,
capable of misleading models into dangerous misclassifications that can delay
treatments or cause misdiagnoses. These attacks, often imperceptible to human
perception, threaten patient safety, particularly in underserved populations.
Our study explores these vulnerabilities through empirical experimentation on a
dermatological dataset, where adversarial methods significantly reduce
classification accuracy. Through detailed threat modeling, experimental
benchmarking, and model evaluation, we demonstrate both the severity of the
threat and the partial success of defenses like adversarial training and
distillation. Our results show that while defenses reduce attack success rates,
they must be balanced against model performance on clean data. We conclude with
a call for integrated technical, ethical, and policy-based approaches to build
more resilient, equitable AI in healthcare.

*Tiago Mendon√ßa dos Santos,Rafael Izbicki,Lu√≠s Gustavo Esteves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two shallow-forest methods (DiNo and RanBu) convert a small set of depth-limited trees into fast, distance-weighted predictors, achieving similar or better accuracy than full random forests with large speedups; extendable to quantile regression; open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce inference latency and memory usage of random forests on tabular data, enabling deployment in latency-sensitive or resource-constrained environments, while preserving accuracy, especially under noise.

Method: DiNo measures cophenetic distances via the most recent common ancestor of observation pairs; RanBu applies kernel smoothing to Breiman's proximity. Both methods operate post-training: no new trees are grown, require tuning a single bandwidth h, and rely on lightweight matrix-vector operations.

Result: RanBu matches or exceeds the accuracy of full-depth random forests, particularly in high-noise settings, with up to 95% reduction in training and inference time. DiNo provides a favorable bias-variance trade-off in low-noise regimes at a modest computational cost. Both extend to quantile regression with substantial speed gains. Tested on three synthetic benchmarks and 25 public datasets.

Conclusion: These methods offer efficient, accurate alternatives to deep random forests for structured tabular data, enabling deployment in resource-constrained settings; an open-source R/C++ package is available, with future work including extensions to other modalities.

Abstract: Random Forest ensembles are a strong baseline for tabular prediction tasks,
but their reliance on hundreds of deep trees often results in high inference
latency and memory demands, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
resource-constrained environments. We introduce DiNo (Distance with Nodes) and
RanBu (Random Bushes), two shallow-forest methods that convert a small set of
depth-limited trees into efficient, distance-weighted predictors. DiNo measures
cophenetic distances via the most recent common ancestor of observation pairs,
while RanBu applies kernel smoothing to Breiman's classical proximity measure.
Both approaches operate entirely after forest training: no additional trees are
grown, and tuning of the single bandwidth parameter $h$ requires only
lightweight matrix-vector operations. Across three synthetic benchmarks and 25
public datasets, RanBu matches or exceeds the accuracy of full-depth random
forests-particularly in high-noise settings-while reducing training plus
inference time by up to 95\%. DiNo achieves the best bias-variance trade-off in
low-noise regimes at a modest computational cost. Both methods extend directly
to quantile regression, maintaining accuracy with substantial speed gains. The
implementation is available as an open-source R/C++ package at
https://github.com/tiagomendonca/dirf. We focus on structured tabular random
samples (i.i.d.), leaving extensions to other modalities for future work.

### [124] [From Detection to Discovery: A Closed-Loop Approach for Simultaneous and Continuous Medical Knowledge Expansion and Depression Detection on Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23626)
*Shuang Geng,Wenli Zhang,Jiaheng Xie,Rui Wang,Sudha Ram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A closed-loop LLM‚Äìknowledge graph framework for depression risk detection from social media UGC that jointly detects depression and extracts entities, uses a knowledge graph to refine predictions, and iteratively expands knowledge under expert supervision, achieving improved prediction and richer clinical understanding through prediction-learning cycles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite incorporating medical knowledge for accuracy, prior work misses opportunities to expand medical knowledge via predictive processes; there is a need for adaptive, co-evolving knowledge systems for dynamic mental health monitoring.

Method: Two-phase loop: (1) knowledge-aware depression detection where the LLM jointly detects depression and extracts entities, building and weighting a knowledge graph to refine predictions. (2) knowledge refinement and expansion where the LLM outputs new entities, relationships, and entity types that experts then incorporate into the KG for continual evolution.

Result: Applied to large-scale user-generated content, the framework achieves improved predictive accuracy and deeper medical understanding; expert evaluations identify clinically meaningful symptoms, comorbidities, and social triggers that complement existing literature.

Conclusion: Introduces and operationalizes prediction-through-learning and learning-through-prediction as mutually reinforcing processes; demonstrates co-evolution of computational models and domain knowledge; provides a foundation for adaptive, data-driven knowledge systems for dynamic risk monitoring and extends to other domains.

Abstract: Social media user-generated content (UGC) provides real-time, self-reported
indicators of mental health conditions such as depression, offering a valuable
source for predictive analytics. While prior studies integrate medical
knowledge to improve prediction accuracy, they overlook the opportunity to
simultaneously expand such knowledge through predictive processes. We develop a
Closed-Loop Large Language Model (LLM)-Knowledge Graph framework that
integrates prediction and knowledge expansion in an iterative learning cycle.
In the knowledge-aware depression detection phase, the LLM jointly performs
depression detection and entity extraction, while the knowledge graph
represents and weights these entities to refine prediction performance. In the
knowledge refinement and expansion phase, new entities, relationships, and
entity types extracted by the LLM are incorporated into the knowledge graph
under expert supervision, enabling continual knowledge evolution. Using
large-scale UGC, the framework enhances both predictive accuracy and medical
understanding. Expert evaluations confirmed the discovery of clinically
meaningful symptoms, comorbidities, and social triggers complementary to
existing literature. We conceptualize and operationalize
prediction-through-learning and learning-through-prediction as mutually
reinforcing processes, advancing both methodological and theoretical
understanding in predictive analytics. The framework demonstrates the
co-evolution of computational models and domain knowledge, offering a
foundation for adaptive, data-driven knowledge systems applicable to other
dynamic risk monitoring contexts.

### [125] [Chain of Execution Supervision Promotes General Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23629)
*Nuo Chen,Zehua Li,Keqin Bao,Junyang Lin,Dayiheng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TracePile introduces a 2.6M-sample corpus that converts code execution into explicit, step-by-step Chain of Execution (CoE) rationales to bolster robust reasoning in LLMs. It spans math, algorithms, and coding domains, and uses variable-tracing and code rewriting to enhance granularity. Across four base models and 20 benchmarks, it yields consistent gains, notably +7.1% average on math for LLaMA3.1-8B and improvements on LiveCodeBench, CRUX, and MMLU with two-stage fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code contains rich logic but reasoning is often implicit and noisy; explicit CoE derived from code execution could disentangle reasoning from syntax and noise, enabling scalable improvements in general reasoning for LLMs.

Method: Construct TracePile by transforming code execution traces into Chain of Execution (CoE) rationales; include domains such as math, classical algorithms, and algorithmic competition; add variable-tracing questions and code rewritings to increase logical granularity and diversity; evaluate with continue-pretraining, instruction tuning after pretraining, and two-stage finetuning across four base models (LLaMA 3, LLaMA 3.1, Qwen-2.5, Qwen-2.5 Coder) on 20 benchmarks spanning math, code, logic, and algorithms.

Result: TracePile yields consistent improvements across models and benchmarks; for example, LLaMA3.1-8B shows an average +7.1% gain on nine math datasets; two-stage fine-tuning yields clear gains on LiveCodeBench, CRUX, and MMLU.

Conclusion: Explicitly tracing code execution as CoE is a viable pathway to enhance reasoning in LLMs, with large gains under structured fine-tuning; the dataset's breadth and multi-domain focus support broader generalization of reasoning abilities.

Abstract: Building robust and general reasoning ability is a central goal in the
development of large language models (LLMs). Recent efforts increasingly turn
to code as a rich training source, given its inherent logical structure and
diverse reasoning paradigms such as divide-and-conquer, topological ordering,
and enumeration. However, reasoning in code is often expressed implicitly and
entangled with syntactic or implementation noise, making direct training on raw
code suboptimal.To address this, we introduce TracePile, a large-scale corpus
of 2.6 million samples that transforms code execution into explicit,
step-by-step chain-of-thought-style rationales, which we call Chain of
Execution (CoE). The corpus spans domains including mathematics, classical
algorithms and algorithmic competition, and is enriched with variable-tracing
questions and code rewritings to enhance logical granularity and code
diversity. We evaluate TracePile using three training setups:
continue-pretraining, instruction tuning after pretraining, and two-stage
finetuning. Experiments across four base models (LLaMA 3, LLaMA 3.1, Qwen-2.5,
and Qwen-2.5 Coder) and 20 benchmarks covering math, code, logic, and
algorithms demonstrate consistent improvements. Notably, TracePile boosts
LLaMA3.1-8B by 7.1\% on average across nine math datasets and delivers clear
gains on LiveCodeBench, CRUX, and MMLU under two-stage fine-tuning.

*Ninghui Feng,Yiyan Qi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces number-to-event reasoning for numerical time-series, proposing AGE, EveDTS, and a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline, achieving better event-level precision/recall than LLM baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle to understand purely numerical time-series and to infer interpretable latent events from numerical changes; existing work focuses on forecasting without revealing underlying drivers or reasoning, and data scarcity/semantic alignment hinder learning.

Method: Agent-guided Event Extractor (AGE) to identify candidate events; a marked multivariate Hawkes-based synthetic generator (EveDTS) to create aligned training data; a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline combining a time-series encoder with a structured decoder to generate explanations and structured event hypotheses.

Result: Experimental evaluation on multi-domain datasets shows substantial improvements in event-level precision and recall over strong LLM baselines.

Conclusion: Proposes a novel framework that unites quantitative reasoning with semantic interpretation, enabling LLMs to explain and predict events directly from numerical dynamics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive multimodal
reasoning capabilities, yet their understanding of purely numerical time-series
signals remains limited. Existing approaches mainly focus on forecasting or
trend description, without uncovering the latent events that drive numerical
changes or explaining the reasoning process behind them. In this work, we
introduce the task of number-to-event reasoning and decoding, which aims to
infer interpretable structured events from numerical inputs, even when current
text is unavailable. To address the data scarcity and semantic alignment
challenges, we propose a reasoning-aware framework that integrates an
agent-guided event extractor (AGE), a marked multivariate Hawkes-based
synthetic generator (EveDTS), and a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline combining a
time-series encoder with a structured decoder. Our model explicitly reasons
over numerical changes, generates intermediate explanations, and outputs
structured event hypotheses. Experiments on multi-domain datasets show that our
method substantially outperforms strong LLM baselines in event-level precision
and recall. These results suggest a new direction for bridging quantitative
reasoning and semantic understanding, enabling LLMs to explain and predict
events directly from numerical dynamics.

### [127] [Beyond Pairwise: Empowering LLM Alignment With Ranked Choice Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23631)
*Yuxuan Tang,Yifan Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RCPO is a unified framework that extends pairwise alignment methods to ranked (multiwise/top-k) preferences using maximum likelihood over choice models, showing empirical gains on Llama-3 and Gemma models across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment relies on simple pairwise preferences. Richer human feedback (multiwise and top-k rankings) can improve learning but requires principled objectives and modeling.

Method: Introduce RCPO that connects preference optimization with ranked-choice modeling using maximum likelihood. It supports utility-based (e.g., Multinomial Logit) and rank-based (e.g., Mallows-RMJ) models, subsumes pairwise methods like DPO/SimPO, and provides training objectives for richer feedback. Instantiated with MNL and Mallows-RMJ and evaluated on Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-it across AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard.

Result: RCPO consistently outperforms competitive baselines on the tested benchmarks, demonstrating that directly leveraging ranked preference data with suitable choice models yields more effective alignment.

Conclusion: Ranked preference data, when paired with appropriate choice models, offer a versatile and extensible foundation for improving LLM alignment, with RCPO serving as a unified framework to incorporate ranked (multiwise/top-k) feedback into training.

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) has predominantly relied on
pairwise preference optimization, where annotators select the better of two
responses to a prompt. While simple, this approach overlooks the opportunity to
learn from richer forms of human feedback, such as multiwise comparisons and
top-$k$ rankings. We propose Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO), a
unified framework that bridges preference optimization with (ranked) choice
modeling via maximum likelihood estimation. The framework is flexible,
supporting both utility-based and rank-based choice models. It subsumes several
existing pairwise methods (e.g., DPO, SimPO), while providing principled
training objectives for richer feedback formats. We instantiate this framework
with two representative ranked choice models (Multinomial Logit and
Mallows-RMJ). Empirical studies on Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-it across
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks show that RCPO consistently outperforms
competitive baselines. RCPO shows how directly leveraging ranked preference
data, combined with the right choice models, yields more effective alignment.
It offers a versatile and extensible foundation for incorporating (ranked)
choice modeling into LLM training.

*Guozhong Li,Muhannad Alhumaidi,Spiros Skiadopoulos,Panos Kalnis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMCOMP uses decoder-only LLMs to perform lossy, error-bounded compression of high-res scientific data by tokenizing 3D fields, ordering with Z-order, training an autoregressive transformer with spatial-temporal embeddings, and performing top-k predictions with rank indices and corrections; it outperforms state-of-the-art by up to 30% in compression ratio under strict error bounds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growth of high-resolution simulations and observations yields massive spatiotemporal data; there is a need for efficient, error-bounded compression. Traditional compressors may be limited; leveraging decoder-only LLMs promises powerful sequence modeling for data compression.

Method: Quantize 3D fields into discrete tokens; arrange tokens with Z-order curves to preserve locality; use coverage-guided sampling to improve training efficiency; train an autoregressive transformer with spatial-temporal embeddings to model token transitions; during compression, perform top-k prediction, storing only rank indices and fallback corrections to maintain strict error bounds.

Result: Experiments on multiple reanalysis datasets show LLMCOMP outperforms state-of-the-art compressors, achieving up to 30% higher compression ratios under strict error bounds.

Conclusion: LLMs can serve as general-purpose compressors for high-fidelity scientific data, enabling efficient storage with guaranteed error bounds.

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution scientific simulations and observation
systems is generating massive spatiotemporal datasets, making efficient,
error-bounded compression increasingly important. Meanwhile, decoder-only large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modeling
complex sequential data. In this paper, we propose LLMCOMP, a novel lossy
compression paradigm that leverages decoder-only large LLMs to model scientific
data. LLMCOMP first quantizes 3D fields into discrete tokens, arranges them via
Z-order curves to preserve locality, and applies coverage-guided sampling to
enhance training efficiency. An autoregressive transformer is then trained with
spatial-temporal embeddings to model token transitions. During compression, the
model performs top-k prediction, storing only rank indices and fallback
corrections to ensure strict error bounds. Experiments on multiple reanalysis
datasets show that LLMCOMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
compressors, achieving up to 30% higher compression ratios under strict error
bounds. These results highlight the potential of LLMs as general-purpose
compressors for high-fidelity scientific data.

*Xun Su,Hiroyuki Kasai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Noise Combination Sampling (NCS) for diffusion-based inverse problems, synthesizing an optimal noise in a subspace to approximate the measurement score, enabling conditional information embedding with reduced tuning and improved robustness, especially for small generation steps (T).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In zero-shot inverse problem solving with pretrained diffusion models, excessive integration of observation data can disrupt generation, while insufficient integration fails to enforce problem constraints. A method is needed to incorporate measurement information without destabilizing the generative process.

Method: Proposes Noise Combination Sampling: construct a noise vector from a subspace to approximate the measurement score, replacing the standard noise term in the DDPM process, so conditional information is naturally embedded during generation without step-wise hyperparameter tuning.

Result: When the number of generation steps T is small, it achieves superior performance with negligible computational overhead, and improves robustness and stability across inverse problems (e.g., image compression).

Conclusion: Noise Combination Sampling provides a general, efficient mechanism to integrate observation constraints into diffusion-based inverse problem solvers without extensive hyperparameter tuning, broadly enhancing performance and stability.

Abstract: Pretrained diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
zero-shot inverse problem solving by incorporating observation information into
the generation process of the diffusion models. However, this presents an
inherent dilemma: excessive integration can disrupt the generative process,
while insufficient integration fails to emphasize the constraints imposed by
the inverse problem. To address this, we propose \emph{Noise Combination
Sampling}, a novel method that synthesizes an optimal noise vector from a noise
subspace to approximate the measurement score, replacing the noise term in the
standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models process. This enables
conditional information to be naturally embedded into the generation process
without reliance on step-wise hyperparameter tuning. Our method can be applied
to a wide range of inverse problem solvers, including image compression, and,
particularly when the number of generation steps $T$ is small, achieves
superior performance with negligible computational overhead, significantly
improving robustness and stability.

*Soutrik Sarangi,Yonatan Sverdlov,Nadav Dym,Abir De*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes and analyzes monotone and separating (MAS) set-to-vector functions that preserve subset containment: S ‚äÜ T iff F(S) ‚â§ F(T). Derives dimension bounds and a nonexistence result for infinite ground sets, and introduces a 'our' model with a relaxed weakly MAS property and H√∂lder continuity. Shows MAS can yield universal monotone models that approximate all monotone set functions; empirical results show gains over standard set models; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To design vector embeddings of sets that preserve the natural subset containment relation, enabling reliable set containment tasks.

Method: Theoretical bounds on the vector dimension needed for MAS; impossibility result for infinite ground sets; introduce a pragmatic model (the 'our' model) that achieves weakly MAS with H√∂lder stability; construct universal monotone models based on MAS; empirical evaluation on set containment tasks comparing against standard models.

Result: Finite ground sets admit MAS functions with dimension bounds; infinite ground sets do not admit MAS; a weakly MAS model with H√∂lder continuity is proposed; MAS-based universal monotone models can approximate all monotone set functions; experiments show empirical advantages over standard set models.

Conclusion: MAS-based embeddings provide a principled inductive bias for set containment; the weakly MAS model offers a practical, stable alternative for infinite domains; code is publicly available for reproduction.

Abstract: Motivated by applications for set containment problems, we consider the
following fundamental problem: can we design set-to-vector functions so that
the natural partial order on sets is preserved, namely $S\subseteq T \text{ if
and only if } F(S)\leq F(T) $. We call functions satisfying this property
Monotone and Separating (MAS) set functions. % We establish lower and upper
bounds for the vector dimension necessary to obtain MAS functions, as a
function of the cardinality of the multisets and the underlying ground set. In
the important case of an infinite ground set, we show that MAS functions do not
exist, but provide a model called our which provably enjoys a relaxed MAS
property we name "weakly MAS" and is stable in the sense of Holder continuity.
We also show that MAS functions can be used to construct universal models that
are monotone by construction and can approximate all monotone set functions.
Experimentally, we consider a variety of set containment tasks. The experiments
show the benefit of using our our model, in comparison with standard set models
which do not incorporate set containment as an inductive bias. Our code is
available in https://github.com/yonatansverdlov/Monotone-Embedding.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Real-world evaluation of Skeptical Learning (SKEL) with end-user confirmation over four weeks using an iLog app, revealing a trade-off between user effort and data quality, and showing SKEL‚Äôs potential to reduce annotation effort while improving data quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test SKEL under realistic conditions with end-user input, addressing the earlier lack of user-confirmed annotations and evaluating how well SKEL preserves annotation accuracy when users refine labels.

Method: Longitudinal field study with university students over four weeks using the iLog mobile app. Participants provide/refine input labels and data from smartphone context; SKEL performance is assessed in real-world conditions, focusing on annotation accuracy, user effort, and data quality.

Result: Findings highlight the challenge of balancing user effort and data quality in annotations. SKEL shows potential benefits, including reduced annotation effort and improved quality of collected data, when end-user confirmation is incorporated.

Conclusion: Incorporating end-user input in SKEL‚Äôs evaluation demonstrates its promise for reducing labeling effort and enhancing data quality in real-world settings, while underscoring the need to optimize the effort‚Äìquality trade-off.

Abstract: Any digital personal assistant, whether used to support task performance,
answer questions, or manage work and daily life, including fitness schedules,
requires high-quality annotations to function properly. However, user
annotations, whether actively produced or inferred from context (e.g., data
from smartphone sensors), are often subject to errors and noise. Previous
research on Skeptical Learning (SKEL) addressed the issue of noisy labels by
comparing offline active annotations with passive data, allowing for an
evaluation of annotation accuracy. However, this evaluation did not include
confirmation from end-users, the best judges of their own context. In this
study, we evaluate SKEL's performance in real-world conditions with actual
users who can refine the input labels based on their current perspectives and
needs. The study involves university students using the iLog mobile application
on their devices over a period of four weeks. The results highlight the
challenges of finding the right balance between user effort and data quality,
as well as the potential benefits of using SKEL, which include reduced
annotation effort and improved quality of collected data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Delays degrade air-traffic efficiency; current approaches often underutilize cross-modal information and real-time context; a scalable, real-time solution context for air traffic controllers monitoring terminal-area delays is needed.

Method: Proposes adapting trajectory representations into the language modality and integrating textual aeronautical information (flight data, weather reports, aerodrome NOTAMs) to form a multimodal input for a lightweight LLM, enabling cross-modality understanding and real-time updates.

Result: Achieves sub-minute prediction error; effectively leverages contextual information about delay sources; demonstrates practicality and scalability for real-world, real-time operations with updates as new information arrives.

Conclusion: Linguistic understanding combined with cross-modality adaptation of trajectory information enhances delay prediction and yields a practical, scalable framework for real-time ATC operations.

Abstract: Flight delay prediction has become a key focus in air traffic management, as
delays highlight inefficiencies that impact overall network performance. This
paper presents a lightweight large language model-based multimodal flight delay
prediction, formulated from the perspective of air traffic controllers
monitoring aircraft delay after entering the terminal area. The approach
integrates trajectory representations with textual aeronautical information,
including flight information, weather reports, and aerodrome notices, by
adapting trajectory data into the language modality to capture airspace
conditions. Experimental results show that the model consistently achieves
sub-minute prediction error by effectively leveraging contextual information
related to the sources of delay. The framework demonstrates that linguistic
understanding, when combined with cross-modality adaptation of trajectory
information, enhances delay prediction. Moreover, the approach shows
practicality and scalability for real-world operations, supporting real-time
updates that refine predictions upon receiving new operational information.

Conclusion: Incorporating relational information through a graph-augmented framework significantly enhances premise selection, demonstrating the value of combining textual representations with structured dependencies in theorem proving.

Abstract: Premise selection is a key bottleneck for scaling theorem proving in large
formal libraries. Yet existing language-based methods often treat premises in
isolation, ignoring the web of dependencies that connects them. We present a
graph-augmented approach that combines dense text embeddings of Lean
formalizations with graph neural networks over a heterogeneous dependency graph
capturing both state--premise and premise--premise relations. On the LeanDojo

TL;DR: MuMo is a structured multimodal fusion framework for molecular representation that tackles 3D conformer unreliability and modality collapse via a Structured Fusion Pipeline and Progressive Injection, achieving state-of-the-art performance across 29 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal molecular models suffer from unstable conformation-dependent fusion and modality collapse, limiting robustness and generalization; a stable, integrated prior and asymmetric fusion strategy can improve performance.

Method: 1) Structured Fusion Pipeline (SFP) combines 2D topology and 3D geometry into a unified structural prior; 2) Progressive Injection (PI) asymmetrically injects this prior into the sequence stream to preserve modality-specific modeling while enabling cross-modal enrichment; 3) implemented on a state-space backbone for long-range dependencies.

Result: On 29 benchmark tasks from Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) and MoleculeNet, MuMo improves by 2.7% on average over the best baseline, ranks first on 22 tasks, including a 27% gain on the LD50 task; demonstrates robustness to 3D conformer noise; code released at github.com/selmiss/MuMo.

Conclusion: MuMo effectively mitigates 3D conformer unreliability and modality collapse, yielding robust multimodal molecular representations and state-of-the-art results on diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Multimodal molecular models often suffer from 3D conformer unreliability and
modality collapse, limiting their robustness and generalization. We propose
MuMo, a structured multimodal fusion framework that addresses these challenges
in molecular representation through two key strategies. To reduce the
instability of conformer-dependent fusion, we design a Structured Fusion
Pipeline (SFP) that combines 2D topology and 3D geometry into a unified and
stable structural prior. To mitigate modality collapse caused by naive fusion,
we introduce a Progressive Injection (PI) mechanism that asymmetrically
integrates this prior into the sequence stream, preserving modality-specific
modeling while enabling cross-modal enrichment. Built on a state space
backbone, MuMo supports long-range dependency modeling and robust information
propagation. Across 29 benchmark tasks from Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) and
MoleculeNet, MuMo achieves an average improvement of 2.7% over the
best-performing baseline on each task, ranking first on 22 of them, including a
27% improvement on the LD50 task. These results validate its robustness to 3D
conformer noise and the effectiveness of multimodal fusion in molecular
representation. The code is available at: github.com/selmiss/MuMo.

TL;DR: SAL-T is a linear-attention transformer variant for high-energy physics that uses physics-informed spatial partitioning and local convolutions to maintain linear complexity while achieving competitive accuracy with full-attention models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the quadratic complexity of transformers in high-throughput environments like the CERN LHC, enabling faster inference without sacrificing performance.

Method: Introduce Spatially Aware Linear Transformer (SAL-T): partition particles spatially based on kinematic features to compute attention between physically significant regions; incorporate convolutional layers to capture local correlations informed by jet physics; build on the linformer architecture to maintain linear attention; validate on jet classification and ModelNet10; release code at the provided URL.

Result: SAL-T outperforms standard linformer in jet classification and achieves accuracy comparable to full-attention transformers, while using markedly fewer resources and exhibiting lower inference latency. Experiments on ModelNet10 further corroborate the linear-attention trend.

Conclusion: SAL-T demonstrates a practical, resource-efficient transformer design for high-energy physics and 3D data, combining physics-informed partitioning with local convolutions to maintain performance with linear complexity; supports deployment in high-throughput experiments and provides a usable codebase.

Abstract: Transformers are very effective in capturing both global and local
correlations within high-energy particle collisions, but they present
deployment challenges in high-data-throughput environments, such as the CERN
LHC. The quadratic complexity of transformer models demands substantial
resources and increases latency during inference. In order to address these
issues, we introduce the Spatially Aware Linear Transformer (SAL-T), a
physics-inspired enhancement of the linformer architecture that maintains
linear attention. Our method incorporates spatially aware partitioning of
particles based on kinematic features, thereby computing attention between
regions of physical significance. Additionally, we employ convolutional layers
to capture local correlations, informed by insights from jet physics. In
addition to outperforming the standard linformer in jet classification tasks,
SAL-T also achieves classification results comparable to full-attention
transformers, while using considerably fewer resources with lower latency
during inference. Experiments on a generic point cloud classification dataset

### [137] [Efficient Low Rank Attention for Long-Context Inference in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23649)
*Tenghui Li,Guoxu Zhou,Xuyang Zhao,Yuning Qiu,Qibin Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LRQK is a two-stage Long-Context KV cache framework that factorizes query/key matrices into low-rank factors to enable efficient attention computation and selective KV transfers, achieving memory savings with minimal accuracy loss on long-context benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-context inference in LLMs is constrained by the GPU memory cost of storing and accessing the KV cache. Existing KV compression (quantization/pruning) sacrifices precision or key-value retention, limiting long-context performance.

Method: During prefill, decompose full-precision query and key matrices into compact rank-r factors. During decoding, compute proxy attention scores in O(l r) using these factors. Use a top-k + small recent token subset with a mixed GPU-CPU cache and a hit/miss policy that transfers only missing full-precision KV pairs, preserving exact attention outputs while reducing data movement.

Result: Empirical evaluations on RULER and LongBench with LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen2.5-7B show LRQK matches or surpasses leading sparse-attention methods in long-context scenarios, delivering significant memory savings with minimal accuracy loss.

Conclusion: LRQK provides an effective, memory-efficient long-context attention mechanism by combining low-rank factorization with selective KV transfers; the authors release code for reproducibility.

Abstract: As the length of input text grows, the key-value (KV) cache in LLMs imposes
prohibitive GPU memory costs and limits long-context inference on resource
constrained devices. Existing approaches, such as KV quantization and pruning,
reduce memory usage but suffer from numerical precision loss or suboptimal
retention of key-value pairs. We introduce Low Rank Query and Key attention
(LRQK), a two-stage framework that jointly decomposes the full-precision query
and key matrices into compact rank-\(r\) factors during the prefill stage, and
then uses these low-dimensional projections to compute proxy attention scores
in \(\mathcal{O}(lr)\) time at each decode step. By selecting only the
top-\(k\) tokens and a small fixed set of recent tokens, LRQK employs a mixed
GPU-CPU cache with a hit-and-miss mechanism that transfers only missing
full-precision KV pairs, thereby preserving exact attention outputs while
reducing CPU-GPU data movement. Extensive experiments on the RULER and
LongBench benchmarks with LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate that LRQK
matches or surpasses leading sparse-attention methods in long context settings,
while delivering significant memory savings with minimal loss in accuracy. Our
code is available at https://github.com/tenghuilee/LRQK.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes static and dynamic zero-shot logits-layer debiasing; dynamic reduces bias up to 70% with minimal fluency loss; logits intervention outperforms hidden-layer approaches; semantic-aware logits intervention is stable and effective for debiasing aligned LLMs.


<details>

Motivation: Tackle bias in language models without retraining by intervening at the logits layer; compare zero-shot logits-based methods to hidden-layer debiasing.

Method: Introduce two zero-shot logits-layer debiasing strategies (static and dynamic) and a semantic-aware logits intervention; assess performance against hidden-layer approaches on aligned LLMs.

Result: Dynamic method achieves up to ~70% bias reduction with minimal fluency loss; logits intervention outperforms hidden-layer debiasing; semantic-aware logits intervention is stable and effective for debiasing aligned LLMs.

Conclusion: Logits-intervention-based debiasing is a robust and effective approach for aligned LLMs, with static/dynamic variants offering strong bias mitigation and favorable fluency trade-offs; semantic-aware logits intervention shows particular promise.

Abstract: We proposed Static and Dynamic -- two zero-shot logits-layer debiasing
methods. Dynamic reduces bias by up to 70% with minimal fluency loss. Logits
intervention outperforms hidden-layer approaches. We show semantic-aware logits

### [139] [The Structural Scalpel: Automated Contiguous Layer Pruning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23652)
*Yao Lu,Yuqi Li,Wenbin Xie,Shanqing Yu,Qi Xuan,Zhaowei Zhu,Shiping Wen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CLP introduces a differentiable concave gate and endpoint tuning to prune continuous layer segments in LLMs, preserving performance while reducing compute; achieves high retention (e.g., 95.34% at 20% pruning on LLaMA3-70B) across multiple models (LLaMA2/3, Qwen) and sizes (7B‚Äì70B); can be combined with quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs demand substantial computational resources; existing layer pruning relies on hand-crafted, per-layer metrics and ignores inter-layer dependencies, risking disrupted information flow and degraded performance. A differentiable, dependency-aware pruning framework is needed to reduce compute while preserving accuracy on edge devices.

Method: (CLIP) CLP proposes two innovations: (1) a differentiable concave gate that automatically identifies the best continuous layer segments to prune via gradient-based optimization; (2) a cutoff endpoint tuning strategy that fine-tunes only the layers adjacent to pruned segments to restore performance. The framework is evaluated across multiple architectures (LLaMA2, LLaMA3, Qwen) and sizes (7B‚Äì70B) and can be combined with quantization.

Result: CLP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in layer pruning. At 20% pruning, it achieves ~95.34% performance retention on LLaMA3-70B, outperforming baselines by 4.29%‚Äì30.52%. The method generalizes across architectures and sizes and can be combined with quantization for further compression with minimal additional loss.

Conclusion: A novel, effective continuous layer pruning framework that respects layer dependencies and maintains high performance while reducing compute. Its differentiable gate and endpoint tuning enable better pruning decisions and quick recovery, with demonstrated gains across diverse models and the option to couple with quantization.

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved revolutionary
breakthroughs in many fields, their large model size and high computational
cost pose significant challenges for practical deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. To this end, layer pruning has been proposed
to reduce the computational overhead by directly removing redundant layers.
However, existing layer pruning methods typically rely on hand-crafted metrics
to evaluate and remove individual layers, while ignoring the dependencies
between layers. This can disrupt the model's information flow and severely
degrade performance. To address these issues, we propose CLP, a novel
continuous layer pruning framework that introduces two key innovations: a
differentiable concave gate algorithm that automatically identifies the best
continuous layer segments for pruning via gradient-based optimization; and a
cutoff endpoint tuning strategy that effectively restores model performance by
fine-tuning only the layers adjacent to the pruned segments. Extensive
experiments across multiple model architectures (including LLaMA2, LLaMA3 and
Qwen) and sizes (from $7$B to $70$B parameters) show that CLP significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. For example, at a pruning rate
of $20\%$, CLP achieves an average performance retention of $95.34\%$ on
LLaMA3-70B, outperforming baselines by $4.29\%$-$30.52\%$. Furthermore, CLP can
be seamlessly combined with quantization to further compress the model with
only a slight performance loss.

### [140] [Error Adjustment Based on Spatiotemporal Correlation Fusion for Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23656)
*Fuqiang Liu,Weiping Ding,Luis Miranda-Moreno,Lijun Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Spatiotemporally Autocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a general framework that treats forecasting errors as a spatiotemporal VAR, uses sparse regularization aligned with road networks, and applies test-time error adjustments to improve traffic forecasting across models and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Common MSE-based training assumes uncorrelated errors across time steps and spatial locations, but traffic data exhibit strong temporal and spatial autocorrelations. This mismatch limits forecast accuracy and real-time performance; a framework to model and mitigate autocorrelated errors is needed.

Method: Model prediction errors as a spatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process with a coefficient matrix capturing spatiotemporal error dependencies. Introduce a new cost function incorporating this matrix, apply structurally sparse regularization to align the learned matrix with road network structure, and implement a test-time inference step to dynamically adjust predictions based on estimated autocorrelated errors.

Result: Empirical evaluation on multiple traffic datasets shows that SAEA improves forecasting accuracy across a wide range of models in most cases.

Conclusion: SAEA offers a general, effective approach to account for autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic forecasting, integrates with existing models, and enables real-time error refinement by explicitly modeling spatiotemporal error dependencies.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a significant role in an increasing body of
research on traffic forecasting due to their effectively capturing
spatiotemporal patterns embedded in traffic data. A general assumption of
training the said forecasting models via mean squared error estimation is that
the errors across time steps and spatial positions are uncorrelated. However,
this assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by
both the temporality and spatiality of traffic data. This gap limits the
performance of DNN-based forecasting models and is overlooked by current
studies. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes Spatiotemporally
Autocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a novel and general framework designed
to systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic
forecasting. Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a
random Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a
spatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic
dependencies. First, it explicitly captures both spatial and temporal error
correlations by a coefficient matrix, which is then embedded into a newly
formulated cost function. Second, a structurally sparse regularization is
introduced to incorporate prior spatial information, ensuring that the learned
coefficient matrix aligns with the inherent road network structure. Finally, an
inference process with test-time error adjustment is designed to dynamically
refine predictions, mitigating the impact of autocorrelated errors in real-time
forecasting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on
different traffic datasets. Results across a wide range of traffic forecasting
models show that our method enhances performance in almost all cases.

*Saklain Niam,Tashfiqur Rahman,Md. Amjad Patwary,Mukarram Hossain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A first ML framework using Extra Trees predicts germination uplift under dielectric barrier discharge plasma across multiple crops, revealing hormesis and power-time effects, and is deployed in MLflow as a precision-agriculture decision tool.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cold plasma is eco-friendly for enhancing seed germination, but outcomes are hard to predict due to complex interactions among seeds, plasma, and environment; predictive models are needed to optimize treatment for reliable gains.

Method: Compared multiple models (GB, XGB, ET, and hybrids) on germination data from soybean, barley, sunflower, radish, and tomato under DBD plasma; ET yielded the best fit (R^2 ~0.92, RMSE/MAE ~3); feature reduction improved R^2 to ~0.93. Analyzed dose-time hormesis (kV, exposure seconds) and discharge power (W); provided species- and cultivar-level predictions; embedded the model in MLflow for practical use in precision agriculture.

Result: ET achieved R^2 = 0.919, RMSE = 3.21, MAE = 2.62; after feature reduction R^2 = 0.925. Hormetic response with negligible effects <7 kV or <200 s; peak germination at 7‚Äì15 kV for 200‚Äì500 s; reduced germination beyond 20 kV or prolonged exposure. Germination rate maximizes at ‚â•100 W with low exposure. Radish MAE 1.46; Soybean MAE 2.05; Sunflower MAE 3.80; cultivars Williams MAE 1.23; Sari 1.33; Arian 2.86; Ny√≠rs√©gi fekete 3.74.

Conclusion: The study delivers a practical ML-based decision-support tool (via MLflow) to optimize CP seed germination in precision agriculture, enabling informed scheduling of voltage, time, and power for different crops and cultivars.

Abstract: Cold plasma (CP) is an eco-friendly method to enhance seed germination, yet
outcomes remain difficult to predict due to complex seed--plasma--environment
interactions. This study introduces the first machine learning framework to
forecast germination uplift in soybean, barley, sunflower, radish, and tomato
under dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma. Among the models tested (GB,
XGB, ET, and hybrids), Extra Trees (ET) performed best (R\textsuperscript{2} =
0.919; RMSE = 3.21; MAE = 2.62), improving to R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.925
after feature reduction. Engineering analysis revealed a hormetic response:
negligible effects at $<$7 kV or $<$200 s, maximum germination at 7--15 kV for
200--500 s, and reduced germination beyond 20 kV or prolonged exposures.
Discharge power was also a dominant factor, with germination rate maximizing at
$\geq$100 W with low exposure time. Species and cultivar-level predictions
showed radish (MAE = 1.46) and soybean (MAE = 2.05) were modeled with high
consistency, while sunflower remained slightly higher variable (MAE = 3.80).
Among cultivars, Williams (MAE = 1.23) and Sari (1.33) were well predicted,
while Arian (2.86) and Ny\'{\i}rs\'{e}gi fekete (3.74) were comparatively
poorly captured. This framework was also embedded into MLflow, providing a
decision-support tool for optimizing CP seed germination in precision
agriculture.

*Vaibhav Jindal,Hejian Sang,Chun-Mao Lai,Yanning Chen,Zhipeng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ELBO-KTO combines an ELBO surrogate for diffusion log-likelihoods with an unpaired Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) objective to align diffusion LLMs using unpaired preferences; it yields strong win-rate gains and competitive reasoning/knowledge task performance, suggesting unpaired preferences as a viable alternative to pairwise alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Align diffusion language models to human preferences while avoiding intractable diffusion log-likelihoods and costly pairwise preference data; provide a practical, scalable objective by coupling an ELBO surrogate with unpaired preferences.

Method: Derive and analyze an ELBO surrogate for diffusion log-likelihoods; adopt Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) as an unpaired preference objective; apply variance-reduction techniques to stabilize gradients; train LLaDA-8B-Instruct with UltraFeedback-Binary data; evaluate on kto-mix-14k, UltraFeedback-Binary and downstream benchmarks (GSM8K, MMLU, etc.).

Result: ELBO-KTO achieves 65.9% and 62.3% adjusted win rates on kto-mix-14k and UltraFeedback-Binary, respectively, versus the base model under an automatic LLM judge; on downstream tasks (GSM8K, MMLU, etc.), ELBO-KTO trained on UltraFeedback-Binary matches or exceeds base-model performance under identical decoding; demonstrates unpaired preference optimization as a viable alternative to pairwise alignment for diffusion LLMs.

Conclusion: Unpaired preference optimization with ELBO-KTO is a viable alternative to pairwise alignment for diffusion LLMs, yielding practical gains and stabilized training through bias/variance-aware ELBO substitution and variance-reduction techniques.

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) are an emerging alternative to
autoregressive (AR) generators, but aligning them to human preferences is
challenging because sequence log-likelihoods are intractable and pairwise
preference data are costly to collect. We introduce ELBO-KTO, which combines an
ELBO surrogate for diffusion log-likelihoods with a prospect-theoretic,
unpaired preference objective (Kahneman Tversky Optimization, KTO). We analyze
the bias and variance induced by the ELBO substitution and employ
variance-reduction practices that stabilize gradients during training. Applied
to LLaDA-8B-Instruct, ELBO-KTO yields \textbf{65.9\%} and \textbf{62.3\%}
adjusted win rates on kto-mix-14k and UltraFeedback-Binary, respectively,
versus the base model under an automatic LLM judge. Across downstream tasks,
including GSM8K, MMLU, and additional reasoning/knowledge benchmarks, ELBO-KTO
trained on UltraFeedback-Binary performs on par with or better than the base
model under identical decoding. This establishes unpaired preference
optimization as a viable alternative to pairwise alignment in diffusion LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high-dimensional image data and aim to improve classification by integrating quantum computing with classical deep learning, demonstrated on potato disease detection.

Method: Use ResNet-50 to extract deep features from RGB potato disease images; apply PCA for dimensionality reduction; feed into QSVM with quantum feature maps (ZZ, Z, Pauli-X); compare against SVM and RF using five-fold stratified CV.

Result: QSVM with Z-feature map achieved 99.23% accuracy, outperforming classical models (SVM, RF).

Conclusion: Hybrid quantum-classical modeling can enhance image classification tasks; quantum feature maps show promise for improving performance and potential in disease detection applications.

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing attention on combining quantum machine
learning (QML) with classical deep learning approaches, as computational
techniques are key to improving the performance of image classification tasks.
This study presents a hybrid approach that uses ResNet-50 (Residual Network)
for feature extraction and Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) for
classification in the context of potato disease detection. Classical machine
learning as well as deep learning models often struggle with high-dimensional
and complex datasets, necessitating advanced techniques like quantum computing
to improve classification efficiency. In our research, we use ResNet-50 to
extract deep feature representations from RGB images of potato diseases. These
features are then subjected to dimensionality reduction using Principal
Component Analysis (PCA). The resulting features are processed through QSVM
models which apply various quantum feature maps such as ZZ, Z, and Pauli-X to
transform classical data into quantum states. To assess the model performance,
we compared it with classical machine learning algorithms such as Support
Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) using five-fold stratified
cross-validation for comprehensive evaluation. The experimental results
demonstrate that the Z-feature map-based QSVM outperforms classical models,
achieving an accuracy of 99.23 percent, surpassing both SVM and RF models. This
research highlights the advantages of integrating quantum computing into image
classification and provides a potential disease detection solution through
hybrid quantum-classical modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid quantum-classical model (QNN) for pneumonia detection using PneumoniaMNIST; uses a quanvolutional layer with a parameterized quantum circuit on 2x2 patches; reports higher validation accuracy (83.33%) than a comparable classical CNN (73.33%), suggesting potential for improved feature extraction and data efficiency in medical imaging with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNNs in medical imaging face high computational costs, limited feature representation, and poor generalization on small datasets. Quantum feature extraction via parameterized quantum circuits (PQC) may yield richer representations and better sample efficiency, motivating a hybrid quantum-classical approach for pneumonia detection.

Method: Apply a quanvolutional layer that processes 2x2 image patches encoded by rotational Y-gates into a PQC with entangling layers to generate non-classical features; extract these features and feed into a classical neural network for classification; evaluate on PneumoniaMNIST and compare against a classical CNN.

Result: Validation accuracy reported as 83.33% for the QNN vs 73.33% for a comparable classical CNN; claims improved convergence and sample efficiency.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of integrating quantum computing into deep-learning-based medical diagnostics; suggests quantum feature extraction can enhance performance, especially with limited labeled data; serves as a foundation for future work on more complex datasets and hardware integration.

Abstract: Pneumonia poses a significant global health challenge, demanding accurate and
timely diagnosis. While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), has shown promise in medical image analysis for pneumonia
detection, CNNs often suffer from high computational costs, limitations in
feature representation, and challenges in generalizing from smaller datasets.
To address these limitations, we explore the application of Quanvolutional
Neural Networks (QNNs), leveraging quantum computing for enhanced feature
extraction. This paper introduces a novel hybrid quantum-classical model for
pneumonia detection using the PneumoniaMNIST dataset. Our approach utilizes a
quanvolutional layer with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) to process 2x2
image patches, employing rotational Y-gates for data encoding and entangling
layers to generate non-classical feature representations. These
quantum-extracted features are then fed into a classical neural network for
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed QNN achieves
a higher validation accuracy of 83.33 percent compared to a comparable
classical CNN which achieves 73.33 percent. This enhanced convergence and
sample efficiency highlight the potential of QNNs for medical image analysis,
particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. This research lays the
foundation for integrating quantum computing into deep-learning-driven medical
diagnostic systems, offering a computationally efficient alternative to
traditional approaches.

TL;DR: ST-ViWT uses a spatiotemporal vision transformer with wavelets to reconstruct continuous, uncertainty-quantified XCO2 fields from OCO-2 over southern Canada, achieving high accuracy and robust independent validation, enabling policy-relevant emissions assessment in poultry-dense regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, gap-filled, uncertainty-quantified XCO2 maps are needed in agricultural landscapes with sparse satellite coverage to guide emissions mitigation and verify inventories; existing methods struggle with temporal gaps and regional heterogeneity.

Method: A Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer with Wavelets (ST-ViWT) fuses wavelet time-frequency representations with transformer attention across features such as meteorology, vegetation indices, topography, and land cover. The model produces 0.25¬∞ XCO2 surfaces with explicit uncertainties and performs gap-filling on 2024 OCO-2 data, with validation against TCCON and regional poultry sites.

Result: On 2024 OCO-2 data: R2 = 0.984, RMSE = 0.468 ppm; 92.3% of gap-filled predictions within ¬±1 ppm. Independent TCCON validation: bias = -0.14 ppm; r = 0.928; reproduces late-summer drawdown. Spatial analysis across 14 poultry regions shows r = 0.43 between facility density and XCO2; higher density regions have larger seasonal amplitudes (9.57 ppm) and enhanced summer variability. Outperforms conventional interpolation and standard ML baselines, yielding seamless 0.25¬∞ CO2 surfaces with explicit uncertainties.

Conclusion: Transformer-based Earth observation enables scalable, transparent, spatially explicit carbon accounting, hotspot prioritization, and policy-relevant mitigation assessment. The approach supports integrating satellite constraints with inventories and precision livestock platforms to benchmark emissions and verify interventions.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of column-averaged CO2 (XCO2) over agricultural landscapes

Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer with Wavelets (ST-ViWT) framework that
reconstructs continuous, uncertainty-quantified XCO2 fields from OCO-2 across
southern Canada, emphasizing poultry-intensive regions. The model fuses wavelet
time-frequency representations with transformer attention over meteorology,

attains R2 = 0.984 and RMSE = 0.468 ppm; 92.3 percent of gap-filled predictions
lie within +/-1 ppm. Independent validation with TCCON shows robust
generalization (bias = -0.14 ppm; r = 0.928), including faithful reproduction
of the late-summer drawdown. Spatial analysis across 14 poultry regions reveals
a moderate positive association between facility density and XCO2 (r = 0.43);
high-density areas exhibit larger seasonal amplitudes (9.57 ppm) and enhanced
summer variability. Compared with conventional interpolation and standard
machine-learning baselines, ST-ViWT yields seamless 0.25 degree CO2 surfaces
with explicit uncertainties, enabling year-round coverage despite sparse

national inventories and precision livestock platforms to benchmark emissions,
refine region-specific factors, and verify interventions. Importantly,

TL;DR: TEMPEST enables Transformers to learn semantic representations directly from compressed byte streams by a novel tokenization that leverages the intrinsic structure of compressed files, reducing tokens and enabling competitive accuracy with lower memory and compute costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compressed file formats are efficient for storage and transmission, but their potential for representation learning is underexplored. If models can operate on compressed streams without full decoding, we can gain efficiency and broaden applicability across modalities.

Method: Introduce a tokenization/encoding scheme that exploits the byte-stream structure of compressed data, allowing a standard transformer to process compressed streams directly. This bypasses raw byte-level processing and full media decoding, reducing token count and computational/memory requirements. Extensive experiments across datasets, coding schemes, and modalities validate the approach.

Result: TEMPEST achieves competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art methods while delivering substantial efficiency gains in memory usage and compute due to a lower token budget and streamlined processing.

Conclusion: Learning semantic representations directly from compressed streams is viable. TEMPEST offers a practical path to efficient representation learning on compressed data, with potential applicability across multiple modalities and compression schemes.

Abstract: Compressed file formats are the corner stone of efficient data storage and
transmission, yet their potential for representation learning remains largely
underexplored. We introduce TEMPEST (TransformErs froM comPressed
rEpreSenTations), a method that exploits the inherent byte-stream structure of
compressed files to design an effective tokenization and encoding strategy. By
leveraging this compact encoding, a standard transformer can directly learn
semantic representations from compressed data streams, bypassing the need for
raw byte-level processing or full media decoding. Our proposal substantially
reduces the number of tokens required for semantic classification, thereby
lowering both computational complexity and memory usage. Through extensive
experiments across diverse datasets, coding schemes, and modalities, we show
that TEMPEST achieves accuracy competitive wit the state-of-the-art while
delivering efficiency gains in memory and compute.

TL;DR: OAT is a foundation-model for topology optimization that directly predicts minimum-compliance layouts across arbitrary aspect ratios, resolutions, loads, and fixtures, using a resolution- and shape-agnostic autoencoder, an implicit neural-field decoder, and a conditional latent-diffusion model trained on a 2.2M-strong OpenTO dataset; it achieves up to 90% reduction in mean compliance, sub-1s GPU inference, and works from 64√ó64 to 256√ó256 with aspect ratios up to 10:1.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TO is computationally intensive and traditionally restricted to fixed grids and limited boundary conditions. A general, fast, and flexible framework is needed to enable deployment across diverse designs without hand-tuning or post-hoc optimization.

Method: The approach combines (1) a resolution- and shape-agnostic autoencoder to encode designs of varying size and aspect ratio, (2) an implicit neural-field decoder to map latent codes to topology fields, and (3) a conditional latent-diffusion model trained on OpenTO, a large corpus (2.2M optimized structures across 2M boundary-condition configurations), enabling generation conditioned on BCs. Outputs are prediction of minimum-compliance layouts across arbitrary specs and fast inference. Dataset and code released.

Result: On four public benchmarks and two unseen tests, OAT lowers mean compliance up to 90% relative to the best prior models and achieves sub-1 second inference on a single GPU across resolutions 64√ó64 to 256√ó256 and aspect ratios up to 10:1.

Conclusion: OAT establishes a general, fast, and resolution-free framework for physics-aware topology optimization, and provides a large-scale dataset to spur further research in generative modeling for inverse design; code and data are publicly available.

Abstract: Structural topology optimization (TO) is central to engineering design but
remains computationally intensive due to complex physics and hard constraints.
Existing deep-learning methods are limited to fixed square grids, a few
hand-coded boundary conditions, and post-hoc optimization, preventing general
deployment. We introduce Optimize Any Topology (OAT), a foundation-model
framework that directly predicts minimum-compliance layouts for arbitrary

a resolution- and shape-agnostic autoencoder with an implicit neural-field
decoder and a conditional latent-diffusion model trained on OpenTO, a new
corpus of 2.2 million optimized structures covering 2 million unique
boundary-condition configurations. On four public benchmarks and two
challenging unseen tests, OAT lowers mean compliance up to 90% relative to the
best prior models and delivers sub-1 second inference on a single GPU across
resolutions from 64 x 64 to 256 x 256 and aspect ratios as high as 10:1. These
results establish OAT as a general, fast, and resolution-free framework for

TL;DR: A STL-driven hybrid traffic Forecast framework uses LSTM for trend, ARIMA for seasonality, and XGBoost for residuals, aggregated multiplicatively to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate traffic forecasting is essential for ITS; single-model approaches struggle with nonlinear, multiscale temporal patterns in traffic data, necessitating decomposition and model specialization.

Method: Decompose the time series with STL into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Train LSTM on the trend, ARIMA on the seasonal component, and XGBoost on the residuals. Combine predictions multiplicatively to obtain the final forecast. Dataset: 998 traffic-flow records from a NYC intersection (Nov‚ÄìDec 2015).

Result: The hybrid LSTM-ARIMA-XGBoost model significantly outperforms individual models (LSTM, ARIMA, XGBoost) across MAE, RMSE, and R^2 metrics.

Conclusion: Decomposition isolates temporal characteristics, allowing model specialization, which enhances accuracy, interpretability, and robustness; the approach is promising for multiscale time-series forecasting in traffic and potentially other domains.

Abstract: Accurate traffic flow forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation
systems and urban traffic management. However, single model approaches often
fail to capture the complex, nonlinear, and multi scale temporal patterns in
traffic flow data. This study proposes a decomposition driven hybrid framework
that integrates Seasonal Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) with three
complementary predictive models. STL first decomposes the original time series
into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Then, a Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) network models long term trends, an Autoregressive Integrated Moving
Average (ARIMA) model captures seasonal periodicity, and an Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm predicts nonlinear residual fluctuations. The
final forecast is obtained through multiplicative integration of the sub model
predictions. Using 998 traffic flow records from a New York City intersection
between November and December 2015, results show that the LSTM ARIMA XGBoost
hybrid model significantly outperforms standalone models including LSTM, ARIMA,
and XGBoost across MAE, RMSE, and R squared metrics. The decomposition strategy
effectively isolates temporal characteristics, allowing each model to
specialize, thereby improving prediction accuracy, interpretability, and
robustness.

### [149] [Sparsity and Superposition in Mixture of Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23671)
*Marmik Chaudhari,Jeremi Nuer,Rome Thorstenson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoE models differ mechanistically from dense networks; network sparsity‚Äîactive-to-total-expert ratio‚Äîdrives their behavior and interpretability more than feature sparsity or importance; higher sparsity yields greater monosemanticity and coherent feature specialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how MoE models operate mechanistically and whether sparsity can improve interpretability without sacrificing performance, addressing gaps in how MoEs differ from dense networks.

Method: Develop new metrics to measure superposition across experts; analyze how feature sparsity, feature importance, and network sparsity relate to phase changes; empirically study MoEs and initialization effects to observe expert organization around feature coalitions.

Result: Network sparsity better characterizes MoEs than feature sparsity/importance; models with greater sparsity show higher monosemanticity; introduce monosemantic-feature-based expert specialization and observe natural grouping of experts around coherent feature combinations when initialized appropriately.

Conclusion: Increasing network sparsity in MoEs may yield more interpretable models without sacrificing performance, challenging the common belief that interpretability and capability are inherently at odds.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have become central to scaling large language
models, yet their mechanistic differences from dense networks remain poorly
understood. Previous work has explored how dense models use
\textit{superposition} to represent more features than dimensions, and how
superposition is a function of feature sparsity and feature importance. MoE
models cannot be explained mechanistically through the same lens. We find that
neither feature sparsity nor feature importance cause discontinuous phase
changes, and that network sparsity (the ratio of active to total experts)
better characterizes MoEs. We develop new metrics for measuring superposition
across experts. Our findings demonstrate that models with greater network
sparsity exhibit greater \emph{monosemanticity}. We propose a new definition of
expert specialization based on monosemantic feature representation rather than
load balancing, showing that experts naturally organize around coherent feature
combinations when initialized appropriately. These results suggest that network
sparsity in MoEs may enable more interpretable models without sacrificing
performance, challenging the common assumption that interpretability and
capability are fundamentally at odds.

### [150] [DBLoss: Decomposition-based Loss Function for Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23672)
*Xiangfei Qiu,Xingjian Wu,Hanyin Cheng,Xvyuan Liu,Chenjuan Guo,Jilin Hu,Bin Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces DBLoss, a decomposition-based loss for time-series forecasting that uses exponential moving averages to split the horizon into seasonal and trend parts and computes a weighted sum of component losses, applicable to any forecasting model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MSE often fails to capture horizon-specific seasonality or trend, even with forward-decomposition modules; a loss that explicitly targets these components can improve training alignment with forecasting objectives.

Method: Within the forecasting horizon, apply EMA to obtain seasonal-like and trend-like components; compute losses for each component separately (e.g., component-wise MSE) and combine them with weights; DBLoss is model-agnostic and can be plugged into existing forecasting frameworks.

Result: Empirical evaluation across diverse real-world datasets shows that DBLoss yields significant improvements over state-of-the-art models.

Conclusion: DBLoss offers a simple, effective, and general approach to time-series loss design, providing a new perspective on decomposing and optimizing forecasting objectives.

Abstract: Time series forecasting holds significant value in various domains such as
economics, traffic, energy, and AIOps, as accurate predictions facilitate
informed decision-making. However, the existing Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
function sometimes fails to accurately capture the seasonality or trend within
the forecasting horizon, even when decomposition modules are used in the
forward propagation to model the trend and seasonality separately. To address
these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective Decomposition-Based Loss
function called DBLoss. This method uses exponential moving averages to
decompose the time series into seasonal and trend components within the
forecasting horizon, and then calculates the loss for each of these components
separately, followed by weighting them. As a general loss function, DBLoss can
be combined with any deep learning forecasting model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DBLoss significantly improves the performance of
state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world datasets and provides a new
perspective on the design of time series loss functions.

### [151] [Informed Initialization for Bayesian Optimization and Active Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23681)
*Carl Hvarfner,David Eriksson,Eytan Bakshy,Max Balandat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HIPE is an information-theoretic acquisition for GP-based Bayesian Optimization that jointly prioritizes predictive uncertainty reduction and hyperparameter learning during initialization, with a closed-form expression and strong empirical gains in few-shot, large-batch settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In few-shot BO, initialization critically shapes the surrogate model's predictive quality and subsequent optimization, but standard (quasi-)random or space-filling designs may waste effort on uncertain regions or hinder hyperparameter learning.

Method: Introduce Hyperparameter-Informed Predictive Exploration (HIPE), derive a closed-form GP acquisition balancing uncertainty reduction and hyperparameter learning via information theory, and evaluate in active learning and few-shot BO.

Result: HIPE outperforms standard initialization strategies in predictive accuracy, hyperparameter identification, and optimization performance, especially for large-batch, few-shot scenarios.

Conclusion: A principled initialization strategy that accounts for hyperparameter learning improves GP-based BO performance in scarce-data regimes and can enhance real-world BO applications.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization is a widely used method for optimizing expensive
black-box functions, relying on probabilistic surrogate models such as Gaussian
Processes. The quality of the surrogate model is crucial for good optimization
performance, especially in the few-shot setting where only a small number of
batches of points can be evaluated. In this setting, the initialization plays a
critical role in shaping the surrogate's predictive quality and guiding
subsequent optimization. Despite this, practitioners typically rely on
(quasi-)random designs to cover the input space. However, such approaches
neglect two key factors: (a) space-filling designs may not be desirable to
reduce predictive uncertainty, and (b) efficient hyperparameter learning during
initialization is essential for high-quality prediction, which may conflict
with space-filling designs. To address these limitations, we propose
Hyperparameter-Informed Predictive Exploration (HIPE), a novel acquisition
strategy that balances predictive uncertainty reduction with hyperparameter
learning using information-theoretic principles. We derive a closed-form
expression for HIPE in the Gaussian Process setting and demonstrate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments in active learning and few-shot BO.
Our results show that HIPE outperforms standard initialization strategies in
terms of predictive accuracy, hyperparameter identification, and subsequent
optimization performance, particularly in large-batch, few-shot settings
relevant to many real-world Bayesian Optimization applications.

### [152] [Beyond Prompt Engineering: Neuro-Symbolic-Causal Architecture for Robust Multi-Objective AI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23682)
*Gokturk Aytug Akarlar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chimera, a neuro-symbolic-causal architecture combining an LLM strategist, a formally verified symbolic constraint engine, and a causal inference module, yields robust autonomous decision-making in high-stakes e-commerce, outperforming LLM-only and LLM-with-constraints baselines and proven free of constraint violations via formal verification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM agents in high-stakes domains suffer catastrophic brittleness and prompt-framing sensitivity; architectural safeguards are needed to ensure reliability and trust, not just better prompts.

Method: Propose Chimera by integrating three components: (1) an LLM strategizer, (2) a formally verified symbolic constraint engine, and (3) a causal inference module for counterfactual reasoning. Benchmark against baselines (LLM-only, LLM with symbolic constraints) over 52 weeks in a realistic e-commerce environment with price elasticity, trust dynamics, and seasonal demand. Test under volume vs. margin optimization biases. Validate with TLA+ formal verification for constraint violations and provide open-source implementations and interactive demos.

Result: LLM-only agents fail catastrophically under some bias (e.g., total loss of $99K in volume scenarios) or erode brand trust (‚àí48.6% in margin scenarios). Adding symbolic constraints prevents disasters but yields only 43‚Äì87% of Chimera‚Äôs profits. Chimera delivers the highest returns (approximately $1.52M for volume and $1.96M for margin scenarios, with some cases +$2.2M) and improves brand trust (+1.8%, +10.8%, up to +20.86%). Chimera demonstrates prompt-agnostic robustness across prompts. TLA+ formal verification reports zero constraint violations across all scenarios. Open-source implementations and demonstrations are provided for reproducibility.

Conclusion: Architectural design choices, not prompt engineering, govern the reliability of autonomous agents in production-like settings. A neuro-symbolic-causal architecture can achieve higher profitability and trust while remaining robust to prompt variations; formal verification confirms safety constraints, and openness enables reproducibility.

Abstract: Large language models show promise as autonomous decision-making agents, yet
their deployment in high-stakes domains remains fraught with risk. Without
architectural safeguards, LLM agents exhibit catastrophic brittleness:
identical capabilities produce wildly different outcomes depending solely on
prompt framing. We present Chimera, a neuro-symbolic-causal architecture that
integrates three complementary components - an LLM strategist, a formally
verified symbolic constraint engine, and a causal inference module for
counterfactual reasoning. We benchmark Chimera against baseline architectures
(LLM-only, LLM with symbolic constraints) across 52-week simulations in a
realistic e-commerce environment featuring price elasticity, trust dynamics,
and seasonal demand. Under organizational biases toward either volume or margin
optimization, LLM-only agents fail catastrophically (total loss of \$99K in
volume scenarios) or destroy brand trust (-48.6% in margin scenarios). Adding
symbolic constraints prevents disasters but achieves only 43-87% of Chimera's
profit. Chimera consistently delivers the highest returns (\$1.52M and \$1.96M
respectively, some cases +\$2.2M) while improving brand trust (+1.8% and
+10.8%, some cases +20.86%), demonstrating prompt-agnostic robustness. Our TLA+
formal verification proves zero constraint violations across all scenarios.
These results establish that architectural design not prompt engineering
determines the reliability of autonomous agents in production environments. We
provide open-source implementations and interactive demonstrations for
reproducibility.

*Junwen Ma,Mingyu Ge,Yisen Wang,Yong Zhang,Weicheng Fu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A parallel Transformer-BiLSTM framework with a feature-fusion layer improves chaotic time-series prediction, outperforming single-branch models on Lorenz-system tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional approaches struggle to simultaneously capture local temporal features and global dependencies in chaotic time series, due to extreme sensitivity to initial conditions and complex dynamics.

Method: A dual-branch architecture: one Transformer branch captures long-range dependencies; a BiLSTM branch captures local temporal features. Features from both branches are fused in a dedicated feature-fusion layer. Evaluated on Lorenz system tasks: autonomous evolution prediction (trajectory extrapolation from time-delay embeddings) and inference of unmeasured variables (state reconstruction from partial observations).

Result: The hybrid Transformer-BiLSTM framework consistently outperforms single-branch architectures on both tasks, demonstrating robustness and effectiveness in chaotic system prediction.

Conclusion: Integrating complementary representations from Transformer and BiLSTM via a fusion layer yields improved predictive accuracy for chaotic systems and effective state completion, validating the benefit of combining long-range and local features.

Abstract: The nonlinear nature of chaotic systems results in extreme sensitivity to
initial conditions and highly intricate dynamical behaviors, posing fundamental
challenges for accurately predicting their evolution. To overcome the
limitation that conventional approaches fail to capture both local features and
global dependencies in chaotic time series simultaneously, this study proposes
a parallel predictive framework integrating Transformer and Bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. The hybrid model employs a dual-branch
architecture, where the Transformer branch mainly captures long-range
dependencies while the BiLSTM branch focuses on extracting local temporal
features. The complementary representations from the two branches are fused in
a dedicated feature-fusion layer to enhance predictive accuracy. As
illustrating examples, the model's performance is systematically evaluated on
two representative tasks in the Lorenz system. The first is autonomous
evolution prediction, in which the model recursively extrapolates system
trajectories from the time-delay embeddings of the state vector to evaluate
long-term tracking accuracy and stability. The second is inference of
unmeasured variable, where the model reconstructs the unobserved states from
the time-delay embeddings of partial observations to assess its
state-completion capability. The results consistently indicate that the
proposed hybrid framework outperforms both single-branch architectures across
tasks, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in chaotic system
prediction.

*Vedant Gupta,Haotian Fu,Calvin Luo,Yiding Jiang,George Konidaris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DEPS is an end-to-end method for discovering parameterized skills from expert demonstrations, learning skill policies and a meta-policy to select discrete skills and continuous parameters, using temporal variational inference and information-theoretic regularization to avoid latent degeneracy. It achieves strong generalization on LIBERO and MetaWorld and yields interpretable parameterized skills like grasp location parameterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to automatically discover reusable, parameterized skills from demonstrations with strong generalization to unseen tasks, while ensuring latent skills are temporally extended, semantically meaningful, and interpretable. This work also addresses degeneracy in latent-variable models.

Method: An end-to-end algorithm (DEPS) that jointly learns parameterized skill policies and a meta-policy that selects the discrete skill and continuous parameters at each timestep. It uses temporal variational inference and information-theoretic regularization to mitigate latent degeneracy and produce temporally extended, meaningful, and adaptable skills, trained on multitask expert demonstrations.

Result: DEPS outperforms multitask and skill learning baselines on LIBERO and MetaWorld benchmarks and discovers interpretable parameterized skills, such as an object grasping skill with continuous arguments defining the grasp location.

Conclusion: DEPS provides a scalable, interpretable framework for discovering parameterized skills with strong generalization to unseen tasks and interpretable continuous arguments, validated on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: We present DEPS, an end-to-end algorithm for discovering parameterized skills
from expert demonstrations. Our method learns parameterized skill policies
jointly with a meta-policy that selects the appropriate discrete skill and
continuous parameters at each timestep. Using a combination of temporal
variational inference and information-theoretic regularization methods, we
address the challenge of degeneracy common in latent variable models, ensuring
that the learned skills are temporally extended, semantically meaningful, and
adaptable. We empirically show that learning parameterized skills from
multitask expert demonstrations significantly improves generalization to unseen
tasks. Our method outperforms multitask as well as skill learning baselines on
both LIBERO and MetaWorld benchmarks. We also demonstrate that DEPS discovers
interpretable parameterized skills, such as an object grasping skill whose
continuous arguments define the grasp location.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The abstract identifies the risk that data-driven ML systems can produce discriminatory outcomes due to insufficient explicit fairness considerations, and underscores the need for measurement, decomposition, and interventions to align ML with social values.

Method: Proposes (1) measurement frameworks for fairness in ML, (2) systematic decomposition of ML systems to understand bias dynamics, and (3) interventions to reduce discrimination without sacrificing utility.

Abstract: This PhD thesis investigates the societal impact of machine learning (ML). ML
increasingly informs consequential decisions and recommendations, significantly
affecting many aspects of our lives. As these data-driven systems are often
developed without explicit fairness considerations, they carry the risk of
discriminatory effects. The contributions in this thesis enable more
appropriate measurement of fairness in ML systems, systematic decomposition of
ML systems to anticipate bias dynamics, and effective interventions that reduce
algorithmic discrimination while maintaining system utility. I conclude by
discussing ongoing challenges and future research directions as ML systems,
including generative artificial intelligence, become increasingly integrated
into society. This work offers a foundation for ensuring that ML's societal
impact aligns with broader social values.

*Anisha Saha,Varsha Suresh,Timothy Hospedales,Vera Demberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces MUStReason, a diagnostic benchmark for sarcasm in Video-language models, with modality-specific cue annotations and reasoning steps; also proposes PragCoT to steer models toward inferred intent and analyzes perception vs reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sarcasm detection relies on cross-modal cues and pragmatic inference; existing multimodal models struggle; need diagnostics to disentangle perception and reasoning; improve VideoLMs' ability to infer speaker intent.

Method: Construct MUStReason with annotations of cues across modalities (tone, facial expressions, context) and underlying reasoning steps; perform classification benchmarking; quantitatively and qualitatively analyze model-generated reasoning by separating perceptual understanding from higher-level inference; introduce PragCoT prompting to emphasize implied intent.

Result: MUStReason enables targeted evaluation of cue utilization and reasoning in VideoLMs; developers can dissect whether models focus on correct cues; PragCoT provides a mechanism to steer models toward implied intent; the study demonstrates the value of diagnostic benchmarks for sarcasm and reveals gaps in current models.

Conclusion: The work provides a diagnostic benchmark and a prompting framework to improve sarcasm detection in VideoLMs, highlighting the importance of separating perception and reasoning, and guiding future research on cross-modal sarcasm and pragmatic inference.

Abstract: Sarcasm is a specific type of irony which involves discerning what is said
from what is meant. Detecting sarcasm depends not only on the literal content
of an utterance but also on non-verbal cues such as speaker's tonality, facial
expressions and conversational context. However, current multimodal models
struggle with complex tasks like sarcasm detection, which require identifying
relevant cues across modalities and pragmatically reasoning over them to infer
the speaker's intention. To explore these limitations in VideoLMs, we introduce
MUStReason, a diagnostic benchmark enriched with annotations of
modality-specific relevant cues and underlying reasoning steps to identify
sarcastic intent. In addition to benchmarking sarcasm classification
performance in VideoLMs, using MUStReason we quantitatively and qualitatively
evaluate the generated reasoning by disentangling the problem into perception
and reasoning, we propose PragCoT, a framework that steers VideoLMs to focus on
implied intentions over literal meaning, a property core to detecting sarcasm.

*Ignavier Ng,Patrick Bl√∂baum,Siddharth Bhandari,Kun Zhang,Shiva Kasiviswanathan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A principled variational framework to remove spurious correlations in reward models for RLHF by identifying non-spurious latent variables from data and using them to train more robust reward models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF reward models often exploit spurious correlations (e.g., response length, discrimination, sycophancy, bias), which can misalign models with true human preferences. The paper aims to disentangle spurious from genuine signals and show non-spurious factors are identifiable from data even without surrogates for spurious factors.

Method: Formulate a data-generating process with both spurious and non-spurious latent variables; prove identifiability of non-spurious latents from data; propose variational inference to recover these latents and use them to train reward models that focus on genuine preferences.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show reduced reliance on spurious cues and improved robustness of reward models.

Conclusion: The framework offers a principled approach to debias reward modeling in alignment tasks, with identifiability guarantees for non-spurious factors and a practical VI-based training method that preserves intended preferences.

Abstract: Recent alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback, have been widely adopted to align large language models with human
preferences by learning and leveraging reward models. In practice, these models
often exploit spurious correlations, involving, e.g., response length,
discrimination, sycophancy, and conceptual bias, which is a problem that has
received increasing attention. In this work, we propose a principled framework
that mitigates these biases in reward models while preserving the underlying
factors that reflect intended preferences. We first provide a formulation of
the data-generating process, assuming that the observed data (e.g., text) is
generated from both spurious and non-spurious latent variables. We show that,
interestingly, these non-spurious latent variables can be theoretically
identified from data, regardless of whether a surrogate for the spurious latent
variables is available. This further inspires a practical method that uses
variational inference to recover these variables and leverages them to train
reward models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our method effectively mitigates spurious correlation issues and yields
more robust reward models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hierarchical, concept-based continual learning model, Cobweb/4V, demonstrates robustness to catastrophic forgetting by integrating adaptive structure, sparse updates, and information-theoretic learning via sufficiency statistics, outperforming neural baselines across multiple datasets while preserving prior knowledge without revisiting past data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting remains a key challenge in continual learning. Building on Cobweb/4V's observed robustness in visual domains, the work investigates whether adaptive restructuring, sparse updates, and information-theoretic learning contribute to stability and knowledge retention, aiming to explain and harness these effects.

Method: Compare Cobweb/4V with neural baselines (including CobwebNN, a neural implementation of Cobweb) across datasets of increasing complexity (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, MedMNIST, CIFAR-10). Test three hypotheses: (1) adaptive structural reorganization enhances retention/plasticity, (2) sparse/ selective updates reduce interference, (3) information-theoretic learning based on sufficiency statistics offers advantages over backpropagation. Evaluate plasticity, interference, and prior knowledge preservation without revisiting past data.

Result: Adaptive restructuring enhances learning plasticity; sparse updates mitigate interference; information-theoretic learning preserves prior knowledge without revisiting past data. Across datasets, Cobweb/4V and CobwebNN outperform purely gradient-based baselines, illustrating the benefits of concept-based, information-theoretic approaches for continual learning.

Conclusion: The study provides mechanistic insight into reducing catastrophic forgetting by combining structure adaptation, sparse updates, and sufficiency-statistics‚Äìdriven learning. It highlights the potential of concept-based, information-theoretic methods for building stable, adaptive continual learning systems.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning,
where models are required to integrate new knowledge over time without losing
what they have previously learned. In prior work, we introduced Cobweb/4V, a
hierarchical concept formation model that exhibited robustness to catastrophic
forgetting in visual domains. Motivated by this robustness, we examine three
hypotheses regarding the factors that contribute to such stability: (1)
adaptive structural reorganization enhances knowledge retention, (2) sparse and
selective updates reduce interference, and (3) information-theoretic learning
based on sufficiency statistics provides advantages over gradient-based
backpropagation. To test these hypotheses, we compare Cobweb/4V with neural
baselines, including CobwebNN, a neural implementation of the Cobweb framework
introduced in this work. Experiments on datasets of varying complexity (MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, MedMNIST, and CIFAR-10) show that adaptive restructuring
enhances learning plasticity, sparse updates help mitigate interference, and
the information-theoretic learning process preserves prior knowledge without
revisiting past data. Together, these findings provide insight into mechanisms
that can mitigate catastrophic forgetting and highlight the potential of
concept-based, information-theoretic approaches for building stable and
adaptive continual learning systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RSS is an MCMC method that explores protein sequence space in continuous logit space, combining AlphaFold2 structural objectives with ESM2 priors to improve designability and diversity over RSO at equal cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RSO and similar single-path gradient methods ignore sequence-space constraints, limiting diversity and designability of protein designs; integrating evolutionary priors and efficient exploration is needed.

Method: RSS uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo framework operating in continuous logit space, with gradient-guided exploration and language-model-informed jumps. The energy combines AF2-derived structural objectives with ESM2-derived sequence priors to balance structure accuracy and biological plausibility.

Result: In silico protein binder design shows RSS yields about 5√ó more designable structures and 2‚Äì3√ó greater structural diversity than RSO baselines at the same computational cost.

Conclusion: RSS is a principled framework for efficiently exploring protein design landscapes by jointly leveraging structure predictions and evolutionary priors within an MCMC in continuous space.

Abstract: Protein design using structure prediction models such as AlphaFold2 has shown
remarkable success, but existing approaches like relaxed sequence optimization
(RSO) rely on single-path gradient descent and ignore sequence-space
constraints, limiting diversity and designability. We introduce Relaxed
Sequence Sampling (RSS), a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework that
integrates structural and evolutionary information for protein design. RSS
operates in continuous logit space, combining gradient-guided exploration with
protein language model-informed jumps. Its energy function couples
AlphaFold2-derived structural objectives with ESM2-derived sequence priors,
balancing accuracy and biological plausibility. In an in silico protein binder
design task, RSS produces 5$\times$ more designable structures and 2-3$\times$
greater structural diversity than RSO baselines, at equal computational cost.
These results highlight RSS as a principled approach for efficiently exploring
the protein design landscape.

TL;DR: Continuous-time RL with uncertain ODE dynamics using COMBRL, achieving sublinear regret and good sample efficiency via uncertainty-aware model-based planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world control is continuous in time; discrete-time RL struggles with unknown continuous dynamics; need scalable, uncertainty-aware continuous-time model-based RL.

Method: Use probabilistic models (Gaussian processes, Bayesian neural networks) to learn an uncertainty-aware ODE model; COMBRL greedily optimizes a weighted sum of extrinsic reward and model epistemic uncertainty.

Result: Sublinear regret in reward-driven setting; sample complexity bound in unsupervised RL; experiments show better scalability, sample efficiency, and superior performance against baselines on multiple deep RL tasks.

Conclusion: COMBRL provides a scalable, sample-efficient approach to continuous-time model-based RL with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms are typically designed for discrete-time
dynamics, even though the underlying real-world control systems are often
continuous in time. In this paper, we study the problem of continuous-time
reinforcement learning, where the unknown system dynamics are represented using
nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We leverage probabilistic
models, such as Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks, to learn an
uncertainty-aware model of the underlying ODE. Our algorithm, COMBRL, greedily
maximizes a weighted sum of the extrinsic reward and model epistemic
uncertainty. This yields a scalable and sample-efficient approach to
continuous-time model-based RL. We show that COMBRL achieves sublinear regret
in the reward-driven setting, and in the unsupervised RL setting (i.e., without
extrinsic rewards), we provide a sample complexity bound. In our experiments,
we evaluate COMBRL in both standard and unsupervised RL settings and
demonstrate that it scales better, is more sample-efficient than prior methods,
and outperforms baselines across several deep RL tasks.

*Jun Liu,Tao Zhou,Jiarui Li,Xiaohui Zhong,Peng Zhang,Jie Feng,Lei Chen,Hao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FuXi-ENS, a learnable perturbation ensemble method, outperforms ECMWF-ENS in tracking tropical cyclones and predicting TC-related variables, with tighter ensemble spread and better large-scale circulation representation, though it underestimates intensity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensemble forecasts for tropical cyclones are computationally expensive and struggle to fully capture atmospheric nonlinearity. A learnable perturbation approach (FuXi-ENS) aims to improve forecast skill and efficiency by better representing uncertainty and nonlinear dynamics.

Method: The paper introduces FuXi-ENS and systematically compares it with ECMWF-ENS using all 90 global TCs from 2018. Evaluations cover TC-related physical variables, track and intensity forecasts, and associated dynamical/thermodynamical fields.

Result: FuXi-ENS shows clear advantages in predicting TC-related physical variables and achieves more accurate track forecasts with reduced ensemble spread, though it underestimates intensity. Dynamical/thermodynamical analyses indicate FuXi-ENS better captures large-scale circulation and concentrates moisture turbulent energy near the TC warm core, while ECMWF-ENS exhibits a more dispersed moisture distribution.

Conclusion: Learnable perturbations offer a promising AI-based path to improve TC ensemble forecasting and broader AI-driven ensemble predictions of extreme weather, though intensity bias remains an area for further improvement.

Abstract: Tropical cyclones (TCs) are highly destructive and inherently uncertain
weather systems. Ensemble forecasting helps quantify these uncertainties, yet
traditional systems are constrained by high computational costs and limited
capability to fully represent atmospheric nonlinearity. FuXi-ENS introduces a
learnable perturbation scheme for ensemble generation, representing a novel
AI-based forecasting paradigm. Here, we systematically compare FuXi-ENS with
ECMWF-ENS using all 90 global TCs in 2018, examining their performance in
TC-related physical variables, track and intensity forecasts, and the
associated dynamical and thermodynamical fields. FuXi-ENS demonstrates clear
advantages in predicting TC-related physical variables, and achieves more
accurate track forecasts with reduced ensemble spread, though it still
underestimates intensity relative to observations. Further dynamical and
thermodynamical analyses reveal that FuXi-ENS better captures large-scale
circulation, with moisture turbulent energy more tightly concentrated around
the TC warm core, whereas ECMWF-ENS exhibits a more dispersed distribution.
These findings highlight the potential of learnable perturbations to improve TC
forecasting skill and provide valuable insights for advancing AI-based ensemble

### [162] [Learning Interpretable Features in Audio Latent Spaces via Sparse Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23802)
*Nathan Paek,Yongyi Zang,Qihui Yang,Randal Leistikow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAE-based mapping from audio latent spaces to discretized acoustic concepts enables interpretable, controllable analysis of audio generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the difficulty of interpreting dense audio latent spaces and the limited ability to characterize features in audio generative models.

Method: Train sparse autoencoders on audio latents; learn linear mappings from SAE features to discretized pitch, amplitude, and timbre; validate on DiffRhythm-VAE (continuous) and EnCodec/WavTokenizer (discrete) latents; analyze DiffRhythm generation.

Result: Enables controllable manipulation and analysis of acoustic properties; reveals how pitch, timbre, and loudness emerge during synthesis; demonstrates applicability across latent spaces; suggests extension to other modalities.

Conclusion: Provides a framework for interpretable analysis of audio generative models; extensible to other modalities like vision.

Abstract: While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) successfully extract interpretable features
from language models, applying them to audio generation faces unique
challenges: audio's dense nature requires compression that obscures semantic
meaning, and automatic feature characterization remains limited. We propose a
framework for interpreting audio generative models by mapping their latent
representations to human-interpretable acoustic concepts. We train SAEs on
audio autoencoder latents, then learn linear mappings from SAE features to
discretized acoustic properties (pitch, amplitude, and timbre). This enables
both controllable manipulation and analysis of the AI music generation process,
revealing how acoustic properties emerge during synthesis. We validate our
approach on continuous (DiffRhythm-VAE) and discrete (EnCodec, WavTokenizer)
audio latent spaces, and analyze DiffRhythm, a state-of-the-art text-to-music
model, to demonstrate how pitch, timbre, and loudness evolve throughout
generation. While our work is only done on audio modality, our framework can be
extended to interpretable analysis of visual latent space generation models.

### [163] [How do simple rotations affect the implicit bias of Adam?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23804)
*Adela DePavia,Vasileios Charisopoulos,Rebecca Willett*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adam's optimization advantage is not invariant to rotations of the data; small orthogonal transforms can eliminate its richness bias and push the learned boundary toward linearity, but a recently proposed orthogonal reparameterization makes first-order methods rotation-equivariant and can restore the bias toward richer decision boundaries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how adaptive, coordinate-wise preconditioned optimizers like Adam generalize relative to SGD, and whether data geometry (rotations) can alter their bias; evaluate a method to enforce rotation equivariance.

Method: Analyze the effect of orthogonal transformations on Adam's learned decision boundary; propose an orthogonal reparameterization of the optimization objective to render first-order methods rotation-equivariant; empirically evaluate the impact on binary classification tasks.

Result: Without reparameterization, Adam's bias can vanish under small data rotations, leading to linear boundaries farther from Bayes-optimal than gradient descent; with the proposed reparameterization, Adam regains its bias toward rich, non-linear decision boundaries.

Conclusion: Rotation-equivariant reformulations of the objective can preserve or restore Adam's favorable generalization bias, suggesting geometry-preserving transforms are valuable for the design and analysis of first-order optimization methods.

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods such as Adam and Adagrad are widely used in machine
learning, yet their effect on the generalization of learned models -- relative
to methods like gradient descent -- remains poorly understood. Prior work on
binary classification suggests that Adam exhibits a ``richness bias,'' which
can help it learn nonlinear decision boundaries closer to the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary relative to gradient descent. However, the coordinate-wise
preconditioning scheme employed by Adam renders the overall method sensitive to
orthogonal transformations of feature space. We show that this sensitivity can
manifest as a reversal of Adam's competitive advantage: even small rotations of
the underlying data distribution can make Adam forfeit its richness bias and
converge to a linear decision boundary that is farther from the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary than the one learned by gradient descent. To alleviate this
issue, we show that a recently proposed reparameterization method -- which
applies an orthogonal transformation to the optimization objective -- endows
any first-order method with equivariance to data rotations, and we empirically
demonstrate its ability to restore Adam's bias towards rich decision
boundaries.

### [164] [A Physics-informed Multi-resolution Neural Operator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23810)
*Sumanta Roy,Bahador Bahmani,Ioannis G. Kevrekidis,Michael D. Shields*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A fully data-free physics-informed operator learning framework extending RINO to handle multi-resolution inputs by projecting onto a latent space with pre-trained bases and learning an operator via an MLP, with PDE enforcement via finite difference; validated on multi-resolution PDE benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity and heterogeneous discretizations hinder operator learning; a data-efficient, grid-agnostic method that respects underlying physics is desirable.

Method: Inputs are projected onto a latent embedding using pre-trained basis functions; an MLP learns the operator mapping latent code and spatiotemporal coordinates to the solution; PDEs are enforced via a finite-difference solver in physical space; training is fully data-free (no high-fidelity data). Benchmarks include numerical examples with varying discretizations (coarse and fine).

Result: Demonstrates capability to handle multi-resolution data and varying grids in a data-free setting, with performance comparable to or exceeding data-dependent baselines on benchmark PDE problems.

Conclusion: Shows feasibility of data-free physics-informed operator learning for PDEs across multi-resolution discretizations, offering a practical route when high-fidelity data is unavailable or expensive to obtain.

Abstract: The predictive accuracy of operator learning frameworks depends on the
quality and quantity of available training data (input-output function pairs),
often requiring substantial amounts of high-fidelity data, which can be
challenging to obtain in some real-world engineering applications. These
datasets may be unevenly discretized from one realization to another, with the
grid resolution varying across samples. In this study, we introduce a
physics-informed operator learning approach by extending the Resolution
Independent Neural Operator (RINO) framework to a fully data-free setup,
addressing both challenges simultaneously. Here, the arbitrarily (but
sufficiently finely) discretized input functions are projected onto a latent
embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions), using pre-trained
basis functions. The operator associated with the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) is then approximated by a simple multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), which takes as input a latent code along with spatiotemporal
coordinates to produce the solution in the physical space. The PDEs are
enforced via a finite difference solver in the physical space. The validation
and performance of the proposed method are benchmarked on several numerical
examples with multi-resolution data, where input functions are sampled at
varying resolutions, including both coarse and fine discretizations.

### [165] [Combining SHAP and Causal Analysis for Interpretable Fault Detection in Industrial Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23817)
*Pedro Cortes dos Santos,Matheus Becali Rocha,Renato A Krohling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A fault-detection framework for the Tennessee Eastman Process using SHAP for feature attribution and DAG-based causal analysis to improve interpretability and detection accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial processes produce complex, opaque data that hamper fault detection; there is a need for interpretable and accurate monitoring in manufacturing environments.

Method: Start with standard models to establish baseline performance, then apply SHAP explanations to identify and reduce to key features, and finally construct/discover causal structures via multiple DAG-learning algorithms to reveal fault propagation mechanisms and validate SHAP findings against causal insights.

Result: SHAP-based feature reduction aligns with the discovered causal structures, consistently highlighting critical elements (e.g., cooling and separation systems) as central to fault development, leading to improved detection accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: A hybrid SHAP + DAG framework provides robust, actionable fault detection for complex industrial systems, bridging predictive power with causal understanding and offering a path toward smarter, interpretable monitoring.

Abstract: Industrial processes generate complex data that challenge fault detection
systems, often yielding opaque or underwhelming results despite advanced
machine learning techniques. This study tackles such difficulties using the
Tennessee Eastman Process, a well-established benchmark known for its intricate
dynamics, to develop an innovative fault detection framework. Initial attempts
with standard models revealed limitations in both performance and
interpretability, prompting a shift toward a more tractable approach. By
employing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we transform the problem into a
more manageable and transparent form, pinpointing the most critical process
features driving fault predictions. This reduction in complexity unlocks the
ability to apply causal analysis through Directed Acyclic Graphs, generated by
multiple algorithms, to uncover the underlying mechanisms of fault propagation.
The resulting causal structures align strikingly with SHAP findings,
consistently highlighting key process elements-like cooling and separation
systems-as pivotal to fault development. Together, these methods not only
enhance detection accuracy but also provide operators with clear, actionable
insights into fault origins, a synergy that, to our knowledge, has not been
previously explored in this context. This dual approach bridges predictive
power with causal understanding, offering a robust tool for monitoring complex
manufacturing environments and paving the way for smarter, more interpretable
fault detection in industrial systems.

### [166] [ScaLoRA: Optimally Scaled Low-Rank Adaptation for Efficient High-Rank Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23818)
*Yilang Zhang,Xiaodong Yang,Yiwei Cai,Georgios B. Giannakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method to progressively build higher-rank weight updates from consecutive low-rank LoRA increments to improve fine-tuning efficiency and convergence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA reduces fine-tuning cost by restricting updates to a low-rank subspace, but this can hurt effectiveness and slow convergence for large models; a high-rank, efficiently computable alternative is needed.

Method: At each update, compute the per-update optimal low-rank matrix to minimize the loss and approximate full fine-tuning. The cumulative high-rank update is formed by scaling the columns of the original low-rank matrix, enabling seamless optimization without restarts. The scaling factors can be found analytically.

Result: Empirical evaluations on LLMs up to 12B parameters show consistent performance gains and faster convergence compared with state-of-the-art LoRA variants across tasks such as natural language understanding, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem solving.

Conclusion: Progressively accumulating high-rank updates via optimally scaled low-rank increments provides a more effective and faster-fine-tuning paradigm for LLMs than standard LoRA, with analytical scaling enabling efficient optimization.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale in size, the computational
overhead has become a major bottleneck for task-specific fine-tuning. While
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) effectively curtails this cost by confining the
weight updates to a low-dimensional subspace, such a restriction can hinder
effectiveness and slow convergence. This contribution deals with these
limitations by accumulating progressively a high-rank weight update from
consecutive low-rank increments. Specifically, the per update optimal low-rank
matrix is identified to minimize the loss function and closely approximate full
fine-tuning. To endow efficient and seamless optimization without restarting,
this optimal choice is formed by appropriately scaling the columns of the
original low-rank matrix. Rigorous performance guarantees reveal that the
optimal scaling can be found analytically. Extensive numerical tests with
popular LLMs scaling up to 12 billion parameters demonstrate a consistent
performance gain and fast convergence relative to state-of-the-art LoRA
variants on diverse tasks including natural language understanding, commonsense
reasoning, and mathematical problem solving.

### [167] [A PDE-Informed Latent Diffusion Model for 2-m Temperature Downscaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23866)
*Paul Rosu,Muchang Bahng,Erick Jiang,Rico Zhu,Vahid Tarokh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-informed diffusion model for downscaling atmospheric data, using a PDE-based loss to enforce advection-diffusion consistency during training; improves physical plausibility of high-resolution 2m temperature fields beyond standard diffusion, with code available on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reconstruct high-resolution surface temperature fields from coarse atmospheric data while ensuring physical consistency, leveraging a latent diffusion framework and incorporating a PDE-based regularization term.

Method: Extend a pre-existing diffusion backbone with a residual connection to a UNet. Introduce a full-resolution PDE loss computed by decoding the latent representation and applying a finite-difference advection-diffusion balance. Train with and without the PDE loss to assess regularization effects; codebase released on GitHub.

Result: Conventional diffusion training already yields low PDE residuals; fine-tuning with the PDE loss provides additional regularization and improves the physical plausibility of generated fields.

Conclusion: A PDE-based loss can modestly enhance the physical consistency of diffusion-based dynamical downscaling for atmospheric temperatures, offering a feasible augmentation to standard diffusion training; the authors provide their code for replication.

Abstract: This work presents a physics-conditioned latent diffusion model tailored for
dynamical downscaling of atmospheric data, with a focus on reconstructing
high-resolution 2-m temperature fields. Building upon a pre-existing diffusion
architecture and employing a residual formulation against a reference UNet, we
integrate a partial differential equation (PDE) loss term into the model's
training objective. The PDE loss is computed in the full resolution (pixel)
space by decoding the latent representation and is designed to enforce physical
consistency through a finite-difference approximation of an effective
advection-diffusion balance. Empirical observations indicate that conventional
diffusion training already yields low PDE residuals, and we investigate how
fine-tuning with this additional loss further regularizes the model and
enhances the physical plausibility of the generated fields. The entirety of our
codebase is available on Github, for future reference and development.

### [168] [GIFT: Group-relative Implicit Fine Tuning Integrates GRPO with DPO and UNA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23868)
*Zhichao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GIFT is an on-policy RL framework for LLM alignment that minimizes the gap between implicit and explicit reward models via normalization, turning the objective into a convex, differentiable MSE loss; it blends GRPO, DPO, and UNA ideas to improve efficiency and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve alignment of LLMs by leveraging implicit rewards while avoiding intractable optimization, enabling on-policy learning with stable, simple optimization and better generalization.

Method: Combine online multi-response generation and normalization (GRPO), implicit reward of DPO, and UNA's alignment principle; normalize both rewards, derive MSE loss between normalized reward functions, enabling convex optimization; on-policy.

Result: Empirically shows superior reasoning and alignment on mathematical benchmarks; faster convergence, fewer hyperparameters, less overfitting, computational efficiency.

Conclusion: GIFT offers a stable, convex, on-policy RL framework for LLM alignment, outperforming existing methods and simplifying training.

Abstract: I propose \textbf{G}roup-relative \textbf{I}mplicit \textbf{F}ine
\textbf{T}uning (GIFT), a novel reinforcement learning framework for aligning
LLMs. Instead of directly maximizing cumulative rewards like PPO or GRPO, GIFT
minimizes the discrepancy between implicit and explicit reward models. It
combines three key ideas: (1) the online multi-response generation and
normalization of GRPO, (2) the implicit reward formulation of DPO, and (3) the
implicit-explicit reward alignment principle of UNA. By jointly normalizing the
implicit and explicit rewards, GIFT eliminates an otherwise intractable term
that prevents effective use of implicit rewards. This normalization transforms
the complex reward maximization objective into a simple mean squared error
(MSE) loss between the normalized reward functions, converting a non-convex
optimization problem into a convex, stable, and analytically differentiable
formulation. Unlike offline methods such as DPO and UNA, GIFT remains on-policy
and thus retains exploration capability. Compared to GRPO, it requires fewer
hyperparameters, converges faster, and generalizes better with significantly
reduced training overfitting. Empirically, GIFT achieves superior reasoning and
alignment performance on mathematical benchmarks while remaining
computationally efficient.

*Ayse Irmak Ercevik,Ahmet Murat Ozbayoglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph-based feature selection with ML to predict alarms in electric buses from CAN data; enhances interpretability and supports proactive maintenance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve predictive maintenance for electric buses given complex CAN/battery systems to reduce downtime and capture anomalies beyond traditional scheduled maintenance.

Method: Two-year CAN data collected; extensive preprocessing; hybrid feature selection combining statistical filters (Pearson, Cramer's V, ANOVA F-test) with optimization-based community detection (InfoMap, Leiden, Louvain, Fast Greedy); ML models (SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost) tuned via grid/random search; data balancing via SMOTEEN and down-sampling; model interpretability via LIME.

Result: The approach effectively predicts vehicle alarms and enhances feature interpretability, enabling proactive maintenance aligned with Industry 4.0.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility and benefits of graph-based feature selection and AI-driven PdM for electric buses, supporting proactive maintenance to reduce downtime.

Abstract: Predictive maintenance (PdM) is crucial for optimizing efficiency and
minimizing downtime of electric buses. While these vehicles provide
environmental benefits, they pose challenges for PdM due to complex electric
transmission and battery systems. Traditional maintenance, often based on
scheduled inspections, struggles to capture anomalies in multi-dimensional
real-time CAN Bus data. This study employs a graph-based feature selection
method to analyze relationships among CAN Bus parameters of electric buses and
investigates the prediction performance of targeted alarms using artificial
intelligence techniques. The raw data collected over two years underwent
extensive preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency. A hybrid
graph-based feature selection tool was developed by combining statistical
filtering (Pearson correlation, Cramer's V, ANOVA F-test) with
optimization-based community detection algorithms (InfoMap, Leiden, Louvain,
Fast Greedy). Machine learning models, including SVM, Random Forest, and
XGBoost, were optimized through grid and random search with data balancing via
SMOTEEN and binary search-based down-sampling. Model interpretability was
achieved using LIME to identify the features influencing predictions. The
results demonstrate that the developed system effectively predicts vehicle
alarms, enhances feature interpretability, and supports proactive maintenance
strategies aligned with Industry 4.0 principles.

*Ayush Sawarni,Sahasrajit Sarmasarkar,Vasilis Syrgkanis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adds response-time data to binary preferences using the EZ diffusion model to improve reward-model learning; achieves oracle convergence with Neyman-orthogonal losses; for linear rewards, it changes error growth from exponential to polynomial; extends to nonparametric spaces; validated on image preference tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Binary preference data is common in reward-model elicitation for foundation models, but it discards valuable temporal information from decision processes. Incorporating response times can reveal decision strength and improve sample efficiency in learning reward functions.

Method: Model response time via the Evidence Accumulation Drift Diffusion (EZ) framework to link RTs to latent preference strength; develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions to attain oracle convergence rates; prove results for linear and non-parametric reward function spaces; perform experiments on image-based preference data.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows RT-augmented methods achieve polynomial scaling with reward magnitude, contrasting with exponential scaling in standard setups; empirical experiments on image preference tasks validate the theory and demonstrate improved data efficiency.

Conclusion: Incorporating response-time information into reward-model learning yields meaningful gains in sample efficiency and robustness, with guarantees extending to complex reward models and practical validation on image datasets; the framework is promising for enhancing human-in-the-loop alignment in large-scale AI systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of response time data into human
preference learning frameworks for more effective reward model elicitation.
While binary preference data has become fundamental in fine-tuning foundation
models, generative AI systems, and other large-scale models, the valuable
temporal information inherent in user decision-making remains largely
unexploited. We propose novel methodologies to incorporate response time
information alongside binary choice data, leveraging the Evidence Accumulation
Drift Diffusion (EZ) model, under which response time is informative of the
preference strength. We develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions that achieve
oracle convergence rates for reward model learning, matching the theoretical
optimal rates that would be attained if the expected response times for each
query were known a priori. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for
linear reward functions, conventional preference learning suffers from error
rates that scale exponentially with reward magnitude. In contrast, our response
time-augmented approach reduces this to polynomial scaling, representing a
significant improvement in sample efficiency. We extend these guarantees to
non-parametric reward function spaces, establishing convergence properties for
more complex, realistic reward models. Our extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings in the context of preference learning over images.

### [171] [RS-ORT: A Reduced-Space Branch-and-Bound Algorithm for Optimal Regression Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23901)
*Cristobal Heredia,Pedro Chumpitaz-Flores,Kaixun Hua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RS-ORT is an exact, scalable two-stage MIP framework for optimal regression trees (no binarization of continuous features). It uses a reduced-space branch-and-bound that only branches on tree-structure variables, with bound-tightening and parallelizable node-wise decomposition, achieving strong performance on large-scale datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the limitations of existing MIP-based regression trees that are restricted to binary features or become intractable on large, continuous data, leading to suboptimal, deep trees.

Method: A two-stage optimization recasting of optimal regression-tree training into Reduced-Space Optimal Regression Trees (RS-ORT). It employs a branch-and-bound algorithm that branches exclusively on tree-structural variables, along with bound-tightening techniques (closed-form leaf prediction, empirical threshold discretization, exact depth-1 subtree parsing) and decomposable upper/lower bounds. Node-wise BB enables trivial parallelism.

Result: Empirical evaluation on regression benchmarks with binary and continuous features shows RS-ORT achieves superior training and testing performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. It scales to datasets with up to 2,000,000 samples with continuous features, delivering guaranteed training performance with a simpler tree and better generalization within about four hours.

Conclusion: RS-ORT delivers scalable, exact training for regression trees on large-scale datasets, avoiding crude binarization, and enabling efficient, parallelizable optimization that yields competitive or superior generalization with simpler trees.

Abstract: Mixed-integer programming (MIP) has emerged as a powerful framework for
learning optimal decision trees. Yet, existing MIP approaches for regression
tasks are either limited to purely binary features or become computationally
intractable when continuous, large-scale data are involved. Naively binarizing
continuous features sacrifices global optimality and often yields needlessly
deep trees. We recast the optimal regression-tree training as a two-stage
optimization problem and propose Reduced-Space Optimal Regression Trees
(RS-ORT) - a specialized branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm that branches
exclusively on tree-structural variables. This design guarantees the
algorithm's convergence and its independence from the number of training
samples. Leveraging the model's structure, we introduce several bound
tightening techniques - closed-form leaf prediction, empirical threshold
discretization, and exact depth-1 subtree parsing - that combine with
decomposable upper and lower bounding strategies to accelerate the training.
The BB node-wise decomposition enables trivial parallel execution, further
alleviating the computational intractability even for million-size datasets.
Based on the empirical studies on several regression benchmarks containing both
binary and continuous features, RS-ORT also delivers superior training and
testing performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on datasets with up
to 2,000,000 samples with continuous features, RS-ORT can obtain guaranteed
training performance with a simpler tree structure and a better generalization
ability in four hours.

*Wasim Ahmad,Maha Shadaydeh,Joachim Denzler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes gCDMI, a multi-group causal discovery method using group-level interventions on trained deep networks and model invariance testing to infer group causal links in nonlinear multivariate time series; shows improved performance on simulated data and real-world brain/climate datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current causal discovery largely targets pairwise relationships, missing group-level interactions and subsystems in multivariate time series; there is a need to uncover causal structures among groups of variables using interventions.

Method: 1) Train a deep neural network to jointly model relationships among groups of time series. 2) Apply group-level interventions to the trained model. 3) Use model invariance testing to infer causal links between variable groups.

Result: In simulations, gCDMI outperforms existing methods at identifying group-level causal relationships. On real-world data (brain networks, climate ecosystems), it reveals complex causal structures and validates the approach.

Conclusion: Group-level interventions on deep models combined with invariance testing can effectively uncover complex causal structures among groups, with valuable applications in neuroscience and climate science.

Abstract: Causal discovery uncovers complex relationships between variables, enhancing
predictions, decision-making, and insights into real-world systems, especially
in nonlinear multivariate time series. However, most existing methods primarily
focus on pairwise cause-effect relationships, overlooking interactions among
groups of variables, i.e., subsystems and their collective causal influence. In
this study, we introduce gCDMI, a novel multi-group causal discovery method
that leverages group-level interventions on trained deep neural networks and
employs model invariance testing to infer causal relationships. Our approach
involves three key steps. First, we use deep learning to jointly model the
structural relationships among groups of all time series. Second, we apply
group-wise interventions to the trained model. Finally, we conduct model
invariance testing to determine the presence of causal links among variable
groups. We evaluate our method on simulated datasets, demonstrating its
superior performance in identifying group-level causal relationships compared
to existing methods. Additionally, we validate our approach on real-world
datasets, including brain networks and climate ecosystems. Our results
highlight that applying group-level interventions to deep learning models,
combined with invariance testing, can effectively reveal complex causal
structures, offering valuable insights for domains such as neuroscience and
climate science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve transformer efficiency by eliminating redundant Query weights in attention, potentially reducing parameter count without sacrificing performance.

Method: Theoretically analyze the QKV triplet under simplifying assumptions to show Query weight redundancy, then implement a reduced-parameter model by removing/tying Query weights; validate on full-complexity GPT-3 small architectures (layer norm, skip connections, weight decay) trained from scratch, comparing to standard baselines.

Result: The reduced model achieves comparable validation loss to standard baselines while using over 8% fewer non-embedding/lm-head parameters.

Conclusion: Supports the idea that Query weight redundancy can be exploited; encourages scaling studies to determine practical benefits and limits in larger models, with attention to the assumptions behind the theoretical reductions.

Abstract: The Query, Key, Value weight triplet is a building block of current attention
mechanisms in state-of-the-art LLMs. We theoretically investigate whether this
triplet can be reduced, proving under simplifying assumptions that the Query
weights are redundant, thereby reducing the number of non-embedding/lm-head
parameters by over 8%. We validate the theory on full-complexity GPT-3 small
architectures (with layer normalization, skip connections, and weight decay)
trained from scratch, demonstrating that the reduced model achieves comparable
validation loss to standard baselines. These findings motivate the
investigation of the Query weight redundancy at scale.

TL;DR: Unifies discounted and average-reward MDP analyses via a geometric interpretation; shows Value Iteration converges geometrically under a unique, ergodic optimal policy in average-reward MDPs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Average-reward and discounted-reward MDPs are usually analyzed separately despite similarities; a unified geometric view can extend powerful results to the average-reward case.

Method: Extend a recently introduced geometric interpretation from discounted MDPs to the average-reward setting and prove geometric convergence of Value Iteration under a unique, ergodic optimal policy.

Result: The geometric convergence rate of Value Iteration, previously known for discounted MDPs under a unique-ergodic optimal policy, is now established for the average-reward MDP setting as well.

Conclusion: Provides a unified framework for MDP analysis across reward criteria and extends key algorithmic guarantees (geometric VI convergence) to the average-reward case.

Abstract: The theoretical analysis of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is commonly
split into two cases - the average-reward case and the discounted-reward case -
which, while sharing similarities, are typically analyzed separately. In this
work, we extend a recently introduced geometric interpretation of MDPs for the
discounted-reward case to the average-reward case, thereby unifying both. This
allows us to extend a major result known for the discounted-reward case to the
average-reward case: under a unique and ergodic optimal policy, the Value
Iteration algorithm achieves a geometric convergence rate.

### [175] [Improving the Straight-Through Estimator with Zeroth-Order Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23926)
*Ningfeng Yang,Tor M. Aamodt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FOGZO (First-Order-Guided Zeroth-Order Gradient Descent) blends guided first-order information with zeroth-order updates to train quantized networks, improving accuracy over standard STE and reducing computational cost relative to pure ZO methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training neural networks with quantized parameters is hindered by biased gradients from straight-through estimators (STE) and the high cost of unbiased zeroth-order (ZO) gradient estimates. The work aims to balance gradient quality with computational efficiency during quantization-aware training.

Method: Introduce FOGZO, a gradient-descent method that uses first-order guidance to steer zeroth-order gradient estimates, thereby reducing STE bias while lowering the computational load compared to conventional ZO methods (e.g., n-SPSA). Applied to quantization-aware pre-training across vision models, CNNs, and LLMs.

Result: Empirically, FOGZO yields improvements over STE at the same iteration count (e.g., 1‚Äì8% accuracy on DeiT Tiny/Small; 1‚Äì2% on ResNet-18/50) and up to 1‚Äì22 perplexity points on LLaMA models up to 0.3B params). It also achieves a 796√ó reduction in computation versus n-SPSA for a 2-layer MLP on MNIST at the same loss. Code is provided at the linked GitHub repository.

Conclusion: FOGZO offers a favorable tradeoff between gradient quality and training time for quantization-aware pre-training, enabling better performance with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: We study the problem of training neural networks with quantized parameters.
Learning low-precision quantized parameters by enabling computation of
gradients via the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) can be challenging. While
the STE enables back-propagation, which is a first-order method, recent works
have explored the use of zeroth-order (ZO) gradient descent for fine-tuning. We
note that the STE provides high-quality biased gradients, and ZO gradients are
unbiased but can be expensive. We thus propose First-Order-Guided Zeroth-Order
Gradient Descent (FOGZO) that reduces STE bias while reducing computations
relative to ZO methods. Empirically, we show FOGZO improves the tradeoff
between quality and training time in Quantization-Aware Pre-Training.
Specifically, versus STE at the same number of iterations, we show a 1-8\%
accuracy improvement for DeiT Tiny/Small, 1-2\% accuracy improvement on ResNet
18/50, and 1-22 perplexity point improvement for LLaMA models with up to 0.3
billion parameters. For the same loss, FOGZO yields a 796$\times$ reduction in
computation versus n-SPSA for a 2-layer MLP on MNIST. Code is available at

*Miguel Fernandez-de-Retana,Unai Zulaika,Rub√©n S√°nchez-Corcuera,Aitor Almeida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DP-SGD reduces gradient leakage risk in federated learning with a moderate drop in model utility; PDP-SGD preserves accuracy but is ineffective against gradient reconstruction attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To empirically evaluate privacy mechanisms against gradient leakage in FL, comparing DP-SGD and a regularization-based PDP-SGD under practical conditions.

Method: Train computer vision models on a simple classification task with varying privacy levels in a simulated FL setup; perform gradient leakage attacks to reconstruct private data from intercepted gradients; compare DP-SGD and PDP-SGD in terms of leakage and utility.

Result: DP-SGD significantly mitigates gradient leakage with a moderate utility loss; PDP-SGD maintains classification performance but is ineffective as a practical defense against reconstruction attacks.

Conclusion: Empirical evaluation of privacy mechanisms is essential; DP-SGD offers leakage protection with a trade-off in accuracy, while PDP-SGD does not provide effective defense against data reconstruction, highlighting gaps between theoretical guarantees and real-world security in distributed learning.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows for the training of Machine Learning models in
a collaborative manner without the need to share sensitive data. However, it
remains vulnerable to Gradient Leakage Attacks (GLAs), which can reveal private
information from the shared model updates. In this work, we investigate the
effectiveness of Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms - specifically, DP-SGD
and a variant based on explicit regularization (PDP-SGD) - as defenses against
GLAs. To this end, we evaluate the performance of several computer vision
models trained under varying privacy levels on a simple classification task,
and then analyze the quality of private data reconstructions obtained from the
intercepted gradients in a simulated FL environment. Our results demonstrate
that DP-SGD significantly mitigates the risk of gradient leakage attacks,
albeit with a moderate trade-off in model utility. In contrast, PDP-SGD
maintains strong classification performance but proves ineffective as a
practical defense against reconstruction attacks. These findings highlight the
importance of empirically evaluating privacy mechanisms beyond their
theoretical guarantees, particularly in distributed learning scenarios where
information leakage may represent an unassumable critical threat to data
security and privacy.

*Junho Choi,Teng-Yuan Chang,Namjung Kim,Youngjoon Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Data-free neural operator for 3D Navier‚ÄìStokes enabling real-time ensemble forecasting with higher accuracy than prior neural operators and greater efficiency than traditional solvers; requires no paired solution data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional Navier‚ÄìStokes ensembles are computationally prohibitive for real-time use. Data-driven operators usually need large paired datasets and struggle with 3D generalization. A data-free, physics-grounded operator could provide fast, robust surrogates for complex flows.

Method: A physics-grounded neural operator that ingests initial and boundary conditions and forcing terms. The architecture is numerically grounded and data-free, designed to handle high variability and perturbations, enabling end-to-end simulation for ensembles.

Result: In 2D benchmarks and 3D tests, the method surpasses prior neural operators in accuracy. For ensembles, it is more efficient than conventional solvers and accurately solves 3D Navier‚ÄìStokes, a regime not previously demonstrated for data-free operators.

Conclusion: Merges numerical grounding with machine-learning scalability to deliver data-free, high-fidelity PDE surrogates for real-time simulation and prediction, enabling practical end-to-end scientific forecasting for high-dimensional flows.

Abstract: Ensemble simulations of high-dimensional flow models (e.g., Navier Stokes
type PDEs) are computationally prohibitive for real time applications. Neural
operators enable fast inference but are limited by costly data requirements and
poor generalization to 3D flows. We present a data-free operator network for
the Navier Stokes equations that eliminates the need for paired solution data
and enables robust, real time inference for large ensemble forecasting. The
physics-grounded architecture takes initial and boundary conditions as well as
forcing functions, yielding solutions robust to high variability and
perturbations. Across 2D benchmarks and 3D test cases, the method surpasses
prior neural operators in accuracy and, for ensembles, achieves greater
efficiency than conventional numerical solvers. Notably, it delivers accurate
solutions of the three dimensional Navier Stokes equations, a regime not
previously demonstrated for data free neural operators. By uniting a
numerically grounded architecture with the scalability of machine learning,
this approach establishes a practical pathway toward data free, high fidelity
PDE surrogates for end to end scientific simulation and prediction.

*Anastasia-Maria Leventi-Peetz,J√∂rg-Volker Peetz,Kai Weber,Nikolaos Zacharis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A 3D multicomponent reaction-diffusion model with excitable dynamics (resembling FitzHugh‚ÄìNagumo) generates time-series data used to train an Echo State Network (ESN); the ESN reproduces the system‚Äôs spatiotemporal dynamics, demonstrating the feasibility of data-driven ESN models for simulating biological dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To capture and understand spatiotemporal electrophysiological dynamics in biological systems and to assess whether a data-driven ESN can learn and reproduce such dynamics from numerical simulations.

Method: Develop a three-dimensional multicomponent reaction-diffusion model with excitable-system dynamics, solve it numerically to produce time-series data, then train and evaluate an Echo State Network on these data.

Result: The ESN successfully reproduced the system‚Äôs dynamic behavior, indicating that data-driven, multifunctional ESN models can feasibly and effectively simulate biological dynamics.

Conclusion: Data-driven ESN approaches are viable for modeling complex biological spatiotemporal dynamics, illustrating a productive combination of RD electrophysiological models with ESN-based learning.

Abstract: In this work, a three-dimensional multicomponent reaction-diffusion model has
been developed, combining excitable-system dynamics with diffusion processes
and sharing conceptual features with the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Designed to
capture the spatiotemporal behavior of biological systems, particularly
electrophysiological processes, the model was solved numerically to generate
time-series data. These data were subsequently used to train and evaluate an
Echo State Network (ESN), which successfully reproduced the system's dynamic
behavior. The results demonstrate that simulating biological dynamics using
data-driven, multifunctional ESN models is both feasible and effective.

### [179] [ChessQA: Evaluating Large Language Models for Chess Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23948)
*Qianfeng Wen,Zhenwei Tang,Ashton Anderson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ChessQA introduces a dynamic, multi-category benchmark to diagnose LLM chess understanding across five abstraction levels, revealing persistent weaknesses and enabling ongoing evaluation with open resources.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current chess evaluations with LLMs are ad hoc and narrow; chess provides a structured ground truth and a wide skill spectrum; need scalable, comparable diagnostics across model scale, training methodologies, and architectures.

Method: Develop ChessQA with five task categories‚ÄîStructural, Motifs, Short Tactics, Position Judgment, Semantic‚Äîmapping to increasing chess knowledge abstractions. Use prompts, answer keys, construction scripts that evolve with model advances. Evaluate contemporary LLMs and provide error analyses by category. Plan to release code, datasets, and a public leaderboard.

Result: Across contemporary LLMs, persistent weaknesses are observed in all five categories; error analyses by category highlight where capabilities fail. The benchmark is dynamic and repeatable, enabling ongoing tracking of progress.

Conclusion: ChessQA offers a more comprehensive picture of chess understanding than move-quality metrics, enabling diagnosis, comparison, and tracking of progress across models. It emphasizes abstraction and semantic understanding and will be supported by open resources for community use.

Abstract: Chess provides an ideal testbed for evaluating the reasoning, modeling, and
abstraction capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as it has
well-defined structure and objective ground truth while admitting a wide
spectrum of skill levels. However, existing evaluations of LLM ability in chess
are ad hoc and narrow in scope, making it difficult to accurately measure LLM
chess understanding and how it varies with scale, post-training methodologies,
or architecture choices. We present ChessQA, a comprehensive benchmark that
assesses LLM chess understanding across five task categories (Structural,
Motifs, Short Tactics, Position Judgment, and Semantic), which approximately
correspond to the ascending abstractions that players master as they accumulate
chess knowledge, from understanding basic rules and learning tactical motifs to
correctly calculating tactics, evaluating positions, and semantically
describing high-level concepts. In this way, ChessQA captures a more
comprehensive picture of chess ability and understanding, going significantly
beyond the simple move quality evaluations done previously, and offers a
controlled, consistent setting for diagnosis and comparison. Furthermore,
ChessQA is inherently dynamic, with prompts, answer keys, and construction
scripts that can evolve as models improve. Evaluating a range of contemporary
LLMs, we find persistent weaknesses across all five categories and provide
results and error analyses by category. We will release the code, periodically
refreshed datasets, and a public leaderboard to support further research.

### [180] [A Pragmatic Way to Measure Chain-of-Thought Monitorability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23966)
*Scott Emmons,Roland S. Zimmermann,David K. Elson,Rohin Shah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes measuring chain-of-thought monitorability via legibility and coverage using an autorater prompt; early results show frontier models have high monitorability; provides the prompt as a tool for developers; emphasizes complementarity with adversarial testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preserve the ability to monitor and interpret AI chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning as training practices and architectures evolve, by ensuring humans can follow (legibility) and derive the final output from the reasoning (coverage).

Method: Define two metrics (legibility and coverage) and implement them with an autorater prompt that enables capable LLMs to evaluate existing CoTs. Validate with synthetic degradations, then apply to frontier models on challenging benchmarks. Share the complete autorater prompt and encourage community use as a monitoring tool.

Result: Frontier models show high monitorability according to the proposed metrics. The metrics and autorater prompt provide a practical tool for developers to track design decisions on monitorability, though the exact prompt is preliminary and should complement, not replace, adversarial stress-testing.

Conclusion: The proposed legibility and coverage metrics, implemented via an autorater prompt, offer a pragmatic way to maintain CoT monitorability; they should be used alongside adversarial testing to assess robustness against evasive models.

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring offers a unique opportunity for AI
safety, this opportunity could be lost through shifts in training practices or
model architecture. To help preserve monitorability, we propose a pragmatic way
to measure two components of it: legibility (whether the reasoning can be
followed by a human) and coverage (whether the CoT contains all the reasoning
needed for a human to also produce the final output). We implement these
metrics with an autorater prompt that enables any capable LLM to compute the
legibility and coverage of existing CoTs. After sanity-checking our prompted
autorater with synthetic CoT degradations, we apply it to several frontier
models on challenging benchmarks, finding that they exhibit high
monitorability. We present these metrics, including our complete autorater
prompt, as a tool for developers to track how design decisions impact
monitorability. While the exact prompt we share is still a preliminary version
under ongoing development, we are sharing it now in the hopes that others in
the community will find it useful. Our method helps measure the default
monitorability of CoT - it should be seen as a complement, not a replacement,
for the adversarial stress-testing needed to test robustness against
deliberately evasive models.

TL;DR: An all-transistor probabilistic computer implementing denoising models at hardware level; system-level analysis suggests parity with GPUs on image tasks with ~10,000√ó energy savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current probabilistic AI hardware proposals rely on limited modeling techniques and exotic hardware; there is a need for scalable, energy-efficient hardware to realize probabilistic models.

Method: Design of an all-transistor probabilistic computer that implements denoising models at hardware level; perform a system-level analysis comparing its energy-performance to GPUs on a simple image benchmark; estimate potential energy efficiency.

Result: Architecture could match GPU performance on a simple image benchmark while consuming ~10,000√ó less energy.

Conclusion: Hardware-level denoising via a transistor-based probabilistic computer shows promise for energy-efficient probabilistic AI; validation on real devices and broader benchmarks is needed to confirm practicality.

Abstract: The proliferation of probabilistic AI has promoted proposals for specialized
stochastic computers. Despite promising efficiency gains, these proposals have
failed to gain traction because they rely on fundamentally limited modeling
techniques and exotic, unscalable hardware. In this work, we address these
shortcomings by proposing an all-transistor probabilistic computer that
implements powerful denoising models at the hardware level. A system-level
analysis indicates that devices based on our architecture could achieve
performance parity with GPUs on a simple image benchmark using approximately
10,000 times less energy.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DATE dynamically updates text embeddings at every diffusion timestep to improve text-image alignment without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed text embeddings in diffusion models limit adaptability to intermediate data and the generative process; better alignment between prompt and evolving image is desirable.

Method: Formulate an optimization at each sampling step to update the text embeddings based on intermediate perturbed data; derive an update rule that refines embeddings to better align the mean predicted image with the text; requires no additional training.

Result: Theoretical analysis supports maintained generative capability; empirical results show superior text-image alignment over fixed embeddings across tasks like multi-concept generation and text-guided editing.

Conclusion: Dynamic conditioning via DATE improves alignment while preserving diffusion model capability, applicable to various prompts and editing tasks; code provided.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models rely on text embeddings from a pre-trained
text encoder, but these embeddings remain fixed across all diffusion timesteps,
limiting their adaptability to the generative process. We propose Diffusion
Adaptive Text Embedding (DATE), which dynamically updates text embeddings at
each diffusion timestep based on intermediate perturbed data. We formulate an
optimization problem and derive an update rule that refines the text embeddings
at each sampling step to improve alignment and preference between the mean
predicted image and the text. This allows DATE to dynamically adapts the text
conditions to the reverse-diffused images throughout diffusion sampling without
requiring additional model training. Through theoretical analysis and empirical
results, we show that DATE maintains the generative capability of the model
while providing superior text-image alignment over fixed text embeddings across
various tasks, including multi-concept generation and text-guided image
editing. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/DATE.

### [183] [Synergistic Neural Forecasting of Air Pollution with Stochastic Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23977)
*Yohan Abeysinghe,Muhammad Akhtar Munir,Sanoojan Baliah,Ron Sarafian,Fahad Shahbaz Khan,Yinon Rudich,Salman Khan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SynCast is a high-resolution transformer-based PM forecasting model with diffusion-based stochastic refinement that integrates ERA5 and CAMS data to improve predictions of average and extreme PM levels (PM1, PM2.5, PM10), addressing tail events with domain-aware objectives and extreme value theory for better performance in highly impacted regions without sacrificing global accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Air pollution causes significant health and environmental risks, and accurate forecasts are crucial for timely warnings. Rare but hazardous pollution spikes from wildfires, haze, and dust storms are often underestimated by existing models, necessitating tail-aware forecasting approaches.

Method: A regionally adapted transformer backbone augmented with a diffusion-based stochastic refinement module. The model fuses meteorological data and air composition data using harmonized ERA5 and CAMS datasets and optimizes with domain-aware objectives and extreme value theory to improve tail predictions for PM1, PM2.5, and PM10.

Result: SynCast achieves substantial gains in forecasting fidelity for multiple PM variables, with improved performance under extreme conditions and without compromising global (mean) accuracy, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: This framework provides a scalable foundation for next-generation air quality early warning systems and climate-health risk mitigation in vulnerable regions, with potential applicability to other pollutants and extreme-event forecasting.

Abstract: Air pollution remains a leading global health and environmental risk,
particularly in regions vulnerable to episodic air pollution spikes due to
wildfires, urban haze and dust storms. Accurate forecasting of particulate
matter (PM) concentrations is essential to enable timely public health warnings
and interventions, yet existing models often underestimate rare but hazardous
pollution events. Here, we present SynCast, a high-resolution neural
forecasting model that integrates meteorological and air composition data to
improve predictions of both average and extreme pollution levels. Built on a
regionally adapted transformer backbone and enhanced with a diffusion-based
stochastic refinement module, SynCast captures the nonlinear dynamics driving
PM spikes more accurately than existing approaches. Leveraging on harmonized
ERA5 and CAMS datasets, our model shows substantial gains in forecasting
fidelity across multiple PM variables (PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$),
especially under extreme conditions. We demonstrate that conventional loss
functions underrepresent distributional tails (rare pollution events) and show
that SynCast, guided by domain-aware objectives and extreme value theory,
significantly enhances performance in highly impacted regions without
compromising global accuracy. This approach provides a scalable foundation for
next-generation air quality early warning systems and supports climate-health
risk mitigation in vulnerable regions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HDGC is a novel algorithm that combines graph convolution with binding and bundling in hyperdimensional computing for transductive graph learning, delivering higher accuracy and orders-of-magnitude speedups over state-of-the-art GNNs and HD methods, with energy-efficiency potential on binary-vector hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve predictive accuracy on both homophilic and heterophilic graphs while reducing computational cost by integrating graph learning with hyperdimensional computing's binding/bundling operations.

Method: Proposes HDGC architecture that marries graph convolution with HD computing operations (binding and bundling) for transductive graph learning on binary vectors; evaluated on a GPU platform against GNN and HD methods across homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

Result: HDGC outperforms major GNNs and state-of-the-art HD methods in accuracy across tested graphs; achieves up to about 9,561x faster than GCNII and 144.5x faster than HDGL on same GPU platform; learning predominantly on binary vectors suggests energy efficiency on neuromorphic or in-memory devices.

Conclusion: HDGC demonstrates a compelling combination of accuracy and speed, with strong implications for energy-efficient graph learning on specialized hardware; promising for future hardware-friendly HD-based graph models.

Abstract: We present a novel algorithm, \hdgc, that marries graph convolution with
binding and bundling operations in hyperdimensional computing for transductive
graph learning. For prediction accuracy \hdgc outperforms major and popular
graph neural network implementations as well as state-of-the-art
hyperdimensional computing implementations for a collection of homophilic
graphs and heterophilic graphs. Compared with the most accurate learning
methodologies we have tested, on the same target GPU platform, \hdgc is on
average 9561.0 and 144.5 times faster than \gcnii, a graph neural network
implementation and HDGL, a hyperdimensional computing implementation,
respectively. As the majority of the learning operates on binary vectors, we
expect outstanding energy performance of \hdgc on neuromorphic and emerging
process-in-memory devices.

### [185] [STNet: Spectral Transformation Network for Solving Operator Eigenvalue Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23986)
*Hong Wang,Jiang Yixuan,Jie Wang,Xinyi Li,Jian Luo,Huanshuo Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spectral Transformation Network (STNet) improves neural-network-based eigenvalue computations by applying spectral transformations to the operator during training, using deflation to remove solved subspaces and a filter transform to emphasize a target spectral region; achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on benchmark tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eigenvalue problems in high dimensions suffer from the curse of dimensionality. The performance of learning-based eigen-solvers depends on the operator's spectral distribution; larger eigenvalue gaps typically yield better accuracy and convergence. Tailored spectral transformations can exploit this distribution to improve learning-based solvers.

Method: STNet iteratively applies spectral transformations to the operator using approximate eigenvalues/eigenfunctions. Deflation projection excludes subspaces corresponding to already solved eigenfunctions to reduce the search space and avoid convergence to known eigenpairs. A filter transform magnifies eigenvalues in a target region while suppressing others, guiding the network to compute desired eigenpairs.

Result: Empirical evaluations show STNet consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in eigenvalue problems.

Conclusion: Incorporating spectral transformations‚Äîvia deflation and filtering‚Äîinto a learning-based framework yields significant improvements for operator eigenvalue problems, particularly when leveraging the operator's spectral distribution.

Abstract: Operator eigenvalue problems play a critical role in various scientific
fields and engineering applications, yet numerical methods are hindered by the
curse of dimensionality. Recent deep learning methods provide an efficient
approach to address this challenge by iteratively updating neural networks.
These methods' performance relies heavily on the spectral distribution of the
given operator: larger gaps between the operator's eigenvalues will improve
precision, thus tailored spectral transformations that leverage the spectral
distribution can enhance their performance. Based on this observation, we
propose the Spectral Transformation Network (STNet). During each iteration,
STNet uses approximate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions to perform spectral
transformations on the original operator, turning it into an equivalent but
easier problem. Specifically, we employ deflation projection to exclude the
subspace corresponding to already solved eigenfunctions, thereby reducing the
search space and avoiding converging to existing eigenfunctions. Additionally,
our filter transform magnifies eigenvalues in the desired region and suppresses
those outside, further improving performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that STNet consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in accuracy.

*Yuxiao Wen,Yanjun Han,Zhengyuan Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a novel three-set elimination scheme for combinatorial bandits with explicit exploration, achieving near-optimal regret and matching lower bounds in both combinatorial MAB with graph feedback and combinatorial linear contextual bandits; highlights limitations of UCB-based methods due to insufficient exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend bandit algorithms to combinatorial actions, addressing the elimination challenge in high-dimensional action spaces while ensuring exploration guarantees; motivated by online recommendations and assortment optimization.

Method: Proposes an elimination scheme that partitions arms into confirmed, active, and eliminated categories and injects explicit exploration steps to update these sets; applies to two settings: combinatorial MAB with graph feedback and combinatorial linear contextual bandits.

Result: Achieves near-optimal regret in both settings; provides matching lower bounds; demonstrates that UCB-based methods can fail without explicit exploration.

Conclusion: The three-set elimination with explicit exploration offers robust performance and better regret guarantees than standard UCB approaches in these combinatorial settings.

Abstract: Combinatorial bandits extend the classical bandit framework to settings where
the learner selects multiple arms in each round, motivated by applications such
as online recommendation and assortment optimization. While extensions of upper
confidence bound (UCB) algorithms arise naturally in this context, adapting arm
elimination methods has proved more challenging. We introduce a novel
elimination scheme that partitions arms into three categories (confirmed,
active, and eliminated), and incorporates explicit exploration to update these
sets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm in two settings: the
combinatorial multi-armed bandit with general graph feedback, and the
combinatorial linear contextual bandit. In both cases, our approach achieves
near-optimal regret, whereas UCB-based methods can provably fail due to
insufficient explicit exploration. Matching lower bounds are also provided.

*Geoffery Agorku,Sarah Hernandez,Hayley Hames,Cade Wagner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Poisson regression with AIS-derived features predicts barge count from satellite-annotated data, achieving MAE 1.92 using 12 features; key predictors are course entropy, speed variability and trip length; scalable approach for Maritime Domain Awareness with transferability to other rivers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, real-time estimation of tow size on inland waterways is challenging due to non-self-propelled barges and limited monitoring. The work aims to enhance Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) by leveraging AIS tracking and ML to estimate barge counts, improving operations like lock scheduling and freight planning.

Method: Collect AIS data and manually annotated barge instances from satellite scenes along the Lower Mississippi River. Spatiotemporal matching linked AIS tracks to labeled barges. Derived 30 AIS-based features covering geometry, dynamics, and trajectories. Used Recursive Feature Elimination to select predictive features. Trained six regression models across ensemble, kernel-based, and GLM families. Poisson Regressor performed best with MAE=1.92 using 12 features.

Result: Poisson Regressor emerged as the best model, achieving MAE of 1.92 barges using 12 of the 30 features. Feature importance highlighted maneuverability measures such as course entropy, speed variability, and trip length as the most predictive. The study demonstrates a scalable approach to estimate barge counts for MDA and river logistics, with potential applications in lock scheduling, port management, and freight planning.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable, implementable method for enhancing Maritime Domain Awareness. It shows strong potential for improving operational decision-making on inland rivers and can be adapted to other waterways. Future work should test model transferability to different rivers with varying conditions and environmental factors.

Abstract: Accurate, real-time estimation of barge quantity on inland waterways remains
a critical challenge due to the non-self-propelled nature of barges and the
limitations of existing monitoring systems. This study introduces a novel
method to use Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking data to
predict the number of barges in tow using Machine Learning (ML). To train and
test the model, barge instances were manually annotated from satellite scenes
across the Lower Mississippi River. Labeled images were matched to AIS vessel
tracks using a spatiotemporal matching procedure. A comprehensive set of 30
AIS-derived features capturing vessel geometry, dynamic movement, and
trajectory patterns were created and evaluated using Recursive Feature
Elimination (RFE) to identify the most predictive variables. Six regression
models, including ensemble, kernel-based, and generalized linear approaches,
were trained and evaluated. The Poisson Regressor model yielded the best
performance, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.92 barges using 12 of
the 30 features. The feature importance analysis revealed that metrics
capturing vessel maneuverability such as course entropy, speed variability and
trip length were most predictive of barge count. The proposed approach provides
a scalable, readily implementable method for enhancing Maritime Domain
Awareness (MDA), with strong potential applications in lock scheduling, port
management, and freight planning. Future work will expand the proof of concept
presented here to explore model transferability to other inland rivers with
differing operational and environmental conditions.

*Byeonghu Na,Mina Kang,Jiseok Kwak,Minsang Park,Jiwoo Shin,SeJoon Jun,Gayoung Lee,Jin-Hwa Kim,Il-Chul Moon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training-free method STG (Safe Text embedding Guidance) improves the safety of diffusion models by adjusting text embeddings during sampling using a safety function applied to the expected final denoised image; it aligns the model distribution with safety constraints and outperforms baselines while preserving core semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models trained on large web-crawled datasets can generate harmful or biased content; there is a need for safer outputs without retraining or heavy computational costs.

Method: STG modulates the input text embeddings during the sampling process using a safety function evaluated on the expected final denoised image. This training-free approach steers generation toward safer outputs while minimally impacting quality, effectively aligning the model distribution with safety constraints.

Result: Empirical results across safety scenarios (nudity, violence, artist-style removal) show STG outperforms both training-based and training-free baselines in removing unsafe content while preserving the semantic intent of prompts.

Conclusion: STG provides a training-free mechanism to enhance diffusion-model safety by steering embeddings to satisfy safety constraints, achieving safer outputs with minimal degradation in generation quality; code is released.

Abstract: Text-to-image models have recently made significant advances in generating
realistic and semantically coherent images, driven by advanced diffusion models
and large-scale web-crawled datasets. However, these datasets often contain
inappropriate or biased content, raising concerns about the generation of
harmful outputs when provided with malicious text prompts. We propose Safe Text
embedding Guidance (STG), a training-free approach to improve the safety of
diffusion models by guiding the text embeddings during sampling. STG adjusts
the text embeddings based on a safety function evaluated on the expected final
denoised image, allowing the model to generate safer outputs without additional
training. Theoretically, we show that STG aligns the underlying model
distribution with safety constraints, thereby achieving safer outputs while
minimally affecting generation quality. Experiments on various safety
scenarios, including nudity, violence, and artist-style removal, show that STG
consistently outperforms both training-based and training-free baselines in
removing unsafe content while preserving the core semantic intent of input
prompts. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/STG.

TL;DR: A path-level trajectory model (NeuroPathNet) captures time-varying connectivity between brain functional partitions using a temporal neural network, outperforming baselines on three fMRI datasets with potential clinical implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how brain functional networks evolve over time and to address the difficulty of modeling temporal evolution of connections between functional communities with static or conventional methods; aims to advance dynamic graph learning for brain networks and support neurological disease diagnosis.

Method: Using medically supported static partition schemes (e.g., Yeo, Smith ICA), compute time series of connection strengths between each pair of partitions. These trajectories are modeled with a temporal neural network to capture dynamic pathway-level behavior.

Result: Empirical validation on three public fMRI datasets showing NeuroPathNet outperforms existing mainstream methods across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: The framework advances dynamic graph learning for brain network analysis and offers potential clinical applications in neurological disease diagnosis.

Abstract: Understanding the evolution of brain functional networks over time is of
great significance for the analysis of cognitive mechanisms and the diagnosis
of neurological diseases. Existing methods often have difficulty in capturing
the temporal evolution characteristics of connections between specific
functional communities. To this end, this paper proposes a new path-level
trajectory modeling framework (NeuroPathNet) to characterize the dynamic
behavior of connection pathways between brain functional partitions. Based on
medically supported static partitioning schemes (such as Yeo and Smith ICA), we
extract the time series of connection strengths between each pair of functional
partitions and model them using a temporal neural network. We validate the
model performance on three public functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
datasets, and the results show that it outperforms existing mainstream methods
in multiple indicators. This study can promote the development of dynamic graph
learning methods for brain network analysis, and provide possible clinical
applications for the diagnosis of neurological diseases.

Motivation: PINN performance hinges on collocation-point placement: global sampling is robust but costly; local sampling is efficient but can miss hard regions. A hybrid strategy aims to combine stability with efficiency.

Method: Residual-adaptive sampling: generate new collocation points by perturbing training points with Gaussian noise scaled inversely to the PDE residual. A lightweight linear surrogate approximates the global residual distribution to reduce computational cost.

Result: GLF consistently improves both accuracy and efficiency over global and local sampling strategies on benchmark PDEs.

Conclusion: GLF provides a practical, scalable framework that preserves stability of global methods while retaining the efficiency of local refinement for solving complex, high-dimensional PDEs.

Abstract: The accuracy of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) critically depends
on the placement of collocation points, as the PDE loss is approximated through
sampling over the solution domain. Global sampling ensures stability by
covering the entire domain but requires many samples and is computationally
expensive, whereas local sampling improves efficiency by focusing on
high-residual regions but may neglect well-learned areas, reducing robustness.
We propose a Global-Local Fusion (GLF) Sampling Strategy that combines the
strengths of both approaches. Specifically, new collocation points are
generated by perturbing training points with Gaussian noise scaled inversely to
the residual, thereby concentrating samples in difficult regions while
preserving exploration. To further reduce computational overhead, a lightweight
linear surrogate is introduced to approximate the global residual-based
distribution, achieving similar effectiveness at a fraction of the cost.
Together, these components, residual-adaptive sampling and residual-based
approximation, preserve the stability of global methods while retaining the
efficiency of local refinement. Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs
demonstrate that GLF consistently improves both accuracy and efficiency
compared with global and local sampling strategies. This study provides a
practical and scalable framework for enhancing the reliability and efficiency
of PINNs in solving complex and high-dimensional PDEs.

### [191] [Spatio-temporal Multivariate Time Series Forecast with Chosen Variables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24027)
*Zibo Liu,Zhe Jiang,Zelin Xu,Tingsong Xiao,Yupu Zhang,Zhengkun Xiao,Haibo Wang,Shigang Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework for spatio-temporal multivariate forecasting with chosen inputs (m out of n variables). It jointly performs variable selection and model optimization using three novel components, achieving higher accuracy and efficiency than baselines on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In sensing applications, the number of available sensors (m) is much smaller than the number of locations (n), creating a missing-input problem. Prior work treats input variables as fixed; there is a need to intelligently select which variables to include to maximize forecast accuracy under budget constraints.

Method: A unified framework that jointly optimizes variable selection and forecasting, featuring (1) masked variable-parameter pruning (quantile-based masking to prune less informative variables and parameters), (2) prioritized variable-parameter replay (replays low-loss past samples to preserve learned knowledge), and (3) dynamic extrapolation (propagates information from selected variables to all others via learnable spatial embeddings and adjacency information).

Result: On five real-world datasets, the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both forecast accuracy and model efficiency, demonstrating the benefit of jointly selecting variables and optimizing the model.

Conclusion: Joint variable selection and model optimization for STMF with chosen variables is effective, enabling accurate and efficient forecasting under sensor-budget constraints.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Multivariate time series Forecast (STMF) uses the time series
of $n$ spatially distributed variables in a period of recent past to forecast
their values in a period of near future. It has important applications in
spatio-temporal sensing forecast such as road traffic prediction and air
pollution prediction. Recent papers have addressed a practical problem of
missing variables in the model input, which arises in the sensing applications
where the number $m$ of sensors is far less than the number $n$ of locations to
be monitored, due to budget constraints. We observe that the state of the art
assumes that the $m$ variables (i.e., locations with sensors) in the model
input are pre-determined and the important problem of how to choose the $m$
variables in the input has never been studied. This paper fills the gap by
studying a new problem of STMF with chosen variables, which optimally selects
$m$-out-of-$n$ variables for the model input in order to maximize the forecast
accuracy. We propose a unified framework that jointly performs variable
selection and model optimization for both forecast accuracy and model
efficiency. It consists of three novel technical components: (1) masked
variable-parameter pruning, which progressively prunes less informative
variables and attention parameters through quantile-based masking; (2)
prioritized variable-parameter replay, which replays low-loss past samples to
preserve learned knowledge for model stability; (3) dynamic extrapolation
mechanism, which propagates information from variables selected for the input
to all other variables via learnable spatial embeddings and adjacency
information. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that our work
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and
efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of joint variable selection and
model optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphNet introduces a real-world DL graph dataset and two benchmark metrics (Speedup Score S(t) and ES(t)) to evaluate tensor compiler performance, with validation on CV/NLP samples using CINN (PaddlePaddle) and TorchInductor (PyTorch).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a reliable, generalizable metric and dataset to assess tensor compiler optimizations on realistic DL workloads, balancing runtime speed with correctness and exposing bottlenecks across frameworks.

Method: Construct GraphNet with 2.7K real-world DL computational graphs across six task categories and multiple frameworks; define Speedup Score S(t) combining runtime speedup and correctness within tolerance; extend to ES(t) by incorporating error information; benchmark default compilers CINN for PaddlePaddle and TorchInductor for PyTorch on CV and NLP samples; provide an end-to-end construction pipeline and tools on GitHub.

Result: Demonstrates practical utility and reproducibility of GraphNet and its metrics in diagnosing compiler performance on CV and NLP workloads; establishes a framework to compare and identify bottlenecks across frameworks and tasks.

Conclusion: GraphNet enables a standardized, open benchmarking framework for tensor compilers, with metrics that jointly capture speed and correctness and an error-aware variant to highlight bottlenecks, supported by a public pipeline.

Abstract: We introduce GraphNet, a dataset of 2.7K real-world deep learning
computational graphs with rich metadata, spanning six major task categories
across multiple deep learning frameworks. To evaluate tensor compiler
performance on these samples, we propose the benchmark metric Speedup Score
S(t), which jointly considers runtime speedup and execution correctness under
tunable tolerance levels, offering a reliable measure of general optimization
capability. Furthermore, we extend S(t) to the Error-aware Speedup Score ES(t),
which incorporates error information and helps compiler developers identify key
performance bottlenecks. In this report, we benchmark the default tensor
compilers, CINN for PaddlePaddle and TorchInductor for PyTorch, on computer
vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) samples to demonstrate the
practicality of GraphNet. The full construction pipeline with graph extraction

*Nikolaos Karalias,Akbar Rafiey,Yifei Xu,Zhishang Luo,Behrooz Tahmasebi,Connie Jiang,Stefanie Jegelka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A differentiable SSL framework for discrete constrained combinatorial optimization that uses Carath√©odory-based decomposition of network outputs into convex combinations of feasible polytope corners, enabling self-supervised training and efficient feasible rounding, with strong results on cardinality constraints and extensions to independent sets and matroid constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Discrete constrained optimization is hard for neural nets, particularly under self-supervised learning. There is a need for an end-to-end differentiable approach that preserves feasibility and yields high-quality solutions without heavy supervision.

Method: An end-to-end differentiable framework that applies convex geometry and Carath√©odory's theorem to decompose neural network outputs into convex combinations of polytope corners representing feasible sets. This enables self-supervised training and efficient rounding of outputs to feasible discrete solutions.

Result: Empirically, the method consistently outperforms neural baselines on cardinality-constrained problems. The paper also demonstrates worked-out examples extending the approach to independent sets in graphs and matroid-constrained problems.

Conclusion: The proposed decomposition-based SSL framework offers a general, differentiable mechanism for solving discrete constrained optimization, with strong empirical performance and broad applicability to various combinatorial tasks.

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Combinatorial Optimization (CO) is an
emerging paradigm for solving combinatorial problems using neural networks. In
this paper, we address a central challenge of SSL for CO: solving problems with
discrete constraints. We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that
enables us to solve discrete constrained optimization problems with neural
networks. Concretely, we leverage algorithmic techniques from the literature on
convex geometry and Carath\'eodory's theorem to decompose neural network
outputs into convex combinations of polytope corners that correspond to
feasible sets. This decomposition-based approach enables self-supervised
training but also ensures efficient quality-preserving rounding of the neural
net output into feasible solutions. Extensive experiments in
cardinality-constrained optimization show that our approach can consistently
outperform neural baselines. We further provide worked-out examples of how our
method can be applied beyond cardinality-constrained problems to a diverse set
of combinatorial optimization tasks, including finding independent sets in
graphs, and solving matroid-constrained problems.

### [194] [Localized Kernel Projection Outlyingness: A Two-Stage Approach for Multi-Modal Outlier Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24043)
*Akira Tamamori*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Three-stage outlier detector (Two-Stage LKPLO) that uses a flexible loss-based outlyingness measure, global kernel PCA, and local clustering to handle non-linear, multi-modal data, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional projection-based outlier methods rely on fixed metrics and assume a single data structure, limiting performance on complex, multi-modal data; a flexible, multi-stage approach is needed.

Method: Introduce PLO loss-based outlyingness (including SVM-like loss), apply a global kernel PCA stage to linearize non-linear structures, followed by a local clustering stage to capture multi-modality; evaluate with 5-fold CV and automated hyperparameter optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across 10 benchmarks; notably superior on Optdigits (multi-cluster) and Arrhythmia (high-dimensional); ablation confirms the necessity of both kernelization and localization.

Conclusion: Hybrid, multi-stage architecture is effective for a broad class of outlier problems and highlights the value of combining kernelization with localization for robust outlier detection.

Abstract: This paper presents Two-Stage LKPLO, a novel multi-stage outlier detection
framework that overcomes the coexisting limitations of conventional
projection-based methods: their reliance on a fixed statistical metric and
their assumption of a single data structure. Our framework uniquely synthesizes
three key concepts: (1) a generalized loss-based outlyingness measure (PLO)
that replaces the fixed metric with flexible, adaptive loss functions like our
proposed SVM-like loss; (2) a global kernel PCA stage to linearize non-linear
data structures; and (3) a subsequent local clustering stage to handle
multi-modal distributions. Comprehensive 5-fold cross-validation experiments on
10 benchmark datasets, with automated hyperparameter optimization, demonstrate
that Two-Stage LKPLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. It significantly
outperforms strong baselines on datasets with challenging structures where
existing methods fail, most notably on multi-cluster data (Optdigits) and
complex, high-dimensional data (Arrhythmia). Furthermore, an ablation study
empirically confirms that the synergistic combination of both the kernelization
and localization stages is indispensable for its superior performance. This
work contributes a powerful new tool for a significant class of outlier
detection problems and underscores the importance of hybrid, multi-stage
architectures.

### [195] [Mitigating Negative Transfer via Reducing Environmental Disagreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24044)
*Hui Sun,Zheng Xie,Hao-Yuan He,Ming Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method to mitigate negative transfer in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) by causally disentangled learning that separates domain-invariant causal features from domain-specific non-causal environmental features, then reduces environmental disagreement via adversarially trained domain-specific extractors, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Negative transfer arises when models over-rely on non-causal environmental features that shift across domains. A causal-disentangled perspective can isolate invariant causal features, improving cross-domain generalization.

Method: Propose RED (Reducing Environmental Disagreement): (1) disentangle each sample into domain-invariant causal features and domain-specific non-causal environmental features using adversarial training with domain-specific environmental feature extractors in the opposite domains; (2) estimate and reduce environmental disagreement using the domain-specific non-causal features, thereby aligning predictions on causal information across domains.

Result: Experimental results show that RED effectively mitigates negative transfer and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard UDA benchmarks.

Conclusion: Disentangling causal and environmental features and actively reducing environmental disagreement yields robust cross-domain transfer in UDA, addressing negative transfer without sacrificing domain alignment.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation~(UDA) focuses on transferring knowledge from a
labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, addressing the challenge
of \emph{domain shift}. Significant domain shifts hinder effective knowledge
transfer, leading to \emph{negative transfer} and deteriorating model
performance. Therefore, mitigating negative transfer is essential. This study
revisits negative transfer through the lens of causally disentangled learning,
emphasizing cross-domain discriminative disagreement on non-causal
environmental features as a critical factor. Our theoretical analysis reveals
that overreliance on non-causal environmental features as the environment
evolves can cause discriminative disagreements~(termed \emph{environmental
disagreement}), thereby resulting in negative transfer. To address this, we
propose Reducing Environmental Disagreement~(RED), which disentangles each
sample into domain-invariant causal features and domain-specific non-causal
environmental features via adversarially training domain-specific environmental
feature extractors in the opposite domains. Subsequently, RED estimates and
reduces environmental disagreement based on domain-specific non-causal
environmental features. Experimental results confirm that RED effectively
mitigates negative transfer and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

*Tu Anh Hoang Nguyen,Dang Nguyen,Tri-Nhan Vo,Thuc Duy Le,Sunil Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CA-GAN is a causal-structure aware GAN for tabular data that uses causal graph extraction and a conditional WGAN-GP with an RL-based objective to preserve causal structure, utility, and privacy, outperforming six SOTA methods across 14 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy concerns and regulatory constraints limit tabular data sharing; existing GAN-based data generators struggle to capture complex causal relationships, maintain data utility, and offer provable privacy guarantees suitable for enterprise deployment.

Method: A two-step approach: (1) extract a causal graph from the data to learn robust causal relationships; (2) train a conditional WGAN-GP that operates according to the causal graph structure, with a reinforcement learning‚Äìbased objective enforcing alignment of causal graphs between real and fake data.

Result: CA-GAN outperforms six state-of-the-art methods on 14 tabular datasets, evaluated on causal preservation, utility preservation, and privacy preservation metrics.

Conclusion: CA-GAN provides a practical, high-performance solution for generating privacy-compliant synthetic tabular data to benchmark database systems, accelerate software development, and enable secure data-driven research.

Abstract: The utility of tabular data for tasks ranging from model training to
large-scale data analysis is often constrained by privacy concerns or
regulatory hurdles. While existing data generation methods, particularly those
based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have shown promise, they
frequently struggle with capturing complex causal relationship, maintaining
data utility, and providing provable privacy guarantees suitable for enterprise
deployment. We introduce CA-GAN, a novel generative framework specifically
engineered to address these challenges for real-world tabular datasets. CA-GAN
utilizes a two-step approach: causal graph extraction to learn a robust,
comprehensive causal relationship in the data's manifold, followed by a custom
Conditional WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty) that operates
exclusively as per the structure of nodes in the causal graph. More
importantly, the generator is trained with a new Reinforcement Learning-based
objective that aligns the causal graphs constructed from real and fake data,
ensuring the causal awareness in both training and sampling phases. We
demonstrate CA-GAN superiority over six SOTA methods across 14 tabular
datasets. Our evaluations, focused on core data engineering metrics: causal
preservation, utility preservation, and privacy preservation. Our method offers
a practical, high-performance solution for data engineers seeking to create
high-quality, privacy-compliant synthetic datasets to benchmark database
systems, accelerate software development, and facilitate secure data-driven
research.

### [197] [Learning from History: A Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Spatiotemporal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24049)
*Hao Jia,Penghao Zhao,Hao Wu,Yuan Gao,Yangyu Tao,Bin Cui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Retrieval-Augmented Prediction framework (RAP) that uses historical exemplars as non-parametric references to steer long-term spatiotemporal forecasts, improving physical realism and reducing error accumulation; outperforms state-of-the-art and analog-only baselines in meteorology, turbulence, and fire simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-term predictions of complex physical systems suffer from error accumulation in purely parametric deep models and struggle to satisfy physical constraints. There is a need to integrate data-driven power with grounding in historical dynamics to improve fidelity and plausibility.

Method: RAP retrieves the most similar historical evolution for a given state from a large database. The true future of that analog serves as a reference target and is fed as a conditional input to a dual-stream network. The target provides dynamic guidance but is not a hard constraint in the loss, enabling the model to align predictions with physically plausible trajectories.

Result: Extensive benchmarks across meteorology, turbulence, and fire simulation show RAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods and a strong analog-only baseline, significantly reducing error divergence in long-term rollouts and producing more physically realistic trajectories.

Conclusion: The RAP framework demonstrates that combining parametric deep learning with non-parametric historical data can effectively constrain dynamics, yielding higher-fidelity, physically plausible long-term predictions and broad applicability in scientific computing.

Abstract: Accurate and long-term spatiotemporal prediction for complex physical systems
remains a fundamental challenge in scientific computing. While deep learning
models, as powerful parametric approximators, have shown remarkable success,
they suffer from a critical limitation: the accumulation of errors during
long-term autoregressive rollouts often leads to physically implausible
artifacts. This deficiency arises from their purely parametric nature, which
struggles to capture the full constraints of a system's intrinsic dynamics. To
address this, we introduce a novel \textbf{Retrieval-Augmented Prediction
(RAP)} framework, a hybrid paradigm that synergizes the predictive power of
deep networks with the grounded truth of historical data. The core philosophy
of RAP is to leverage historical evolutionary exemplars as a non-parametric
estimate of the system's local dynamics. For any given state, RAP efficiently
retrieves the most similar historical analog from a large-scale database. The
true future evolution of this analog then serves as a \textbf{reference
target}. Critically, this target is not a hard constraint in the loss function
but rather a powerful conditional input to a specialized dual-stream
architecture. It provides strong \textbf{dynamic guidance}, steering the
model's predictions towards physically viable trajectories. In extensive
benchmarks across meteorology, turbulence, and fire simulation, RAP not only
surpasses state-of-the-art methods but also significantly outperforms a strong
\textbf{analog-only forecasting baseline}. More importantly, RAP generates
predictions that are more physically realistic by effectively suppressing error
divergence in long-term rollouts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FolDE uses naturalness-based warm-starting and a constant-liar batch selector to improve end-of-campaign success in active-learning-assisted directed evolution, outperforming baselines in simulations across 20 targets; open-source workflow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ALDE reduces experimental cost but suffers from homogeneous training data when selecting top-predicted mutants each round, which degrades predictive accuracy in later rounds. There is a need to diversify data and improve early predictions to maximize end-of-campaign success in protein optimization.

Method: FolDE introduces two core innovations: (1) naturalness-based warm-starting that augments limited activity measurements with protein-language-model outputs to improve activity prediction; (2) a constant-liar batch selector to increase batch diversity in multi-mutation campaigns.

Result: In simulations across 20 protein targets, FolDE discovers 23% more top 10% mutants than the best baseline ALDE method (p=0.005) and is 55% more likely to find top 1% mutants.

Conclusion: FolDE advances ALDE by maximizing end-of-campaign success and provides an open-source workflow that makes efficient protein optimization accessible to laboratories.

Abstract: Proteins are traditionally optimized through the costly construction and
measurement of many mutants. Active Learning-assisted Directed Evolution (ALDE)
alleviates that cost by predicting the best improvements and iteratively
testing mutants to inform predictions. However, existing ALDE methods face a
critical limitation: selecting the highest-predicted mutants in each round
yields homogeneous training data insufficient for accurate prediction models in
subsequent rounds. Here we present FolDE, an ALDE method designed to maximize
end-of-campaign success. In simulations across 20 protein targets, FolDE
discovers 23% more top 10% mutants than the best baseline ALDE method (p=0.005)
and is 55% more likely to find top 1% mutants. FolDE achieves this primarily
through naturalness-based warm-starting, which augments limited activity
measurements with protein language model outputs to improve activity
prediction. We also introduce a constant-liar batch selector, which improves
batch diversity; this is important in multi-mutation campaigns but had limited
effect in our benchmarks. The complete workflow is freely available as
open-source software, making efficient protein optimization accessible to any
laboratory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FALQON merges LoRA adapters into an FP8 backbone to eliminate quantization overhead in low-bit fine-tuning, delivering ~3x speedup with similar accuracy and enabling end-to-end FP8 training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FP8 formats offer speedups for large matrix multiplications, but LoRA-based fine-tuning incurs quantization overhead that negates benefits; a method that removes separate quantized paths could unlock FP8's full potential for LLM fine-tuning.

Method: Directly merge LoRA adapters into the FP8-quantized backbone during fine-tuning; reformulate forward and backward passes for the merged adapters to reduce quantization overhead; introduce a row-wise proxy update to efficiently integrate large updates into the quantized backbone; enable an end-to-end FP8 training workflow without post-training quantization.

Result: Approximately 3√ó training speedup over existing quantized LoRA methods with comparable accuracy; end-to-end FP8 workflow eliminates the need for post-training quantization, facilitating efficient deployment.

Conclusion: FALQON provides a practical solution for efficient large-scale fine-tuning by removing quantization bottlenecks in LoRA paths and delivering deploy-friendly end-to-end FP8 training.

Abstract: Low-bit floating-point (FP) formats, such as FP8, provide significant
acceleration and memory savings in model training thanks to native hardware
support on modern GPUs and NPUs. However, we analyze that FP8 quantization
offers speedup primarily for large-dimensional matrix multiplications, while
inherent quantization overheads diminish speedup when applied to low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which uses small-dimensional matrices for efficient
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). To address this limitation, we
propose FALQON, a novel framework that eliminates the quantization overhead
from separate LoRA computational paths by directly merging LoRA adapters into
an FP8-quantized backbone during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we reformulate the
forward and backward computations for merged adapters to significantly reduce
quantization overhead, and introduce a row-wise proxy update mechanism that
efficiently integrates substantial updates into the quantized backbone.
Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FALQON achieves approximately a
3$\times$ training speedup over existing quantized LoRA methods with a similar
level of accuracy, providing a practical solution for efficient large-scale
model fine-tuning. Moreover, FALQON's end-to-end FP8 workflow removes the need
for post-training quantization, facilitating efficient deployment. Code is

TL;DR: A principled information-theoretic framework for discrete diffusion that connects mutual information to score-based losses to yield tight log-likelihood estimators, with extensions to masked diffusion and practical estimators; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To obtain principled, potentially tight estimators of data log-likelihood in discrete diffusion models, moving beyond variational bounds, and to enable practical tasks like conditional likelihood and likelihood ratios.

Method: Introduce I-MDSE relation linking MI between data and diffused version to minimum denoising score entropy; extend to I-MDCE in masked diffusion; derive a time-integral decomposition of log-likelihood in terms of optimal score-based losses; provide time-free formula and Monte Carlo estimators; validate theoretically and empirically.

Result: Proves that DSE/DCE-based losses can be tight estimators of log-likelihood; yields decompositions and practical formulas; experiments on synthetic/real data show accuracy and stable variance; code released.

Conclusion: The framework provides principled, tight estimators of log-likelihood for discrete diffusion models and enables practical extensions; paves the way for better evaluation and use of score-based methods in discrete settings; future work may explore broader tasks and further empirical evaluation.

Abstract: We present an information-theoretic framework for discrete diffusion models
that yields principled estimators of log-likelihood using score-matching
losses. Inspired by the I-MMSE identity for the Gaussian setup, we derive
analogous results for the discrete setting. Specifically, we introduce the
Information-Minimum Denoising Score Entropy (I-MDSE) relation, which links
mutual information between data and its diffused version to the minimum
denoising score entropy (DSE) loss. We extend this theory to masked diffusion
and establish the Information-Minimum Denoising Cross-Entropy (I-MDCE)
relation, connecting cross-entropy losses to mutual information in discrete
masked processes. These results provide a time-integral decomposition of the
log-likelihood of the data in terms of optimal score-based losses, showing that
commonly used losses such as DSE and DCE are not merely variational bounds but
tight and principled estimators of log-likelihood. The I-MDCE decomposition
further enables practical extensions, including time-free formula, conditional
likelihood estimation in prompt-response tasks, and coupled Monte Carlo
estimation of likelihood ratios. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data
confirm the accuracy, variance stability, and utility of our estimators. The
code is publicly available at https://github.com/Dongjae0324/infodis.

### [201] [What do vision-language models see in the context? Investigating multimodal in-context learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24331)
*Gabriel O. dos Santos,Esther Colombini,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In-context learning in vision-language models is limited; interleaved image-text training helps ICL but does not yield true multimodal integration from demonstrations; instruction tuning improves following instructions but reduces reliance on demonstrations, revealing a trade-off; attention analyses show models rely on textual cues rather than visuals, indicating limited multimodal integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The abstract motivates a systematic study of ICL in VLMs because while ICL has been explored in LLMs, its behavior and effectiveness in multimodal models remain underexplored. The goal is to understand how prompt design, architectural choices, and training strategies shape multimodal ICL and attention patterns, and to uncover limitations in current VLMs‚Äô ability to learn from multimodal in-context examples.

Method: 1) Evaluate seven models spanning four architectures on three image captioning benchmarks. 2) Systematically study prompt design, architectural choices, and training strategies. 3) Analyze attention patterns as the number of in-context demonstrations increases. 4) Compare training data regimes (imag-text interleaved vs others) and post-hoc effects of instruction tuning.

Result: Findings include: (a) Training on imag-text interleaved data improves ICL performance but does not reflect effective integration of visual and textual information from demonstrations; (b) Instruction tuning enhances instruction-following but can reduce reliance on in-context demonstrations, indicating a trade-off between instruction alignment and in-context adaptation; (c) Attention analyses show that models primarily attend to textual cues and fail to leverage visual information, revealing limited multimodal integration in current VLMs.

Conclusion: The study reveals key limitations in VLMs‚Äô ICL ability and offers directions for improving multimodal in-context learning, such as balancing instruction alignment with in-context adaptation and developing attentional mechanisms that better integrate visual cues from demonstrations.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn tasks
from demonstration examples without parameter updates. Although it has been
extensively studied in LLMs, its effectiveness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ICL in
VLMs, evaluating seven models spanning four architectures on three image
captioning benchmarks. We analyze how prompt design, architectural choices, and
training strategies influence multimodal ICL. To our knowledge, we are the
first to analyze how attention patterns in VLMs vary with an increasing number
of in-context demonstrations. Our results reveal that training on imag-text
interleaved data enhances ICL performance but does not imply effective
integration of visual and textual information from demonstration examples. In
contrast, instruction tuning improves instruction-following but can reduce
reliance on in-context demonstrations, suggesting a trade-off between
instruction alignment and in-context adaptation. Attention analyses further
show that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage
visual information, suggesting a limited capacity for multimodal integration.
These findings highlight key limitations in the ICL abilities of current VLMs
and provide insights for enhancing their ability to learn from multimodal
in-context examples.

*Ziyu Liu,Yijing Liu,Jianfei Yuan,Minzhi Yan,Le Yue,Honghui Xiong,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G2ConS reduces the cost of graph-based retrieval for LLM QA by selecting salient chunks and using a zero-cost, LLM-independent concept graph, achieving better construction cost, retrieval effectiveness, and QA quality across real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieval-driven QA with LLMs in domains with proprietary documents requires many LLM calls to extract entities/relations, making it costly at scale; a cheaper, effective retrieval graph is highly desirable.

Method: An ablation study identifies important words (concepts) and their documents. Proposes Graph-Guided Concept Selection (G2ConS) with (1) a chunk selection method to pick salient document chunks, and (2) a zero-cost, LLM-independent concept graph to bridge gaps caused by chunk reduction.

Result: G2ConS outperforms baselines on construction cost, retrieval effectiveness, and answering quality across multiple real-world datasets.

Conclusion: G2ConS offers a cost-efficient, end-to-end KG-based retrieval approach for LLM QA, reducing dependence on expensive LLM-derived extractions while maintaining or improving QA performance; well-suited for domains with proprietary documents and multi-hop retrieval.

Abstract: Graph-based RAG constructs a knowledge graph (KG) from text chunks to enhance
retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is
especially beneficial in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political
science, where effective retrieval often involves multi-hop reasoning over
proprietary documents. However, these methods demand numerous LLM calls to
extract entities and relations from text chunks, incurring prohibitive costs at
scale. Through a carefully designed ablation study, we observe that certain
words (termed concepts) and their associated documents are more important.
Based on this insight, we propose Graph-Guided Concept Selection (G2ConS). Its
core comprises a chunk selection method and an LLM-independent concept graph.
The former selects salient document chunks to reduce KG construction costs; the
latter closes knowledge gaps introduced by chunk selection at zero cost.
Evaluations on multiple real-world datasets show that G2ConS outperforms all
baselines in construction cost, retrieval effectiveness, and answering quality.

### [203] [Causal Convolutional Neural Networks as Finite Impulse Response Filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24125)
*Kiran Bacsa,Wei Liu,Xudong Jian,Huangbin Liang,Eleni Chatzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Causal CNNs with long kernels and quasi-linear activations on multimodal time-series behave like FIR filters and can be reduced to a single-layer FIR via least-squares, enabling interpretable spectral learning; validated on beam dynamics and bridge vibration data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how deep causal CNNs learn spectral content in time-series and link their behavior to classical linear signal processing to improve interpretability for dynamic physical systems.

Method: Theoretical and empirical analysis of causal CNNs with extended kernels and quasi-linear activations. Demonstrate FIR-like behavior and use associativity of convolution to reduce the network to an equivalent single-layer FIR filter optimized by least-squares. Validate on simulated beam dynamics and real bridge vibration datasets.

Result: CNNs capture spectral features implicitly and explicitly, offering enhanced interpretability. The network is equivalent to an optimized FIR filter under least-squares criteria, yielding insights into spectral learning for signals with sparse frequency content; validation on beam dynamics simulations and bridge data supports relevance for modeling dynamic systems.

Conclusion: Establishes a bridge between CNN-based spectral learning and FIR filtering, providing a practical reduction technique and interpretability framework for modeling physical dynamic systems with time-series data.

Abstract: This study investigates the behavior of Causal Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) with quasi-linear activation functions when applied to time-series data
characterized by multimodal frequency content. We demonstrate that, once
trained, such networks exhibit properties analogous to Finite Impulse Response
(FIR) filters, particularly when the convolutional kernels are of extended
length exceeding those typically employed in standard CNN architectures. Causal
CNNs are shown to capture spectral features both implicitly and explicitly,
offering enhanced interpretability for tasks involving dynamic systems.
Leveraging the associative property of convolution, we further show that the
entire network can be reduced to an equivalent single-layer filter resembling
an FIR filter optimized via least-squares criteria. This equivalence yields new
insights into the spectral learning behavior of CNNs trained on signals with
sparse frequency content. The approach is validated on both simulated beam
dynamics and real-world bridge vibration datasets, underlining its relevance
for modeling and identifying physical systems governed by dynamic responses.

### [204] [Local Performance vs. Out-of-Distribution Generalization: An Empirical Analysis of Personalized Federated Learning in Heterogeneous Data Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24503)
*Mortesa Hussaini,Jan Thei√ü,Anthony Stein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU) to address client drift in heterogeneous data by extending FedAvg with an adaptive personalization step, and emphasizes evaluating both local performance and generalization across staged metrics and diverse data splits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In FL with heterogeneous data, local models drift toward local optima, and FedAvg updates may be suboptimal for the global objective. Current personalized FL often focuses on local performance, neglecting robustness and generalization to out-of-distribution data. A comprehensive evaluation framework and a method combining personalization with aggregation are needed.

Method: Extend FedAvg with an adaptive individualized update step (FLIU) to personalize updates per client. Evaluate empirically on MNIST and CIFAR-10 under IID, non-IID Dirichlet distributions, and novel stress-test environments to assess both local performance and generalization across different stages within a communication round.

Result: Abstract does not report concrete empirical results; it indicates that the method will be evaluated empirically under various data heterogeneity conditions.

Conclusion: The work proposes a straightforward augmentation to FedAvg (individualized updates with adaptive personalization) and a richer evaluation framework to capture both local performance and generalization, signaling potential robustness benefits but requiring empirical validation.

Abstract: In the context of Federated Learning with heterogeneous data environments,
local models tend to converge to their own local model optima during local
training steps, deviating from the overall data distributions. Aggregation of
these local updates, e.g., with FedAvg, often does not align with the global
model optimum (client drift), resulting in an update that is suboptimal for
most clients. Personalized Federated Learning approaches address this challenge
by exclusively focusing on the average local performances of clients' models on
their own data distribution. Generalization to out-of-distribution samples,
which is a substantial benefit of FedAvg and represents a significant component
of robustness, appears to be inadequately incorporated into the assessment and
evaluation processes. This study involves a thorough evaluation of Federated
Learning approaches, encompassing both their local performance and their
generalization capabilities. Therefore, we examine different stages within a
single communication round to enable a more nuanced understanding of the
considered metrics. Furthermore, we propose and incorporate a modified approach
of FedAvg, designated as Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU),
extending the algorithm by a straightforward individualization step with an
adaptive personalization factor. We evaluate and compare the approaches
empirically using MNIST and CIFAR-10 under various distributional conditions,
including benchmark IID and pathological non-IID, as well as additional novel
test environments with Dirichlet distribution specifically developed to stress
the algorithms on complex data heterogeneity.

*Hojin Cheon,Hyeongseok Seo,Jihun Jeon,Wooju Lee,Dohyun Jeong,Hongseok Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning-based framework combining NeuralSPMe surrogate and PUNet for fast, accurate parameter identification of electrochemical battery models, achieving huge speedups under dynamic EV loads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for accurate, efficient battery health assessment. Metaheuristics are computationally expensive; existing ML methods depend on constant-current data; real-world EVs exhibit dynamic loads requiring robust identification.

Method: Employ NeuralSPMe as a neural surrogate of the single particle model with electrolyte, trained on realistic EV load profiles to capture lithium concentration dynamics; use a parameter update network (PUNet) to perform fixed-point iterations and accelerate convergence, reducing evaluation time and total iterations.

Result: Accelerates parameter identification by >2000√ó, achieves superior sample efficiency, and >10√ó higher accuracy compared with conventional metaheuristic algorithms, particularly under dynamic load scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a scalable, efficient, and accurate solution for parameter identification of electrochemical battery models in realistic, dynamic operating conditions, addressing the limitations of traditional optimization and ML approaches.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of electric vehicles has intensified the need for
accurate and efficient diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries. Parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models is widely recognized as a
powerful method for battery health assessment. However, conventional
metaheuristic approaches suffer from high computational cost and slow
convergence, and recent machine learning methods are limited by their reliance
on constant current data, which may not be available in practice. To overcome
these challenges, we propose deep learning-based framework for parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models. The proposed framework
combines a neural surrogate model of the single particle model with electrolyte
(NeuralSPMe) and a deep learning-based fixed-point iteration method. NeuralSPMe
is trained on realistic EV load profiles to accurately predict lithium
concentration dynamics under dynamic operating conditions while a parameter
update network (PUNet) performs fixed-point iterative updates to significantly
reduce both the evaluation time per sample and the overall number of iterations
required for convergence. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the
proposed framework accelerates the parameter identification by more than 2000
times, achieves superior sample efficiency and more than 10 times higher
accuracy compared to conventional metaheuristic algorithms, particularly under
dynamic load scenarios encountered in practical applications.

*Aiqing Zhu,Beatrice W. Soh,Grigorios A. Pavliotis,Qianxiao Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces I-OnsagerNet, a data-driven framework for learning dissipative stochastic dynamics with interpretable, unique decompositions to quantify irreversibility and entropy production.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantify energy dissipation and time irreversibility in far-from-equilibrium systems from trajectory data, with models that are expressive yet physically meaningful and identifiable.

Method: Extends Onsager's principle by learning a potential from the stationary density and decomposing drift via Helmholtz decomposition into reversible and irreversible parts; enables computation of entropy production and irreversibility; ensures uniqueness and interpretability.

Result: Allows calculation of entropy production and quantification of irreversibility; uncovering scaling laws (e.g., super-linear barrier heights with strain rate; sub-linear entropy production with strain rate) and batch-size effects; validated on polymer stretching in elongational flow and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics.

Conclusion: I-OnsagerNet provides a general, data-driven framework for discovering and interpreting non-equilibrium dynamics, offering a principled means to detect and quantify deviations from equilibrium.

Abstract: Complex dissipative systems appear across science and engineering, from
polymers and active matter to learning algorithms. These systems operate far
from equilibrium, where energy dissipation and time irreversibility are key to
their behavior, but are difficult to quantify from data. Learning accurate and
interpretable models of such dynamics remains a major challenge: the models
must be expressive enough to describe diverse processes, yet constrained enough
to remain physically meaningful and mathematically identifiable. Here, we
introduce I-OnsagerNet, a neural framework that learns dissipative stochastic
dynamics directly from trajectories while ensuring both interpretability and
uniqueness. I-OnsagerNet extends the Onsager principle to guarantee that the
learned potential is obtained from the stationary density and that the drift
decomposes cleanly into time-reversible and time-irreversible components, as
dictated by the Helmholtz decomposition. Our approach enables us to calculate
the entropy production and to quantify irreversibility, offering a principled
way to detect and quantify deviations from equilibrium. Applications to polymer
stretching in elongational flow and to stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
reveal new insights, including super-linear scaling of barrier heights and
sub-linear scaling of entropy production rates with the strain rate, and the
suppression of irreversibility with increasing batch size. I-OnsagerNet thus
establishes a general, data-driven framework for discovering and interpreting
non-equilibrium dynamics.

*Yiheng Du,Aditi S. Krishnapriyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EddyFormer combines a Transformer-based spectral-element approach with a novel SEM tokenization to simulate large-scale turbulence. It achieves DNS-level accuracy at 256^3 with ~30x speedup, generalizes to unseen domains up to 4x larger, and performs well on diverse flows where prior ML models struggle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNS of turbulence is computationally prohibitive due to multi-scale interactions. A data-driven, scalable model that preserves physics-inspired metrics and generalizes across domain sizes is needed.

Method: A Transformer-based spectral-element (SEM) architecture named EddyFormer. Introduces SEM tokenization that splits flow into grid-scale and subgrid-scale components to capture local and global features. Trains on a newly created 3D isotropic turbulence dataset to reproduce DNS accuracy at 256^3. Evaluates on larger unseen domains and on the Well benchmark suite to assess generalization and robustness.

Result: EddyFormer achieves DNS-level accuracy at 256^3 and delivers ~30x speedup over DNS. It generalizes to unseen domains up to 4x larger than training while preserving physics-invariant metrics: energy spectra, correlation functions, and structure functions. On The Well benchmark, it resolves cases where prior ML models fail to converge and accurately reproduces complex dynamics across diverse physical conditions.

Conclusion: The combination of SEM with Transformer-based attention and the SEM tokenization enables accurate, scalable turbulence simulation with strong domain generalization. EddyFormer demonstrates competitive performance across a range of flows and conditions, suggesting potential to complement or replace DNS in large-scale turbulence studies.

Abstract: Computationally resolving turbulence remains a central challenge in fluid
dynamics due to its multi-scale interactions. Fully resolving large-scale
turbulence through direct numerical simulation (DNS) is computationally
prohibitive, motivating data-driven machine learning alternatives. In this
work, we propose EddyFormer, a Transformer-based spectral-element (SEM)
architecture for large-scale turbulence simulation that combines the accuracy
of spectral methods with the scalability of the attention mechanism. We
introduce an SEM tokenization that decomposes the flow into grid-scale and
subgrid-scale components, enabling capture of both local and global features.
We create a new three-dimensional isotropic turbulence dataset and train
EddyFormer to achieves DNS-level accuracy at 256^3 resolution, providing a 30x
speedup over DNS. When applied to unseen domains up to 4x larger than in
training, EddyFormer preserves accuracy on physics-invariant metrics-energy
spectra, correlation functions, and structure functions-showing domain
generalization. On The Well benchmark suite of diverse turbulent flows,
EddyFormer resolves cases where prior ML models fail to converge, accurately
reproducing complex dynamics across a wide range of physical conditions.

*Arpita Kundu,Joyita Chakraborty,Anindita Desarkar,Aritra Sen,Srushti Anil Patil,Vishwanathan Raman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified subtitle annotation framework (V-SAT) that uses LLMs, VLMs, image processing, and ASR to automatically detect and correct a wide range of subtitle quality issues using audio-visual context, reducing post-editing effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subtitles on streaming platforms are essential but current methods (speech transcription or OCR) struggle with synchronization, harmful/inaccurate text, formatting inconsistencies, reading-speed issues, and adapting to dynamic audiovisual context. Post-editing is labor-intensive, motivating a unified, automated solution.

Method: V-SAT integrates Large Language Models, Vision-Language Models, image processing, and automatic speech recognition to jointly analyze audio and video cues for a broad range of subtitle quality issues. It addresses both language-mode and image-mode problems, employing human-in-the-loop validation to ensure high-quality results, and reporting quantitative improvements (e.g., SUBER and F1 metrics).

Result: Subtitle quality improves significantly: SUBER score drops from 9.6 to 3.54 after correcting language-mode issues; image-mode issues achieve ~0.80 F1-score. Human-in-the-loop validation confirms robust outputs; claimed as the first comprehensive solution for robust subtitle annotation.

Conclusion: The paper presents a unified, multimodal framework that tackles diverse subtitle quality issues end-to-end, reducing manual post-editing and enabling robust, accurate subtitles across content.

Abstract: The surge of audiovisual content on streaming platforms and social media has
heightened the demand for accurate and accessible subtitles. However, existing
subtitle generation methods primarily speech-based transcription or OCR-based
extraction suffer from several shortcomings, including poor synchronization,
incorrect or harmful text, inconsistent formatting, inappropriate reading
speeds, and the inability to adapt to dynamic audio-visual contexts. Current
approaches often address isolated issues, leaving post-editing as a
labor-intensive and time-consuming process. In this paper, we introduce V-SAT
(Video Subtitle Annotation Tool), a unified framework that automatically
detects and corrects a wide range of subtitle quality issues. By combining
Large Language Models(LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Image Processing,
and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), V-SAT leverages contextual cues from
both audio and video. Subtitle quality improved, with the SUBER score reduced
from 9.6 to 3.54 after resolving all language mode issues and F1-scores of
~0.80 for image mode issues. Human-in-the-loop validation ensures high-quality
results, providing the first comprehensive solution for robust subtitle
annotation.

*Alexander Bakarsky,Dimitar I. Dimitrov,Maximilian Baader,Martin Vechev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPEAR++ makes gradient inversion attacks on linear layers with ReLU practical for larger batch sizes using sparse dictionary learning, preserving robustness to DP noise and FedAvg.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess privacy risks in federated learning and address SPEAR's prohibitive runtime by enabling a tractable attack that scales to bigger batches.

Method: Apply Sparsely-Used Dictionary Learning techniques to reformulate gradient inversion for linear-ReLU networks, enabling efficient recovery.

Result: Attack becomes scalable; can handle 10x larger batch sizes and retains robustness to DP noise and FedAvg aggregation.

Conclusion: SPEAR++ demonstrates a more practical gradient inversion threat under standard privacy defenses, highlighting ongoing privacy risks in FL.

Abstract: Federated Learning has seen an increased deployment in real-world scenarios
recently, as it enables the distributed training of machine learning models
without explicit data sharing between individual clients. Yet, the introduction
of the so-called gradient inversion attacks has fundamentally challenged its
privacy-preserving properties. Unfortunately, as these attacks mostly rely on
direct data optimization without any formal guarantees, the vulnerability of
real-world systems remains in dispute and requires tedious testing for each new
federated deployment. To overcome these issues, recently the SPEAR attack was
introduced, which is based on a theoretical analysis of the gradients of linear
layers with ReLU activations. While SPEAR is an important theoretical
breakthrough, the attack's practicality was severely limited by its exponential
runtime in the batch size b. In this work, we fill this gap by applying
State-of-the-Art techniques from Sparsely-Used Dictionary Learning to make the
problem of gradient inversion on linear layers with ReLU activations tractable.
Our experiments demonstrate that our new attack, SPEAR++, retains all desirable
properties of SPEAR, such as robustness to DP noise and FedAvg aggregation,
while being applicable to 10x bigger batch sizes.

### [210] [Unlocking Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Dynamics through Physics-Guided Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24216)
*Fan Xu,Hao Wu,Kun Wang,Nan Wang,Qingsong Wen,Xian Wu,Wei Gong,Xibin Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPARK proposes physics-guided data augmentation for dynamical systems: a reconstruction autoencoder builds a physics-rich discrete state dictionary, enabling principled latent-space interpolation; augmented representations feed a Fourier-enhanced Graph ODE for robust, long-horizon prediction, yielding strong gains in data-scarce and out-of-distribution scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional numerical methods are computationally costly, and modern data-driven models struggle with limited data and distribution shifts. Incorporating physics via data augmentation aims to enrich training samples and stabilize long-term predictions.

Method: Train a reconstruction autoencoder to embed physical parameters into a discrete physics-rich state dictionary. Use this dictionary to interpolate new, physically plausible samples in the latent space. For prediction, integrate the augmented representations with a Fourier-enhanced Graph ODE to capture long-range temporal dependencies while leveraging the enriched data distribution.

Result: Extensive experiments show SPARK outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in out-of-distribution and data-scarce regimes, demonstrating the efficacy of physics-guided augmentation.

Conclusion: Physics-guided augmentation via SPARK is an effective paradigm for robust, data-efficient dynamical modeling, enabling improved generalization and long-horizon predictions.

Abstract: In dynamical system modeling, traditional numerical methods are limited by
high computational costs, while modern data-driven approaches struggle with
data scarcity and distribution shifts. To address these fundamental
limitations, we first propose SPARK, a physics-guided quantitative augmentation
plugin. Specifically, SPARK utilizes a reconstruction autoencoder to integrate
physical parameters into a physics-rich discrete state dictionary. This state
dictionary then acts as a structured dictionary of physical states, enabling
the creation of new, physically-plausible training samples via principled
interpolation in the latent space. Further, for downstream prediction, these
augmented representations are seamlessly integrated with a Fourier-enhanced
Graph ODE, a combination designed to robustly model the enriched data
distribution while capturing long-term temporal dependencies. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that SPARK significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in challenging
out-of-distribution scenarios and data-scarce regimes, proving the efficacy of
our physics-guided augmentation paradigm.

*Alisher Turubayev,Anna Shopova,Fabian Lange,Mahmut Kamalak,Paul Mattes,Victoria Ayvasky,Bert Arnrich,Bjarne Pfitzner,Robin P. van de Water*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an extensible benchmark to compare ICU vital-sign imputation methods and guide ML predictions in healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data quality and missingness in ICU vital signs hinder machine learning-based predictions; ad-hoc imputation (e.g., zero fill) can degrade performance, necessitating systematic evaluation of imputation strategies.

Method: Introduces a reusable benchmark framework encompassing 15 imputation methods and 4 amputation methods, designed for benchmarking on major ICU datasets to enable fair comparisons.

Result: The abstract presents the benchmark and its intended use but does not report empirical results; it outlines how it will allow researchers to compare methods.

Conclusion: A standardized benchmark should help identify the most accurate imputation techniques and accelerate the adoption of ML models in clinical practice.

Abstract: As more Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data becomes available, the interest in
developing clinical prediction models to improve healthcare protocols
increases. However, the lack of data quality still hinders clinical prediction
using Machine Learning (ML). Many vital sign measurements, such as heart rate,
contain sizeable missing segments, leaving gaps in the data that could
negatively impact prediction performance. Previous works have introduced
numerous time-series imputation techniques. Nevertheless, more comprehensive
work is needed to compare a representative set of methods for imputing ICU
vital signs and determine the best practice. In reality, ad-hoc imputation
techniques that could decrease prediction accuracy, like zero imputation, are
still used. In this work, we compare established imputation techniques to guide
researchers in improving the performance of clinical prediction models by
selecting the most accurate imputation technique. We introduce an extensible
and reusable benchmark with currently 15 imputation and 4 amputation methods,
created for benchmarking on major ICU datasets. We hope to provide a
comparative basis and facilitate further ML development to bring more models
into clinical practice.

### [212] [PRIVET: Privacy Metric Based on Extreme Value Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24233)
*Antoine Szatkownik,Aur√©lien Decelle,Beatriz Seoane,Nicolas Bereux,L√©o Planche,Guillaume Charpiat,Burak Yelmen,Flora Jay,Cyril Furtlehner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRIVET provides per-sample privacy leakage scores using extreme value statistics on nearest-neighbor distances, enabling interpretable, sample-level detection of memorization across data modalities; it outperforms global-risk criteria and uncovers current CV embedding limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing privacy evaluation for synthetic data relies on global metrics that lack interpretability and sample-level insight, hindering deployment. There is a need for a rigorous, modality-agnostic method to assess privacy risk at the sample level.

Method: Apply extreme value statistics to NN distances to assign an individual privacy leak score to each synthetic sample. Modality-agnostic approach, enabling dataset-level and sample-level outputs. Evaluated across high-dimensional data, small sample sizes (e.g., genetic data), and underfitting regimes; comparisons with existing approaches under controlled settings.

Result: PRIVET reliably detects memorization and privacy leakage across diverse modalities; provides both dataset-level and sample-level assessments with qualitative and quantitative outputs; reveals that many computer-vision embeddings produce distances that are not perceptually meaningful for near-duplicate detection.

Conclusion: Sample-level privacy evaluation is feasible and useful for real-world deployment of synthetic data; PRIVET offers a generic, interpretable, and robust tool, while also highlighting limitations of current CV embeddings for privacy assessment.

Abstract: Deep generative models are often trained on sensitive data, such as genetic
sequences, health data, or more broadly, any copyrighted, licensed or protected
content. This raises critical concerns around privacy-preserving synthetic
data, and more specifically around privacy leakage, an issue closely tied to
overfitting. Existing methods almost exclusively rely on global criteria to
estimate the risk of privacy failure associated to a model, offering only
quantitative non interpretable insights. The absence of rigorous evaluation
methods for data privacy at the sample-level may hinder the practical
deployment of synthetic data in real-world applications. Using extreme value
statistics on nearest-neighbor distances, we propose PRIVET, a generic
sample-based, modality-agnostic algorithm that assigns an individual privacy
leak score to each synthetic sample. We empirically demonstrate that PRIVET
reliably detects instances of memorization and privacy leakage across diverse
data modalities, including settings with very high dimensionality, limited
sample sizes such as genetic data and even under underfitting regimes. We
compare our method to existing approaches under controlled settings and show
its advantage in providing both dataset level and sample level assessments
through qualitative and quantitative outputs. Additionally, our analysis
reveals limitations in existing computer vision embeddings to yield
perceptually meaningful distances when identifying near-duplicate samples.

*Ludovic Schwartz,Hamish Flynn,Gergely Neu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SOIDS achieves optimal worst-case regret in both data-rich and data-poor regimes for sparse linear bandits, without Bayesian assumptions, by using a time-dependent learning rate; theory and experiments support its performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for algorithms that adaptively achieve optimal worst-case regret across both data-rich and data-poor regimes in high-dimensional online decision problems, without relying on Bayesian priors.

Method: Introduce Sparse Optimistic Information Directed Sampling (SOIDS) with a time-dependent learning rate and novel analysis; extends IDS to worst-case, sparse setting to balance information and regret.

Result: SOIDS provably attains optimal worst-case regret in both regimes; provides the first such guarantee in the non-Bayesian setting; empirical experiments show good performance.

Conclusion: SOIDS unifies optimal worst-case guarantees across data-rich and data-poor regimes without Bayesian assumptions, extending IDS and proving practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Many high-dimensional online decision-making problems can be modeled as
stochastic sparse linear bandits. Most existing algorithms are designed to
achieve optimal worst-case regret in either the data-rich regime, where
polynomial dependence on the ambient dimension is unavoidable, or the data-poor
regime, where dimension-independence is possible at the cost of worse
dependence on the number of rounds. In contrast, the sparse Information
Directed Sampling (IDS) algorithm satisfies a Bayesian regret bound that has
the optimal rate in both regimes simultaneously. In this work, we explore the
use of Sparse Optimistic Information Directed Sampling (SOIDS) to achieve the
same adaptivity in the worst-case setting, without Bayesian assumptions.
Through a novel analysis that enables the use of a time-dependent learning
rate, we show that SOIDS can optimally balance information and regret. Our
results extend the theoretical guarantees of IDS, providing the first algorithm
that simultaneously achieves optimal worst-case regret in both the data-rich
and data-poor regimes. We empirically demonstrate the good performance of
SOIDS.

### [214] [PaTaRM: Bridging Pairwise and Pointwise Signals via Preference-Aware Task-Adaptive Reward Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24235)
*Ai Jian,Jingqing Ruan,Xing Ma,Dailin Li,QianLin Zhou,Ke Zeng,Xunliang Cai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PaTaRM unifies preference-aware reward modeling with dynamic rubric adaptation to turn pairwise preferences into robust point-wise training signals and generate task-adaptive evaluation criteria, enabling efficient, generalizable, and interpretable RLHF reward models; shows improvements on benchmarks and code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current reward models for RLHF face a mismatch between pairwise labels and point-wise inferences, plus high annotation costs and limited adaptability. There is a need for an interpretable, flexible reward signal that leverages relative preferences to produce robust training signals and adaptable evaluation criteria.

Method: Introduce PaTaRM which combines a Preference-Aware Reward (PAR) mechanism with a dynamic rubric adaptation system. It uses relative preferences from pairwise data to create robust point-wise training signals without explicit point-wise labels, and a task-adaptive rubric system to generate criteria for global task consistency and instance-specific reasoning.

Result: Empirical results show an average relative improvement of 4.7% on RewardBench and RMBench across Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-14B models. Downstream RLHF performance improves by an average of 13.6% on IFEval and InFoBench. Code is released at https://github.com/JaneEyre0530/PaTaRM.

Conclusion: PaTaRM delivers efficient, generalizable, and interpretable reward modeling for RLHF, demonstrating robustness and improved downstream RLHF performance, with a flexible framework that reduces labeling burdens and supports task-adaptive evaluation.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are central to reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF), providing the critical supervision signals that align large language
models (LLMs) with human preferences. While generative reward models (GRMs)
offer greater interpretability than traditional scalar RMs, current training
paradigms remain limited. Pair-wise methods rely on binary good-versus-bad
labels, which cause mismatches for point-wise inference and necessitate complex
pairing strategies for effective application in RLHF. On the other hand,
point-wise methods require more elaborate absolute labeling with rubric-driven
criteria, resulting in poor adaptability and high annotation costs. In this
work, we propose the Preference-Aware Task-Adaptive Reward Model (PaTaRM), a
unified framework that integrates a preference-aware reward (PAR) mechanism
with dynamic rubric adaptation. PaTaRM leverages relative preference
information from pairwise data to construct robust point-wise training signals,
eliminating the need for explicit point-wise labels. Simultaneously, it employs
a task-adaptive rubric system that flexibly generates evaluation criteria for
both global task consistency and instance-specific fine-grained reasoning. This
design enables efficient, generalizable, and interpretable reward modeling for
RLHF. Extensive experiments show that PaTaRM achieves an average relative
improvement of 4.7% on RewardBench and RMBench across Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-14B
models. Furthermore, PaTaRM boosts downstream RLHF performance, with an average
improvement of 13.6% across IFEval and InFoBench benchmarks, confirming its
effectiveness and robustness. Our code is available at

### [215] [Temporal Knowledge Graph Hyperedge Forecasting: Exploring Entity-to-Category Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24240)
*Edward Markai,Sina Molavipour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends TLogic with category-aware rules for Temporal Knowledge Graphs, enabling explainable predictions; uses LLM-based category generation when categories are unknown; studies aggregation methods for ranking retrieved entities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the black-box nature of embedding-based temporal KG methods by providing explainable, rule-based predictions; incorporate entity categories to constrain rule applicability; handle missing category information with data-driven categorization; assess how score aggregation affects category prediction.

Method: Introduce a new rule format that embeds entity category; adopt a data-driven method (LLM-based) to generate categories when graph lacks them; evaluate different aggregation methods for combining scores of retrieved entities during category prediction.

Result: Achieves high accuracy together with explainable predictions, demonstrating the viability of the category-aware rule extension; provides transparency for end-users to evaluate rules.

Conclusion: Category-aware rules and LLM-generated categories are viable for temporal KG reasoning, improving interpretability without sacrificing accuracy; the chosen aggregation method for scores influences category prediction and is an important design choice.

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a powerful way of not only modeling
static relationships between entities but also the dynamics of how relations
evolve over time. As these informational structures can be used to store
information from a real-world setting, such as a news flow, predicting future
graph components to a certain extent equates predicting real-world events. Most
of the research in this field focuses on embedding-based methods, often
leveraging convolutional neural net architectures. These solutions act as black
boxes, limiting insight. In this paper, we explore an extension to an
established rule-based framework, TLogic, that yields a high accuracy in
combination with explainable predictions. This offers transparency and allows
the end-user to critically evaluate the rules applied at the end of the
prediction stage. The new rule format incorporates entity category as a key
component with the purpose of limiting rule application only to relevant
entities. When categories are unknown for building the graph, we propose a
data-driven method to generate them with an LLM-based approach. Additionally,
we investigate the choice of aggregation method for scores of retrieved
entities when performing category prediction.

### [216] [SALS: Sparse Attention in Latent Space for KV cache Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24273)
*Junlin Mu,Hantao Huang,Jihang Zhang,Minghui Yu,Tao Wang,Yidong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SALS reduces KV cache size and speeds up attention for long-context LLMs by projecting KV caches into a latent space and performing RoPE-free sparse QK interactions, avoiding full KV reconstruction while maintaining accuracy; achieves substantial compression and speedups across models and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling extended-context inference is bottlenecked by large KV caches and high memory bandwidth. Low-rank KV cache hints exist, but RoPE-based models complicate compression; naive low-rank methods degrade accuracy. The goal is efficient KV compression without reconstructing the full cache.

Method: SALS projects the KV cache into a compact latent space via low-rank projection and performs sparse token selection using RoPE-free query-key interactions in this space. Only a subset of tokens needed for accurate attention are reconstructed, enabling sparse attention in latent space instead of full KV-cache expansion.

Result: Achieves 6.4√ó KV-cache compression and 5.7√ó speed-up in the attention operator vs FlashAttention2 on 4K sequences. End-to-end throughput improves 1.4√ó and 4.5√ó compared to GPT-fast on 4K and 32K sequences, respectively. Validated on LLaMA2-7b-chat and Mistral-7b; scalable to RULER-128k with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct. Maintains competitive accuracy, achieving SOTA performance.

Conclusion: SALS enables efficient long-context inference by compressing KV caches in latent space with RoPE-free sparse QK, delivering substantial memory bandwidth reductions and speedups while preserving accuracy, and demonstrating strong scalability across models and long sequences.

Abstract: Large Language Models capable of handling extended contexts are in high
demand, yet their inference remains challenging due to substantial Key-Value
cache size and high memory bandwidth requirements. Previous research has
demonstrated that KV cache exhibits low-rank characteristics within the hidden
dimension, suggesting the potential for effective compression. However, due to
the widely adopted Rotary Position Embedding mechanism in modern LLMs, naive
low-rank compression suffers severe accuracy degradation or creates a new speed
bottleneck, as the low-rank cache must first be reconstructed in order to apply
RoPE. In this paper, we introduce two key insights: first, the application of
RoPE to the key vectors increases their variance, which in turn results in a
higher rank; second, after the key vectors are transformed into the latent
space, they largely maintain their representation across most layers. Based on
these insights, we propose the Sparse Attention in Latent Space framework. SALS
projects the KV cache into a compact latent space via low-rank projection, and
performs sparse token selection using RoPE-free query-key interactions in this
space. By reconstructing only a small subset of important tokens, it avoids the
overhead of full KV cache reconstruction. We comprehensively evaluate SALS on
various tasks using two large-scale models: LLaMA2-7b-chat and Mistral-7b, and
additionally verify its scalability on the RULER-128k benchmark with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct. Experimental results demonstrate that SALS achieves SOTA
performance by maintaining competitive accuracy. Under different settings, SALS
achieves 6.4-fold KV cache compression and 5.7-fold speed-up in the attention
operator compared to FlashAttention2 on the 4K sequence. For the end-to-end
throughput performance, we achieves 1.4-fold and 4.5-fold improvement compared
to GPT-fast on 4k and 32K sequences, respectively.

### [217] [EDC: Equation Discovery for Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24310)
*Guus Toussaint,Arno Knobbe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new ED-based binary classifier (EDC) learns analytic decision-boundary functions using a modest, configurable grammar; it shows strong performance among ED-based methods and competitive overall accuracy; supports domain-specific expressions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend equation-discovery (ED) methods to binary classification to produce concise, interpretable decision boundaries, and to simultaneously recover structure and parameters.

Method: Introduce EDC framework that searches for analytical functions forming the decision boundary via a grammar of additive terms (linear, quadratic, exponential) and products of features to capture nonlinearities (including XOR-like patterns); learn both the structure and numerical parameters; conduct extensive experiments on artificial and real datasets; grammar complexity is configurable and adaptable to domain knowledge.

Result: EDC outperforms current state-of-the-art ED-based classification methods for binary tasks and achieves performance comparable to the overall state of the art in binary classification; demonstrates recovery of both the target equation structure and its parameters; enables flexible decision boundaries without promoting overfitting due to a moderately expressive grammar.

Conclusion: EDC provides a viable, interpretable ED-based classifier with a tunable grammar, balancing expressiveness and generalization; domain-specific expressions can be integrated into the pattern language to suit particular problems; shows promise for discovering interpretable boundary equations in classification.

Abstract: Equation Discovery techniques have shown considerable success in regression
tasks, where they are used to discover concise and interpretable models
(\textit{Symbolic Regression}). In this paper, we propose a new ED-based binary
classification framework. Our proposed method EDC finds analytical functions of
manageable size that specify the location and shape of the decision boundary.
In extensive experiments on artificial and real-life data, we demonstrate how
EDC is able to discover both the structure of the target equation as well as
the value of its parameters, outperforming the current state-of-the-art
ED-based classification methods in binary classification and achieving
performance comparable to the state of the art in binary classification. We
suggest a grammar of modest complexity that appears to work well on the tested
datasets but argue that the exact grammar -- and thus the complexity of the
models -- is configurable, and especially domain-specific expressions can be
included in the pattern language, where that is required. The presented grammar
consists of a series of summands (additive terms) that include linear,
quadratic and exponential terms, as well as products of two features (producing
hyperbolic curves ideal for capturing XOR-like dependencies). The experiments
demonstrate that this grammar allows fairly flexible decision boundaries while
not so rich to cause overfitting.

### [218] [Transformers can do Bayesian Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24318)
*Prajit Bhaskaran,Tom Viering*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cluster-PFN uses a Transformer-based Prior-Data Fitted Network to perform unsupervised Bayesian clustering, estimating both the number of clusters and assignments. Trained on synthetic data from a finite Gaussian Mixture Model prior, it handles missing data, outperforms traditional model selection (AIC/BIC) and is competitive with Variational Inference while being much faster. It remains robust to high missingness and scales to complex priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian clustering accounts for uncertainty but is computationally heavy, especially at scale; real-world data often contain missing values and simple imputation ignores associated uncertainty, yielding suboptimal results.

Method: Extend Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) with a Transformer-based architecture to unsupervised Bayesian clustering (Cluster-PFN). Train entirely on synthetic data generated from a finite Gaussian Mixture Model prior, teaching the model to infer the posterior over the number of clusters and cluster assignments. The framework accommodates missing data within the prior, enabling learning under incomplete observations.

Result: Cluster-PFN estimates the posterior over the number of clusters more accurately than handcrafted model-selection criteria (AIC, BIC) and achieves clustering quality competitive with Variational Inference, while being orders of magnitude faster. It can be trained on complex priors that include missing data and outperforms imputation-based baselines on real-world genomic datasets with high missingness.

Conclusion: Cluster-PFN provides scalable and flexible Bayesian clustering, capable of handling missing data via learned priors and delivering fast, accurate inference for both the number of clusters and cluster assignments in real-world, high-m missingness settings.

Abstract: Bayesian clustering accounts for uncertainty but is computationally demanding
at scale. Furthermore, real-world datasets often contain missing values, and
simple imputation ignores the associated uncertainty, resulting in suboptimal
results. We present Cluster-PFN, a Transformer-based model that extends
Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) to unsupervised Bayesian clustering. Trained
entirely on synthetic datasets generated from a finite Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) prior, Cluster-PFN learns to estimate the posterior distribution over
both the number of clusters and the cluster assignments. Our method estimates
the number of clusters more accurately than handcrafted model selection
procedures such as AIC, BIC and Variational Inference (VI), and achieves
clustering quality competitive with VI while being orders of magnitude faster.
Cluster-PFN can be trained on complex priors that include missing data,
outperforming imputation-based baselines on real-world genomic datasets, at
high missingness. These results show that the Cluster-PFN can provide scalable
and flexible Bayesian clustering.

*Suman Sanyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PeL decouples perception from decision, learning task-agnostic perceptual representations with invariants, and provides metrics to certify perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robust, task-agnostic perception: learn perceptual interfaces that resist nuisances, preserve informative content, and maintain controlled geometry, independently of downstream tasks.

Method: Formally separate perception and decision; define perceptual properties independent of objectives or reparameterizations; prove that invariant-preserving PeL updates are orthogonal to Bayes task-risk gradients; introduce a suite of task-agnostic metrics to certify perceptual quality.

Result: Theoretical guarantees: formal separation of perception and decision, invariant properties, and an orthogonality result; practical toolkit: a suite of task-agnostic metrics to certify perceptual quality.

Conclusion: PeL provides a principled separation of perception and decision along with a metric-based toolkit to certify perceptual quality, enabling stable, informative, and geometrically controlled perceptual representations that are decoupled from downstream tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Perception Learning (PeL), a paradigm that optimizes an agent's
sensory interface $f_\phi:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Z}$ using task-agnostic
signals, decoupled from downstream decision learning
$g_\theta:\mathcal{Z}\to\mathcal{Y}$. PeL directly targets label-free
perceptual properties, such as stability to nuisances, informativeness without
collapse, and controlled geometry, assessed via objective
representation-invariant metrics. We formalize the separation of perception and
decision, define perceptual properties independent of objectives or
reparameterizations, and prove that PeL updates preserving sufficient
invariants are orthogonal to Bayes task-risk gradients. Additionally, we
provide a suite of task-agnostic evaluation metrics to certify perceptual
quality.

*Maria Gabriela Valeriano,David Kohan Marzag√£o,Alfredo Montelongo,Carlos Roberto Veiga Kiffer,Natan Katz,Ana Carolina Lorena*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-step data-centric approach improves ML reliability in healthcare by first filtering problematic training instances using Instance Hardness (IH) and then rejecting low-confidence predictions at inference, balancing accuracy and coverage across three real-world datasets and baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML models in high-stakes domains (e.g., healthcare) must account for uncertainty and avoid making unreliable predictions; data quality and selective prediction are key to deploying trustworthy systems.

Method: Step 1: filter problematic instances during training using Instance Hardness to refine the dataset. Step 2: apply a confidence-based rejection mechanism during inference to retain only reliable predictions. Baselines include using influence values for filtering and uncertainty for rejection; evaluated on three real healthcare datasets.

Result: IH-based filtering plus confidence-based rejection improves model reliability and predictive performance while maintaining a high proportion of accepted instances and a manageable rejection rate, outperforming the chosen baselines.

Conclusion: A practical data-centric strategy for safety-critical ML: combining training-time IH filtering with inference-time confidence-based rejection yields robust, deployable models without excessively sacrificing coverage.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are widely used in high-stakes domains such as
healthcare, where the reliability of predictions is critical. However, these
models often fail to account for uncertainty, providing predictions even with
low confidence. This work proposes a novel two-step data-centric approach to
enhance the performance of ML models by improving data quality and filtering
low-confidence predictions. The first step involves leveraging Instance
Hardness (IH) to filter problematic instances during training, thereby refining
the dataset. The second step introduces a confidence-based rejection mechanism
during inference, ensuring that only reliable predictions are retained. We
evaluate our approach using three real-world healthcare datasets, demonstrating
its effectiveness at improving model reliability while balancing predictive
performance and rejection rate. Additionally, we use alternative criteria -
influence values for filtering and uncertainty for rejection - as baselines to
evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that
integrating IH filtering with confidence-based rejection effectively enhances
model performance while preserving a large proportion of instances. This
approach provides a practical method for deploying ML systems in
safety-critical applications.

*Yuanyuan Wu,Zhenlin Qin,Zhenliang Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework (RPU) evaluates synthetic trip data on Representativeness, Privacy, and Utility across record, group, and population levels; evaluated on 12 generation methods; CTGAN offers the best balanced trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is fragmentation in how synthetic data quality is assessed for smart card/public transport data. A unified framework is needed to assess representativeness, privacy risks, and practical utility across hierarchical levels.

Method: Introduce the RPU framework comprising metrics for similarity (representativeness), disclosure risk (privacy), and utility (practical usefulness) across three hierarchical levels (record, group, population). Apply the framework to 12 generation methods (statistical, deep generative networks, privacy-enhanced variants) and benchmark their performance.

Result: Synthetic data do not inherently guarantee privacy; no single method dominates across tasks or levels. Trade-offs between privacy and representativeness/utility are evident. CTGAN provides the most balanced trade-off and is recommended for practical use.

Conclusion: The RPU framework offers a systematic, reproducible basis for comparing synthetic data generation techniques and guiding method selection for public transport applications.

Abstract: Synthetic data offers a promising solution to the privacy and accessibility
challenges of using smart card data in public transport research. Despite rapid
progress in generative modeling, there is limited attention to comprehensive
evaluation, leaving unclear how reliable, safe, and useful synthetic data truly
are. Existing evaluations remain fragmented, typically limited to
population-level representativeness or record-level privacy, without
considering group-level variations or task-specific utility. To address this
gap, we propose a Representativeness-Privacy-Utility (RPU) framework that
systematically evaluates synthetic trip data across three complementary
dimensions and three hierarchical levels (record, group, population). The
framework integrates a consistent set of metrics to quantify similarity,
disclosure risk, and practical usefulness, enabling transparent and balanced
assessment of synthetic data quality. We apply the framework to benchmark
twelve representative generation methods, spanning conventional statistical
models, deep generative networks, and privacy-enhanced variants. Results show
that synthetic data do not inherently guarantee privacy and there is no
"one-size-fits-all" model, the trade-off between privacy and
representativeness/utility is obvious. Conditional Tabular generative
adversarial network (CTGAN) provide the most balanced trade-off and is
suggested for practical applications. The RPU framework provides a systematic
and reproducible basis for researchers and practitioners to compare synthetic
data generation techniques and select appropriate methods in public transport
applications.

### [222] [APEX: Approximate-but-exhaustive search for ultra-large combinatorial synthesis libraries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24380)
*Aryan Pedawi,Jordi Silvestre-Ryan,Bradley Worley,Darren J Hsu,Kushal S Shah,Elias Stehle,Jingrong Zhang,Izhar Wallach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: APEX is an approximate-but-exhaustive search protocol for make-on-demand combinatorial libraries (CSLs) that enables fast, near-top-k retrieval under a constrained computational budget by using a neural-network surrogate tailored to CSL structure. It allows full enumeration on a consumer GPU in under a minute and retrieves approximate top-k sets exactly, demonstrated on a benchmark CSL of >10M compounds with docking scores and RDKit properties, showing strong retrieval accuracy and runtime versus alternatives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large make-on-demand CSLs (e.g., Enamine REAL) have tens of billions of compounds, making full screening infeasible. Virtual screening must identify top candidates under fixed computational budgets and often needs to adapt as constraints/objectives change, with little opportunity for amortization. There is a need for fast, accurate top-k retrieval that exploits CSL structure.

Method: Train a neural network surrogate that leverages the structure of CSLs to predict objectives and constraints. Use this surrogate to perform near-exhaustive search that can enumerate the CSL on a consumer GPU in under a minute, enabling exact retrieval of approximate top-k compounds under given constraints. Build a benchmark CSL containing over 10 million compounds annotated with docking scores for five targets and RDKit physico-chemical properties to quantify ground-truth top-k and compare retrievals.

Result: APEX achieves consistently strong retrieval accuracy and fast runtime, outperforming alternative methods in identifying near-top-k compounds under various constraints on the benchmark CSL.

Conclusion: APEX provides an effective, fast, approximate-exhaustive search strategy for enormous CSLs, enabling rapid, accurate retrieval of high-scoring compounds under changing objectives and constraints; the accompanying benchmark enables robust evaluation of virtual screening algorithms for CSLs.

Abstract: Make-on-demand combinatorial synthesis libraries (CSLs) like Enamine REAL
have significantly enabled drug discovery efforts. However, their large size
presents a challenge for virtual screening, where the goal is to identify the
top compounds in a library according to a computational objective (e.g.,
optimizing docking score) subject to computational constraints under a limited
computational budget. For current library sizes -- numbering in the tens of
billions of compounds -- and scoring functions of interest, a routine virtual
screening campaign may be limited to scoring fewer than 0.1% of the available
compounds, leaving potentially many high scoring compounds undiscovered.
Furthermore, as constraints (and sometimes objectives) change during the course
of a virtual screening campaign, existing virtual screening algorithms
typically offer little room for amortization. We propose the
approximate-but-exhaustive search protocol for CSLs, or APEX. APEX utilizes a
neural network surrogate that exploits the structure of CSLs in the prediction
of objectives and constraints to make full enumeration on a consumer GPU
possible in under a minute, allowing for exact retrieval of approximate top-$k$
sets. To demonstrate APEX's capabilities, we develop a benchmark CSL comprised
of more than 10 million compounds, all of which have been annotated with their
docking scores on five medically relevant targets along with physicohemical
properties measured with RDKit such that, for any objective and set of
constraints, the ground truth top-$k$ compounds can be identified and compared
against the retrievals from any virtual screening algorithm. We show APEX's
consistently strong performance both in retrieval accuracy and runtime compared
to alternative methods.

*Seyed Mahdi Basiri Azad,Joschka Boedecker*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple offline-to-online RL method that initializes the value function with a few successful demonstrations and then refines it through online learning, boosting sample efficiency in sparse rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-reward environments yield slow learning; leveraging a small number of demonstrations can provide a valuable prior to guide exploration and bootstrap value estimates.

Method: Compute initial value estimates from offline demonstrations and use them as targets to initialize the value function. After this offline bootstrap, continue with standard online RL to refine these estimates through interaction, forming a hybrid offline-to-online learning paradigm.

Result: Experiments on benchmark tasks show faster convergence and improved sample efficiency, outperforming standard baselines even when demonstrations are minimal or suboptimal.

Conclusion: A simple offline-to-online strategy can effectively mitigate exploration challenges in sparse-reward RL by providing a strong initial prior from demonstrations and refining it online, with robust performance under limited demonstration data.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in sparse-reward environments remains a
significant challenge due to the lack of informative feedback. We propose a
simple yet effective method that uses a small number of successful
demonstrations to initialize the value function of an RL agent. By precomputing
value estimates from offline demonstrations and using them as targets for early
learning, our approach provides the agent with a useful prior over promising
actions. The agent then refines these estimates through standard online
interaction. This hybrid offline-to-online paradigm significantly reduces the
exploration burden and improves sample efficiency in sparse-reward settings.
Experiments on benchmark tasks demonstrate that our method accelerates
convergence and outperforms standard baselines, even with minimal or suboptimal
demonstration data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically compare multiple machine learning survival analysis models using a large censored cancer dataset and assess predictive performance, interpretability, and clinical relevance.

Method: Dataset of ~45,000 colorectal cancer patients from Hospital-Based Cancer Registries of S√£o Paulo. Compared six models: Random Survival Forest (RSF), Gradient Boosting for Survival Analysis (GBSA), Survival SVM (SSVM), XGBoost-Cox (XGB-Cox), XGBoost-AFT (XGB-AFT), and LightGBM (LGBM).

Result: XGB-AFT achieved the best performance (C-Index 0.7618; IPCW 0.7532); GBSA and RSF also performed well. Overall, six MLSA models demonstrated predictive capability on censored survival data, with improvements over some traditional approaches and valuable interpretability analyses.

Conclusion: MLSAs show potential to improve survival prediction and support decision making in colorectal cancer, highlighting their applicability and interpretability in clinical contexts.

Abstract: This study presents a comparative methodological analysis of six machine

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A curated, reproducible sepsis benchmark from MIMIC-IV (MIMIC-Sepsis) with 35k ICU patients, time-aligned clinical and treatment data, a transparent preprocessing pipeline based on Sepsis-3, and benchmark tasks (early mortality, length of stay, shock onset). Including treatments improves predictive performance, especially for Transformer models; aims to standardize evaluation of sepsis trajectory modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sepsis remains a major ICU mortality driver and current studies rely on outdated data, opaque preprocessing, and limited treatment coverage. A reproducible, treatment-inclusive benchmark is needed to fairly evaluate predictive models of sepsis trajectories.

Method: Construct a large, standardized sepsis cohort from MIMIC-IV aligned in time with clinical variables and treatments (vasopressors, fluids, ventilation, antibiotics). Apply Sepsis-3 criteria for cohort definition, implement structured imputation and a transparent preprocessing pipeline, and release benchmark tasks for early mortality, length of stay, and shock onset classification.

Result: Inclusion of treatment variables substantially improves model performance, with Transformer-based architectures gaining notable benefits.

Conclusion: MIMIC-Sepsis provides a robust, reproducible platform for evaluating predictive and sequential models in critical care, enabling standardized benchmarking and fair comparison across methods.

Abstract: Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs), yet
existing research often relies on outdated datasets, non-reproducible
preprocessing pipelines, and limited coverage of clinical interventions. We
introduce MIMIC-Sepsis, a curated cohort and benchmark framework derived from
the MIMIC-IV database, designed to support reproducible modeling of sepsis
trajectories. Our cohort includes 35,239 ICU patients with time-aligned
clinical variables and standardized treatment data, including vasopressors,
fluids, mechanical ventilation and antibiotics. We describe a transparent
preprocessing pipeline-based on Sepsis-3 criteria, structured imputation
strategies, and treatment inclusion-and release it alongside benchmark tasks
focused on early mortality prediction, length-of-stay estimation, and shock
onset classification. Empirical results demonstrate that incorporating
treatment variables substantially improves model performance, particularly for
Transformer-based architectures. MIMIC-Sepsis serves as a robust platform for
evaluating predictive and sequential models in critical care research.

### [226] [LoRA-DA: Data-Aware Initialization for Low-Rank Adaptation via Asymptotic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24561)
*Qingyue Zhang,Chang Chu,Tianren Peng,Qi Li,Xiangyang Luo,Zhihao Jiang,Shao-Lun Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theoretically grounded, data-aware initialization for LoRA (LoRA-DA) that uses a Fisher-based bias-variance decomposition to optimize LoRA initialization from a small target-domain sample set, improving accuracy and convergence over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA initializations either ignore target-domain data, rely on shallow one-step gradient updates, or lack a solid theoretical foundation (often assuming isotropy). A data-aware, rigorously grounded initialization is needed to improve performance and stability across domains and ranks.

Method: Develop an asymptotic optimization framework for initializing LoRA by minimizing the expected parameter discrepancy between the fine-tuned model and the target model, decomposed into a bias term (parameter distance approximated with a Fisher-gradient to preserve anisotropy) and a variance term (uncertainty from sampling via Fisher information). Solve for the optimal initialization and implement LoRA-DA, which estimates the two terms from a small set of target-domain samples to compute the initialization.

Result: Empirical evaluation across multiple benchmarks shows that LoRA-DA consistently improves final accuracy over existing initialization methods, with faster and more stable convergence and robustness to rank variations, while adding only a modest initialization overhead. Source code will be released.

Conclusion: LoRA-DA provides a principled, data-aware initialization for LoRA that yields consistent accuracy gains and improved training efficiency, with a solid theoretical basis and practical robustness.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of LLMs, LoRA has become a dominant method for
PEFT, and its initialization methods have attracted increasing attention.
However, existing methods have notable limitations: many methods do not
incorporate target-domain data, while gradient-based methods exploit data only
at a shallow level by relying on one-step gradient decomposition, which remains
unsatisfactory due to the weak empirical performance of the one-step
fine-tuning model that serves as their basis, as well as the fact that these
methods either lack a rigorous theoretical foundation or depend heavily on
restrictive isotropic assumptions. In this paper, we establish a theoretical
framework for data-aware LoRA initialization based on asymptotic analysis.
Starting from a general optimization objective that minimizes the expectation
of the parameter discrepancy between the fine-tuned and target models, we
derive an optimization problem with two components: a bias term, which is
related to the parameter distance between the fine-tuned and target models, and
is approximated using a Fisher-gradient formulation to preserve anisotropy; and
a variance term, which accounts for the uncertainty introduced by sampling
stochasticity through the Fisher information. By solving this problem, we
obtain an optimal initialization strategy for LoRA. Building on this
theoretical framework, we develop an efficient algorithm, LoRA-DA, which
estimates the terms in the optimization problem from a small set of target
domain samples and obtains the optimal LoRA initialization. Empirical results
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LoRA-DA consistently improves final
accuracy over existing initialization methods. Additional studies show faster,
more stable convergence, robustness across ranks, and only a small
initialization overhead for LoRA-DA. The source code will be released upon
publication.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DistDF introduces a joint-distribution Wasserstein discrepancy to align the conditional forecast and label distributions in time-series forecasting, addressing bias from label autocorrelation; it offers tractable, differentiable estimation and yields state-of-the-art results across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct forecast using conditional likelihood (often via MSE) is biased when label sequences are autocorrelated; a reliable measure to align conditional forecast distributions with label distributions is needed.

Method: Propose DistDF that minimizes a discrepancy between conditional forecast and label distributions. Introduce a joint-distribution Wasserstein discrepancy for time-series forecasting that upper bounds the conditioned discrepancy, is tractable to estimate from empirical samples, differentiable, and integrates with gradient-based training.

Result: Empirical studies show DistDF improves performance across diverse forecast models and achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance.

Conclusion: DistDF provides an effective and scalable way to align conditional distributions in time-series forecasting, mitigating bias from autocorrelation and delivering strong empirical performance; code is released.

Abstract: Training time-series forecast models requires aligning the conditional
distribution of model forecasts with that of the label sequence. The standard
direct forecast (DF) approach resorts to minimize the conditional negative
log-likelihood of the label sequence, typically estimated using the mean
squared error. However, this estimation proves to be biased in the presence of
label autocorrelation. In this paper, we propose DistDF, which achieves
alignment by alternatively minimizing a discrepancy between the conditional
forecast and label distributions. Because conditional discrepancies are
difficult to estimate from finite time-series observations, we introduce a
newly proposed joint-distribution Wasserstein discrepancy for time-series
forecasting, which provably upper bounds the conditional discrepancy of
interest. This discrepancy admits tractable, differentiable estimation from
empirical samples and integrates seamlessly with gradient-based training.
Extensive experiments show that DistDF improves the performance diverse
forecast models and achieves the state-of-the-art forecasting performance. Code

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid quantum-classical adversarial framework for regression integrating a quantum neural network with classical layers, an LIME-based evaluator for interpretability, and extensions via quantum GAN and self-supervised variants; shows competitive regression metrics with a Vanilla model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trade-offs among predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability in quantum machine learning; advance QML toward lighter, more interpretable models.

Method: Hybrid quantum neural network (QNN) with classical layers; adversarial evaluator providing feedback loss to optimize both accuracy and explainability; LIME-based interpretability; extended with quantum GAN and self-supervised variants; evaluated on regression tasks.

Result: Vanilla model achieves RMSE 0.27, MSE 0.071, MAE 0.21, R^2 0.59; demonstrates the most consistent performance across regression metrics compared to adversarial counterparts.

Conclusion: Combining quantum-inspired methods with classical architectures can yield lightweight, high-performance, and interpretable predictive models, expanding the applicability of quantum-inspired machine learning.

Abstract: Current quantum machine learning approaches often face challenges balancing
predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. To address this, we
propose a novel quantum adversarial framework that integrates a hybrid quantum
neural network (QNN) with classical deep learning layers, guided by an
evaluator model with LIME-based interpretability, and extended through quantum
GAN and self-supervised variants. In the proposed model, an adversarial
evaluator concurrently guides the QNN by computing feedback loss, thereby
optimizing both prediction accuracy and model explainability. Empirical
evaluations show that the Vanilla model achieves RMSE = 0.27, MSE = 0.071, MAE
= 0.21, and R^2 = 0.59, delivering the most consistent performance across
regression metrics compared to adversarial counterparts. These results
demonstrate the potential of combining quantum-inspired methods with classical
architectures to develop lightweight, high-performance, and interpretable
predictive models, advancing the applicability of QML beyond current
limitations.

### [230] [Semi-supervised and unsupervised learning for health indicator extraction from guided waves in aerospace composite structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24614)
*James Josep Perry,Pablo Garcia-Conde Ortiz,George Konstantinou,Cornelie Vergouwen,Edlyn Santha Kumaran,Morteza Moradi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dual learning framework for health indicators in aerospace composites using semi-supervised Diversity-DeepSAD with continuous auxiliary labels and a degradation-trend-constrained VAE (DTC-VAE), integrated with multi-domain guided-wave data. Per-frequency HIs fused via unsupervised ensemble; achieves 81.6% (Diversity-DeepSAD) and 92.3% (DTC-VAE), outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ground-truth health indicators are unavailable; high variability in material properties, stochastic damage evolution, and multiple damage modes challenge reliable HI extraction. Manufacturing defects and in-service incidents further complicate monitoring. A data-driven, weakly supervised framework leveraging multi-frequency signals can robustly infer degradation trajectories.

Method: Two learning approaches: (i) Diversity-DeepSAD with continuous auxiliary labels as hypothetical damage proxies to capture intermediate degradation beyond binary healthy/faulty labeling; (ii) DTC-VAE with explicit monotonic degradation trend constraint. Guided waves at multiple excitation frequencies monitor single-stiffener composites under fatigue. Explores time, frequency, and time-frequency representations; per-frequency HIs fused via unsupervised ensemble learning. Features derived from fast Fourier transforms.

Result: Empirical performance: Diversity-DeepSAD achieves 81.6%; DTC-VAE achieves 92.3% and provides more consistent HIs. Both approaches outperform existing baselines.

Conclusion: The integrated framework yields more stable and interpretable health indicators under fatigue for aerospace composites, addressing intermediate degradation and frequency dependence. The combination of semi-supervised and unsupervised methods with multi-domain signal processing enhances robustness and reduces HI variance.

Abstract: Health indicators (HIs) are central to diagnosing and prognosing the
condition of aerospace composite structures, enabling efficient maintenance and
operational safety. However, extracting reliable HIs remains challenging due to
variability in material properties, stochastic damage evolution, and diverse
damage modes. Manufacturing defects (e.g., disbonds) and in-service incidents
(e.g., bird strikes) further complicate this process. This study presents a
comprehensive data-driven framework that learns HIs via two learning approaches
integrated with multi-domain signal processing. Because ground-truth HIs are
unavailable, a semi-supervised and an unsupervised approach are proposed: (i) a
diversity deep semi-supervised anomaly detection (Diversity-DeepSAD) approach
augmented with continuous auxiliary labels used as hypothetical damage proxies,
which overcomes the limitation of prior binary labels that only distinguish
healthy and failed states while neglecting intermediate degradation, and (ii) a
degradation-trend-constrained variational autoencoder (DTC-VAE), in which the
monotonicity criterion is embedded via an explicit trend constraint. Guided
waves with multiple excitation frequencies are used to monitor single-stiffener
composite structures under fatigue loading. Time, frequency, and time-frequency
representations are explored, and per-frequency HIs are fused via unsupervised
ensemble learning to mitigate frequency dependence and reduce variance. Using
fast Fourier transform features, the augmented Diversity-DeepSAD model achieved
81.6% performance, while DTC-VAE delivered the most consistent HIs with 92.3%
performance, outperforming existing baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: One-shot ILP with saved intermediate hypotheses and MDL-weighted ensemble improves accuracy by ~4% at <1% overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the computational cost of ensemble ILP methods that train multiple times by reusing hypotheses from a single run and weighting them using MDL.

Method: Train an ILP algorithm once, save intermediate hypotheses encountered during the search, and form an ensemble from these hypotheses. Use a minimum description length (MDL) based weighting to combine their predictions.

Result: On benchmarks including game playing and visual reasoning, predictive accuracy improved by about 4% with less than 1% additional computational overhead.

Conclusion: A single-run ILP with an MDL-weighted ensemble can achieve competitive accuracy with very low overhead, offering a practical efficiency improvement for ILP.

Abstract: Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a form of logical machine learning. Most
ILP algorithms learn a single hypothesis from a single training run. Ensemble
methods train an ILP algorithm multiple times to learn multiple hypotheses. In
this paper, we train an ILP algorithm only once and save intermediate
hypotheses. We then combine the hypotheses using a minimum description length
weighting scheme. Our experiments on multiple benchmarks, including game
playing and visual reasoning, show that our approach improves predictive
accuracy by 4% with less than 1% computational overhead.

### [232] [Causal Ordering for Structure Learning From Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24639)
*Pedro P. Sanchez,Damian Machlanski,Steven McDonagh,Sotirios A. Tsaftaris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DOTS uses diffusion-based causal discovery across multiple valid temporal orderings to recover the transitive closure of the causal graph in time-series data, improving accuracy and scalability over single-ordering methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal discovery in time series is combinatorially hard and single-ordering methods limit the model's representational capacity, often introducing spurious artifacts. Using multiple valid orderings aims to more faithfully capture causal structure and improve robustness.

Method: DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure) integrates diffusion-based causal discovery with multiple temporal orderings. It leverages score matching with diffusion processes to enable efficient Hessian estimation under standard assumptions (stationarity and additive noise). The approach recovers the transitive closure of the underlying DAG by aggregating information from multiple orderings, rather than relying on a single ordering.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows strong gains: on synthetic benchmarks (d=3‚Äì6, T=200‚Äì5,000), mean window-graph F1 improves from 0.63 (best baseline) to 0.81. On the real-world CausalTime benchmark (d=20‚Äì36), DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph F1, while halving runtime compared with graph-optimization baselines.

Conclusion: DOTS provides a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal discovery by leveraging multiple orderings to recover the transitive closure, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Predicting causal structure from time series data is crucial for
understanding complex phenomena in physiology, brain connectivity, climate
dynamics, and socio-economic behaviour. Causal discovery in time series is
hindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal
relationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A
common approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods.
Traditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of
the resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple
valid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We
propose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based
causal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS
effectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic
graph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We
formalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the
additive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to
enable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the
approach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a
scalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic
benchmarks ($d{=}\!3-\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\!-\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS
improves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$. On the
CausalTime real-world benchmark ($d{=}20\!-\!36$), while baselines remain the
best on individual datasets, DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph
$F1$ while halving runtime relative to graph-optimisation methods. These
results establish DOTS as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal
discovery.

### [233] [The Cost of Robustness: Tighter Bounds on Parameter Complexity for Robust Memorization in ReLU Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24643)
*Yujun Kim,Chaewon Moon,Chulhee Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tight parameter-count bounds for robust memorization in ReLU nets across rho in (0,1); robustness increases parameter complexity; matches non-robust at small rho.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how many parameters are necessary to interpolate data under mu-robustness with epsilon separation; fill gap with fine-grained rho analysis.

Method: Derives upper and lower bounds on parameter count as a function of rho; analyzes the entire range (0,1); provides tighter bounds than prior work.

Result: Shows parameter complexity for robust memorization matches non-robust when rho is small, and grows with rho; tighter bounds compared to previous results.

Conclusion: Robustness incurs parameter cost; trade-off between robustness and model size; results illuminate the parameter-efficiency landscape across the rho spectrum.

Abstract: We study the parameter complexity of robust memorization for $\mathrm{ReLU}$
networks: the number of parameters required to interpolate any given dataset
with $\epsilon$-separation between differently labeled points, while ensuring
predictions remain consistent within a $\mu$-ball around each training sample.
We establish upper and lower bounds on the parameter count as a function of the
robustness ratio $\rho = \mu / \epsilon$. Unlike prior work, we provide a
fine-grained analysis across the entire range $\rho \in (0,1)$ and obtain
tighter upper and lower bounds that improve upon existing results. Our findings
reveal that the parameter complexity of robust memorization matches that of
non-robust memorization when $\rho$ is small, but grows with increasing $\rho$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pearl is a foundation model for protein‚Äìligand cofolding that combines large-scale synthetic data, an SO(3)-equivariant diffusion architecture, and controllable inference with multi-chain templating. It achieves state-of-the-art pose accuracy and validity, outperforming AlphaFold 3 and baselines on key benchmarks, with performance scaling with training data size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome data scarcity, enforce physical plausibility and symmetry in 3D structure prediction, and enable flexible inference with multiple input types and conditional modes for protein and non-polymeric components.

Method: Three innovations: (1) large-scale synthetic data to mitigate data scarcity; (2) an SO(3)-equivariant diffusion module that respects 3D rotational symmetry for better generalization and sample efficiency; (3) a controllable inference framework with a generalized multi-chain templating system supporting both protein and non-polymeric components and dual unconditional/conditional modes.

Result: Pearl achieves state-of-the-art performance in protein‚Äìligand cofolding. On RMSD<2 √Ö and physically valid poses, it surpasses AlphaFold 3 and other baselines on Runs N' Poses and PoseBusters benchmarks by about 14.5% and 14.2%, respectively. In pocket-conditional cofolding on a real-world proprietary set, it yields 3.6√ó improvement at RMSD<1 √Ö. Performance scales with synthetic data size used for training.

Conclusion: Three-tier approach‚Äîdata scale, symmetry-aware diffusion architectures, and controllable inference‚Äîdrives superior performance in protein‚Äìligand cofolding and demonstrates that model capability correlates with synthetic data volume; promise for broader applications in structure-based drug discovery, with caveats regarding reliance on synthetic data and computational cost.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the three-dimensional structures of protein-ligand
complexes remains a fundamental challenge in computational drug discovery that
limits the pace and success of therapeutic design. Deep learning methods have
recently shown strong potential as structural prediction tools, achieving
promising accuracy across diverse biomolecular systems. However, their
performance and utility are constrained by scarce experimental data,
inefficient architectures, physically invalid poses, and the limited ability to
exploit auxiliary information available at inference. To address these issues,
we introduce Pearl (Placing Every Atom in the Right Location), a foundation
model for protein-ligand cofolding at scale. Pearl addresses these challenges
with three key innovations: (1) training recipes that include large-scale
synthetic data to overcome data scarcity; (2) architectures that incorporate an
SO(3)-equivariant diffusion module to inherently respect 3D rotational
symmetries, improving generalization and sample efficiency, and (3)
controllable inference, including a generalized multi-chain templating system
supporting both protein and non-polymeric components as well as dual
unconditional/conditional modes. Pearl establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance in protein-ligand cofolding. On the key metric of generating
accurate (RMSD < 2 \r{A}) and physically valid poses, Pearl surpasses AlphaFold
3 and other open source baselines on the public Runs N' Poses and PoseBusters
benchmarks, delivering 14.5% and 14.2% improvements, respectively, over the
next best model. In the pocket-conditional cofolding regime, Pearl delivers
$3.6\times$ improvement on a proprietary set of challenging, real-world drug
targets at the more rigorous RMSD < 1 \r{A} threshold. Finally, we demonstrate
that model performance correlates directly with synthetic dataset size used in
training.

### [235] [Eigenfunction Extraction for Ordered Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24672)
*Burak Varƒ±cƒ±,Che-Ping Tsai,Ritabrata Ray,Nicholas M. Boffi,Pradeep Ravikumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a modular framework to extract ordered, identifiable eigenfunctions of contextual kernels in representation learning, addressing limitations of recovering only top linear eigenfunctions; uses low-rank and Rayleigh quotient approaches; eigenvalues provide feature-importance scores for adaptive dimensions in image tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for exact spectral decomposition to understand feature ordering and importance in representation learning. Current contrastive/non-contrastive methods only recover the linear span of top eigenfunctions of a contextual kernel, which limits interpretability and control over feature dimensionality. A scalable, kernel-compatible method for ordered, identifiable eigenfunctions would improve feature selection and efficiency.

Method: Introduce modular building blocks that ensure compatibility with the contextual kernel and scalability. Show alignment with two main paradigms for eigenfunction extraction: (i) low-rank approximation and (ii) Rayleigh quotient optimization, within the proposed framework.

Result: Validation on synthetic kernels and real-world image datasets demonstrates that the recovered eigenvalues act as meaningful feature importance scores, enabling principled efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs via adaptive-dimensional representations.

Conclusion: The framework provides a principled, scalable approach to extract ordered, identifiable eigenfunctions from contextual kernels, enabling better feature selection and interpretation in representation learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in representation learning reveal that widely used
objectives, such as contrastive and non-contrastive, implicitly perform
spectral decomposition of a contextual kernel, induced by the relationship
between inputs and their contexts. Yet, these methods recover only the linear
span of top eigenfunctions of the kernel, whereas exact spectral decomposition
is essential for understanding feature ordering and importance. In this work,
we propose a general framework to extract ordered and identifiable
eigenfunctions, based on modular building blocks designed to satisfy key
desiderata, including compatibility with the contextual kernel and scalability
to modern settings. We then show how two main methodological paradigms,
low-rank approximation and Rayleigh quotient optimization, align with this
framework for eigenfunction extraction. Finally, we validate our approach on
synthetic kernels and demonstrate on real-world image datasets that the
recovered eigenvalues act as effective importance scores for feature selection,
enabling principled efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs via adaptive-dimensional
representations.

### [236] [Learning to Drive Safely with Hybrid Options](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24674)
*Bram De Cooman,Johan Suykens*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hierarchical RL for highway driving using the options framework with dedicated longitudinal/lateral maneuvers and safety/comfort constraints; hybrid options outperform action-based baselines and offer interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Options (skills) offer hierarchical control benefits that are underutilized in autonomous driving. Incorporating domain knowledge and safety/comfort constraints can guide learning, improve safety, and enhance interpretability of policies amid varying traffic.

Method: Define dedicated options for longitudinal and lateral maneuvers with embedded safety/comfort constraints; explore several hierarchical control setups using the options framework; derive practical RL algorithms with state-of-the-art techniques; learn policies over separate longitudinal and lateral controls, yielding combined/hybrid options.

Result: Policies over hybrid/combined options outperform baseline policies that operate over primitive actions, especially under varying traffic conditions; hybrid options provide the best performance and interpretability relative to action-based baselines.

Conclusion: Applying the options framework to autonomous highway driving is effective, enabling incorporation of domain knowledge and constraints, improving performance and interpretability over traditional action-space policies.

Abstract: Out of the many deep reinforcement learning approaches for autonomous
driving, only few make use of the options (or skills) framework. That is
surprising, as this framework is naturally suited for hierarchical control
applications in general, and autonomous driving tasks in specific. Therefore,
in this work the options framework is applied and tailored to autonomous
driving tasks on highways. More specifically, we define dedicated options for
longitudinal and lateral manoeuvres with embedded safety and comfort
constraints. This way, prior domain knowledge can be incorporated into the
learning process and the learned driving behaviour can be constrained more
easily. We propose several setups for hierarchical control with options and
derive practical algorithms following state-of-the-art reinforcement learning
techniques. By separately selecting actions for longitudinal and lateral
control, the introduced policies over combined and hybrid options obtain the
same expressiveness and flexibility that human drivers have, while being easier
to interpret than classical policies over continuous actions. Of all the
investigated approaches, these flexible policies over hybrid options perform
the best under varying traffic conditions, outperforming the baseline policies
over actions.

### [237] [Greedy Sampling Is Provably Efficient for RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24700)
*Di Wu,Chengshuai Shi,Jing Yang,Cong Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Greedy sampling (empirical estimates) suffices for KL-regularized RLHF with general preference models, yielding strong, order-wise guarantees and improving over BT-based reward designs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF is central to post-training LLMs, but theory lags, especially for KL-regularized targets with only preference feedback; existing work focuses on reward-based BT models and optimistic/pessimistic analyses.

Method: The authors analyze a general preference model under KL-regularized RLHF, prove performance guarantees using greedy empirical estimates rather than optimistic/pessimistic constructions, and identify a unique structural property of the optimal policy class; they then specialize results to the Bradley‚ÄìTerrey (BT) model.

Result: They obtain major, order-wise improvements over existing guarantees; show that greedy sampling is sufficient in RLHF for the general model, and provide BT-specific instantiations.

Conclusion: Greedy sampling suffices for RLHF under KL regularization due to intrinsic structure of the optimal policy class; this advances theoretical understanding and suggests simpler algorithmic approaches for RLHF.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
technique for post-training large language models. Despite its empirical
success, the theoretical understanding of RLHF is still limited, as learning
the KL-regularized target with only preference feedback poses additional
challenges compared with canonical RL. Existing works mostly study the
reward-based Bradley-Terry (BT) preference model, and extend classical designs
utilizing optimism or pessimism. This work, instead, considers the general
preference model (whose practical relevance has been observed recently) and
obtains performance guarantees with major, order-wise improvements over
existing ones. Surprisingly, these results are derived from algorithms that
directly use the empirical estimates (i.e., greedy sampling), as opposed to
constructing optimistic or pessimistic estimates in previous works. This
insight has a deep root in the unique structural property of the optimal policy
class under the KL-regularized target, and we further specialize it to the BT
model, highlighting the surprising sufficiency of greedy sampling in RLHF.

TL;DR: RoboOmni enables proactive intention recognition for robotic manipulation by fusing cross-modal cues in an omni-modal LLM framework and introducing OmniAction dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In real-world human-robot collaboration, users seldom issue explicit commands; robots need to infer intent from dialogue, sounds, and visuals to provide proactive assistance.

Method: Propose RoboOmni (Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor) architecture that fuses audio-visual signals via end-to-end omni-modal LLMs; introduce OmniAction dataset with 140k episodes, 5k+ speakers, 2.4k event sounds, 640 backgrounds, and six contextual instruction types.

Result: Outperforms text- and ASR-based baselines in simulation and real-world tests on success rate, inference speed, intention recognition, and proactive assistance.

Conclusion: Shows that proactive intention recognition is feasible in robotic manipulation using cross-modal cues and omni-modal LLMs; OmniAction provides essential training data for such tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have driven rapid
progress in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotic manipulation.
Although effective in many scenarios, current approaches largely rely on
explicit instructions, whereas in real-world interactions, humans rarely issue
instructions directly. Effective collaboration requires robots to infer user
intentions proactively. In this work, we introduce cross-modal contextual
instructions, a new setting where intent is derived from spoken dialogue,
environmental sounds, and visual cues rather than explicit commands. To address
this new setting, we present RoboOmni, a Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor
framework based on end-to-end omni-modal LLMs that unifies intention
recognition, interaction confirmation, and action execution. RoboOmni fuses
auditory and visual signals spatiotemporally for robust intention recognition,
while supporting direct speech interaction. To address the absence of training
data for proactive intention recognition in robotic manipulation, we build
OmniAction, comprising 140k episodes, 5k+ speakers, 2.4k event sounds, 640
backgrounds, and six contextual instruction types. Experiments in simulation
and real-world settings show that RoboOmni surpasses text- and ASR-based
baselines in success rate, inference speed, intention recognition, and
proactive assistance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Social robots acting as peer study companions (goal reminders and emotional support) improved perceived ease of use and willingness to reuse in self-study tasks, beyond mere presence, with social perception predicting goal achievement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses a gap in research on robots aiding self-directed learning (as opposed to structured classroom tasks) by evaluating functional (goal reminders) and emotional (positive support) contributions of socially assistive robots during self-study.

Method: Exploratory Wizard-of-Oz study with college students comparing three conditions: goal-reminder, emotional-support, and control (presence-only). Measured perceived focus, productivity, engagement, ease of use, willingness to reuse, and satisfaction; assessed the relationship between perceived sociality and goal achievement.

Result: Participants in the goal-reminder and emotional-support conditions reported greater ease of use; the goal-reminder condition also showed higher willingness to use the robot in future sessions. Satisfaction with the robot correlated with viewing it as a social others, and this social perception predicted goal achievement in the self-study task.

Conclusion: Socially assistive robots can support self-study through both functional (reminders) and emotional (support) engagement, suggesting design considerations for future self-directed learning tools to enhance usability and outcomes.

Abstract: While the efficacy of social robots in supporting people in learning tasks
has been extensively investigated, their potential impact in assisting students
in self-studying contexts has not been investigated much. This study explores
how a social robot can act as a peer study companion for college students
during self-study tasks by delivering task-oriented goal reminder and positive
emotional support. We conducted an exploratory Wizard-of-Oz study to explore
how these robotic support behaviors impacted students' perceived focus,
productivity, and engagement in comparison to a robot that only provided
physical presence (control). Our study results suggest that participants in the
goal reminder and the emotional support conditions reported greater ease of
use, with the goal reminder condition additionally showing a higher willingness
to use the robot in future study sessions. Participants' satisfaction with the
robot was correlated with their perception of the robot as a social other, and
this perception was found to be a predictor for their level of goal achievement
in the self-study task. These findings highlight the potential of socially
assistive robots to support self-study through both functional and emotional
engagement.

<details>

Motivation: Wheeled-legged robots offer efficiency and obstacle negotiation, but current systems rely on costly actuators/sensors and lack integrated fall recovery. The work targets budget platforms by enabling recovery-aware navigation.

Method: A recovery-aware visual-inertial navigation system using depth-camera perception combined with deep reinforcement learning policies for robust locomotion and autonomous recovery from falls. Evaluation includes simulation across irregular terrains and goal-directed indoor navigation with inexpensive sensing.

Result: Demonstrates agile mobility with low-torque actuators on irregular terrain and reliable recovery from external perturbations and self-induced failures; shows goal-directed indoor navigation with budget perception.

Conclusion: The approach lowers barriers to deploying autonomous navigation and robust locomotion policies on budget robotic platforms.

Abstract: Wheeled-legged robots combine the efficiency of wheels with the obstacle
negotiation of legs, yet many state-of-the-art systems rely on costly actuators
and sensors, and fall-recovery is seldom integrated, especially for
wheeled-legged morphologies. This work presents a recovery-aware
visual-inertial navigation system on a low-cost wheeled quadruped. The proposed
system leverages vision-based perception from a depth camera and deep
reinforcement learning policies for robust locomotion and autonomous recovery
from falls across diverse terrains. Simulation experiments show agile mobility
with low-torque actuators over irregular terrain and reliably recover from
external perturbations and self-induced failures. We further show goal directed
navigation in structured indoor spaces with low-cost perception. Overall, this
approach lowers the barrier to deploying autonomous navigation and robust
locomotion policies in budget-constrained robotic platforms.

Motivation: Address data bottlenecks in real-time perception and enable scalable robot learning by compressing data streams while maintaining high-quality 3D world representations in dynamic environments.

Method: Two-module approach: (1) error-based selection using photometric error and SSIM to pick informative frames; (2) momentum-based update to adapt selection thresholds to motion dynamics; evaluate by integrating with Spann3r and CUT3R and performing ablations to isolate component contributions.

Result: Significant improvements over traditional fixed-interval or uniform skipping strategies; consistent reconstruction quality gains across both networks; ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component.

Conclusion: Adaptive, dynamic keyframe selection advances perceptual systems able to respond to evolving scenes and supports scalable, real-time 3D reconstruction in complex environments.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an adaptive keyframe selection method for improved
3D scene reconstruction in dynamic environments. The proposed method integrates
two complementary modules: an error-based selection module utilizing
photometric and structural similarity (SSIM) errors, and a momentum-based
update module that dynamically adjusts keyframe selection thresholds according
to scene motion dynamics. By dynamically curating the most informative frames,
our approach addresses a key data bottleneck in real-time perception. This
allows for the creation of high-quality 3D world representations from a
compressed data stream, a critical step towards scalable robot learning and
deployment in complex, dynamic environments. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements over traditional static keyframe selection strategies,
such as fixed temporal intervals or uniform frame skipping. These findings
highlight a meaningful advancement toward adaptive perception systems that can
dynamically respond to complex and evolving visual scenes. We evaluate our
proposed adaptive keyframe selection module on two recent state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction networks, Spann3r and CUT3R, and observe consistent improvements
in reconstruction quality across both frameworks. Furthermore, an extensive
ablation study confirms the effectiveness of each individual component in our
method, underlining their contribution to the overall performance gains.

*Pejman Kheradmand,Behnam Moradkhani,Raghavasimhan Sankaranarayanan,Kent K. Yamamoto,Tanner J. Zachem,Patrick J. Codd,Yash Chitalia,Pierre E. Dupont*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Cosserat-rod based modeling framework for tendon-actuated concentric tube robots with multiple tubes, validated experimentally, achieving low tip errors and generalizable to existing robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of a complete, general mechanical model for tendon-actuated concentric tube mechanisms, enabling accurate shape estimation and control while overcoming limitations of tendon-driven and concentric tube robots.

Method: Develop a Cosserat rod-based framework for n concentric tubes, each with m_i actuated tendons; allow twisting and elongation; enforce a shared centerline for bending; validate with 2-tube and 3-tube experiments across various tendon routings, then test on existing robots.

Result: Tip prediction errors <4% of the robot length for two- and three-tube assemblies; maximum tip deviations around 5% when applied to existing robots, demonstrating generality and accuracy.

Conclusion: Provides a general, accurate model foundation for shape estimation and control of tendon-actuated concentric tube robots, applicable to diverse configurations and existing devices.

Abstract: Tendon-actuated concentric tube mechanisms combine the advantages of
tendon-driven continuum robots and concentric tube robots while addressing
their respective limitations. They overcome the restricted degrees of freedom
often seen in tendon-driven designs, and mitigate issues such as snapping
instability associated with concentric tube robots. However, a complete and
general mechanical model for these systems remains an open problem. In this
work, we propose a Cosserat rod-based framework for modeling the general case
of $n$ concentric tubes, each actuated by $m_i$ tendons, where $i = \{1,
\ldots, n\}$. The model allows each tube to twist and elongate while enforcing
a shared centerline for bending. We validate the proposed framework through
experiments with two-tube and three tube assemblies under various tendon
routing configurations, achieving tip prediction errors $<4\%$ of the robot's
total length. We further demonstrate the model's generality by applying it to
existing robots in the field, where maximum tip deviations remain around $5\%$
of the total length. This model provides a foundation for accurate shape
estimation and control of advanced tendon-actuated concentric tube robots.

### [243] [Adaptive-twist Soft Finger Mechanism for Grasping by Wrapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23963)
*Hiroki Ishikawa,Kyosuke Ishibashi,Ko Yamamoto*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A soft robot finger with adaptive-twist deformation and a single, pressure-controlled variable stiffness actuation enables wrapping-based grasping in cluttered environments; validated via FEA and basic experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Grasping in dense object scenes requires fingers that can twist in both in-plane and out-of-plane directions, insert deeply into gaps, and apply controlled normal force to maintain the twist, all from a single actuation source.

Method: Introduce a variable stiffness mechanism that increases stiffness with higher pressure; perform finite element analysis to determine design parameters; fabricate the soft finger and demonstrate grasping of various objects through wrapping.

Result: FEA-guided design parameters obtained; basic experimental demonstrations show the finger can wrap and grasp diverse objects, including insertion into tight gaps and maintaining deformation during grasp.

Conclusion: A single-actuation, variable-stiffness soft finger enabling adaptive-twist, wrap-based grasping in cluttered environments; potential for more robust soft grippers; future work could optimize performance and range of objects.

Abstract: This paper presents a soft robot finger capable of adaptive-twist deformation
to grasp objects by wrapping them. For a soft hand to grasp and pick-up one
object from densely contained multiple objects, a soft finger requires the
adaptive-twist deformation function in both in-plane and out-of-plane
directions. The function allows the finger to be inserted deeply into a limited
gap among objects. Once inserted, the soft finger requires appropriate control
of grasping force normal to contact surface, thereby maintaining the twisted
deformation. In this paper, we refer to this type of grasping as grasping by
wrapping. To achieve these two functions by a single actuation source, we
propose a variable stiffness mechanism that can adaptively change the stiffness
as the pressure is higher. We conduct a finite element analysis (FEA) on the
proposed mechanism and determine its design parameter based on the FEA result.
Using the developed soft finger, we report basic experimental results and
demonstrations on grasping various objects.

TL;DR: Systematic survey of multi-robot SLAM with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS): taxonomy, components, datasets, metrics, and open challenges with future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS enables real-time, high-fidelity scene representations for robotics, but multi-robot SLAM must tackle global consistency, communication, and heterogeneous data fusion. A unified taxonomy and benchmarks are needed to guide design and evaluation.

Method: Conduct a structured literature review, categorizing approaches into centralized and distributed architectures. Analyze core components such as multi-agent consistency and alignment, communication efficiency, Gaussian representations, semantic distillation, fusion and pose optimization, and real-time scalability. Compile critical datasets and evaluation metrics, and synthesize insights to identify open challenges and future research directions.

Result: Provides a comprehensive taxonomy and comparative insights across centralized and distributed multi-robot 3DGS SLAM methods. Summarizes representative datasets and metrics, highlights design trade-offs, and pinpoints gaps in lifelong mapping, semantic association, multi-model robustness, and sim-to-real bridging.

Conclusion: 3DGS-based multi-robot SLAM is promising for real-time, scalable perception; advancing lifelong mapping, semantic grounding, robustness to model heterogeneity, and sim-to-real transfer will be key to practical deployment.

Abstract: This survey comprehensively reviews the evolving field of multi-robot
collaborative Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). As an explicit scene representation, 3DGS has enabled
unprecedented real-time, high-fidelity rendering, ideal for robotics. However,
its use in multi-robot systems introduces significant challenges in maintaining
global consistency, managing communication, and fusing data from heterogeneous
sources. We systematically categorize approaches by their architecture --
centralized, distributed -- and analyze core components like multi-agent
consistency and alignment, communication-efficient, Gaussian representation,
semantic distillation, fusion and pose optimization, and real-time scalability.
In addition, a summary of critical datasets and evaluation metrics is provided
to contextualize performance. Finally, we identify key open challenges and

### [245] [VOCALoco: Viability-Optimized Cost-aware Adaptive Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23997)
*Stanley Wu,Mohamad H. Danesh,Simon Li,Hanna Yurchyk,Amin Abyaneh,Anas El Houssaini,David Meger,Hsiu-Chin Lin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VOCALoco is a modular skill-selection framework for legged locomotion that chooses among pre-trained policies based on predicted safety and energy cost, improving safety and efficiency on stair locomotion in simulation and on a real quadruped, addressing safety/interpretability gaps of end-to-end DRL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end DRL approaches in legged locomotion often lack explicit safety guarantees and interpretability and may not generalize well to novel terrains; a modular framework can provide safer, more transparent policy selection using perceptual input.

Method: Given a set of pre-trained locomotion policies, VOCALoco predicts both the safety of executing each policy and the anticipated energy cost over a fixed planning horizon, then selects policies that balance safety and energy efficiency based on observed local terrain.

Result: In staircase locomotion tasks, VOCALoco demonstrated improved robustness and safety during both ascent and descent, validated in simulation and on a real quadruped, compared to a conventional end-to-end DRL policy.

Conclusion: A modular sensor-informed policy selection approach can enhance safety, robustness, and energy-aware locomotion, offering interpretability and better generalization over terrains relative to end-to-end DRL.

Abstract: Recent advancements in legged robot locomotion have facilitated traversal
over increasingly complex terrains. Despite this progress, many existing
approaches rely on end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which poses
limitations in terms of safety and interpretability, especially when
generalizing to novel terrains. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
VOCALoco, a modular skill-selection framework that dynamically adapts
locomotion strategies based on perceptual input. Given a set of pre-trained
locomotion policies, VOCALoco evaluates their viability and energy-consumption
by predicting both the safety of execution and the anticipated cost of
transport over a fixed planning horizon. This joint assessment enables the
selection of policies that are both safe and energy-efficient, given the
observed local terrain. We evaluate our approach on staircase locomotion tasks,
demonstrating its performance in both simulated and real-world scenarios using
a quadrupedal robot. Empirical results show that VOCALoco achieves improved
robustness and safety during stair ascent and descent compared to a
conventional end-to-end DRL policy

*Andrew Gerstenslager,Bekarys Dukenbaev,Ali A. Minai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Extends Boundary Vector Cells to 3D by adding vertical angular sensitivity and LiDAR-based vertical contours, improving place-field distinctiveness and reducing spatial aliasing in 3D spaces while matching 2D performance in near-planar environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D BVC models suffer from spatial ambiguities under horizontal symmetry and lack robust performance in 3D environments; a 3D BVC framework could improve localization/navigation in real-world spaces.

Method: Integrates vertical angular sensitivity into BVCs and processes LiDAR data to capture vertical contours. Implemented in a biologically-inspired robot model. Compares a 3D BVC model to a 2D baseline across environments with varying vertical variation.

Result: In environments with minimal vertical variation, 3D BVC performance matches the 2D baseline. As vertical complexity increases, the 3D model yields more distinct place fields and significantly reduces spatial aliasing, enhancing localization.

Conclusion: Incorporating the vertical dimension into BVC-based localization improves navigation and mapping in 3D spaces while preserving parity with 2D performance in near-planar scenarios.

Abstract: Boundary Vector Cells (BVCs) are a class of neurons in the brains of
vertebrates that encode environmental boundaries at specific distances and
allocentric directions, playing a central role in forming place fields in the
hippocampus. Most computational BVC models are restricted to two-dimensional
(2D) environments, making them prone to spatial ambiguities in the presence of
horizontal symmetries in the environment. To address this limitation, we
incorporate vertical angular sensitivity into the BVC framework, thereby
enabling robust boundary detection in three dimensions, and leading to
significantly more accurate spatial localization in a biologically-inspired
robot model.
  The proposed model processes LiDAR data to capture vertical contours, thereby
disambiguating locations that would be indistinguishable under a purely 2D
representation. Experimental results show that in environments with minimal
vertical variation, the proposed 3D model matches the performance of a 2D
baseline; yet, as 3D complexity increases, it yields substantially more
distinct place fields and markedly reduces spatial aliasing. These findings
show that adding a vertical dimension to BVC-based localization can
significantly enhance navigation and mapping in real-world 3D spaces while
retaining performance parity in simpler, near-planar scenarios.

### [247] [SynAD: Enhancing Real-World End-to-End Autonomous Driving Models through Synthetic Data Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24052)
*Jongsuk Kim,Jaeyoung Lee,Gyojin Han,Dongjae Lee,Minki Jeong,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SynAD introduces a framework to leverage synthetic driving scenarios to improve end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E AD) by designating an ego vehicle in multi-agent synthetic data, projecting path-level scenarios onto maps, and using a Map-to-BEV Network to extract BEV features without sensor inputs, followed by a training strategy that fuses synthetic map-based data with real-world data to improve safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world driving data alone lacks scenario diversity; synthetic data can expand coverage of rare or dangerous situations but E2E AD models typically lack ego-vehicle inputs in synthetic setups, hindering integration. The work aims to bridge synthetic scenario generation with E2E AD by creating ego-aware synthetic data and map-based representations.

Method: - Identify the agent with the most comprehensive driving information as the ego vehicle in synthetic multi-agent scenes. - Project path-level scenarios onto maps. - Develop a Map-to-BEV Network to obtain bird's-eye-view features without camera/LiDAR inputs. - Propose a training strategy to integrate map-based synthetic data with real driving data for E2E AD training.

Result: Experimental results show that SynAD successfully integrates all components and leads to notable improvements in safety performance of real-world E2E AD models when augmented with synthetic data.

Conclusion: SynAD bridges synthetic scenario generation and end-to-end autonomous driving by providing an essential framework and components (ego designation, map-based BEV features, integration strategy) that enable effective use of synthetic data to enhance safety and robustness of E2E AD models.

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning and the availability of high-quality
real-world driving datasets have propelled end-to-end autonomous driving.
Despite this progress, relying solely on real-world data limits the variety of
driving scenarios for training. Synthetic scenario generation has emerged as a
promising solution to enrich the diversity of training data; however, its
application within E2E AD models remains largely unexplored. This is primarily
due to the absence of a designated ego vehicle and the associated sensor
inputs, such as camera or LiDAR, typically provided in real-world scenarios. To
address this gap, we introduce SynAD, the first framework designed to enhance
real-world E2E AD models using synthetic data. Our method designates the agent
with the most comprehensive driving information as the ego vehicle in a
multi-agent synthetic scenario. We further project path-level scenarios onto
maps and employ a newly developed Map-to-BEV Network to derive bird's-eye-view
features without relying on sensor inputs. Finally, we devise a training
strategy that effectively integrates these map-based synthetic data with real
driving data. Experimental results demonstrate that SynAD effectively
integrates all components and notably enhances safety performance. By bridging
synthetic scenario generation and E2E AD, SynAD paves the way for more
comprehensive and robust autonomous driving models.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework combines a Language-Conditioned Visual Representation (LCVR) with a Language-conditioned Mixture-of-Experts Density Policy (LMoE-DP) to address perceptual ambiguity and task conflict in multitask imitation-learning-based robotic manipulation. It grounds visual features with language to disambiguate tasks and uses sparse experts to specialize action distributions, yielding strong real-robot performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perceptual ambiguity and conflicting objectives across multiple tasks limit the effectiveness of multitask imitation learning in robotic manipulation. Grounding perception with language and introducing expert specialization can improve disambiguation and reduce interference between tasks.

Method: Introduce LCVR to ground visual representations with language instructions, resolving perceptual ambiguities; implement LMoE-DP, a sparse expert density policy conditioned on language, with gradient modulation to stabilize training and encourage specialization across multimodal action distributions.

Result: On real-robot benchmarks, LCVR improves Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) and Diffusion Policy (DP) success rates by 33.75% and 25% respectively. The full framework achieves 79% average success, outperforming an advanced baseline by 21%.

Conclusion: Combining semantic grounding with expert specialization enables robust and efficient multi-task manipulation via imitation learning.

Abstract: Perceptual ambiguity and task conflict limit multitask robotic manipulation
via imitation learning. We propose a framework combining a Language-Conditioned
Visual Representation (LCVR) module and a Language-conditioned

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for scalable multi-robot exploration that maintains coverage, balances workload, and handles dynamic, obstacle-dense spaces; existing methods struggle with partition fairness and global completeness.

Method: Incremental topological map capturing spatial connectivity and exploration completeness; receding-horizon target planning under global guidance; distributed weighted topological graph Voronoi algorithm for balanced partitions; local planner optimizes exploration target visitation and generates safe trajectories; theoretical guarantees on consensus convergence and equitable partitions; benchmarking against state-of-the-art.

Result: Proves distributed consensus convergence and equitable graph partitions with constant bounds; empirical benchmarking shows significant improvements in exploration efficiency, completeness, and workload balance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a scalable, provably balanced, and efficient approach to collaborative exploration in challenging environments, combining topological mapping, Voronoi-based partitioning, and receding-horizon planning to realize improved performance.

Abstract: This work addresses the collaborative multi-robot autonomous online
exploration problem, particularly focusing on distributed exploration planning
for dynamically balanced exploration area partition and task allocation among a
team of mobile robots operating in obstacle-dense non-convex environments.
  We present a novel topological map structure that simultaneously
characterizes both spatial connectivity and global exploration completeness of
the environment. The topological map is updated incrementally to utilize known
spatial information for updating reachable spaces, while exploration targets
are planned in a receding horizon fashion under global coverage guidance.
  A distributed weighted topological graph Voronoi algorithm is introduced
implementing balanced graph space partitions of the fused topological maps.
Theoretical guarantees are provided for distributed consensus convergence and
equitable graph space partitions with constant bounds.
  A local planner optimizes the visitation sequence of exploration targets
within the balanced partitioned graph space to minimize travel distance, while
generating safe, smooth, and dynamically feasible motion trajectories.
  Comprehensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods demonstrates
significant improvements in exploration efficiency, completeness, and workload
balance across the robot team.

*Sangmin Kim,Hajun Kim,Gijeong Kim,Min-Gyu Kim,Hae-Won Park*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Phase-based trajectory optimization for legged robots that decouples translational dynamics by contact using linear superposition, and enforces dynamics and friction constraints via B√©zier polynomial differentiation matrices and convexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure dynamically feasible legged motions by jointly optimizing trajectory and contact sequence with accurate dynamics and friction constraints.

Method: 1) Decompose translational dynamics per contact via superposition of linear differential equations, across different phase sequences. 2) Use differentiation matrices of B√©zier polynomials to link position and contact forces analytically, ensuring dynamic consistency. 3) Exploit convex closure property of B√©zier polynomials to satisfy friction cone constraints along the trajectory. 4) Validate on a quadruped model focusing on dynamics feasibility and motion generation across gait sequences.

Result: A trajectory optimization framework that can generate dynamically reliable motions for legged robots with various gait sequences; demonstrated feasibility for dynamics and motion generation on a quadruped model.

Conclusion: The approach offers a mathematically tractable and vibration-free way to enforce dynamic feasibility and friction constraints through phase-based decoupling and B√©zier-based relations, enabling reliable gait-aware motion planning for legged robots.

Abstract: To generate reliable motion for legged robots through trajectory
optimization, it is crucial to simultaneously compute the robot's path and
contact sequence, as well as accurately consider the dynamics in the problem
formulation. In this paper, we present a phase-based trajectory optimization
that ensures the feasibility of translational dynamics and friction cone
constraints throughout the entire trajectory. Specifically, our approach
leverages the superposition properties of linear differential equations to
decouple the translational dynamics for each contact point, which operates
under different phase sequences. Furthermore, we utilize the differentiation
matrix of B{\'e}zier polynomials to derive an analytical relationship between
the robot's position and force, thereby ensuring the consistent satisfaction of
translational dynamics. Additionally, by exploiting the convex closure property
of B{\'e}zier polynomials, our method ensures compliance with friction cone
constraints. Using the aforementioned approach, the proposed trajectory
optimization framework can generate dynamically reliable motions with various
gait sequences for legged robots. We validate our framework using a quadruped
robot model, focusing on the feasibility of dynamics and motion generation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel offline RL framework for end-to-end autonomous driving that learns directly from high-dimensional sensor data without imitation learning, using Exhaustive Policy Optimization (EPO) to optimize on enumerable actions/rewards, achieving strong results across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome limitations of imitation learning (sub-optimal demonstrations, covariate shift) and traditional RL limits (reliance on low-dimensional inputs) by enabling end-to-end learning from raw sensor data while maintaining robust planning.

Method: Introduce ZTRS (Zero-Imitation End-to-End Autonomous Driving with Trajectory Scoring) that uses offline reinforcement learning with Exhaustive Policy Optimization (EPO), a policy-gradient variant tailored for enumerable actions and rewards, operating directly on high-dimensional sensor inputs and circumventing imitation learning entirely.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Navhard and outperforms IL-based baselines on HUGSIM; demonstrates strong performance across three benchmarks (Navtest, Navhard, HUGSIM). Code will be released at the provided repository link.

Conclusion: ZTRS is the first framework to eliminate imitation learning entirely for end-to-end autonomous driving by learning from rewards on high-dimensional sensor data, highlighting the viability of offline RL with tailored policy optimization for real-world driving tasks.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving maps raw sensor inputs directly into
ego-vehicle trajectories to avoid cascading errors from perception modules and
to leverage rich semantic cues. Existing frameworks largely rely on Imitation
Learning (IL), which can be limited by sub-optimal expert demonstrations and
covariate shift during deployment. On the other hand, Reinforcement Learning
(RL) has recently shown potential in scaling up with simulations, but is
typically confined to low-dimensional symbolic inputs (e.g. 3D objects and
maps), falling short of full end-to-end learning from raw sensor data. We
introduce ZTRS (Zero-Imitation End-to-End Autonomous Driving with Trajectory
Scoring), a framework that combines the strengths of both worlds: sensor inputs
without losing information and RL training for robust planning. To the best of
our knowledge, ZTRS is the first framework that eliminates IL entirely by only
learning from rewards while operating directly on high-dimensional sensor data.
ZTRS utilizes offline reinforcement learning with our proposed Exhaustive
Policy Optimization (EPO), a variant of policy gradient tailored for enumerable
actions and rewards. ZTRS demonstrates strong performance across three
benchmarks: Navtest (generic real-world open-loop planning), Navhard (open-loop
planning in challenging real-world and synthetic scenarios), and HUGSIM
(simulated closed-loop driving). Specifically, ZTRS achieves the
state-of-the-art result on Navhard and outperforms IL-based baselines on
HUGSIM. Code will be available at https://github.com/woxihuanjiangguo/ZTRS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance human-centered AI by enabling robots to understand, plan, and execute natural-language tasks more reliably, addressing limitations of existing LLM-based embodied agents in online planning and execution.

Method: Proposes an embodied robot framework with modules: (1) human-robot voice interaction, (2) vision-language agent including a vision-based task planner, an NL instruction converter, and a task performance feedback evaluator, and (3) an action execution module. The system integrates Vision-Language Models to enable online planning and action.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows a 28% higher average task success rate than LLM+CLIP baselines in both simulated and real environments, notably improving high-level NL instruction execution.

Conclusion: The proposed Vision-Language embodied agent effectively enhances online planning and execution of natural-language tasks in robotics, contributing to more capable and reliable Human-centered AI; future work may explore broader tasks, real-time robustness, and scalability.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has marked a
significant breakthrough in Artificial Intelligence (AI), ushering in a new era
of Human-centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI). HAI aims to better serve human
welfare and needs, thereby placing higher demands on the intelligence level of
robots, particularly in aspects such as natural language interaction, complex
task planning, and execution. Intelligent agents powered by LLMs have opened up
new pathways for realizing HAI. However, existing LLM-based embodied agents
often lack the ability to plan and execute complex natural language control
tasks online. This paper explores the implementation of intelligent robotic
manipulating agents based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in the physical
world. We propose a novel embodied agent framework for robots, which comprises
a human-robot voice interaction module, a vision-language agent module and an
action execution module. The vision-language agent itself includes a
vision-based task planner, a natural language instruction converter, and a task
performance feedback evaluator. Experimental results demonstrate that our agent
achieves a 28\% higher average task success rate in both simulated and real
environments compared to approaches relying solely on LLM+CLIP, significantly
improving the execution success rate of high-level natural language instruction
tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LagMemo introduces a 3D language memory built on language-augmented Gaussian splatting to support open-vocabulary, multi-goal visual navigation, coupled with a curated GOAT-Core evaluation suite.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical visual navigation is limited to single-goal, single-modality, and closed-set queries. Real-world robotic tasks require multi-modal (text, images), open vocabulary, and multi-goal navigation; a unified memory facilitates flexible goal querying during navigation.

Method: During exploration LagMemo constructs a unified 3D memory using language-guided 3D Gaussian splatting. Upon receiving task goals, it queries the memory to predict candidate goal locations and applies a local perception-based verification to confirm goals during navigation. The authors also create GOAT-Core, a multi-modal, open-vocabulary, multi-goal core-split distilled from GOAT-Bench to enable fair evaluation.

Result: Experiments show that the memory module enables effective multi-modal open-vocabulary goal localization and LagMemo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-goal visual navigation.

Conclusion: A memory-augmented navigation approach with open-vocabulary language grounding substantially improves multi-goal navigation performance and provides a new benchmarking resource for rigorous evaluation.

Abstract: Navigating to a designated goal using visual information is a fundamental
capability for intelligent robots. Most classical visual navigation methods are
restricted to single-goal, single-modality, and closed set goal settings. To
address the practical demands of multi-modal, open-vocabulary goal queries and
multi-goal visual navigation, we propose LagMemo, a navigation system that
leverages a language 3D Gaussian Splatting memory. During exploration, LagMemo
constructs a unified 3D language memory. With incoming task goals, the system
queries the memory, predicts candidate goal locations, and integrates a local
perception-based verification mechanism to dynamically match and validate goals
during navigation. For fair and rigorous evaluation, we curate GOAT-Core, a
high-quality core split distilled from GOAT-Bench tailored to multi-modal
open-vocabulary multi-goal visual navigation. Experimental results show that
LagMemo's memory module enables effective multi-modal open-vocabulary goal
localization, and that LagMemo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
multi-goal visual navigation. Project page:

*Ev Zisselman,Mirco Mutti,Shelly Francis-Meretzki,Elisei Shafer,Aviv Tamar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Cloning a blindfolded (information-limited) expert improves generalization in imitation learning with few demonstrations, supported by theory (generalization error ~ sqrt(I/m)) and experiments on robot peg-insertion and Procgen games.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning often requires many demonstrations to generalize to unseen tasks. Fully informed, expert demonstrations can overfit to task specifics. The paper proposes hiding information from the demonstrator to induce exploration and improve data efficiency and generalization.

Method: Introduce a 'blindfolded' expert who has limited task information. The expert must explore non-trivially to solve tasks. Train a behavioral cloning model to imitate this expert. Provide theoretical analysis showing generalization error scales as sqrt(I/m). Validate with experiments on real robotics (peg-insertion with limited human demonstrations) and Procgen video games.

Result: Cloning blindfolded experts generalizes better to unseen tasks than cloning fully-informed experts, especially with fewer demonstrated tasks. Empirical results on real-world robot tasks and Procgen benchmarks align with the theoretical bound.

Conclusion: Hiding task information from demonstrators acts as a regularizer that improves data-efficient generalization in imitation learning. Theoretical and empirical results support that generalization error scales with sqrt(I/m), advocating for information-constrained demonstrations in practice.

Abstract: Behavioral cloning is a simple yet effective technique for learning
sequential decision-making from demonstrations. Recently, it has gained
prominence as the core of foundation models for the physical world, where
achieving generalization requires countless demonstrations of a multitude of
tasks. Typically, a human expert with full information on the task demonstrates
a (nearly) optimal behavior. In this paper, we propose to hide some of the
task's information from the demonstrator. This ``blindfolded'' expert is
compelled to employ non-trivial exploration to solve the task. We show that
cloning the blindfolded expert generalizes better to unseen tasks than its
fully-informed counterpart. We conduct experiments of real-world robot peg
insertion tasks with (limited) human demonstrations, alongside videogames from
the Procgen benchmark. Additionally, we support our findings with theoretical
analysis, which confirms that the generalization error scales with
$\sqrt{I/m}$, where $I$ measures the amount of task information available to
the demonstrator, and $m$ is the number of demonstrated tasks. Both theory and
practice indicate that cloning blindfolded experts generalizes better with
fewer demonstrated tasks. Project page with videos and code:

### [255] [Manipulate as Human: Learning Task-oriented Manipulation Skills by Adversarial Motion Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24257)
*Ziqi Ma,Changda Tian,Yue Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework (HMAMP) learns human-style manipulation using adversarial motion priors; it uses a discriminator trained on real-world and simulated agent data to shape a policy that generates realistic, human-like motion, demonstrated on hammering with outperformance of baselines and feasibility for real-robot use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable more natural and intuitive human‚Äìrobot interaction by allowing robots to manipulate tools and objects in human-like ways, addressing the challenge of capturing complex human motion dynamics and tool/object manipulation. Adversarial priors are proposed to capture statistical properties of human motion.

Method: An adversarial learning setup where a discriminator is trained on a mix of real human motion data and robot-simulated trajectories to encourage a policy to produce human-like trajectories. The policy learns to generate motion that matches the statistical properties of human manipulation, demonstrated on a hammering task, with real-robot hammering demonstrations.

Result: The HMAMP approach learns human-style manipulation skills and outperforms current baselines on the hammering task, and shows potential for real-world robot arm hammering demonstrations.

Conclusion: HMAMP offers a meaningful step toward more natural human‚Äìrobot interaction by enabling human-like manipulation of tools and objects. The work demonstrates practical potential, though future work may address broader task generalization and data efficiency for real-world deployment.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing robots and
autonomous systems that can interact with human in a more natural and intuitive
way. One of the key challenges in achieving this goal is to enable these
systems to manipulate objects and tools in a manner that is similar to that of
humans. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning human-style
manipulation skills by using adversarial motion priors, which we name HMAMP.
The approach leverages adversarial networks to model the complex dynamics of
tool and object manipulation, as well as the aim of the manipulation task. The
discriminator is trained using a combination of real-world data and simulation
data executed by the agent, which is designed to train a policy that generates
realistic motion trajectories that match the statistical properties of human
motion. We evaluated HMAMP on one challenging manipulation task: hammering, and
the results indicate that HMAMP is capable of learning human-style manipulation
skills that outperform current baseline methods. Additionally, we demonstrate
that HMAMP has potential for real-world applications by performing real robot
arm hammering tasks. In general, HMAMP represents a significant step towards
developing robots and autonomous systems that can interact with humans in a
more natural and intuitive way, by learning to manipulate tools and objects in
a manner similar to how humans do.

*Jingyi Tian,Le Wang,Sanping Zhou,Sen Wang,Jiayi Li,Gang Hua*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DynaRend learns 3D-aware, dynamics-informed triplane representations from multi-view RGB-D video using masked reconstruction and future prediction with differentiable volumetric rendering. These representations are transferred to robotic manipulation tasks via action-value map predictions, improving generalization and real-world applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scarcity of diverse real-world training data for manipulation; existing methods rely on static 2D pretraining or 2D dynamics models that miss joint geometry, semantics, and dynamics necessary for manipulation.

Method: Pretrain on multi-view RGB-D video to learn 3D-aware, dynamics-informed triplane features via masked reconstruction and future prediction, using differentiable volumetric rendering. Transfer to downstream tasks through action value map prediction for policy learning.

Result: Significant improvements in policy success rate, better generalization under environmental perturbations, and demonstrated real-world applicability across diverse manipulation tasks on RLBench, Colosseum, and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: A unified representation that jointly encodes geometry, semantics, and dynamics enables more effective and generalizable robotic manipulation policies, with strong transfer to downstream tasks.

Abstract: Learning generalizable robotic manipulation policies remains a key challenge
due to the scarcity of diverse real-world training data. While recent
approaches have attempted to mitigate this through self-supervised
representation learning, most either rely on 2D vision pretraining paradigms
such as masked image modeling, which primarily focus on static semantics or
scene geometry, or utilize large-scale video prediction models that emphasize
2D dynamics, thus failing to jointly learn the geometry, semantics, and
dynamics required for effective manipulation. In this paper, we present
DynaRend, a representation learning framework that learns 3D-aware and
dynamics-informed triplane features via masked reconstruction and future
prediction using differentiable volumetric rendering. By pretraining on
multi-view RGB-D video data, DynaRend jointly captures spatial geometry, future
dynamics, and task semantics in a unified triplane representation. The learned
representations can be effectively transferred to downstream robotic
manipulation tasks via action value map prediction. We evaluate DynaRend on two
challenging benchmarks, RLBench and Colosseum, as well as in real-world robotic
experiments, demonstrating substantial improvements in policy success rate,
generalization to environmental perturbations, and real-world applicability
across diverse manipulation tasks.

### [257] [Global-State-Free Obstacle Avoidance for Quadrotor Control in Air-Ground Cooperation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24315)
*Baozhe Zhang,Xinwei Chen,Qingcheng Chen,Chao Xu,Fei Gao,Yanjun Cao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces CoNi-OA, a LiDAR-based, modulation-driven obstacle avoidance method for UAV-UGV cooperation in non-inertial frames that operates without global state estimation or obstacle prediction, enabling real-time, collision-free trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CoNi-MPC relies on relative states but lacks environmental information, making obstacle avoidance difficult in unknown or featureless settings; a fast, local solution is needed for UAV-UGV teams.

Method: From a single UAV LiDAR frame, compute a modulation matrix that directly modulates the quadrotor‚Äôs velocity in the UGV‚Äôs non-inertial frame to avoid obstacles, without building obstacle models or predicting motion; achieves real-time trajectory generation (<5 ms per iteration).

Result: A modulation-based obstacle avoidance algorithm tailored for UAV-UGV cooperation in non-inertial frames, enabling rapid, real-time trajectory updates using only single-frame LiDAR data and maintaining safety in static/dynamic environments.

Conclusion: This approach removes dependence on global state estimation and obstacle prediction, enhancing safety and responsiveness for cooperative UAV-UGV tasks, and broadening applicability to unknown or featureless environments.

Abstract: CoNi-MPC provides an efficient framework for UAV control in air-ground
cooperative tasks by relying exclusively on relative states, eliminating the
need for global state estimation. However, its lack of environmental
information poses significant challenges for obstacle avoidance. To address
this issue, we propose a novel obstacle avoidance algorithm, Cooperative
Non-inertial frame-based Obstacle Avoidance (CoNi-OA), designed explicitly for
UAV-UGV cooperative scenarios without reliance on global state estimation or
obstacle prediction. CoNi-OA uniquely utilizes a single frame of raw LiDAR data
from the UAV to generate a modulation matrix, which directly adjusts the
quadrotor's velocity to achieve obstacle avoidance. This modulation-based
method enables real-time generation of collision-free trajectories within the
UGV's non-inertial frame, significantly reducing computational demands (less
than 5 ms per iteration) while maintaining safety in dynamic and unpredictable
environments. The key contributions of this work include: (1) a
modulation-based obstacle avoidance algorithm specifically tailored for UAV-UGV
cooperation in non-inertial frames without global states; (2) rapid, real-time
trajectory generation based solely on single-frame LiDAR data, removing the
need for obstacle modeling or prediction; and (3) adaptability to both static
and dynamic environments, thus extending applicability to featureless or
unknown scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional 3D scanning is costly and scales poorly; indoor robotics needs scalable, navigable representations from readily available data, addressing artifacts on sparsely observed floors.

Method: Extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to create clean ground planes (Floor-Aware Gaussian Splatting) and perform mesh-free traversability checking by analyzing rendered views to construct a topological graph.

TL;DR: Proposes an optimal trajectory generation framework for 3D overhead cranes using differential flatness, incorporating nonlinear friction and collision constraints; shows friction modeling is essential for fast, safe trajectories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable fast, aggressive crane motions while ensuring safety, by incorporating realistic physical constraints (dry friction, collision avoidance) into trajectory planning.

Method: Apply differential flatness to crane dynamics to directly encode nonlinear friction, rope-payload collision avoidance, and swing constraints at the final point; validated via comparative simulations.

Result: Simulations reveal that ignoring dry friction causes actuator saturation and collisions; incorporating friction yields safer, faster trajectories.

Conclusion: Friction modeling is fundamental for achieving fast and safe crane trajectories using this differential-flatness-based framework.

Abstract: This paper presents an optimal trajectory generation method for 3D overhead
cranes by leveraging differential flatness. This framework enables the direct
inclusion of complex physical and dynamic constraints, such as nonlinear
friction and collision avoidance for both payload and rope. Our approach allows
for aggressive movements by constraining payload swing only at the final point.
A comparative simulation study validates our approach, demonstrating that
neglecting dry friction leads to actuator saturation and collisions. The
results show that friction modeling is a fundamental requirement for fast and
safe crane trajectories.

### [260] [Supervisory Measurement-Guided Noise Covariance Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24508)
*Haoying Li,Yifan Peng,Junfeng Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A bilevel optimization framework estimates sensor noise covariances by factorizing the joint likelihood of odometry and supervisory measurements, enabling efficient parallel estimation with lower-level invariant EKF trajectory estimation and upper-level gradient updates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensor noise covariances are hard to identify due to environmental variability and preprocessing, yet accurate covariances are crucial for proper sensor fusion; existing methods may be inefficient.

Method: Formulate noise covariance estimation as a Bayesian bilevel optimization that factorizes the joint likelihood into a chain structure. At the lower level, an invariant extended Kalman filter with state augmentation estimates trajectories. A derivative filter computes analytical gradients in parallel for upper-level gradient updates. The upper level refines the covariance to guide the lower-level estimation.

Result: Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show higher efficiency than existing baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed bilevel, factorized approach yields efficient, scalable covariance estimation that improves state estimation under varying noise conditions and environmental variability.

Abstract: Reliable state estimation hinges on accurate specification of sensor noise
covariances, which weigh heterogeneous measurements. In practice, these
covariances are difficult to identify due to environmental variability,
front-end preprocessing, and other reasons. We address this by formulating
noise covariance estimation as a bilevel optimization that, from a Bayesian
perspective, factorizes the joint likelihood of so-called odometry and
supervisory measurements, thereby balancing information utilization with
computational efficiency. The factorization converts the nested Bayesian
dependency into a chain structure, enabling efficient parallel computation: at
the lower level, an invariant extended Kalman filter with state augmentation
estimates trajectories, while a derivative filter computes analytical gradients
in parallel for upper-level gradient updates. The upper level refines the
covariance to guide the lower-level estimation. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets show that our method achieves higher efficiency over
existing baselines.

### [261] [Stochastic Prize-Collecting Games: Strategic Planning in Multi-Robot Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24515)
*Malintha Fernando,Petter √ñgren,Silun Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPCG extends the Team Orienteering Problem to self-interested agents under energy constraints and stochastic transitions. It proves a unique pure Nash equilibrium that matches the TOP solution under a rank-based conflict rule, introduces Ordinal Rank Search (ORS) and Fictitious Ordinal Response Learning (FORL) for scalable learning, and achieves 87‚Äì95% of TOP optimality with good generalization and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model competitive, reward-scarce multi-robot environments where agents act selfishly and must operate under uncertainty; existing TOP assumes cooperative agents, which is inadequate for competitive settings.

Method: Theoretically analyze SPCGs on complete and star graphs to prove a unique pure Nash equilibrium that coincides with a TOP solution under a rank-based conflict resolution rule. Develop ORS to infer local ordinal ranks and FORL to learn best-response policies against higher-ranked opponents. Empirically evaluate on road networks and synthetic graphs across dynamic and stationary prize distributions, comparing against global-index training and other multi-agent methods.

Result: Existence of a unique pure Nash equilibrium in SPCGs that aligns with an equivalent TOP solution under rank-based conflict resolution. ORS reduces state aliasing and scales better with team size. FORL yields policies that generalize better to prize imbalances. Learned policies achieve 87‚Äì95% of the TOP optimum (via MILP).

Conclusion: SPCG with ORS and FORL provides scalable, robust planning for competitive multi-robot teams under uncertainty, achieving near-optimal performance relative to centralized TOP solutions and demonstrating good generalization to changing prize distributions.

Abstract: The Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) generalizes many real-world multi-robot
scheduling and routing tasks that occur in autonomous mobility, aerial
logistics, and surveillance applications. While many flavors of the TOP exist
for planning in multi-robot systems, they assume that all the robots cooperate
toward a single objective; thus, they do not extend to settings where the
robots compete in reward-scarce environments. We propose Stochastic
Prize-Collecting Games (SPCG) as an extension of the TOP to plan in the
presence of self-interested robots operating on a graph, under energy
constraints and stochastic transitions. A theoretical study on complete and
star graphs establishes that there is a unique pure Nash equilibrium in SPCGs
that coincides with the optimal routing solution of an equivalent TOP given a
rank-based conflict resolution rule. This work proposes two algorithms: Ordinal
Rank Search (ORS) to obtain the ''ordinal rank'' --one's effective rank in
temporarily-formed local neighborhoods during the games' stages, and Fictitious
Ordinal Response Learning (FORL) to obtain best-response policies against one's
senior-rank opponents. Empirical evaluations conducted on road networks and
synthetic graphs under both dynamic and stationary prize distributions show
that 1) the state-aliasing induced by OR-conditioning enables learning policies
that scale more efficiently to large team sizes than those trained with the
global index, and 2) Policies trained with FORL generalize better to imbalanced
prize distributions than those with other multi-agent training methods.
Finally, the learned policies in the SPCG achieved between 87% and 95%
optimality compared to an equivalent TOP solution obtained by mixed-integer
linear programming.

*Yuan Shen,Yuze Hong,Guangyang Zeng,Tengfei Zhang,Pui Yi Chui,Ziyang Hong,Junfeng Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GeVI-SLAM advances gravity-aware stereo VI SLAM for underwater robots, enabling stable 6-DOF tracking with a 4-DOF PnP and a bias-eliminated, consistent estimator, plus adaptive IMU weighting‚Äîachieving higher accuracy and stability with reduced computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater VI SLAM faces severe visual degeneracy and insufficient IMU excitation, causing scale, pitch/roll coupling, and pose estimation challenges. A gravity-informed, efficient approach is needed to maintain reliable localization and mapping in low-dynamic and feature-poor underwater environments.

Method: Leverage stereo camera direct depth to avoid scale estimation during IMU initialization. Use precise gravity initialization to decouple pitch and roll and solve a 4-DOF PnP for pose tracking with a minimal 3-point solver within RANSAC. Introduce a bias-eliminated 4-DOF PnP estimator with provable consistency so relative pose converges to the true value as features increase. For dynamic motion, refine the full 6-DOF pose while jointly estimating IMU covariance to adaptively weight the gravity prior.

Result: Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world datasets show GeVI-SLAM achieves higher accuracy and greater stability than state-of-the-art methods, with faster outlier rejection and robust performance under low acceleration dynamics.

Conclusion: Gravity-enhanced, stereo VI SLAM provides a robust solution for underwater localization and mapping by decoupling gravity-anchored components, enabling a consistent, efficient 4-DOF PnP-based tracking and adaptive IMU weighting, while maintaining full 6-DOF refinement for dynamic motion.

Abstract: Accurate visual inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (VI SLAM) for
underwater robots remains a significant challenge due to frequent visual
degeneracy and insufficient inertial measurement unit (IMU) motion excitation.
In this paper, we present GeVI-SLAM, a gravity-enhanced stereo VI SLAM system
designed to address these issues. By leveraging the stereo camera's direct
depth estimation ability, we eliminate the need to estimate scale during IMU
initialization, enabling stable operation even under low acceleration dynamics.
With precise gravity initialization, we decouple the pitch and roll from the
pose estimation and solve a 4 degrees of freedom (DOF) Perspective-n-Point
(PnP) problem for pose tracking. This allows the use of a minimal 3-point
solver, which significantly reduces computational time to reject outliers
within a Random Sample Consensus framework. We further propose a
bias-eliminated 4-DOF PnP estimator with provable consistency, ensuring the
relative pose converges to the true value as the feature number increases. To
handle dynamic motion, we refine the full 6-DOF pose while jointly estimating
the IMU covariance, enabling adaptive weighting of the gravity prior. Extensive
experiments on simulated and real-world data demonstrate that GeVI-SLAM
achieves higher accuracy and greater stability compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hierarchical planning for robotic inspection under uncertainty: global view-plan from historical maps plus local view replanning to adapt to current morphology; validated on a quadrupedal robot in subterranean mines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty between environment models and real site conditions (morphology changes, obstructions) can disrupt inspection routes. A framework is needed to preserve global coverage while adapting locally.

Method: A two-level hierarchy: (a) generate an initial global view-plan for regions of interest using a historical map; (b) perform local view replanning to adapt to the current inspection scene morphology, preserving global coverage while enabling reactive local adaptation. Implemented on a quadrupedal robot and validated in real-world subterranean mines.

Result: The approach was validated through real-world subterranean mine deployments with a quadrupedal robot, demonstrating robustness to environment uncertainty and successful completion of inspection tasks.

Conclusion: A hierarchical planning framework effectively combines global planning with local adaptability to handle environment uncertainty in robotic inspection and can generalize to similar tasks.

Abstract: In this work, we present a hierarchical framework designed to support robotic
inspection under environment uncertainty. By leveraging a known environment
model, existing methods plan and safely track inspection routes to visit points
of interest. However, discrepancies between the model and actual site
conditions, caused by either natural or human activities, can alter the surface
morphology or introduce path obstructions. To address this challenge, the
proposed framework divides the inspection task into: (a) generating the initial
global view-plan for region of interests based on a historical map and (b)
local view replanning to adapt to the current morphology of the inspection
scene. The proposed hierarchy preserves global coverage objectives while
enabling reactive adaptation to the local surface morphology. This enables the
local autonomy to remain robust against environment uncertainty and complete
the inspection tasks. We validate the approach through deployments in
real-world subterranean mines using quadrupedal robot.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A Unified Iterative Calibration (UIC) framework for joint calibration of DVL extrinsics and clock offsets using a Gaussian Process motion prior within a MAP estimation, featuring an efficient alternating update scheme and provable initialization, applicable beyond DVL to IMU/cameras, and validated by simulations and real-world tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calibration of extrinsics and time offsets is crucial for underwater SLAM but remains insufficiently explored. Existing DVL calibration methods are limited to particular sensor configurations or rely on oversimplified assumptions and do not jointly estimate translational extrinsics and time offsets.

Method: Formulates calibration as a MAP estimation with a Gaussian Process motion prior for high-fidelity motion interpolation. The algorithm alternates between GP-based motion state updates and gradient-based calibration variable updates, supported by a provably statistically consistent initialization scheme. The framework is extendable to IMU, cameras and other modalities, and an open-source DVL-camera calibration toolbox is released.

Result: Simulations and real-world tests validate the approach, showing high-fidelity motion interpolation and reliable initialization. The method generalizes to multi-sensor setups beyond underwater DVL-camera configurations.

Conclusion: UIC provides a general, effective calibration framework for multi-sensor setups, enabling joint estimation of translational extrinsics and time offsets with GP priors. Its components‚ÄîMAP with GP priors and provable initialization‚Äîare broadly applicable, and the authors provide open-source toolbox resources.

Abstract: The calibration of extrinsic parameters and clock offsets between sensors for
high-accuracy performance in underwater SLAM systems remains insufficiently
explored. Existing methods for Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) calibration are
either constrained to specific sensor configurations or rely on oversimplified
assumptions, and none jointly estimate translational extrinsics and time
offsets. We propose a Unified Iterative Calibration (UIC) framework for general
DVL sensor setups, formulated as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation with a
Gaussian Process (GP) motion prior for high-fidelity motion interpolation. UIC
alternates between efficient GP-based motion state updates and gradient-based
calibration variable updates, supported by a provably statistically consistent
sequential initialization scheme. The proposed UIC can be applied to IMU,
cameras and other modalities as co-sensors. We release an open-source
DVL-camera calibration toolbox. Beyond underwater applications, several aspects
of UIC-such as the integration of GP priors for MAP-based calibration and the
design of provably reliable initialization procedures-are broadly applicable to
other multi-sensor calibration problems. Finally, simulations and real-world
tests validate our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of learning precise, high-performance jumping policies for legged robots, addressing sparse rewards and reliance on reference trajectories, and improving Sim2Real transfer by combining curriculum RL, reward shaping, and smart initialization.

Method: Develop separate vertical and horizontal jumping policies within a curriculum-based RL framework; densify sparse rewards using projectile motion laws; apply a reference state initialization scheme to accelerate exploration without reference trajectories; couple with a walking policy to enable versatile locomotion; demonstrate through experiments including varied terrain and omnidirectional potential.

Result: Experimental validation demonstrates horizontal jumps up to 1.25 m with centimeter accuracy and vertical jumps up to 1.0 m; walking on varied terrains validated; surpasses prior work and crossing Sim2Real gap.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables precise, high-performance, and versatile locomotion combining walking and jumping, with potential for omnidirectional jumping with minor modifications.

Abstract: This paper presents a curriculum-based reinforcement learning framework for
training precise and high-performance jumping policies for the robot `Olympus'.
Separate policies are developed for vertical and horizontal jumps, leveraging a
simple yet effective strategy. First, we densify the inherently sparse jumping
reward using the laws of projectile motion. Next, a reference state
initialization scheme is employed to accelerate the exploration of dynamic
jumping behaviors without reliance on reference trajectories. We also present a
walking policy that, when combined with the jumping policies, unlocks versatile
and dynamic locomotion capabilities. Comprehensive testing validates walking on
varied terrain surfaces and jumping performance that exceeds previous works,
effectively crossing the Sim2Real gap. Experimental validation demonstrates
horizontal jumps up to 1.25 m with centimeter accuracy and vertical jumps up to
1.0 m. Additionally, we show that with only minor modifications, the proposed
method can be used to learn omnidirectional jumping.

TL;DR: GroundLoc is a LiDAR-only outdoor localization pipeline that projects LiDAR data into a BEV ground-focused map and uses R2D2 or SIFT to register 2D raster maps, achieving sub-50 cm ATE across multi-sensor setups and outperforming SOTA on SemanticKITTI/HeLiPR with compact maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust, scalable LiDAR-based localization in large outdoor environments using pre-built maps, while handling multi-sensor data and keeping map storage minimal. BEV ground projection and keypoint-based registration aim to improve accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Project LiDAR into Bird's-Eye View ground-area BEV images; perform place recognition using R2D2 or classical SIFT to identify keypoints; register BEV map to prior 2D raster maps stored for each area; supports multiple sensors; maps are small (4 MB per km2) and can be created from a single drive.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art on SemanticKITTI and HeLiPR across sensors; multi-session localization yields average trajectory error well below 50 cm on all Ouster OS2 128 sequences; online runtime satisfied.

Conclusion: GroundLoc demonstrates accurate, efficient LiDAR-only localization with compact 2D raster priors, cross-sensor compatibility, and practical online performance, enabling scalable large-scale outdoor localization.

Abstract: In this letter, we introduce GroundLoc, a LiDAR-only localization pipeline
designed to localize a mobile robot in large-scale outdoor environments using
prior maps. GroundLoc employs a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) image projection focusing
on the perceived ground area and utilizes the place recognition network R2D2,
or alternatively, the non-learning approach Scale-Invariant Feature Transform
(SIFT), to identify and select keypoints for BEV image map registration. Our
results demonstrate that GroundLoc outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the
SemanticKITTI and HeLiPR datasets across various sensors. In the multi-session
localization evaluation, GroundLoc reaches an Average Trajectory Error (ATE)
well below 50 cm on all Ouster OS2 128 sequences while meeting online runtime
requirements. The system supports various sensor models, as evidenced by
evaluations conducted with Velodyne HDL-64E, Ouster OS2 128, Aeva Aeries II,
and Livox Avia sensors. The prior maps are stored as 2D raster image maps,
which can be created from a single drive and require only 4 MB of storage per
square kilometer. The source code is available at

*Li Li,Tobias Brinkmann,Till Temmen,Markus Eisenbarth,Jakob Andert*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Transformer-enhanced CVAE (CVAE-T) generates multi-agent roundabout traffic scenarios; achieves accurate reconstruction and realistic, diverse synthetic data with partially disentangled latent factors influencing entry/exit timing and velocity; supports validation of intelligent driving functions and data augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient, reproducible, and comprehensive scenario-based testing for intelligent driving functions, especially in challenging roundabout environments with rich dynamics that are underexplored in current research.

Method: Develop a Transformer-enhanced Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE-T) to model multi-agent roundabout traffic scenarios. The model learns a latent representation conditioned on context to generate diverse scenarios. It evaluates interactive behavior using two KPIs and analyzes latent space for disentanglement, linking certain latent dimensions to attributes like entry timing, exit timing, and velocity profiles.

Result: The CVAE-T accurately reconstructs original scenarios and generates realistic, diverse synthetic scenarios. KPIs indicate meaningful interactive behavior in generated data. Latent space shows partial disentanglement, with some dimensions affecting entry timing, exit timing, and velocity, enabling controlled scenario generation.

Conclusion: CVAE-T is effective for validating intelligent driving functions involving multi-agent interactions in roundabouts and can augment data for development and iterative improvement of automated driving systems.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of intelligent driving functions into
serial-produced vehicles, ensuring their functionality and robustness poses
greater challenges. Compared to traditional road testing, scenario-based
virtual testing offers significant advantages in terms of time and cost
efficiency, reproducibility, and exploration of edge cases. We propose a
Transformer-enhanced Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE-T) model for
generating multi-agent traffic scenarios in roundabouts, which are
characterized by high vehicle dynamics and complex layouts, yet remain
relatively underexplored in current research. The results show that the
proposed model can accurately reconstruct original scenarios and generate
realistic, diverse synthetic scenarios. Besides, two Key-Performance-Indicators
(KPIs) are employed to evaluate the interactive behavior in the generated
scenarios. Analysis of the latent space reveals partial disentanglement, with
several latent dimensions exhibiting distinct and interpretable effects on
scenario attributes such as vehicle entry timing, exit timing, and velocity
profiles. The results demonstrate the model's capability to generate scenarios
for the validation of intelligent driving functions involving multi-agent
interactions, as well as to augment data for their development and iterative
improvement.

*Jiaxuan Zhang,Yuquan Leng,Yixuan Guo,Chenglong Fu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Inertial-sensor-based obstacle negotiation for transfemoral prosthetics using a GA-optimized neural network and gait progression predictor to estimate thigh/knee angles and knee actuation, demonstrating noise robustness and high gait-phase accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assist amputees with powered transfemoral prosthetics in navigating obstacles and complex terrain by accurately predicting joint angles and gait progression.

Method: An inertial sensor is placed on the sound ankle to guide obstacle-crossing. A genetic algorithm optimizes the neural network structure predicting thigh/knee joint angles. A gait progression prediction algorithm determines the actuation angle index for the prosthetic knee motor, thereby defining thigh and knee angles and gait progression.

Result: With Gaussian noise on thigh angle data having standard deviation < 1, the method effectively suppresses noise, achieving 100% gait-phase estimation accuracy at up to 150 Hz. Thigh angle prediction error: 8.71%; knee angle prediction error: 6.78%.

Conclusion: The approach can accurately predict gait progression and joint angles, offering practical value for obstacle negotiation in powered transfemoral prosthetics.

Abstract: For amputees with powered transfemoral prosthetics, navigating obstacles or
complex terrain remains challenging. This study addresses this issue by using
an inertial sensor on the sound ankle to guide obstacle-crossing movements. A
genetic algorithm computes the optimal neural network structure to predict the
required angles of the thigh and knee joints. A gait progression prediction
algorithm determines the actuation angle index for the prosthetic knee motor,
ultimately defining the necessary thigh and knee angles and gait progression.
Results show that when the standard deviation of Gaussian noise added to the
thigh angle data is less than 1, the method can effectively eliminate noise
interference, achieving 100\% accuracy in gait phase estimation under 150 Hz,
with thigh angle prediction error being 8.71\% and knee angle prediction error
being 6.78\%. These findings demonstrate the method's ability to accurately
predict gait progression and joint angles, offering significant practical value
for obstacle negotiation in powered transfemoral prosthetics.

### [269] [Fare: Failure Resilience in Learned Visual Navigation Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24680)
*Zishuo Wang,Joel Loo,David Hsu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Fare enables failure-resilient imitation learning by integrating OOD detection and failure recognition with recovery heuristics, allowing policies to detect and recover from out-of-distribution failures without explicit failure data, improving long-range navigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IL policies often fail in out-of-distribution scenarios; there is a need to detect, understand, and automatically recover from such failures to achieve robust navigation.

Method: Introduce the Fare framework that embeds OOD-detection and failure recognition within imitation learning and pairs them with recovery heuristics. Notably, it does not require explicit failure data. The framework is validated on real-world experiments across two policy architectures to demonstrate cross-architecture failure recovery.

Result: Fare enables failure recovery across two policy architectures and improves robustness for long-range navigation in complex environments, demonstrating effective handling of OOD failures without explicit failure data.

Conclusion: Fare provides a practical pathway to building failure-resilient IL policies by coupling OOD detection/recognition with recovery heuristics, enabling robust real-world navigation.

Abstract: While imitation learning (IL) enables effective visual navigation, IL
policies are prone to unpredictable failures in out-of-distribution (OOD)
scenarios. We advance the notion of failure-resilient policies, which not only
detect failures but also recover from them automatically. Failure recognition
that identifies the factors causing failure is key to informing recovery: e.g.
pinpointing image regions triggering failure detections can provide cues to
guide recovery. We present Fare, a framework to construct failure-resilient IL
policies, embedding OOD-detection and recognition in them without using
explicit failure data, and pairing them with recovery heuristics. Real-world
experiments show that Fare enables failure recovery across two different policy
architectures, enabling robust long-range navigation in complex environments.

### [270] [A Framework for the Systematic Evaluation of Obstacle Avoidance and Object-Aware Controllers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24683)
*Caleb Escobedo,Nataliya Nechyporenko,Shreyas Kadekodi,Alessandro Roncone*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework to analyze object-aware robot controllers for obstacle avoidance focusing on kinematics, motion profiles, and virtual constraints; evaluates three controllers and highlights gaps; aims to enable design, comparison, and benchmarking of obstacle avoidance methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure safe real-time operation of robots in dynamic environments by systematically evaluating how object-aware control strategies handle kinematics, timing, and constraints.

Method: Proposes a framework built on three design considerations (kinematics, motion profiles, virtual constraints), uses verification via basic robot-obstacle experiments, and compares three representative object-aware controllers using metrics tied to these considerations.

Result: The analysis shows that many object-aware controllers neglect kinematic considerations, continuity of control points, and stability in movement profiles; the framework successfully enables comparison and benchmarking.

Conclusion: The framework can be used in future work to design, compare, and benchmark obstacle avoidance methods, guiding improvements in kinematic integration, control point continuity, and stable motion profiles.

Abstract: Real-time control is an essential aspect of safe robot operation in the real
world with dynamic objects. We present a framework for the analysis of
object-aware controllers, methods for altering a robot's motion to anticipate
and avoid possible collisions. This framework is focused on three design
considerations: kinematics, motion profiles, and virtual constraints.
Additionally, the analysis in this work relies on verification of robot
behaviors using fundamental robot-obstacle experimental scenarios. To showcase
the effectiveness of our method we compare three representative object-aware
controllers. The comparison uses metrics originating from the design
considerations. From the analysis, we find that the design of object-aware
controllers often lacks kinematic considerations, continuity of control points,
and stability in movement profiles. We conclude that this framework can be used
in the future to design, compare, and benchmark obstacle avoidance methods.

### [271] [Embodying Physical Computing into Soft Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24692)
*Jun Wang,Ziyang Zhou,Ardalan Kahak,Suyi Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Embodied physical computing in soft robots enables electronics-free, reprogrammable computation through analog oscillators, physical reservoir computing, and physical algorithmic computing to achieve complex behaviors like obstacle-avoidant locomotion and classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address robustness and intelligence gaps in soft robots by embedding computation directly into their physical substrates, enabling reprogrammable, adaptive behaviors without relying on traditional CMOS electronics.

Method: Proposes a framework for embedding physical computing in soft robots and surveys three strategies from the literature: analog oscillators, physical reservoir computing, and physical algorithmic computing, detailing how these embedded processors operate and interact with soft actuation/sensing.

Result: Embodied computers enable soft robots to perform complex tasks‚Äîe.g., obstacle-avoiding locomotion, payload/orientation classification, and logic-based programmability‚Äîwithout conventional electronics; the paper surveys current state-of-the-art and outlines a future development trajectory.

Conclusion: A perspective piece that articulates a framework for embodied physical computing in soft robotics, highlights three enabling strategies, and charts a roadmap for future research and development.

Abstract: Softening and onboarding computers and controllers is one of the final
frontiers in soft robotics towards their robustness and intelligence for
everyday use. In this regard, embodying soft and physical computing presents
exciting potential. Physical computing seeks to encode inputs into a mechanical
computing kernel and leverage the internal interactions among this kernel's
constituent elements to compute the output. Moreover, such input-to-output
evolution can be re-programmable. This perspective paper proposes a framework
for embodying physical computing into soft robots and discusses three unique
strategies in the literature: analog oscillators, physical reservoir computing,
and physical algorithmic computing. These embodied computers enable the soft
robot to perform complex behaviors that would otherwise require CMOS-based
electronics -- including coordinated locomotion with obstacle avoidance,
payload weight and orientation classification, and programmable operation based
on logical rules. This paper will detail the working principles of these
embodied physical computing methods, survey the current state-of-the-art, and
present a perspective for future development.

*Ovi Sarkar,Md Shafiuzzaman,Md. Faysal Ahamed,Golam Mahmud,Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: MSRANetV2 is a high-performing, interpretable CNN for colorectal tissue classification, achieving near-perfect AUC and top metrics on two public datasets, with Grad-CAM for visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CRC diagnosis is subjective and time-consuming; digital pathology with deep learning can improve accuracy and efficiency.

Method: A ResNet50V2-based CNN (MSRANetV2) with residual attention and squeeze-excitation blocks; multi-scale feature fusion via channel alignment/upsampling; five-fold cross-validation on CRC-VAL-HE-7K and NCT-CRC-HE-100K; Grad-CAM for explainability.

Result: On CRC-VAL-HE-7K: Precision 0.9884¬±0.0151, Recall 0.9900¬±0.0151, F1 0.9900¬±0.0145, AUC 0.9999¬±0.00006, Accuracy 0.9905¬±0.0025. On NCT-CRC-HE-100K: Precision 0.9904¬±0.0091, Recall 0.9900¬±0.0071, F1 0.9900¬±0.0071, AUC 0.9997¬±0.00016, Accuracy 0.9902¬±0.0006.

Conclusion: MSRANetV2 is a reliable, interpretable, high-performing architecture for classifying CRC tissues.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading worldwide cause of cancer-related
mortality, and the role of prompt precise detection is of paramount interest in
improving patient outcomes. Conventional diagnostic methods such as colonoscopy
and histological examination routinely exhibit subjectivity, are extremely
time-consuming, and are susceptible to variation. Through the development of
digital pathology, deep learning algorithms have become a powerful approach in
enhancing diagnostic precision and efficiency. In our work, we proposed a
convolutional neural network architecture named MSRANetV2, specially optimized
for the classification of colorectal tissue images. The model employs a
ResNet50V2 backbone, extended with residual attention mechanisms and
squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks, to extract deep semantic and fine-grained
spatial features. With channel alignment and upsampling operations, MSRANetV2
effectively fuses multi-scale representations, thereby enhancing the robustness
of the classification. We evaluated our model on a five-fold stratified
cross-validation strategy on two publicly available datasets: CRC-VAL-HE-7K and
NCT-CRC-HE-100K. The proposed model achieved remarkable average Precision,
recall, F1-score, AUC, and test accuracy were 0.9884 plus-minus 0.0151, 0.9900
plus-minus 0.0151, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0145, 0.9999 plus-minus 0.00006, and
0.9905 plus-minus 0.0025 on the 7K dataset. On the 100K dataset, they were
0.9904 plus-minus 0.0091, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0071, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0071,
0.9997 plus-minus 0.00016, and 0.9902 plus-minus 0.0006. Additionally, Grad-CAM
visualizations were incorporated to enhance model interpretability by
highlighting tissue areas that are medically relevant. These findings validate
that MSRANetV2 is a reliable, interpretable, and high-performing architectural
model for classifying CRC tissues.
