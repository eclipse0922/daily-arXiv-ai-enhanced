### [1] [Attention-Enhanced Prototypical Learning for Few-Shot Infrastructure Defect Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05266)
*Christina Thrainer,Md Meftahul Ferdaus,Mahdi Abdelguerfi,Christian Guetl,Steven Sloan,Kendall N. Niles,Ken Pathak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Enhanced Feature Pyramid Network (E-FPN) for few-shot semantic segmentation of culvert/sewer defects using prototypical learning and attention; demonstrates strong few-shot performance with an 8-way 5-shot setup, with notable gains from self-attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In infrastructure inspection, new defect categories often appear with scarce labeled examples. Traditional deep learning models require large labeled datasets and struggle to quickly adapt to new defect types, hindering timely maintenance decisions.

Method: Adaptive E-FPN encoder featuring InceptionSepConv blocks and depthwise separable convolutions for efficient multi-scale feature extraction; prototypical learning with masked average pooling to generate robust prototypes from small support sets; attention-based feature representation through global self-attention, local self-attention, and cross-attention.

Result: On challenging infrastructure inspection datasets, the method achieves 8-way 5-shot performance with 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU in 2-way classification testing; incorporating self-attention yields the largest gains, with ~2.57% F1 and ~2.9% mIoU over baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables rapid adaptation to new defect types with limited data, supporting more efficient and economical maintenance planning for critical infrastructure systems.

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation is vital for deep learning-based
infrastructure inspection applications, where labeled training examples are
scarce and expensive. Although existing deep learning frameworks perform well,
the need for extensive labeled datasets and the inability to learn new defect
categories with little data are problematic. We present our Enhanced Feature
Pyramid Network (E-FPN) framework for few-shot semantic segmentation of culvert
and sewer defect categories using a prototypical learning framework. Our
approach has three main contributions: (1) adaptive E-FPN encoder using
InceptionSepConv blocks and depth-wise separable convolutions for efficient
multi-scale feature extraction; (2) prototypical learning with masked average
pooling for powerful prototype generation from small support examples; and (3)
attention-based feature representation through global self-attention, local
self-attention and cross-attention. Comprehensive experimentation on
challenging infrastructure inspection datasets illustrates that the method
achieves excellent few-shot performance, with the best configuration being
8-way 5-shot training configuration at 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU in 2-way
classification testing. The self-attention method had the most significant
performance improvements, providing 2.57% F1-score and 2.9% mIoU gain over
baselines. Our framework addresses the critical need to rapidly respond to new
defect types in infrastructure inspection systems with limited new training
data that lead to more efficient and economical maintenance plans for critical
infrastructure systems.

### [2] [SkinMap: Weighted Full-Body Skin Segmentation for Robust Remote Photoplethysmography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05296)
*Zahra Maleki,Amirhossein Akbari,Amirhossein Binesh,Babak Khalaj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel skin segmentation method for rPPG that prioritizes skin regions to improve signal quality, robust to movement and lighting, enabling accurate heart rate estimation across diverse skin tones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) relies on skin color changes captured by a camera. Accurate unsupervised skin-region selection is crucial, yet challenging under movement and varying lighting. The paper introduces a segmentation approach to selectively extract skin areas while excluding interfering regions.

Method: A new skin segmentation technique that identifies and prioritizes skin regions across the body, suppresses non-skin areas (mouth, eyes, hair), and is robust to movement (e.g., talking, head rotations). It was evaluated on public datasets and a new SYNC-rPPG dataset designed to reflect real-world conditions.

Result: The method maintains low mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual heart rates even in challenging scenarios (talking, head rotation) where other methods fail. It shows high accuracy across a diverse range of skin tones and provides a more reliable signal extraction for rPPG in real-world conditions.

Conclusion: Prioritizing skin-region selection in rPPG segmentation improves signal quality and heart-rate estimation, making remote monitoring more feasible across diverse users and conditions. The SYNC-rPPG dataset supports evaluation under realistic conditions.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an innovative method for monitoring
heart rate and vital signs by using a simple camera to record a person, as long
as any part of their skin is visible. This low-cost, contactless approach helps
in remote patient monitoring, emotion analysis, smart vehicle utilization, and
more. Over the years, various techniques have been proposed to improve the
accuracy of this technology, especially given its sensitivity to lighting and
movement. In the unsupervised pipeline, it is necessary to first select skin
regions from the video to extract the rPPG signal from the skin color changes.
We introduce a novel skin segmentation technique that prioritizes skin regions
to enhance the quality of the extracted signal. It can detect areas of skin all
over the body, making it more resistant to movement, while removing areas such
as the mouth, eyes, and hair that may cause interference. Our model is
evaluated on publicly available datasets, and we also present a new dataset,
called SYNC-rPPG, to better represent real-world conditions. The results
indicate that our model demonstrates a prior ability to capture heartbeats in
challenging conditions, such as talking and head rotation, and maintain the
mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual heart rates, while other
methods fail to do so. In addition, we demonstrate high accuracy in detecting a
diverse range of skin tones, making this technique a promising option for
real-world applications.

### [3] [DeepAf: One-Shot Spatiospectral Auto-Focus Model for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05315)
*Yousef Yeganeh,Maximilian Frantzen,Michael Lee,Kun-Hsing Yu,Nassir Navab,Azade Farshad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Single-shot spatiospectral autofocus (DeepAf) for automated microscopy converts conventional microscopes into fast, accurate slide scanners with strong cross-lab generalization and good diagnostic performance at low magnification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Whole slide imaging (WSI) scanners are expensive, limiting access. Cheaper autofocus approaches suffer from inconsistent focus, time-consuming focal stacks, or poor generalization across tissue types and staining protocols.

Method: A hybrid architecture that fuses spatial and spectral features to predict the focal distance from a single image, automatically adjusting focusing parameters for optimal image quality and enabling cross-lab robustness.

Result: 80% reduction in focusing time vs stack-based methods; focus accuracy of 0.18 μm on same-lab data (comparable to 0.19 μm from dual-image methods) with half the input; 0.72% false focus rate and 90% predictions within depth of field across tests; 536-brain tissue study achieving 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification.

Conclusion: The proposed hardware–software design enables accessible, real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy.

Abstract: While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for
digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many
healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations:
automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue
morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks,
and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack
generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We
introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel
auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features
through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed
network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using
the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for
optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into
efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based
methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\mu}m on the same-lab samples,
matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\mu}m) with half the
input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with
only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of
field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our
system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a
significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This
results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible,
real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining
diagnostic accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DenseNet201 achieves 99.33% accuracy for eight-class mango leaf disease classification using fine-tuned transfer learning; other architectures show varying performance; demonstrates effectiveness of transfer learning for this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leaf diseases greatly affect mango yield and quality; automated, accurate detection is needed to support sustainable and intelligent agricultural management.

best results, achieving 99.33% accuracy with consistently strong metrics for
individual classes, particularly excelling in identifying Cutting Weevil and
Bacterial Canker. Moreover, ResNet152V2 and SeResNet152 provided strong
outcomes, whereas InceptionV3 and Xception exhibited lower performance in
visually similar categories like Sooty Mould and Powdery Mildew. The training

models. The capability of fine-tuned transfer learning models, for precise and
dependable multi-class mango leaf disease detection in intelligent agricultural
applications.

### [5] [Mitigating Diffusion Model Hallucinations with Dynamic Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05356)
*Kostas Triaridis,Alexandros Graikos,Aggelina Chatziagapi,Grigorios G. Chrysos,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-model hallucination problem due to mode smoothing is addressed by Dynamic Guidance, which sharpens the score only along artifact-prone directions during generation, reducing hallucinations while preserving semantic variations; claimed as first generation-time mitigation rather than post-hoc filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in diffusion models stem from excessive smoothing between data modes; there is a need to enable semantic interpolation without introducing artifacts.

Method: Introduce Dynamic Guidance that selectively sharpens the score function along pre-determined artifact directions during sampling.

Result: Significant reduction of hallucinations on controlled and natural image datasets; outperforms baselines.

Conclusion: Presents a novel generation-time approach to mitigate hallucinations in diffusion models; improves reliability and diversity.

Abstract: Diffusion models, despite their impressive demos, often produce hallucinatory
samples with structural inconsistencies that lie outside of the support of the
true data distribution. Such hallucinations can be attributed to excessive
smoothing between modes of the data distribution. However, semantic
interpolations are often desirable and can lead to generation diversity, thus
we believe a more nuanced solution is required. In this work, we introduce
Dynamic Guidance, which tackles this issue. Dynamic Guidance mitigates
hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the
pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid
semantic variations. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that
addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc
filtering. Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both
controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines.

### [6] [LightCache: Memory-Efficient, Training-Free Acceleration for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05367)
*Yang Xiao,Gen Li,Kaiyuan Deng,Yushu Wu,Zheng Zhan,Yanzhi Wang,Xiaolong Ma,Bo Hui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free, stage-aware cache-based acceleration for diffusion video generation, reducing memory with asynchronous cache swapping, feature chunking, and latent slicing while preserving speed and quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address memory surges in cache-based speedups for diffusion-model video generation, enabling faster inference without large memory footprints.

Method: Decompose inference into encoding, denoising, and decoding. Introduce three stage-specific strategies: asynchronous cache swapping, feature chunking, and slicing latents for decoding. Ensure overhead is lower than acceleration gains and evaluate against baselines.

Result: Faster inference and lower memory usage than baseline, with quality degradation kept within an acceptable range; code released at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: Stage-specific memory-reduction techniques for diffusion-based video generation yield practical speedups with manageable quality trade-offs; the approach is training-free and analyzes stage characteristics to tailor optimizations.

Abstract: Training-free acceleration has emerged as an advanced research area in video
generation based on diffusion models. The redundancy of latents in diffusion
model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper,
we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding
stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to
substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we
analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose
stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous
Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same
time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies
remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the
baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage,
while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range. The Code is
available at https://github.com/NKUShaw/LightCache .

### [7] [See the past: Time-Reversed Scene Reconstruction from Thermal Traces Using Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05408)
*Kebin Contreras,Luis Toscano-Palomino,Mauro Dalla Mura,Jorge Bacca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Time-reversed imaging framework that uses paired RGB-thermal data and VLM-guided diffusion to reconstruct plausible past scene states from seconds earlier, validated in controlled scenarios up to 120 seconds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To recover recent events hidden in present observations by exploiting residual thermal traces that RGB misses; enabling forensic/scene-analysis capabilities.

Method: Combine RGB-thermal pairs with a constrained diffusion process. One Visual-Language Model fabricates scene descriptions; a second VLM guides reconstruction to ensure semantic and structural consistency with the descriptions, forming a feedback loop.

Result: Feasibility demonstrated: plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier; first step toward time-reversed imaging using thermal traces; evidence from three controlled scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for reconstructing past scene states from thermal traces using multimodal guidance, but is demonstrated only in controlled settings; effectiveness in unconstrained real-world environments remains to be tested, with improvements needed in robustness and scalability.

Abstract: Recovering the past from present observations is an intriguing challenge with
potential applications in forensics and scene analysis. Thermal imaging,
operating in the infrared range, provides access to otherwise invisible
information. Since humans are typically warmer (37 C -98.6 F) than their
surroundings, interactions such as sitting, touching, or leaning leave residual
heat traces. These fading imprints serve as passive temporal codes, allowing
for the inference of recent events that exceed the capabilities of RGB cameras.
This work proposes a time-reversed reconstruction framework that uses paired
RGB and thermal images to recover scene states from a few seconds earlier. The
proposed approach couples Visual-Language Models (VLMs) with a constrained
diffusion process, where one VLM generates scene descriptions and another
guides image reconstruction, ensuring semantic and structural consistency. The
method is evaluated in three controlled scenarios, demonstrating the
feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier,
providing a first step toward time-reversed imaging from thermal traces.

### [8] [Personalizing Retrieval using Joint Embeddings or "the Return of Fluffy"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05411)
*Bruno Korbar,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes pi-map, a trainable mapping from object-instance image embeddings to text tokens to enable compound CLIP-based retrieval with a natural language description; kept CLIP encoders frozen; simple one-time per-object training; achieves state-of-the-art on personalized retrieval benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable retrieval via compound queries that combine an object's instance information from an image with a natural language description of its actions or location, overcoming the gap between visual instance representations and text queries.

Method: Introduce a trainable mapping network (pi-map) that translates a local image embedding of an object instance into a text token. This token is combined with a natural language query to form a CLIP-compatible input for text encoding and image retrieval. The mapping is trained once per object instance while keeping CLIP text and image encoders fixed.

Result: The pi-map approach improves the state of the art on two benchmarks for personalized retrieval.

Conclusion: Trainable, per-object textual token mapping enables effective, flexible retrieval using compound queries without fine-tuning the backbone CLIP models, advancing personalized image retrieval.

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to be able to retrieve images using a compound
query that combines object instance information from an image, with a natural
text description of what that object is doing or where it is. For example, to
retrieve an image of "Fluffy the unicorn (specified by an image) on someone's
head". To achieve this we design a mapping network that can "translate" from a
local image embedding (of the object instance) to a text token, such that the
combination of the token and a natural language query is suitable for CLIP
style text encoding, and image retrieval. Generating a text token in this
manner involves a simple training procedure, that only needs to be performed
once for each object instance. We show that our approach of using a trainable
mapping network, termed pi-map, together with frozen CLIP text and image
encoders, improves the state of the art on two benchmarks designed to assess
personalized retrieval.

### [9] [ArchitectHead: Continuous Level of Detail Control for 3D Gaussian Head Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05488)
*Peizhi Yan,Rabab Ward,Qiang Tang,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArchitectHead introduces a UV-feature-field framework for continuous level-of-detail control in 3D Gaussian head avatars, enabling dynamic Gaussian resampling for scalable quality and speed without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting-based head avatars rely on tens of thousands of fixed Gaussians, making fine-grained control of rendering detail costly and inflexible; there is a need for continuous, retraining-free LOD adjustment to balance quality and efficiency in practical applications.

Method: Parameterize Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space using a multi-level learnable UV feature field. A lightweight neural network decoder translates latent UV features into 3D Gaussian attributes. The number of Gaussians is controlled by dynamically resampling feature maps from the UV field at the target resolutions, enabling continuous LOD without retraining.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art quality in self- and cross-identity reenactment at the highest LOD. Maintains near state-of-the-art performance at lower LODs. At the lowest LOD, uses only 6.2% of Gaussians with moderate quality degradation (L1 +7.9%, PSNR -0.97%, SSIM -0.6%, LPIPS +24.1%) and nearly doubles rendering speed.

Conclusion: ArchitectHead provides an effective, training-free pathway to continuously adjustable detail for 3D Gaussian head avatars by leveraging UV feature fields and dynamic Gaussian resampling, delivering optimal high-LOD quality with substantial efficiency gains at low-LOD.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic and real-time
rendering of 3D head avatars. Existing 3DGS-based avatars typically rely on
tens of thousands of 3D Gaussian points (Gaussians), with the number of
Gaussians fixed after training. However, many practical applications require
adjustable levels of detail (LOD) to balance rendering efficiency and visual
quality. In this work, we propose "ArchitectHead", the first framework for
creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our
key idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose
a UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode
their latent features. A lightweight neural network-based decoder then
transforms these latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes for rendering.
ArchitectHead controls the number of Gaussians by dynamically resampling
feature maps from the UV feature field at the desired resolutions. This method
enables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining.
Experimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while
maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. At the lowest LOD, our method
uses only 6.2\% of the Gaussians while the quality degrades moderately (L1 Loss
+7.9\%, PSNR --0.97\%, SSIM --0.6\%, LPIPS Loss +24.1\%), and the rendering
speed nearly doubles.

### [10] [Human Action Recognition from Point Clouds over Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05506)
*James Dickens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D point-cloud–based HAR pipeline with segmentation, tracking, and voxel-based backbones that achieves competitive NTU RGB-D 120 results and 89.3% cross-subject accuracy with sensor and estimated depth fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of consumer depth sensors and Lidar enables dense 3D data, suggesting a third HAR paradigm beyond skeletal and video-based methods.

Method: Segment humans from scenes, track individuals over time, and perform body-part segmentation. The pipeline supports depth sensors and monocular depth estimation. The backbone combines point-based representations with sparse convolution over voxel-mapped point cloud sequences, enhanced by auxiliary features (surface normals, color, IR intensity, and body-part labels). An ensemble of sensor-based and estimated-depth inputs is used.

Result: On NTU RGB-D 120, the approach is competitive with existing skeletal-based methods. The ensemble setup achieves 89.3% accuracy in cross-subject evaluation (training subjects different from testing subjects).

Conclusion: The results support the viability of 3D point-cloud–based HAR and show that combining multiple 3D input modalities can yield strong cross-subject performance.

Abstract: Recent research into human action recognition (HAR) has focused predominantly
on skeletal action recognition and video-based methods. With the increasing
availability of consumer-grade depth sensors and Lidar instruments, there is a
growing opportunity to leverage dense 3D data for action recognition, to
develop a third way. This paper presents a novel approach for recognizing
actions from 3D videos by introducing a pipeline that segments human point
clouds from the background of a scene, tracks individuals over time, and
performs body part segmentation. The method supports point clouds from both
depth sensors and monocular depth estimation. At the core of the proposed HAR
framework is a novel backbone for 3D action recognition, which combines
point-based techniques with sparse convolutional networks applied to
voxel-mapped point cloud sequences. Experiments incorporate auxiliary point
features including surface normals, color, infrared intensity, and body part
parsing labels, to enhance recognition accuracy. Evaluation on the NTU RGB- D
120 dataset demonstrates that the method is competitive with existing skeletal
action recognition algorithms. Moreover, combining both sensor-based and
estimated depth inputs in an ensemble setup, this approach achieves 89.3%
accuracy when different human subjects are considered for training and testing,
outperforming previous point cloud action recognition methods.

### [11] [Be Tangential to Manifold: Discovering Riemannian Metric for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05509)
*Shinnosuke Saito,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduce a Riemannian metric on the diffusion model's noise space, informed by the score function's Jacobian, to align diffusion geodesics with the learned data manifold and enable more natural interpolations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models lack an explicit, low-dimensional latent space, hindering manifold-aware analysis (e.g., interpolation, editing). Conventional interpolation traverses high-density regions and may not lie on the data manifold, resulting in unnatural transitions.

Method: Define a Riemannian metric on the noise space using the score function's Jacobian to capture local tangent spaces of the data manifold. Use this metric to compute geodesics that stay on or parallel to the manifold, and compare against density-based and naive baselines in image interpolation experiments.

Result: The geometry-guided geodesics produce perceptually more natural and faithful image interpolations than existing density-based and naive baselines.

Conclusion: The proposed metric enables manifold-aware navigation of diffusion models, improving interpolation fidelity and enabling future manifold-based analysis and editing of diffusion-generated content.

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful deep generative models (DGMs) that generate
high-fidelity, diverse content. However, unlike classical DGMs, they lack an
explicit, tractable low-dimensional latent space that parameterizes the data
manifold. This absence limits manifold-aware analysis and operations, such as
interpolation and editing. Existing interpolation methods for diffusion models
typically follow paths through high-density regions, which are not necessarily
aligned with the data manifold and can yield perceptually unnatural
transitions. To exploit the data manifold learned by diffusion models, we
propose a novel Riemannian metric on the noise space, inspired by recent
findings that the Jacobian of the score function captures the tangent spaces to
the local data manifold. This metric encourages geodesics in the noise space to
stay within or run parallel to the learned data manifold. Experiments on image
interpolation show that our metric produces perceptually more natural and
faithful transitions than existing density-based and naive baselines.

### [12] [Teamwork: Collaborative Diffusion with Low-rank Coordination and Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05532)
*Sam Sartor,Pieter Peers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Teamwork is a unified approach to extend pretrained diffusion models to handle more input/output channels and new tasks by coordinating multiple lightweight adaptations of the base model, without changing its architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current channel-expansion solutions for diffusion models are often ad hoc, task-specific, and hard to adapt to different models or new tasks. There is a need for a flexible, efficient method to expand channels and adapt diffusion models to a broad set of generative and inverse graphics tasks.

Method: Teamwork uses multiple base diffusion model instances (teammates) coordinated by a novel low-rank adaptation (LoRA) variant that jointly handles adaptation and coordination. It expands input/output channels without altering the pretrained model by dynamically activating/deactivating teammates, enabling cross-task transfer across tasks like inpainting, SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.

Result: Demonstrates flexibility and efficiency across a range of generative and inverse graphics tasks, showing that channel expansion and task adaptation can be achieved without modifying the core diffusion architecture, via coordinated lightweight adapters and dynamic teammate activation.

Conclusion: Teamwork provides a flexible, efficient, and unified framework for expanding channels and adapting pretrained diffusion models to new tasks, reducing task-specific engineering and enabling broad applicability in graphics and vision applications.

Abstract: Large pretrained diffusion models can provide strong priors beneficial for
many graphics applications. However, generative applications such as neural
rendering and inverse methods such as SVBRDF estimation and intrinsic image
decomposition require additional input or output channels. Current solutions
for channel expansion are often application specific and these solutions can be
difficult to adapt to different diffusion models or new tasks. This paper
introduces Teamwork: a flexible and efficient unified solution for jointly
increasing the number of input and output channels as well as adapting a
pretrained diffusion model to new tasks. Teamwork achieves channel expansion
without altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating
and adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\ie, teammates).
We employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address
both adaptation and coordination between the different teammates. Furthermore
Teamwork supports dynamic (de)activation of teammates. We demonstrate the
flexibility and efficiency of Teamwork on a variety of generative and inverse
graphics tasks such as inpainting, single image SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic
decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.

### [13] [Seeing the Big Picture: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs' Ability to Interpret and Grade Handwritten Student Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05538)
*Owen Henkel,Bill Roberts,Doug Jaffe,Laurence Holt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two experiments show MLLMs can grade handwritten arithmetic with high accuracy but struggle with student-drawn math illustrations. Providing human-written descriptions of illustrations improves grading alignment with human judges, suggesting MLLMs can interpret arithmetic work well but need better visual-pedagogical understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess the capability of multimodal LLMs to grade, analyze, and give feedback on handwritten math student work, with potential to support elementary and middle-school education where much work is handwritten.

Method: Experiment A: 288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving arithmetic problems with objective answers; measure accuracy (reported ~95%) and agreement (kappa ~0.90). Experiment B: 150 mathematical illustrations from American elementary students (no single objective answer). Tasks: (i) model grades illustrations directly; (ii) model grades with added human-written description of the illustration. Compare model agreements (kappa) with ground truth.

Result: Experiment A: near-human accuracy (95%), kappa 0.90, with occasional errors unlikely for humans. Experiment B: direct grading kappa ~0.20 vs. with human descriptions kappa ~0.47, aligning with human-to-human agreement.

Conclusion: MLLMs can interpret arithmetic work relatively well but struggle with analyzing student mathematical illustrations. Providing descriptive text about the image enhances the model’s pedagogical evaluation, reducing the gap to human judgment; highlights domain-specific limitations and potential for improving feedback quality with additional descriptive guidance.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raise the
question of their potential for grading, analyzing, and offering feedback on
handwritten student classwork. This capability would be particularly beneficial
in elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains
handwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides
valuable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely
time-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM
performance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines
288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving
arithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved
near-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human
educators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical
illustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the
answer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require
sophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to
analyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities
from their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student
illustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human
description of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze
the student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20
with ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement
levels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human
agreement levels. This gap suggests MLLMs can "see" and interpret arithmetic
work relatively well, but still struggle to "see" student mathematical
illustrations.

*Christopher Hoang,Mengye Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Midway Network: a self-supervised architecture that jointly learns object recognition and motion understanding from natural videos by modeling latent dynamics; uses a midway top-down path, dense forward prediction, and a hierarchical structure to handle multi-object scenes, achieving strong results on semantic segmentation and optical flow, with a forward feature perturbation analysis to study dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the gap in self-supervised learning which typically targets either recognition or motion in isolation, by extending latent dynamics modeling to learn representations for both tasks from natural videos.

Method: Introduce Midway Network with a midway top-down path to infer motion latents between frames, a dense forward prediction objective, and a hierarchical structure to handle complex multi-object scenes; pretrain on large-scale natural video datasets to learn joint representations for recognition and motion.

Result: After pretraining, Midway Network achieves strong performance on semantic segmentation and optical flow compared with prior self-supervised methods; its learned dynamics can capture high-level correspondences, demonstrated by a novel forward feature perturbation analysis.

Conclusion: A single self-supervised model can learn robust representations for both object recognition and motion understanding from natural videos, bridging recognition and motion tasks and enabling analysis of latent dynamics.

Abstract: Object recognition and motion understanding are key components of perception
that complement each other. While self-supervised learning methods have shown
promise in their ability to learn from unlabeled data, they have primarily
focused on obtaining rich representations for either recognition or motion
rather than both in tandem. On the other hand, latent dynamics modeling has
been used in decision making to learn latent representations of observations
and their transformations over time for control and planning tasks. In this
work, we present Midway Network, a new self-supervised learning architecture
that is the first to learn strong visual representations for both object
recognition and motion understanding solely from natural videos, by extending
latent dynamics modeling to this domain. Midway Network leverages a midway
top-down path to infer motion latents between video frames, as well as a dense
forward prediction objective and hierarchical structure to tackle the complex,
multi-object scenes of natural videos. We demonstrate that after pretraining on
two large-scale natural video datasets, Midway Network achieves strong
performance on both semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks relative to
prior self-supervised learning methods. We also show that Midway Network's
learned dynamics can capture high-level correspondence via a novel analysis
method based on forward feature perturbation.

*Hongchi Xia,Chih-Hao Lin,Hao-Yu Hsu,Quentin Leboutet,Katelyn Gao,Michael Paulitsch,Benjamin Ummenhofer,Shenlong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloScene is a unified interactive 3D reconstruction framework that builds complete geometry, appearance, and physical properties within a scene-graph, optimized via energy-based methods and a hybrid search/refinement strategy to produce realistic, physically plausible digital twins for VR/AR, gaming, and robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D reconstruction and scene understanding struggle to achieve geometry completeness, object interactivity, physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, and accurate dynamic properties. A cohesive framework that jointly models geometry, appearance, physics, and relationships is needed to enable reliable digital twins and real-time applications.

Method: Represent scenes with an interactive scene-graph encoding object geometry, appearance, physical properties, and inter-object relationships. Formulate reconstruction as an energy-based optimization that fuses observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors. Solve via a hybrid pipeline combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based refinement for efficiency and accuracy.

Result: Digital twins with complete and precise geometry, physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Benchmark results show superior performance, and real-time digital-twin manipulation and interactive gaming demonstrate broad applicability.

Conclusion: HoloScene advances 3D reconstruction by unifying geometry, appearance, physics, and inter-object relations within an energy-based optimization framework. This enables robust, interactive digital twins suitable for VR/AR, gaming, robotics, and related applications; future work may focus on scalability, generalization, and real-time performance improvements.

Abstract: Digitizing the physical world into accurate simulation-ready virtual
environments offers significant opportunities in a variety of fields such as
augmented and virtual reality, gaming, and robotics. However, current 3D
reconstruction and scene-understanding methods commonly fall short in one or
more critical aspects, such as geometry completeness, object interactivity,
physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, or realistic physical
properties for reliable dynamic simulation. To address these limitations, we
introduce HoloScene, a novel interactive 3D reconstruction framework that
simultaneously achieves these requirements. HoloScene leverages a comprehensive
interactive scene-graph representation, encoding object geometry, appearance,
and physical properties alongside hierarchical and inter-object relationships.
Reconstruction is formulated as an energy-based optimization problem,
integrating observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors
into a unified, coherent objective. Optimization is efficiently performed via a
hybrid approach combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based
refinement. The resulting digital twins exhibit complete and precise geometry,
physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Evaluations
conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance,
while practical use-cases in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin
manipulation illustrate HoloScene's broad applicability and effectiveness.

### [16] [CalibCLIP: Contextual Calibration of Dominant Semantics for Text-Driven Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05586)
*Bin Kang,Bin Chen,Junjie Wang,Yulin Li,Junzhi Zhao,Zhuotao Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalibCLIP is a training-free calibrator for Visual Language Models that mitigates dominance of a few tokens by decoupling visual features and distinguishing general vs. discriminative text concepts, improving text-driven image retrieval across multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual Language Models often have structural limitations where a few high-contribution tokens disproportionately capture global semantics, suppressing discriminative features needed for text-driven image retrieval. A training-free calibration that re-balance token contributions in both visual and textual spaces is desirable.

Method: Visual Space: Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE) decouples visual features into target and low-information regions, identifies dominant tokens, and dynamically suppresses their representations. Textual Space: Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC) differentiates between general and discriminative concepts within the text query, mitigating generic concepts and strengthening discriminative concept representations.

Result: Extensive experiments show consistent improvements across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks, validating the effectiveness of CalibCLIP.

Conclusion: CalibCLIP offers a training-free calibration paradigm that reduces the suppressive effect of dominant tokens and enhances discriminative cues in both visual and textual modalities, yielding robust gains in text-driven image retrieval; code is available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Existing Visual Language Models (VLMs) suffer structural limitations where a
few low contribution tokens may excessively capture global semantics,
dominating the information aggregation process and suppressing the
discriminative features in text-driven image retrieval tasks. To address this,
we introduce \textbf{CalibCLIP}, a training-free method designed to calibrate
the suppressive effect of dominant tokens. Specifically, in the visual space,
we propose the Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE), which decouples visual
features into target and low information regions. Subsequently, it identifies
dominant tokens and dynamically suppresses their representations.In the textual
space, we introduce the Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC), which aims to
differentiate between general and discriminative concepts within the text
query. By mitigating the challenges posed by generic concepts and improving the
representations of discriminative concepts, DCC strengthens the differentiation
among similar samples. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks,
underscoring the effectiveness of CalibCLIP. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShortCoTI reduces chain-of-thought length in autoregressive multimodal LLMs for image generation by ~54% via reinforcement learning reward for conciseness, while preserving or slightly improving image quality on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate visual overthinking (redundant, verbose prompts) that increases computation and can contradict the original prompt.

Method: Introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that trains a concise reasoning strategy with a reward that adapts to estimated task difficulty, using reinforcement learning to encourage shorter yet semantically rich CoT prompts.

Result: Achieves a 54% reduction in prompt reasoning length and maintains or slightly improves quality metrics on T2I-CompBench and GenEval; qualitative analysis shows removal of verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, with concise yet semantically rich prompts.

Conclusion: Concise, well-formed CoT prompts can sustain or enhance image generation quality while reducing computational costs; ShortCoTI demonstrates effective alignment between conciseness and fidelity in multimodal generation.

Abstract: Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained
popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To
enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image
synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a
phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs
and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we
explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image
generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that
encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI
rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to
an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a
reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while
maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks
(T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates
verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts
that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves
computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of
generated images.

*Junwen Chen,Peilin Xiong,Keiji Yanai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes HOI-R1: a reinforcement-learning driven method using multilingual LLMs to perform HOI detection purely via text, removing extra detection modules; achieves 2x accuracy over baseline on HICO-DET.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the heavy reliance on vision-language models and complex pipelines for HOID by leveraging the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of multilingual LLMs to perform HOI detection without additional detection modules, aiming for simpler architecture and better generalization.

Method: Train multilingual LLMs with reinforcement learning to perform the HOI reasoning process in text. Introduce an HOI reasoning process and HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task entirely through text, without integrating external object detector–derived HOI representations.

Result: Evaluated on the HICO-DET dataset, HOI-R1 achieves about twice the accuracy of the baseline while showing strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that pure-text HOID via an MLLM is viable and can reduce architectural complexity and dependency on dedicated detection modules, with code available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Recent Human-object interaction detection (HOID) methods highly require prior
knowledge from VLMs to enhance the interaction recognition capabilities. The
training strategies and model architectures for connecting the knowledge from
VLMs to the HOI instance representations from the object detector are
challenging, and the whole framework is complex for further development or
application. On the other hand, the inherent reasoning abilities of MLLMs on
human-object interaction detection are under-explored. Inspired by the recent
success of training MLLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, we propose
HOI-R1 and first explore the potential of the language model on the HOID task
without any additional detection modules. We introduce an HOI reasoning process
and HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task by pure text. The results on
the HICO-DET dataset show that HOI-R1 achieves 2x the accuracy of the baseline
with great generalization ability. The source code is available at

### [19] [Efficient Conditional Generation on Scale-based Visual Autoregressive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05610)
*Jiaqi Liu,Tao Huang,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Plug-and-play Efficient Control Model (ECM) enables efficient, controllable autoregressive image synthesis without heavy fine-tuning, via a lightweight control module, distributed architecture, and early-focused training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models can rival diffusion models but require costly fine-tuning for complex spatial conditioning; there is a need for a plug-and-play, efficient control mechanism that can steer generation without enormous training overhead.

Method: ECM introduces a lightweight control module with a distributed architecture: context-aware attention layers refine conditional features using real-time generated tokens, and a shared gated feed-forward network (FFN) maximizes limited capacity for coherent control feature learning. An early-centric sampling strategy prioritizes learning early control sequences, reducing per-iteration training tokens, while inference uses temperature scheduling to compensate for under-trained late-stage tokens.

Result: Experiments on scale-based autoregressive models show high fidelity and diverse control over image generation, outperforming existing baselines and achieving significant improvements in both training and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: ECM provides an effective, efficient plug-and-play solution for controlled autoregressive image synthesis, leveraging early-stage emphasis and distributed control to maintain coherence and quality with lower computational cost.

Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated their
potential to rival diffusion models in image synthesis. However, for complex
spatially-conditioned generation, current AR approaches rely on fine-tuning the
pre-trained model, leading to significant training costs. In this paper, we
propose the Efficient Control Model (ECM), a plug-and-play framework featuring
a lightweight control module that introduces control signals via a distributed
architecture. This architecture consists of context-aware attention layers that
refine conditional features using real-time generated tokens, and a shared
gated feed-forward network (FFN) designed to maximize the utilization of its
limited capacity and ensure coherent control feature learning. Furthermore,
recognizing the critical role of early-stage generation in determining semantic
structure, we introduce an early-centric sampling strategy that prioritizes
learning early control sequences. This approach reduces computational cost by
lowering the number of training tokens per iteration, while a complementary
temperature scheduling during inference compensates for the resulting
insufficient training of late-stage tokens. Extensive experiments on
scale-based AR models validate that our method achieves high-fidelity and
diverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while
significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.

### [20] [PointNSP: Autoregressive 3D Point Cloud Generation with Next-Scale Level-of-Detail Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05613)
*Ziqiao Meng,Qichao Wang,Zhiyang Dou,Zixing Song,Zhipeng Zhou,Irwin King,Peilin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PointNSP introduces a coarse-to-fine, multi-scale autoregressive model for point clouds that preserves global structure and avoids fixed orderings, achieving state-of-the-art generation quality within autoregressive methods and improved efficiency over diffusion baselines, especially at 8k points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive generation imposes an artificial ordering on unordered point sets, biasing the model toward short-range continuity and hindering long-range/global dependencies such as symmetry, topology, and large-scale geometry. A level-of-detail (LOD) inspired approach can preserve global structure at low resolutions and progressively refine details, aligning the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of point sets.

Method: PointNSP is a coarse-to-fine generative framework that uses a next-scale prediction paradigm and multi-scale factorization to preserve global shape at low resolutions and progressively refine fine-grained geometry at higher scales. This design enables rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed orderings, by preserving permutation invariance within each scale and performing cross-scale refinements.

Result: On ShapeNet, PointNSP achieves state-of-the-art generation quality within the autoregressive paradigm. It also surpasses strong diffusion-based baselines in parameter efficiency, training efficiency, and inference efficiency. The advantages are more pronounced in dense generation with 8,192 points, highlighting scalability potential.

Conclusion: PointNSP demonstrates that a permutation-invariant, multi-scale autoregressive approach can match or exceed diffusion-based methods in quality while offering improved efficiency and scalability, by maintaining global structure through coarse-to-fine predictions.

Abstract: Autoregressive point cloud generation has long lagged behind diffusion-based
approaches in quality. The performance gap stems from the fact that
autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered
point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local
predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but
undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering
its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry,
consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the
level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a
coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at
low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher
scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization
aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of
point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed
orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the
autoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based
baselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense
generation with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more
pronounced, underscoring its scalability potential.

*Guangrong Wan,Jun liu,Tang tang,Lianghao Shi,Wenjun Luo,TingTing Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-task Tear Film Multi-task (TFM) dataset enables automated tear film analysis. It supports frame-level classification, Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU segmentation across 15 high-resolution videos (6,247 frames). The paper proposes TF-Net, a lightweight segmentation baseline using MobileOne-mini with re-parameterization and enhanced FPN, and TF-Collab, an integrated real-time pipeline that orchestrates classification, pupil localization, and TFBU segmentation. Benchmarks against state-of-the-art models demonstrate effectiveness, and code/dataset are released for reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated tear film break-up (TFBU) analysis is essential for dry eye diagnosis but is hindered by a lack of annotated multi-task datasets and integrated real-time pipelines. This work aims to fill that gap by providing a comprehensive dataset and end-to-end pipeline to enable accurate and efficient clinical analysis.

Method: Create the Tear Film Multi-task (TFM) dataset with 15 high-resolution videos (6,247 frames) annotated for three tasks: frame-level classification (clear, closed, broken, blur), Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU segmentation. Develop TF-Net with a MobileOne-mini backbone, re-parameterization, and an enhanced feature pyramid network for real-time segmentation. Benchmark TF-Net against SOTA medical segmentation models. Design TF-Collab, a real-time pipeline that sequentially performs frame classification (BUT determination), pupil region localization for input standardization, and TFBU segmentation.

Result: TF-Net achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and computational efficiency suitable for real-time clinical use. TF-Collab demonstrates automated end-to-end tear film analysis by orchestrating the three tasks. The study provides competitive benchmarks on the TFM segmentation subset and establishes a foundation for future ocular surface diagnostics research.

Conclusion: The work delivers a comprehensive multi-task tear film dataset and integrated real-time analysis pipeline, advancing automated dry eye diagnostics. The release of code and data promotes reproducibility and paves the way for future research in ocular surface analytics.

Abstract: Tear film break-up (TFBU) analysis is critical for diagnosing dry eye
syndrome, but automated TFBU segmentation remains challenging due to the lack
of annotated datasets and integrated solutions. This paper introduces the Tear
Film Multi-task (TFM) Dataset, the first comprehensive dataset for multi-task
tear film analysis, comprising 15 high-resolution videos (totaling 6,247
frames) annotated with three vision tasks: frame-level classification ('clear',
'closed', 'broken', 'blur'), Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU area
segmentation. Leveraging this dataset, we first propose TF-Net, a novel and
efficient baseline segmentation model. TF-Net incorporates a MobileOne-mini
backbone with re-parameterization techniques and an enhanced feature pyramid
network to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency for real-time clinical applications. We further establish benchmark
performance on the TFM segmentation subset by comparing TF-Net against several
state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models. Furthermore, we design
TF-Collab, a novel integrated real-time pipeline that synergistically leverages
models trained on all three tasks of the TFM dataset. By sequentially
orchestrating frame classification for BUT determination, pupil region
localization for input standardization, and TFBU segmentation, TF-Collab fully
automates the analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed TF-Net and TF-Collab, providing a foundation for future research
in ocular surface diagnostics. Our code and the TFM datasets are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaGeo offers an open-source end-to-end pipeline that automates raw satellite data curation, distills large geospatial foundation models into compact, compute-efficient versions, and deploys them via interactive web-map apps, achieving competitive accuracy with substantially smaller models and enabling rapid deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the bottlenecks in geospatial AI: lack of automated data pipelines for raw satellite imagery and the heavy footprint of fine-tuned models, hindering real-world deployment and scalability in humanitarian and environmental tasks.

Method: Integrate automated data curation to transform raw imagery into model-ready datasets, perform task-specific model distillation to produce compact models, and enable deployment as interactive web-map applications. The authors reproduce three published datasets, evaluate mIoU deltas, and demonstrate up to 8x smaller models with reduced FLOPs/CO2, plus a larger crop segmentation dataset with state-of-the-art performance.

Result: Distilled models are up to 8x smaller than standard fine-tuned counterparts, with mIoU deltas of -0.73 pp (flood mapping), -0.20 pp (crop segmentation), and +1.79 pp (desert locust). Achieved a crop segmentation mIoU of 60.65% on a larger dataset, a 12 pp improvement over baselines. Enabled end-to-end workflow from raw data to deployment within a day.

Conclusion: End-to-end, open-source InstaGeo bridges data preparation, model compression, and deployment to transform GFMs into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time, large-scale Earth observation, emphasizing data quality and application-driven innovation.

Abstract: Open-access multispectral imagery from missions like Landsat 8-9 and
Sentinel-2 has fueled the development of geospatial foundation models (GFMs)
for humanitarian and environmental applications. Yet, their deployment remains
limited by (i) the absence of automated geospatial data pipelines and (ii) the
large size of fine-tuned models. Existing GFMs lack workflows for processing
raw satellite imagery, and downstream adaptations often retain the full
complexity of the original encoder.
  We present InstaGeo, an open-source, end-to-end framework that addresses
these challenges by integrating: (1) automated data curation to transform raw
imagery into model-ready datasets; (2) task-specific model distillation to
derive compact, compute-efficient models; and (3) seamless deployment as
interactive web-map applications. Using InstaGeo, we reproduced datasets from
three published studies and trained models with marginal mIoU differences of
-0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, and +1.79 pp for
desert locust prediction. The distilled models are up to 8x smaller than
standard fine-tuned counterparts, reducing FLOPs and CO2 emissions with minimal
accuracy loss.
  Leveraging InstaGeo's streamlined data pipeline, we also curated a larger
crop segmentation dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art mIoU of 60.65%, a 12 pp
improvement over prior baselines. Moreover, InstaGeo enables users to progress
from raw data to model deployment within a single working day.
  By unifying data preparation, model compression, and deployment, InstaGeo
transforms research-grade GFMs into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time,
large-scale Earth observation. This approach shifts geospatial AI toward data
quality and application-driven innovation. Source code, datasets, and model

### [23] [Beyond Spectral Peaks: Interpreting the Cues Behind Synthetic Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05633)
*Sara Mandelli,Diego Vila-Portela,David Vázquez-Padín,Paolo Bestagini,Fernando Pérez-González*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper interrogates the reliance of deep-learning forensic detectors on frequency-domain spectral peaks, finding that most detectors do not fundamentally depend on these peaks; it introduces a peak-only, interpretable baseline detector and shows spectral peaks are not essential for detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve interpretability and trust in AI-based forensics by testing whether frequency-domain artifacts (spectral peaks) truly drive detectors, challenging the assumption that peaks are a primary indicator of synthetic images.

Method: 1) Develop a strategy to remove spectral peaks from images and evaluate the impact on multiple detectors. 2) Propose a simple linear detector that relies solely on frequency peaks as an interpretable baseline.

Result: Most detectors are not fundamentally dependent on spectral peaks; removing peaks does not invalidate their performance, and the peak-based linear detector provides a transparent baseline that captures the peak information.

Conclusion: The reliance on spectral peaks by state-of-the-art detectors is not as strong or essential as previously believed, calling for more transparent, interpretable forensic tools and baselines that isolate the role of frequency-domain artifacts.

Abstract: Over the years, the forensics community has proposed several deep
learning-based detectors to mitigate the risks of generative AI. Recently,
frequency-domain artifacts (particularly periodic peaks in the magnitude
spectrum), have received significant attention, as they have been often
considered a strong indicator of synthetic image generation. However,
state-of-the-art detectors are typically used as black-boxes, and it still
remains unclear whether they truly rely on these peaks. This limits their
interpretability and trust. In this work, we conduct a systematic study to
address this question. We propose a strategy to remove spectral peaks from
images and analyze the impact of this operation on several detectors. In
addition, we introduce a simple linear detector that relies exclusively on
frequency peaks, providing a fully interpretable baseline free from the
confounding influence of deep learning. Our findings reveal that most detectors
are not fundamentally dependent on spectral peaks, challenging a widespread
assumption in the field and paving the way for more transparent and reliable
forensic tools.

### [24] [Combined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple Loss Beyond the Single Space Deep Metric Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05643)
*Shozo Saeki,Minoru Kawahara,Hirohisa Aman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CHEST proposes a combined hyperbolic and Euclidean proxy-based loss with a hyperbolic hierarchical regularizer for deep metric learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on four benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperbolic space captures hierarchical/tree-like structures and can improve representation learning, but proxy-based losses have been underexplored in hyperbolic spaces due to challenges in applying proxy-based formulations there and concerns about scalability. A combined hyperbolic–Euclidean approach, with a proxy-based loss in both spaces and a hyperbolic hierarchical regularizer, aims to leverage the strengths of both geometries for large-scale DML.

Method: CHEST defines a joint loss as the sum of three components: a hyperbolic proxy-based loss, a Euclidean proxy-based loss (Soft Triple style), and a regularization term based on hyperbolic hierarchical clustering. Proxies (class centers) are learned in both hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces, and a hyperbolic clustering regularizer enforces hierarchical structure among embeddings. The losses are trained jointly to produce embeddings that benefit from both geometric regimes.

Result: Empirical evaluation on four benchmark datasets shows CHEST achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improved accuracy and learning stability for both hyperbolic and Euclidean representations compared to prior methods.

Conclusion: Joint optimization of hyperbolic and Euclidean proxy-based losses, augmented with a hyperbolic hierarchical clustering regularizer, yields robust, scalable, and highly accurate deep metric learning, underscoring the benefit of multi-geometry designs for large-scale, structured data.

Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) aims to learn a neural network mapping data to an
embedding space, which can represent semantic similarity between data points.
Hyperbolic space is attractive for DML since it can represent richer
structures, such as tree structures. DML in hyperbolic space is based on
pair-based loss or unsupervised regularization loss. On the other hand,
supervised proxy-based losses in hyperbolic space have not been reported yet
due to some issues in applying proxy-based losses in a hyperbolic space.
However, proxy-based losses are attractive for large-scale datasets since they
have less training complexity. To address these, this paper proposes the
Combined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple (CHEST) loss. CHEST loss is
composed of the proxy-based losses in hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces and the
regularization loss based on hyperbolic hierarchical clustering. We find that
the combination of hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces improves DML accuracy and
learning stability for both spaces. Finally, we evaluate the CHEST loss on four
benchmark datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AHP diagnosis using deep learning (AHP-CADNet) and missing-data imputation via curriculum learning achieve high accuracy and robustness on PoseGaze-AHP; tested with PubMedBERT; potential for clinical deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Objective, interpretable automated diagnosis of ocular-induced abnormal head posture and robust handling of incomplete medical records, addressing subjectivity in clinical assessments and data gaps.

Method: Develop AHP-CADNet, a multi-level attention fusion model integrating ocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes for diagnosis; pair with a curriculum-learning imputation framework that leverages structured data and unstructured notes (using PubMedBERT) to impute missing clinical variables.

Result: AHP-CADNet: 96.9–99.0% accuracy across classification tasks; MAE 0.103–0.199; R2 > 0.93. Imputation framework: 93.46–99.78% accuracy with PubMedBERT; p<0.001 for clinical dependency modeling improvements.

Conclusion: Both frameworks enhance automated diagnosis and robustness to missing data in clinical settings, demonstrating practical utility for managing AHP-related conditions.

Abstract: Ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) is a compensatory mechanism that
arises from ocular misalignment conditions, such as strabismus, enabling
patients to reduce diplopia and preserve binocular vision. Early diagnosis
minimizes morbidity and secondary complications such as facial asymmetry;
however, current clinical assessments remain largely subjective and are further
complicated by incomplete medical records. This study addresses both challenges
through two complementary deep learning frameworks. First, AHP-CADNet is a
multi-level attention fusion framework for automated diagnosis that integrates
ocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes to
generate interpretable predictions. Second, a curriculum learning-based
imputation framework is designed to mitigate missing data by progressively
leveraging structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to enhance
diagnostic robustness under realistic data conditions. Evaluation on the
PoseGaze-AHP dataset demonstrates robust diagnostic performance. AHP-CADNet
achieves 96.9-99.0 percent accuracy across classification tasks and low
prediction errors for continuous variables, with MAE ranging from 0.103 to
0.199 and R2 exceeding 0.93. The imputation framework maintains high accuracy
across all clinical variables (93.46-99.78 percent with PubMedBERT), with
clinical dependency modeling yielding significant improvements (p < 0.001).
These findings confirm the effectiveness of both frameworks for automated
diagnosis and recovery from missing data in clinical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EduVerse introduces a first-of-its-kind user-defined multi-agent educational simulation space with a layered cognition–interaction–evolution (CIE) architecture and human-in-the-loop, validated in middle-school Chinese classes for realism, interaction structure, and longitudinal development; open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of existing short-term, single-agent classroom simulations and enable open-ended, long-term, cross-task research with reproducibility and interpretability.

Method: Developed EduVerse with environment, agent, and session customization; human-in-the-loop interface; layered CIE architecture ensuring individual consistency, authentic interaction, and longitudinal adaptation; validated across three text genres, environments, and multiple sessions in middle-school classes; measured IRF realism, network density and peer links, and cross-session transition rates.

Result: IRF rates (0.28-0.64) align with real classrooms (0.37-0.49); network density (0.27-0.40) with ~1/3 peer links realized; cross-session positive transition rate R+ increases by 11.7% on average; findings indicate realism, balanced variability and stability, and longitudinal learning trajectories.

Conclusion: EduVerse balances realism, reproducibility, interpretability; scalable platform for educational AI; open-sourced to enable cross-disciplinary research.

Abstract: Reproducing cognitive development, group interaction, and long-term evolution
in virtual classrooms remains a core challenge for educational AI, as real
classrooms integrate open-ended cognition, dynamic social interaction,
affective factors, and multi-session development rarely captured together.
Existing approaches mostly focus on short-term or single-agent settings,
limiting systematic study of classroom complexity and cross-task reuse. We
present EduVerse, the first user-defined multi-agent simulation space that
supports environment, agent, and session customization. A distinctive
human-in-the-loop interface further allows real users to join the space. Built
on a layered CIE (Cognition-Interaction-Evolution) architecture, EduVerse
ensures individual consistency, authentic interaction, and longitudinal
adaptation in cognition, emotion, and behavior-reproducing realistic classroom
dynamics with seamless human-agent integration. We validate EduVerse in
middle-school Chinese classes across three text genres, environments, and
multiple sessions. Results show: (1) Instructional alignment: simulated IRF
rates (0.28-0.64) closely match real classrooms (0.37-0.49), indicating
pedagogical realism; (2) Group interaction and role differentiation: network
density (0.27-0.40) with about one-third of peer links realized, while
human-agent tasks indicate a balance between individual variability and
instructional stability; (3) Cross-session evolution: the positive transition
rate R+ increase by 11.7% on average, capturing longitudinal shifts in
behavior, emotion, and cognition and revealing structured learning
trajectories. Overall, EduVerse balances realism, reproducibility, and
interpretability, providing a scalable platform for educational AI. The system
will be open-sourced to foster cross-disciplinary research.

*Manolis Mylonas,Charalampia Zerva,Evlampios Apostolidis,Vasileios Mezaris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SD-MVSum extends script-driven video summarization to multimodal content (script, video, transcript) using a weighted cross-modal attention mechanism to align script with video and transcript, extends S-VideoXum and MrHiSum datasets for this task, and shows competitive results with state-of-the-art methods; code is released on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve relevance of video summaries by leveraging user-provided scripts and spoken content, not just visual content, by explicitly modeling cross-modal dependencies between script, video, and transcript.

Method: Introduce SD-MVSum with a weighted cross-modal attention mechanism that captures dependencies between script-video and script-transcript. The method uses semantic similarity between modalities to promote video segments highly relevant to the script. It also extends two large-scale datasets (S-VideoXum, MrHiSum) for script-driven multimodal summarization.

Result: Experimental comparisons demonstrate competitiveness with state-of-the-art approaches for both script-driven and generic video summarization.

Conclusion: The method successfully extends script-driven video summarization to a multimodal setting and provides extended datasets to support training and evaluation; code/datasets are made available to the community.

Abstract: In this work, we extend a recent method for script-driven video
summarization, originally considering just the visual content of the video, to
take into account the relevance of the user-provided script also with the
video's spoken content. In the proposed method, SD-MVSum, the dependence
between each considered pair of data modalities, i.e., script-video and
script-transcript, is modeled using a new weighted cross-modal attention
mechanism. This explicitly exploits the semantic similarity between the paired
modalities in order to promote the parts of the full-length video with the
highest relevance to the user-provided script. Furthermore, we extend two
large-scale datasets for video summarization (S-VideoXum, MrHiSum), to make
them suitable for training and evaluation of script-driven multimodal video
summarization methods. Experimental comparisons document the competitiveness of
our SD-MVSum method against other SOTA approaches for script-driven and generic
video summarization. Our new method and extended datasets are available at:

*Anwen Lu,Mingxin Liu,Yiping Jiao,Hongyi Gong,Geyang Xu,Jun Chen,Jun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARGUS captures macro-meso-micro hierarchical information in WSIs to improve histological subtyping of liver cancer (HCC vs ICC) by introducing micro-geometry features of nuclei, a Hierarchical FoVs Alignment module, and a Geometry Prior Guided Fusion, achieving state-of-the-art results on public and private cohorts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hepatic primary malignancies (HCC and ICC) are highly heterogeneous. WSIs contain rich macro-, meso-, and micro-level information and tumor microenvironment (TME), which are underexploited by existing methods. A method that leverages these hierarchical descriptors could improve histological subtyping accuracy and clinical utility.

Method: 1) Micro-geometry feature: quantify fine-grained cell-level patterns via geometric structures across nuclei. 2) Hierarchical FoVs Alignment: model macro- and meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. 3) Geometry Prior Guided Fusion: fuse augmented micro-geometry and FoVs features into a joint representation for holistic phenotype modeling.

Result: Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate that ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art performance in histological subtyping of liver cancer.

Conclusion: By modeling macro-meso-micro hierarchical representations of the tumor microenvironment within WSIs, ARGUS advances histological subtyping and provides a robust diagnostic tool for clinical practice.

Abstract: Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous
and prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these,
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge
as the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater
complexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common
tumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs)
encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological
subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment
(TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not
adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a
limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping
performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance
histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro
hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a
micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a
geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise
perspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical
Field-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and
meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. Finally, the augmented
micro-geometry and FoVs features are fused into a joint representation via
present Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for modeling holistic phenotype
interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate
that our ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in histological
subtyping of liver cancer, which provide an effective diagnostic tool for
primary liver malignancies in clinical practice.

*Jialu Gao,K J Joseph,Fernando De La Torre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free insertion of a person into a background using pre-trained diffusion models, with inversion, classifier-free guidance, and a mask-guided self-attention for identity-preserving personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of realistic person insertion by jointly solving placement/pose and personalization without task-specific training; prior work treats these steps separately and relies on training data.

Method: A unified, training-free pipeline that leverages pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, using inversion and classifier-free guidance to place people in scenes, plus a mask-guided self-attention mechanism to preserve identity, clothing, and body features from a single reference image.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on diverse composite scenes with excellent identity preservation; first to perform realistic training-free human insertions.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that diffusion models encode latent knowledge enabling realistic, personalized human insertions without task-specific training.

Abstract: The task of realistically inserting a human from a reference image into a
background scene is highly challenging, requiring the model to (1) determine
the correct location and poses of the person and (2) perform high-quality
personalization conditioned on the background. Previous approaches often treat
them as separate problems, overlooking their interconnections, and typically
rely on training to achieve high performance. In this work, we introduce a
unified training-free pipeline that leverages pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. We show that diffusion models inherently possess the
knowledge to place people in complex scenes without requiring task-specific
training. By combining inversion techniques with classifier-free guidance, our
method achieves affordance-aware global editing, seamlessly inserting people
into scenes. Furthermore, our proposed mask-guided self-attention mechanism
ensures high-quality personalization, preserving the subject's identity,
clothing, and body features from just a single reference image. To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first to perform realistic human insertions into
scenes in a training-free manner and achieve state-of-the-art results in
diverse composite scene images with excellent identity preservation in
backgrounds and subjects.

### [30] [When and How to Cut Classical Concerts? A Multimodal Automated Video Editing Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05661)
*Daniel Gonzálbez-Biosca,Josep Cabacas-Maso,Carles Ventura,Ismael Benito-Altamirano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal two-task framework for automated video editing of multicamera classical concerts: temporal segmentation using audio+image features; spatial shot selection using CLIP-based visual encoder; dataset via pseudo-labeling; achieves state-of-the-art cut-point detection and competitive shot selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated video editing is underexplored relative to video generation and scene understanding. Editing multicamera classical concerts requires identifying when to cut (temporal segmentation) and how to cut (shot selection). The authors propose a two-task architecture that leverages multimodal cues and updated backbones to improve both tasks, and they synthesize a dataset via pseudo-labeling to enable evaluation.

Method: Temporal segmentation: a lightweight convolutional-transformer pipeline that fuses log-mel spectrograms from audio, an optional image embedding, and scalar temporal features. Spatial selection: a CLIP-based visual encoder and a constraint that distractor segments come from the same concert to reduce irrelevant choices. Dataset: built via pseudo-labeling by clustering raw video into coherent shot segments.

Result: The proposed models outperform previous baselines on cut-point detection and deliver competitive performance for visual shot selection, advancing the state of the art in multimodal automated video editing.

Conclusion: A two-task multimodal editing pipeline—combining audio-visual temporal segmentation with a CLIP-based visual selection—paired with a pseudo-labeled dataset, yields improvements in cut-point detection and competitive shot selection, indicating strong potential for automated editing of multicamera events and possible generalization to similar editing scenarios.

Abstract: Automated video editing remains an underexplored task in the computer vision
and multimedia domains, especially when contrasted with the growing interest in
video generation and scene understanding. In this work, we address the specific
challenge of editing multicamera recordings of classical music concerts by
decomposing the problem into two key sub-tasks: when to cut and how to cut.
Building on recent literature, we propose a novel multimodal architecture for
the temporal segmentation task (when to cut), which integrates log-mel
spectrograms from the audio signals, plus an optional image embedding, and
scalar temporal features through a lightweight convolutional-transformer
pipeline. For the spatial selection task (how to cut), we improve the
literature by updating from old backbones, e.g. ResNet, with a CLIP-based
encoder and constraining distractor selection to segments from the same
concert. Our dataset was constructed following a pseudo-labeling approach, in
which raw video data was automatically clustered into coherent shot segments.
We show that our models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points
and provide competitive visual shot selection, advancing the state of the art
in multimodal automated video editing.

### [31] [Development and Validation of a Low-Cost Imaging System for Seedling Germination Kinetics through Time-Cumulative Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05668)
*M. Torrente,A. Follador,A. Calcante,P. Casati,R. Oberti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Low-cost, image-based system analyzes R. solani effects on Lactuca sativa germination using a temporal, morphology-spatial image-analysis pipeline. Achieves high accuracy in seedling counting and vigor assessment with R^2=0.98 and RMSE=1.12, showing infection reduces germination and early vigor and demonstrating scalable, non-destructive phenotyping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantify pathogen impact on seed germination and early seedling vigor in a scalable, non-destructive way, addressing limitations of traditional image analysis under dense/overlapping seedling growth and emphasizing low-cost hardware.

Method: Multi-camera setup continuously captures germination in infected and control groups. A novel image-analysis pipeline combines morphological and spatial features with temporal integration across time points to robustly identify and quantify individual seedlings even under overlapping/tangled growth, yielding seedling counts and vigor metrics and emergence timing.

Result: R. solani infection significantly reduces germination rates and early seedling vigor. The pipeline provides accurate counting and vigor assessment in challenging scenarios with overlapping seedlings, validates the feasibility of combining low-cost imaging with advanced analytics for non-destructive, scalable phenotyping, and enables precise emergence timing determination (R^2=0.98, RMSE=1.12).

Conclusion: Temporal integration with combined morphological-spatial features enables robust, scalable seedling phenotyping in dense conditions using affordable hardware, and the approach is adaptable to similar plant phenotyping tasks.

Abstract: The study investigates the effects of R. solani inoculation on the
germination and early development of Lactuca sativa L. seeds using a low-cost,
image-based monitoring system. Multiple cameras were deployed to continuously
capture images of the germination process in both infected and control groups.
The objective was to assess the impact of the pathogen by analyzing germination
dynamics and growth over time. To achieve this, a novel image analysis pipeline
was developed. The algorithm integrates both morphological and spatial features
to identify and quantify individual seedlings, even under complex conditions
where traditional image analyses fails. A key innovation of the method lies in
its temporal integration: each analysis step considers not only the current
status but also their developmental across prior time points. This approach
enables robust discrimination of individual seedlings, especially when
overlapping leaves significantly hinder object separation. The method
demonstrated high accuracy in seedling counting and vigor assessment, even in
challenging scenarios characterized by dense and intertwined growth. Results
confirm that R. solani infection significantly reduces germination rates and
early seedling vigor. The study also validates the feasibility of combining
low-cost imaging hardware with advanced computational tools to obtain
phenotyping data in a non-destructive and scalable manner. The temporal
integration enabled accurate quantification of germinated seeds and precise
determination of seedling emergence timing. This approach proved particularly
effective in later stages of the experiment, where conventional segmentation
techniques failed due to overlapping or intertwined seedlings, making accurate
counting. The method achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.98 and a root
mean square error (RMSE) of 1.12, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.

### [32] [Context Matters: Learning Global Semantics for Visual Reasoning and Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05674)
*Jike Zhong,Yuxiang Lai,Xiaofeng Yang,Konstantinos Psounis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A semantic-grounded objective for vision transformers via object-level tokens in masked image modeling narrows the gap with language models by teaching ViTs to model visual semantics and global context. It focuses on masking visual objects (not patches) to learn a realistic world distribution, improves reasoning in multimodal tasks, and suggests object-level encoding as a promising direction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision models lag behind language models in emergent reasoning and in-context abilities. The authors argue this stems from lack of semantic and contextual guidance in ViT training, due to patch-based, semantically weak tokenization. They aim to bridge the gap by introducing object-level semantics as a 'word-like' visual token.

Method: Adopt masked image modeling (MIM) and apply masks to visual objects rather than random patches. Learn an object-level visual tokenizer that treats objects as semantic units, encouraging the model to capture global context and semantics among visual elements. Evaluate through qualitative and quantitative analyses and by plugging the vision encoder into multimodal LLMs for VQA-style tasks.

Result: Object-level representations help learn a real-world distribution; pixel-averaging shortcuts are avoided or reduced when object-level tokens are used. Multimodal LLM evaluations on VQA, GQA, and ScienceQA show improved reasoning and contextual understanding with the proposed objective.

Conclusion: Object-level encoding serves as an effective semantic grounding for vision encoders and tokenizers, providing a plausible path toward stronger ViTs and richer visual tokens, with released code and models to enable replication.

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly
desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning.
However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas.
In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and
contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and
such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective.
Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are
inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a
realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which
inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to
directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model
to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate
our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach
can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random
patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations
reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a
real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned
without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual
question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning
and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our
study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a
plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers.
Code and model will be publicly released. Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer,

*Shihao Zhu,Bohan Cao,Ziheng Ouyang,Zhen Li,Peng-Tao Jiang,Qibin Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AgeBooth is a finetuning method that enables age-controllable, identity-consistent face generation from a single reference by combining age-conditioned prompt blending with age-specific LoRA fusion using SVDMix, reducing the need for large age-labeled datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based identity personalization struggles to accurately control age and maintain identity; obtaining large, paired age-varied datasets is costly. There is a need for effective age control without extensive age-labeled data.

Method: AgeBooth uses adapter-based identity personalization models, leveraging the linear nature of aging. It introduces age-conditioned prompt blending and an age-specific LoRA fusion strategy, implemented via SVDMix matrix fusion, to enable high-quality intermediate-age portraits with minimal data.

Result: Experiments show superior age control and visual quality compared with previous editing-based methods, producing realistic and identity-consistent face images across different ages from a single reference image.

Conclusion: AgeBooth provides effective and data-efficient age control for identity-preserving generation, validating the linear aging assumption and the utility of SVDMix-based fusion in adapter-based personalization.

Abstract: Recent diffusion model research focuses on generating identity-consistent
images from a reference photo, but they struggle to accurately control age
while preserving identity, and fine-tuning such models often requires costly
paired images across ages. In this paper, we propose AgeBooth, a novel
age-specific finetuning approach that can effectively enhance the age control
capability of adapterbased identity personalization models without the need for
expensive age-varied datasets. To reduce dependence on a large amount of
age-labeled data, we exploit the linear nature of aging by introducing
age-conditioned prompt blending and an age-specific LoRA fusion strategy that
leverages SVDMix, a matrix fusion technique. These techniques enable
high-quality generation of intermediate-age portraits. Our AgeBooth produces
realistic and identity-consistent face images across different ages from a
single reference image. Experiments show that AgeBooth achieves superior age
control and visual quality compared to previous state-of-the-art editing-based
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free pipeline uses pretrained ControlNet and Vision-Language Models to generate pixel-accurate synthetic data for semantic segmentation, with a Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator, and Image Selection module, achieving promising results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i compared to peers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data augmentation for pixel-wise segmentation is labor-intensive. Conventional augmentations struggle with high-level semantic attributes (materials/textures). Diffusion-based approaches offer semantic control but are often costly or trade-off performance. A training-free, controllable synthesis pipeline could provide labeled data efficiently, reducing annotation burdens and improving downstream segmentation tasks.

Method: A training-free framework that leverages pretrained ControlNet and Vision-Language Models to produce synthetic image-label pairs. The pipeline includes a Multi-way Prompt Generator to create diverse prompts, a Mask Generator to produce pixel-level labels, and a High-quality Image Selection module to ensure fidelity/diversity. Outputs are paired image-label data without manual annotations, intended to boost one-shot semantic segmentation.

Result: On standard benchmarks PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i for one-shot semantic segmentation, the approach shows promising performance and outperforms concurrent methods, indicating strong effectiveness of the training-free data synthesis for this task.

Conclusion: Training-free, diffusion-based data synthesis with ControlNet and VLMs—augmented by prompting, masking, and image selection—can yield high-quality, diverse labeled data, improving segmentation performance while reducing annotation effort.

Abstract: Generating enough and diverse data through augmentation offers an efficient
solution to the time-consuming and labour-intensive process of collecting and
annotating pixel-wise images. Traditional data augmentation techniques often
face challenges in manipulating high-level semantic attributes, such as
materials and textures. In contrast, diffusion models offer a robust
alternative, by effectively utilizing text-to-image or image-to-image
transformation. However, existing diffusion-based methods are either
computationally expensive or compromise on performance. To address this issue,
we introduce a novel training-free pipeline that integrates pretrained
ControlNet and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate synthetic images
paired with pixel-level labels. This approach eliminates the need for manual
annotations and significantly improves downstream tasks. To improve the
fidelity and diversity, we add a Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator and
High-quality Image Selection module. Our results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i
present promising performance and outperform concurrent work for one-shot
semantic segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FusionDetect achieves state-of-the-art detection of synthetic images by leveraging a cross-domain feature space from CLIP and Dinov2, evaluated on OmniGen with 12 generators; it outperforms baselines and shows robustness to perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond cross-generator generalization and address generalization across visual domains, enabling reliable detection of synthetic images under varied content/design and perturbations.

Method: Fuse features from CLIP and Dinov2 into a joint representation to detect synthetic images, and evaluate on OmniGen Benchmark (12 generators) to cover diverse content and domain shifts.

Result: Achieves SOTA performance: ~3.87% higher accuracy than the closest competitor, ~6.13% higher precision on established benchmarks; ~4.48% accuracy gain on OmniGen; shows robustness to common perturbations.

Conclusion: Provides a top-performing detector, plus a new benchmark and framework for universal AI image detection; code and data available.

Abstract: The rapid development of generative models has made it increasingly crucial
to develop detectors that can reliably detect synthetic images. Although most
of the work has now focused on cross-generator generalization, we argue that
this viewpoint is too limited. Detecting synthetic images involves another
equally important challenge: generalization across visual domains. To bridge
this gap,we present the OmniGen Benchmark. This comprehensive evaluation
dataset incorporates 12 state-of-the-art generators, providing a more realistic
way of evaluating detector performance under realistic conditions. In addition,
we introduce a new method, FusionDetect, aimed at addressing both vectors of
generalization. FusionDetect draws on the benefits of two frozen foundation
models: CLIP & Dinov2. By deriving features from both complementary models,we
develop a cohesive feature space that naturally adapts to changes in both
thecontent and design of the generator. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that FusionDetect delivers not only a new state-of-the-art, which is 3.87% more
accurate than its closest competitor and 6.13% more precise on average on
established benchmarks, but also achieves a 4.48% increase in accuracy on
OmniGen,along with exceptional robustness to common image perturbations. We
introduce not only a top-performing detector, but also a new benchmark and
framework for furthering universal AI image detection. The code and dataset are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised LiDAR instance segmentation using ALISE with Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), spatio-temporal voting, 2D priors, and prototype-based contrastive learning; achieves state-of-the-art results and beats some GT-supervised methods by a margin.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Eliminate manual annotation and enable fully unsupervised 3D instance segmentation for outdoor LiDAR.

Method: Use VFMs guided by text/images to generate initial pseudo-labels. Refine with a spatio-temporal voting module that fuses 2D and 3D semantics for offline/online optimization. Provide semantic supervision via (i) 2D prior-based losses injecting visual knowledge into the 3D network, and (ii) a prototype-based contrastive loss leveraging 3D semantic consistency to create a discriminative feature space.

Result: Significant performance gains; establishes a new state-of-the-art for unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Notably, it outperforms MWSIS (which uses GT 2D bounding boxes) by 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).

Conclusion: The ALISE framework demonstrates that fully unsupervised LiDAR instance segmentation is viable and competitive, achieving SOTA by integrating cross-modal supervision, temporal refinement, and discriminative feature learning.

Abstract: The manual annotation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds for instance segmentation
is extremely costly and time-consuming. Current methods attempt to reduce this
burden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate
this dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR
instance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to
generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our
approach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text
and images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels
through a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D
semantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature
learning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D
prior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a
novel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature
space by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results
in significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for
unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Remarkably, our approach even
outperforms MWSIS, a method that operates with supervision from ground-truth
(GT) 2D bounding boxes by a margin of 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).

Result: Offline evaluations show OneVision matches MCA performance; dynamic pruning yields ~21% faster inference. In A/B tests, item CTR +2.15%, CVR +2.27%, order volume +3.12%.

Conclusion: A semantic-ID-centric, generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization, simplify serving, and deliver consistent or improved online performance compared with conventional multi-stage architectures.

Abstract: Traditional vision search, similar to search and recommendation systems,
follows the multi-stage cascading architecture (MCA) paradigm to balance
efficiency and conversion. Specifically, the query image undergoes feature
extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the
user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This
multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the
optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to
achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this
paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address
these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization
encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object
across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each
product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is
adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively
incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation.
In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while
improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it
achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and
+3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric,
generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while
simplifying the serving pathway.

*Mert Kiray,Alican Karaomer,Benjamin Busam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Monocular SLAM achieving RGB-D-level accuracy without depth sensors by using three pretrained vision modules; dynamic objects suppressed; operates in real-time; strong results on TUM; suggests pretrained models can replace active depth sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Replace active depth sensors with learned vision modules to obtain metric scale and competitive accuracy while reducing hardware complexity and cost.

Method: Use a monocular metric depth estimator, a learned keypoint detector, and an instance segmentation network; suppress dynamic objects with dilated masks; assign predicted depths to static keypoints and backproject to 3D; feed into an unmodified RGB-D SLAM back end.

Result: On the TUM RGB-D benchmark, 7.4 cm mean ATE on static sequences and 1.8 cm on dynamic sequences; matches or surpasses state-of-the-art RGB-D methods; runs at 22 FPS on a single GPU.

Conclusion: Modern pretrained vision models can replace active depth sensors as reliable metric-scale sources, enabling simpler and more cost-effective SLAM systems.

Abstract: We present DropD-SLAM, a real-time monocular SLAM system that achieves
RGB-D-level accuracy without relying on depth sensors. The system replaces
active depth input with three pretrained vision modules: a monocular metric
depth estimator, a learned keypoint detector, and an instance segmentation
network. Dynamic objects are suppressed using dilated instance masks, while
static keypoints are assigned predicted depth values and backprojected into 3D
to form metrically scaled features. These are processed by an unmodified RGB-D
SLAM back end for tracking and mapping. On the TUM RGB-D benchmark, DropD-SLAM
attains 7.4 cm mean ATE on static sequences and 1.8 cm on dynamic sequences,
matching or surpassing state-of-the-art RGB-D methods while operating at 22 FPS
on a single GPU. These results suggest that modern pretrained vision models can
replace active depth sensors as reliable, real-time sources of metric scale,
marking a step toward simpler and more cost-effective SLAM systems.

### [39] [A Novel Technique for Robust Training of Deep Networks With Multisource Weak Labeled Remote Sensing Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05760)
*Gianmarco Perantoni,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robust remote-sensing image classification framework that leverages multiple weakly labeled sources together with a small clean dataset by weighting labels according to source-specific transition matrices to handle label noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning in remote sensing requires large amounts of accurately labeled data, which is costly. Noisy or outdated label sources are abundant (e.g., old maps), so leveraging them with proper noise handling can improve learning.

Method: Create multisource labeled datasets by combining weak sources with a small reliable set. Use transition matrices that describe each source's label error statistics. Embed these matrices into the labels and use them to weight each label during training (gradient-level weighting), allowing different weights per instance and per class.

Result: Experimental validation on multiple remote-sensing datasets shows the method is robust to label noise and effectively leverages unreliable sources, improving generalization.

Conclusion: Introducing a transition-matrix weighted training scheme enables effective use of noisy labels in remote-sensing classification, reducing the need for large amounts of perfectly labeled data while maintaining performance.

Abstract: Deep learning has gained broad interest in remote sensing image scene
classification thanks to the effectiveness of deep neural networks in
extracting the semantics from complex data. However, deep networks require
large amounts of training samples to obtain good generalization capabilities
and are sensitive to errors in the training labels. This is a problem in remote
sensing since highly reliable labels can be obtained at high costs and in
limited amount. However, many sources of less reliable labeled data are
available, e.g., obsolete digital maps. In order to train deep networks with
larger datasets, we propose both the combination of single or multiple weak
sources of labeled data with a small but reliable dataset to generate
multisource labeled datasets and a novel training strategy where the
reliability of each source is taken in consideration. This is done by
exploiting the transition matrices describing the statistics of the errors of
each source. The transition matrices are embedded into the labels and used
during the training process to weigh each label according to the related
source. The proposed method acts as a weighting scheme at gradient level, where
each instance contributes with different weights to the optimization of
different classes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by
experiments on different datasets. The results proved the robustness and
capability of leveraging on unreliable source of labels of the proposed method.

### [40] [Mysteries of the Deep: Role of Intermediate Representations in Out of Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05782)
*I. M. De la Jara,C. Rodriguez-Opazo,D. Teney,D. Ranasinghe,E. Abbasnejad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free OOD detector can leverage intermediate layers of pre-trained models. By using an entropy-based criterion to select layers that provide complementary signals, one can improve OOD detection accuracy (up to ~10% far-OOD, >7% near-OOD) without access to OOD data, across architectures and objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional OOD detection relies on final-layer representations of monolithic encoders. Intermediate layers, shaped by residual connections, can carry diverse, useful signals for distinguishing in- and out-of-distribution samples. The work aims to exploit this latent diversity without requiring OOD data.

Method: Propose an entropy-based criterion to automatically identify the most informative intermediate layers in a training-free manner. Combine selected layer representations to form an enhanced detection signal, and evaluate on various model architectures and training objectives for both far-OOD and near-OOD benchmarks.

Result: Selective inclusion of intermediate representations yields significant gains over state-of-the-art training-free methods: up to ~10% improvement for far-OOD and over ~7% for near-OOD, consistent across architectures and objectives.

Conclusion: Highlighting the role of representation diversity across layers as a resource for OOD detection. Demonstrates that training objectives and model architectures influence confidence-based OOD methods, and opens a new direction to exploit intermediate representations for robust detection without OOD data.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliably deploying
machine learning models in the wild. Yet, most methods treat large pre-trained
models as monolithic encoders and rely solely on their final-layer
representations for detection. We challenge this wisdom. We reveal the
\textit{intermediate layers} of pre-trained models, shaped by residual
connections that subtly transform input projections, \textit{can} encode
\textit{surprisingly rich and diverse signals} for detecting distributional
shifts. Importantly, to exploit latent representation diversity across layers,
we introduce an entropy-based criterion to \textit{automatically} identify
layers offering the most complementary information in a training-free setting
-- \textit{without access to OOD data}. We show that selectively incorporating
these intermediate representations can increase the accuracy of OOD detection
by up to \textbf{$10\%$} in far-OOD and over \textbf{$7\%$} in near-OOD
benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods across various
model architectures and training objectives. Our findings reveal a new avenue
for OOD detection research and uncover the impact of various training
objectives and model architectures on confidence-based OOD detection methods.

*Yi-Hsin Li,Thomas Sikora,Sebastian Knorr,Mårten Sjöström*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rasterization-based optimization for Steered Mixture of Experts accelerates 2D image regression while preserving sparsity and reconstruction quality, enabling native super-resolution and denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMoE excels in image tasks but is hampered by high computational cost; a faster, memory-efficient method that maintains edge-aware gating is needed.

Method: Replace global optimization with a rasterized Gaussian kernel rendering combined with SMoE's edge-aware gating; maintain sparsity; improve parameter update speed and memory efficiency.

Result: Significantly faster parameter updates and more memory-efficient representations with preserved reconstruction quality; enables native super-resolution and denoising within this framework.

Conclusion: The rasterized optimization approach offers a favorable speed-quality trade-off for 2D image processing and broadens SMoE applicability.

Abstract: The Steered Mixture of Experts regression framework has demonstrated strong
performance in image reconstruction, compression, denoising, and
super-resolution. However, its high computational cost limits practical
applications. This work introduces a rasterization-based optimization strategy
that combines the efficiency of rasterized Gaussian kernel rendering with the
edge-aware gating mechanism of the Steered Mixture of Experts. The proposed
method is designed to accelerate two-dimensional image regression while
maintaining the model's inherent sparsity and reconstruction quality. By
replacing global iterative optimization with a rasterized formulation, the
method achieves significantly faster parameter updates and more
memory-efficient model representations. In addition, the proposed framework
supports applications such as native super-resolution and image denoising,
which are not directly achievable with standard rasterized Gaussian kernel
approaches. The combination of fast rasterized optimization with the edge-aware
structure of the Steered Mixture of Experts provides a new balance between
computational efficiency and reconstruction fidelity for two-dimensional image
processing tasks.

*Sven Koehler,Sarah Kaye Mueller,Jonathan Kiekenap,Gerald Greil,Tarique Hussain,Samir Sarikouch,Florian André,Norbert Frey,Sandy Engelhardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised, multi-view (SAX and 4CH) cardiac keyframe detection in cine CMR using 1D motion descriptors from dense registration. Detects five SAX and four-chamber keyframes, beyond ED/ES, enabling temporally aligned cross-subject analysis with high repeatability across diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMR cycle variability complicates automatic comparison. ED/ES alone provide limited insight; a robust, view-consistent, multi-keyframe detection method can improve temporal alignment and enable deeper myocardial motion analysis across patients and cycle lengths.

Method: Compute dense deformable registration fields from cine CMR to derive a 1D motion descriptor per frame. Apply simple rule-based detection to identify five SAX and four-chamber keyframes (including ED/ES and three additional frames) in a self-supervised framework. Evaluate on SAX and 4CH views across three public multicentre datasets (M&Ms-2 for training/evaluation, M&Ms and ACDC for repeatability), and test generalizability on GCN congenital defects. GitHub code provided.

Result: Improved detection accuracy for ES/ED by 30–51% in SAX and 11–47% in 4CH versus volume-based approach. Achieved mean cyclic frame difference (cFD) below 1.31 frames for SAX and 1.73 frames for LAX, enabling reliable detection of ED, ES, and three additional keyframes across datasets and views.

Conclusion: The self-supervised, multi-view keyframe detector enables temporally aligned cardiac-motion analysis that is robust to cycle-length variability and across diverse pathologies, with accessible implementation (GitHub).

Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for assessing
cardiac function, but individual cardiac cycles complicate automatic temporal
comparison or sub-phase analysis. Accurate cardiac keyframe detection can
eliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole
(ES) and end-diastole (ED) frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do
not provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion. We propose a
self-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis
(SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable
registration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion
descriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction
and relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are
determined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated
for both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. M&Ms-2
(n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&Ms (n=345) and ACDC
(n=100) datasets for repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to
patients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German
Competence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved
improved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED
and ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the
volume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional
keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for
SAX and 1.73 for LAX. Our approach enables temporally aligned inter- and
intra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics, irrespective of cycle or phase
lengths. GitHub repository:

### [43] [Flow4Agent: Long-form Video Understanding via Motion Prior from Optical Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05836)
*Ruyang Liu,Shangkun Sun,Haoran Tang,Ge Li,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow4Agent introduces motion-prior-guided pruning and hierarchical temporal grouping to enable LLM-based long video understanding, outperforming prior methods on hour-scale benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-form video understanding is hindered by redundancy in both temporal and spatial contents and by the limited context window of multimodal LLMs. Prior works rely on semantic priors (e.g., CLIP) to extract key video information, but this may miss motion-relevant signals. Incorporating motion priors from optical flow can better identify informative content and reduce redundancy.

Method: Flow4Agent comprises two core modules: (1) Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO): uses coarse flow priors to group similar visual contents across time and then applies semantic priors to filter out irrelevant scenes, refining frame-level hierarchies; (2) Motion Token Pruning (MTP): uses fine-grained optical flow to prune redundant tokens within frames, producing compact intra-frame representations. These modules feed an LLM-based long-video understanding pipeline.

Result: The framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple long-video benchmarks, notably 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU, and 60.4% on LongVideoBench, outperforming existing methods.

Conclusion: Motion priors derived from optical flow effectively mitigate redundancy in long videos and enhance LLM-based long-video understanding, with pronounced benefits for hour-scale tasks, as demonstrated by strong cross-benchmark results.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding has always been a challenging problem due to
the significant redundancy in both temporal and spatial contents. This
challenge is further exacerbated by the limited context length of Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, many previous works have
attempted to extract key video information, where the "key" is typically
semantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper,
we propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion
priors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding.
Flow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial
levels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO)
adaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow
priors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to
filter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP)
further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy
video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide
range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding
tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.

TL;DR: acia-workflows delivers an open-source, end-to-end platform for automated live-cell imaging analysis by integrating the acia DL-based segmentation/tracking library with Jupyter-based pipelines and real-world application workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-throughput live-cell imaging generates vast, complex spatio-temporal data that require automated, reproducible, and accessible analysis tools. While DL methods for segmentation/tracking exist, integrating them into flexible, user-friendly workflows remains a bottleneck.

Method: Three components: (1) acia Python library enabling modular DL-based image analysis pipelines with eight segmentation/tracking approaches; (2) workflows that bundle the pipeline, dependencies, documentation, and visualizations into a single Jupyter Notebook; (3) a collection of application workflows (>10) demonstrating real-world analyses in microfluidic LCI experiments, including growth-rate comparisons and minute-resolution responses to changing oxygen; all open-source under JuBiotech/acia-workflows.

Result: Provides ready-to-use, reproducible, scalable analysis workflows for LCI data, lowering barriers to adopting DL-based analysis and enabling routine, real-world applications in biology and bioprocessing; code and workflows are openly available.

Conclusion: By coupling modular DL tools with turnkey, notebook-based workflows, acia-workflows lowers barriers to routine high-throughput LCI analysis and promotes reproducibility, accessibility, and scalability in live-cell studies.

Abstract: Live-cell imaging (LCI) technology enables the detailed spatio-temporal
characterization of living cells at the single-cell level, which is critical
for advancing research in the life sciences, from biomedical applications to
bioprocessing. High-throughput setups with tens to hundreds of parallel cell
cultivations offer the potential for robust and reproducible insights. However,
these insights are obscured by the large amount of LCI data recorded per
experiment. Recent advances in state-of-the-art deep learning methods for cell
segmentation and tracking now enable the automated analysis of such large data
volumes, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically study
single-cell dynamics. The next key challenge lies in integrating these powerful
tools into accessible, flexible, and user-friendly workflows that support
routine application in biological research. In this work, we present
acia-workflows, a platform that combines three key components: (1) the
Automated live-Cell Imaging Analysis (acia) Python library, which supports the
modular design of image analysis pipelines offering eight deep learning
segmentation and tracking approaches; (2) workflows that assemble the image
analysis pipeline, its software dependencies, documentation, and visualizations
into a single Jupyter Notebook, leading to accessible, reproducible and
scalable analysis workflows; and (3) a collection of application workflows
showcasing the analysis and customization capabilities in real-world
applications. Specifically, we present three workflows to investigate various
types of microfluidic LCI experiments ranging from growth rate comparisons to
precise, minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual dynamic cells
responses to changing oxygen conditions. Our collection of more than ten
application workflows is open source and publicly available at

TL;DR: A multimodal NAS-based insect classifier BioAutoML-NAS leverages images and metadata with neural architecture search to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on BIOSCAN-5M and Insects-1M, while producing sparse, efficient models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Insect classification is challenging due to complex insect characteristics, class imbalance, and large-scale datasets. There is a need to exploit multimodal data (images + metadata) and automatic architecture search to improve accuracy, efficiency, and scalability for sustainable farming.

Method: Use NAS to design image-processing cells, stack multiple cells to form a deep network, and fuse image embeddings with metadata via a multimodal fusion module. Employ alternating bi-level optimization to update network weights and architecture parameters, and prune zero-operations to yield sparse, efficient architectures.

Result: On BIOSCAN-5M: 96.81% accuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and 97.05% F1; outperforms state-of-the-art transfer learning, transformer, AutoML, and NAS by roughly 16%, 10%, and 8% respectively. On Insects-1M: 93.25% accuracy, 93.71% precision, 92.74% recall, and 93.22% F1.

Conclusion: BioAutoML-NAS delivers accurate, confident insect classification and supports sustainable farming by demonstrating the effectiveness of multimodal NAS with alternating optimization for large-scale ecological datasets.

Abstract: Insect classification is important for agricultural management and ecological
research, as it directly affects crop health and production. However, this task
remains challenging due to the complex characteristics of insects, class
imbalance, and large-scale datasets. To address these issues, we propose
BioAutoML-NAS, the first BioAutoML model using multimodal data, including
images, and metadata, which applies neural architecture search (NAS) for images
to automatically learn the best operations for each connection within each
cell. Multiple cells are stacked to form the full network, each extracting
detailed image feature representations. A multimodal fusion module combines
image embeddings with metadata, allowing the model to use both visual and
categorical biological information to classify insects. An alternating bi-level
optimization training strategy jointly updates network weights and architecture
parameters, while zero operations remove less important connections, producing
sparse, efficient, and high-performing architectures. Extensive evaluation on
the BIOSCAN-5M dataset demonstrates that BioAutoML-NAS achieves 96.81%
accuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and a 97.05% F1 score, outperforming
state-of-the-art transfer learning, transformer, AutoML, and NAS methods by
approximately 16%, 10%, and 8% respectively. Further validation on the
Insects-1M dataset obtains 93.25% accuracy, 93.71% precision, 92.74% recall,
and a 93.22% F1 score. These results demonstrate that BioAutoML-NAS provides
accurate, confident insect classification that supports modern sustainable
farming.

TL;DR: D^3QE-based detection for autoregressive image generation using a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer to leverage codebook frequency biases; evaluated on ARForensics across 7 AR models with strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR models generate images via discrete token prediction and exhibit distinctive quantization patterns; robust detection tools are needed to distinguish real vs AR-generated images despite evolving models.

Method: Introduce Discrete Distribution Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D^3QE) to capture quantization-error distribution differences. Develop a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that injects dynamic codebook frequency statistics into attention, combining semantic features with quantization-error latent. Create ARForensics dataset covering 7 mainstream visual AR models.

Result: Experiments show higher detection accuracy and strong cross-model generalization; robustness to real-world perturbations; code released.

Conclusion: D^3QE with dynamic-attention helps detect autoregressive-generated images more reliably; the ARForensics dataset provides a broad benchmark; suggests a promising direction of exploiting token/quantization statistics for forensic detection.

Abstract: The emergence of visual autoregressive (AR) models has revolutionized image
generation while presenting new challenges for synthetic image detection.
Unlike previous GAN or diffusion-based methods, AR models generate images
through discrete token prediction, exhibiting both marked improvements in image
synthesis quality and unique characteristics in their vector-quantized
representations. In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution
Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D$^3$QE) for autoregressive-generated
image detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency
distribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We
introduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates
dynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing
semantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we
construct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream
visual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and
strong generalization of D$^3$QE across different AR models, with robustness to
real-world perturbations. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WS-ICL introduces weakly supervised in-context learning for medical image segmentation, enabling context via weak prompts (points/bounding boxes) instead of dense masks. It reduces annotation effort while maintaining performance comparable to fully supervised ICL, and remains competitive under interactive settings; code is released at the provided GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field seeks universal medical image segmentation models with strong generalization, but dense pixel-level labels and repeated prompting are expensive. The motivation is to cut annotation cost and effort while preserving or approaching the performance of interactive/ICL models.

Method: Propose a WS-ICL paradigm that uses weak prompts (e.g., bounding boxes or points) as context in in-context learning for medical image segmentation, eliminating the need for fine-grained masks and reducing user prompts. Evaluation on three held-out benchmarks.

Result: WS-ICL achieves performance comparable to regular ICL models at a substantially lower annotation cost and remains highly competitive even under the interactive paradigm.

Conclusion: WS-ICL is a promising step toward more efficient and unified universal models for medical image segmentation, with code and model publicly available.

Abstract: Universal models for medical image segmentation, such as interactive and
in-context learning (ICL) models, offer strong generalization but require
extensive annotations. Interactive models need repeated user prompts for each
image, while ICL relies on dense, pixel-level labels. To address this, we
propose Weakly Supervised In-Context Learning (WS-ICL), a new ICL paradigm that
leverages weak prompts (e.g., bounding boxes or points) instead of dense labels
for context. This approach significantly reduces annotation effort by
eliminating the need for fine-grained masks and repeated user prompting for all
images. We evaluated the proposed WS-ICL model on three held-out benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that WS-ICL achieves performance comparable to
regular ICL models at a significantly lower annotation cost. In addition,
WS-ICL is highly competitive even under the interactive paradigm. These
findings establish WS-ICL as a promising step toward more efficient and unified
universal models for medical image segmentation. Our code and model are

TL;DR: A new large-scale defects dataset for logistics anomaly detection, surpassing existing benchmarks in size and difficulty; current methods barely reach ~57% AUROC, highlighting challenges due to pose/appearance variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manufacturing benchmarks saturate and do not generalize to retail logistics where pose and appearance vary widely; there is a gap in anomaly detection for diverse, real-world settings.

Method: Develop a large-scale dataset from retail logistics with >230k images, >29k defective instances, and >48k distinct objects; evaluate multiple state-of-the-art anomaly detectors on it and perform qualitative analyses.

Result: State-of-the-art methods fail to exceed 56.96% AUROC on the dataset; existing methods struggle to leverage normal samples under heavy pose/appearance variation; the dataset serves as a new, more challenging benchmark.

Conclusion: Introduces a challenging, scalable benchmark for retail logistics anomaly detection to spur future research; the dataset is publicly available at the provided URL.

Abstract: We present a novel large-scale dataset for defect detection in a logistics
setting. Recent work on industrial anomaly detection has primarily focused on
manufacturing scenarios with highly controlled poses and a limited number of
object categories. Existing benchmarks like MVTec-AD [6] and VisA [33] have
reached saturation, with state-of-the-art methods achieving up to 99.9% AUROC
scores. In contrast to manufacturing, anomaly detection in retail logistics
faces new challenges, particularly in the diversity and variability of object
pose and appearance. Leading anomaly detection methods fall short when applied
to this new setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that
overcomes the current limitations of existing datasets. With over 230,000
images (and more than 29,000 defective instances), it is 40 times larger than
MVTec-AD and contains more than 48,000 distinct objects. To validate the
difficulty of the problem, we conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple
state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, demonstrating that they do not
surpass 56.96% AUROC on our dataset. Further qualitative analysis confirms that
existing methods struggle to leverage normal samples under heavy pose and
appearance variation. With our large-scale dataset, we set a new benchmark and
encourage future research towards solving this challenging problem in retail
logistics anomaly detection. The dataset is available for download under

TL;DR: Comprehensive study of token mixers in MetaFormer for medical imaging shows: for image classification, simple token mixers (e.g., pooling or grouped convolution) suffice and pretrained weights help transfer across token mixers; for semantic segmentation, local inductive bias from convolutions is crucial, with grouped convolutions favored for efficiency, while channel-MLPs provide cross-channel interaction. The work spans eight datasets and highlights design choices across modalities; code available on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging has been underexplored for MetaFormer-style architectures. There is little systematic comparison of token mixers (pooling, convolution, attention) in this domain, and pretrained weights from natural images are commonly used—it's unclear how well they transfer when token mixer designs change. The study aims to identify which token mixers suit classification vs segmentation tasks and how pretrained weights perform across token mixer variants.

Method: Systematic evaluation of token mixers within the MetaFormer framework across eight medical imaging datasets covering classification (global prediction) and segmentation (dense prediction). Compare pooling-based, convolution-based (including grouped convolutions), and attention-based token mixers. Assess transferability by pretrained weights from natural images to new token mixers and measure efficiency (runtime and parameter count).

Result: Classification: low-complexity token mixers (grouped convolution or pooling) are sufficient, and pretrained weights remain useful despite domain gap. Segmentation: local inductive bias from convolutional token mixers is essential; grouped convolutions are preferred due to lower runtime and parameters vs standard convolutions, with MetaFormer's channel-MLPs providing necessary cross-channel interactions.

Conclusion: The study suggests task-dependent token-mixer design choices in medical imaging: simple mixers suffice for classification and pretrained transfer is beneficial; for segmentation, preserving convolutional inductive bias—especially with grouped convolutions—yields better efficiency while maintaining performance, aided by channel-MLP cross-channel mixing. Code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: The generalization of the Transformer architecture via MetaFormer has
reshaped our understanding of its success in computer vision. By replacing
self-attention with simpler token mixers, MetaFormer provides strong baselines
for vision tasks. However, while extensively studied on natural image datasets,
its use in medical imaging remains scarce, and existing works rarely compare
different token mixers, potentially overlooking more suitable designs choices.
In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of token mixers for
medical imaging. We systematically analyze pooling-, convolution-, and
attention-based token mixers within the MetaFormer architecture on image
classification (global prediction task) and semantic segmentation (dense
prediction task). Our evaluation spans eight datasets covering diverse
modalities and common challenges in the medical domain. Given the prevalence of
pretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also
examine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show
that, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution
or pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images.
Pretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new
token mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of
convolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the
preferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to
standard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the
necessary cross-channel interactions. Our code is available on GitHub.

### [50] [Diffusion Models for Low-Light Image Enhancement: A Multi-Perspective Taxonomy and Performance Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05976)
*Eashan Adhikarla,Yixin Liu,Brian D. Davison*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A survey on diffusion models for low-light image enhancement (LLIE), proposing a six-category taxonomy, comparing with GAN/Transformer methods, analyzing deployment challenges and future directions including foundation models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLIE is critical for safety-sensitive applications (surveillance, autonomous navigation, medical imaging) where visibility impacts downstream tasks. Diffusion models offer robust modeling of complex image distributions and have surged in LLIE. A current, critical evaluation is needed against GAN/Transformer baselines, plus practical deployment and ethical considerations.

Method: Systematic literature review and critical analysis of diffusion-based LLIE methods. Comparative performance benchmarking against GAN- and Transformer-based state-of-the-art methods. Development of a six-category taxonomy (Intrinsic Decomposition, Spectral & Latent, Accelerated, Guided, Multimodal, Autonomous) that links model mechanics with conditioning signals. Qualitative failure-mode analysis, benchmark inconsistencies assessment, and evaluation of trade-offs among interpretability, generalization, and inference efficiency. Discussion of deployment constraints (memory, energy) and ethical aspects. Forward-looking perspectives on conditioning strategies and foundation-model integration.

Result: Provides a comprehensive taxonomy and evaluation framework for diffusion-based LLIE, along with comparative insights, documented deployment challenges, and identified open research questions that guide future work and real-world adoption.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based LLIE is promising for enhancing low-light images but requires advances in efficiency, generalization, and deployment practicality. The paper highlights novel conditioning approaches and real-time adaptation, and anticipates the growing role of foundation models in this domain.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is vital for safety-critical applications
such as surveillance, autonomous navigation, and medical imaging, where
visibility degradation can impair downstream task performance. Recently,
diffusion models have emerged as a promising generative paradigm for LLIE due
to their capacity to model complex image distributions via iterative denoising.
This survey provides an up-to-date critical analysis of diffusion models for
LLIE, distinctively featuring an in-depth comparative performance evaluation
against Generative Adversarial Network and Transformer-based state-of-the-art
methods, a thorough examination of practical deployment challenges, and a
forward-looking perspective on the role of emerging paradigms like foundation
models. We propose a multi-perspective taxonomy encompassing six categories:
Intrinsic Decomposition, Spectral & Latent, Accelerated, Guided, Multimodal,
and Autonomous; that map enhancement methods across physical priors,
conditioning schemes, and computational efficiency. Our taxonomy is grounded in
a hybrid view of both the model mechanism and the conditioning signals. We
evaluate qualitative failure modes, benchmark inconsistencies, and trade-offs
between interpretability, generalization, and inference efficiency. We also
discuss real-world deployment constraints (e.g., memory, energy use) and
ethical considerations. This survey aims to guide the next generation of
diffusion-based LLIE research by highlighting trends and surfacing open
research questions, including novel conditioning, real-time adaptation, and the
potential of foundation models.

### [51] [A Dynamic Mode Decomposition Approach to Morphological Component Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05977)
*Owen T. Huber,Raghu G. Raj,Tianyu Chen,Zacharie I. Idriss*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Dynamic Morphological Component Analysis (DMCA), an adaptive, data-driven extension of MCA that learns dictionaries by clustering Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) eigenvalues to separate morphologies in videos and related imaging tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitation of fixed, predefined dictionaries in MCA for video content with varying dynamics; develop data-driven, adaptive representations that better separate structurally distinct components.

Method: Compute a DMD-based eigenspace; cluster eigenvalues to form data-driven MCA dictionaries; integrate these dictionaries into MCA to perform sparse decomposition (DMCA). Demonstrates with a motivational still-image example, video denoising on Adobe 240fps datasets, SNR enhancement of a faint target with sea state, and separation of a bicycle from wind clutter in inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) images.

Result: DMCA demonstrates effectiveness in denoising and source separation tasks across modalities: improved noise suppression in videos, higher SNR for faint targets, and ability to separate moving objects from clutter in ISAR imagery, using learned, adaptive dictionaries.

Conclusion: DMCA provides a novel, data-driven extension of MCA by leveraging eigenspace clustering of DMD eigenvalues to generate adaptive dictionaries, enabling flexible and morphology-aware representations for multi-modal signal separation and denoising.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology of adapting the representation of
videos based on the dynamics of their scene content variation. In particular,
we demonstrate how the clustering of dynamic mode decomposition eigenvalues can
be leveraged to learn an adaptive video representation for separating
structurally distinct morphologies of a video. We extend the morphological
component analysis (MCA) algorithm, which uses multiple predefined incoherent
dictionaries and a sparsity prior to separate distinct sources in signals, by
introducing our novel eigenspace clustering technique to obtain data-driven MCA
dictionaries, which we call dynamic morphological component analysis (DMCA).
After deriving our novel algorithm, we offer a motivational example of DMCA
applied to a still image, then demonstrate DMCA's effectiveness in denoising
applications on videos from the Adobe 240fps dataset. Afterwards, we provide an
example of DMCA enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of a faint target summed
with a sea state, and conclude the paper by applying DMCA to separate a bicycle
from wind clutter in inverse synthetic aperture radar images.

### [52] [Diffusion-Based Image Editing for Breaking Robust Watermarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05978)
*Yunyi Ni,Finn Carter,Ze Niu,Emily Davis,Bo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-based image regeneration and guided diffusion attacks can erase robust invisible watermarks, causing decoding failure with near-zero watermark recovery while preserving image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of diffusion-based image generation threatens existing robust watermarking schemes, which were designed to withstand conventional perturbations; understanding this vulnerability is crucial to develop defenses in the era of generative AI.

Method: The paper provides a theoretical analysis showing that mutual information between a watermarked image and its payload vanishes under sufficient diffusion. It introduces a guided diffusion attack that explicitly targets the watermark signal during generation. Experimental evaluation on StegaStamp, TrustMark, and VINE demonstrates near-zero watermark recovery after attack with high perceptual fidelity.

Result: Watermarks become undetectable/unrecoverable after the diffusion attack across multiple schemes, while regenerated images maintain high visual quality.

Conclusion: Current robust watermarking techniques are vulnerable to diffusion-model-based attacks, underscoring the need for new watermarking strategies that are resilient to generative-model transformations.

Abstract: Robust invisible watermarking aims to embed hidden information into images
such that the watermark can survive various image manipulations. However, the
rise of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses
a new threat to these watermarking schemes. In this paper, we present a
theoretical study and method demonstrating that diffusion models can
effectively break robust image watermarks that were designed to resist
conventional perturbations. We show that a diffusion-driven ``image
regeneration'' process can erase embedded watermarks while preserving
perceptual image content. We further introduce a novel guided diffusion attack
that explicitly targets the watermark signal during generation, significantly
degrading watermark detectability. Theoretically, we prove that as an image
undergoes sufficient diffusion-based transformation, the mutual information
between the watermarked image and the embedded watermark payload vanishes,
resulting in decoding failure. Experimentally, we evaluate our approach on
multiple state-of-the-art watermarking schemes (including the deep
learning-based methods StegaStamp, TrustMark, and VINE) and demonstrate
near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual
fidelity of the regenerated images. Our findings highlight a fundamental
vulnerability in current robust watermarking techniques against generative
model-based attacks, underscoring the need for new watermarking strategies in
the era of generative AI.

### [53] [Detection and Measurement of Hailstones with Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06008)
*Moritz Alker,David C. Schedl,Andreas Stöckl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pretrained multimodal LLMs can estimate hailstone diameters from social media images with ~1.12 cm MAE; two-stage prompting using reference cues improves accuracy; no model fine-tuning required; potential to augment traditional sensors; real-time image harvesting remains open.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for rapid, dense hail damage data by leveraging social media imagery and pretrained multimodal models to complement traditional hail sensors.

Method: Dataset of 474 crowdsourced hailstone images from Austria (Jan 2022–Sep 2024) with diameters 2–11 cm. Compare four models using one-stage and two-stage prompting; two-stage prompts use size cues from reference objects (e.g., human hands) in the image; assess diameter estimates via mean absolute error.

Result: Best model achieved an average MAE of 1.12 cm. Two-stage prompting improved reliability for most models compared to one-stage prompting.

Conclusion: Off-the-shelf, unfine-tuned multimodal models can provide meaningful, spatially dense hail data from social imagery, complementing sensors; enables faster, more detailed assessments of severe weather. Automated real-time image harvesting remains an open task for direct applicability in future events.

Abstract: This study examines the use of social media and news images to detect and
measure hailstones, utilizing pre-trained multimodal large language models. The
dataset for this study comprises 474 crowdsourced images of hailstones from
documented hail events in Austria, which occurred between January 2022 and
September 2024. These hailstones have maximum diameters ranging from 2 to 11cm.
We estimate the hail diameters and compare four different models utilizing
one-stage and two-stage prompting strategies. The latter utilizes additional
size cues from reference objects, such as human hands, within the image. Our
results show that pretrained models already have the potential to measure
hailstone diameters from images with an average mean absolute error of 1.12cm
for the best model. In comparison to a single-stage prompt, two-stage prompting
improves the reliability of most models. Our study suggests that these
off-the-shelf models, even without fine-tuning, can complement traditional hail
sensors by extracting meaningful and spatially dense information from social
media imagery, enabling faster and more detailed assessments of severe weather
events. The automated real-time image harvesting from social media and other
sources remains an open task, but it will make our approach directly applicable
to future hail events.

### [54] [Continual Learning for Image Captioning through Improved Image-Text Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06009)
*Bertram Taetz,Gal Bordelius*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A continual image captioning framework combining semantic guidance via prompt-based alignment, CLIP-style embedding alignment, and language-guided contrastive loss on a ViT-GPT-2 backbone to reduce forgetting and improve semantic captioning without extra inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In continual learning, image captioning must cope with evolving visual concepts and language; standard methods suffer catastrophic forgetting and semantic misalignment between tasks.

Method: Multi-loss training: cross-entropy plus (1) prompt-based cosine similarity aligning image embeddings with synthetic prompts for objects/attributes/actions; (2) CLIP-style image-caption embedding alignment; (3) language-guided triplet contrastive loss to improve class-level discriminability across tasks; backbone is pretrained ViT-GPT-2; no prompts required at inference; no extra overhead at test.

Result: Outperforms or reduces forgetting relative to state-of-the-art; better semantic alignment; no inference-time prompts; code available.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-loss continual learning framework effectively mitigates forgetting and enhances semantic alignment in image captioning, maintaining inference efficiency.

Abstract: Generating accurate and coherent image captions in a continual learning
setting remains a major challenge due to catastrophic forgetting and the
difficulty of aligning evolving visual concepts with language over time. In
this work, we propose a novel multi-loss framework for continual image
captioning that integrates semantic guidance through prompt-based continual
learning and contrastive alignment. Built upon a pretrained ViT-GPT-2 backbone,
our approach combines standard cross-entropy loss with three additional
components: (1) a prompt-based cosine similarity loss that aligns image
embeddings with synthetically constructed prompts encoding objects, attributes,
and actions; (2) a CLIP-style loss that promotes alignment between image
embeddings and target caption embedding; and (3) a language-guided contrastive
loss that employs a triplet loss to enhance class-level discriminability
between tasks. Notably, our approach introduces no additional overhead at
inference time and requires no prompts during caption generation. We find that
this approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while achieving better
semantic caption alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code can

### [55] [Emergent AI Surveillance: Overlearned Person Re-Identification and Its Mitigation in Law Enforcement Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06026)
*An Thi Nguyen,Radina Stoykova,Eric Arazo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Emergent person re-identification arises in generic instance search models; two safeguards (index exclusion and confusion loss) can cut re-id accuracy to under 2% while preserving ~82% of non-person retrieval, but vulnerabilities remain; raises urgent governance and de-identification standards questions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess risks of unintended individual identification in surveillance-oriented retrieval systems and evaluate mitigations against personal data leakage; address lack of de-identification standards and regulatory guidance.

Method: Experimentally evaluate two technical safeguards—index exclusion and confusion loss—alone and in combination; measure impact on person re-id accuracy and non-person object retrieval; test potential circumvention via partial person images.

Result: Combined safeguards reduce person re-identification accuracy to below 2% while maintaining ~82% retrieval for non-person objects; several vulnerabilities identified, including possible circumvention with partial person images.

Conclusion: Results raise urgent questions about classification and regulation of systems with emergent identification capabilities and the technical standards needed to prevent such capabilities from developing in benign applications; calls for governance and data protection frameworks to address de-identification gaps.

Abstract: Generic instance search models can dramatically reduce the manual effort
required to analyze vast surveillance footage during criminal investigations by
retrieving specific objects of interest to law enforcement. However, our
research reveals an unintended emergent capability: through overlearning, these
models can single out specific individuals even when trained on datasets
without human subjects. This capability raises concerns regarding
identification and profiling of individuals based on their personal data, while
there is currently no clear standard on how de-identification can be achieved.
We evaluate two technical safeguards to curtail a model's person
re-identification capacity: index exclusion and confusion loss. Our experiments
demonstrate that combining these approaches can reduce person re-identification
accuracy to below 2% while maintaining 82% of retrieval performance for
non-person objects. However, we identify critical vulnerabilities in these
mitigations, including potential circumvention using partial person images.
These findings highlight urgent regulatory questions at the intersection of AI
governance and data protection: How should we classify and regulate systems
with emergent identification capabilities? And what technical standards should
be required to prevent identification capabilities from developing in seemingly
benign applications?

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fragmentation in NAS by unifying diverse architectures into a single flexible search space, enabling systematic exploration and fair, reproducible comparisons.

Method: Define UniNAS as a universal, graph-based search space; develop a traversal/search algorithm to navigate the space; implement a standardized training/evaluation protocol and toolkit.

Result: The search space contains architectures that outperform state-of-the-art hand-crafted models under the same training setup; shows generality across architectures; provides toolkit.

Conclusion: UniNAS enables systematic exploration of the full spectrum of neural architectures within a unified NAS framework and fosters reproducibility and fair comparisons in NAS research.

Abstract: We introduce Universal Neural Architecture Space (UniNAS), a generic search
space for neural architecture search (NAS) which unifies convolutional
networks, transformers, and their hybrid architectures under a single, flexible
framework. Our approach enables discovery of novel architectures as well as
analyzing existing architectures in a common framework. We also propose a new
search algorithm that allows traversing the proposed search space, and
demonstrate that the space contains interesting architectures, which, when
using identical training setup, outperform state-of-the-art hand-crafted
architectures. Finally, a unified toolkit including a standardized training and
evaluation protocol is introduced to foster reproducibility and enable fair
comparison in NAS research. Overall, this work opens a pathway towards
systematically exploring the full spectrum of neural architectures with a
unified graph-based NAS perspective.

*Xinye Cao,Hongcan Guo,Jiawen Qian,Guoshun Nan,Chao Wang,Yuqi Pan,Tianhao Hou,Xiaojuan Wang,Yutong Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoMiner introduces a hierarchical, tree-based framework for long-video understanding with iterative segmentation, captioning, and clustering, plus a tree-guided RL policy (T-GRPO) to identify key frames, achieving superior performance and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end MM-LLM video understanding is overwhelmed by massive redundant frames in long videos; existing hierarchical frame extraction still suffers from noise and difficulty in adapting to complex hierarchical structures.

Method: Iteratively segment, caption, and cluster long videos to build a hierarchical tree; locate key frames with T-GRPO, a tree-aware group-relative policy optimization in reinforcement learning guided by the user question; employ a tree-growth auxin mechanism to adapt expansion depth; evaluate on long-video understanding tasks; code released at GitHub.

Result: Superior performance across long-video understanding tasks; the method encourages spontaneous reasoning chains; dynamic tree growth yields accuracy and efficiency gains; code publicly available.

Conclusion: VideoMiner effectively reduces interference from redundant information, accurately identifies key frames within a hierarchical structure, and adapts to varying levels of granularity, enabling efficient end-to-end MM-LLM video understanding; T-GRPO and auxin-based growth contribute to performance gains.

Abstract: Understanding hour-long videos with multi-modal large language models
(MM-LLMs) enriches the landscape of human-centered AI applications. However,
for end-to-end video understanding with LLMs, uniformly sampling video frames
results in LLMs being overwhelmed by a vast amount of irrelevant information as
video length increases. Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods
improve the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical
challenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in
long videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex
hierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address
these issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and
clusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed
VideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving
temporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely
locate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy
optimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of
the VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree
structures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while
being guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve
superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several
interesting insights. Our proposed T-GRPO surprisingly incentivizes the model
to spontaneously generate a reasoning chain. Additionally, the designed tree
growth auxin dynamically adjusts the expansion depth, obtaining accuracy and
efficiency gains. The code is publicly available at
https://github.com/caoxinye/VideoMiner.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLVD is a hybrid 3D face reconstruction method that combines per-vertex neural field optimization with dynamic 3D keypoints and relative spatial encoding to achieve expressive geometry from few-shot images, with state-of-the-art single-view results and fast inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D face modeling is often constrained by fixed shape priors from 3D Morphable Models, while optimization-based methods, though accurate, are slow. There's a need for expressive, efficient reconstruction from limited data without dense 3D supervision.

Method: GLVD extends Learned Vertex Descent by integrating per-vertex neural field optimization with global guidance from dynamically predicted 3D keypoints and relative spatial encoding to iteratively refine mesh vertices.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-view settings and remains competitive in multi-view scenarios, while substantially reducing inference time.

Conclusion: GLVD provides expressive, adaptable geometry reconstruction with improved efficiency, balancing quality and speed in few-shot 3D face reconstruction.

Abstract: Existing 3D face modeling methods usually depend on 3D Morphable Models,
which inherently constrain the representation capacity to fixed shape priors.
Optimization-based approaches offer high-quality reconstructions but tend to be
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce GLVD, a hybrid method for
3D face reconstruction from few-shot images that extends Learned Vertex Descent
(LVD) by integrating per-vertex neural field optimization with global
structural guidance from dynamically predicted 3D keypoints. By incorporating
relative spatial encoding, GLVD iteratively refines mesh vertices without
requiring dense 3D supervision. This enables expressive and adaptable geometry
reconstruction while maintaining computational efficiency. GLVD achieves
state-of-the-art performance in single-view settings and remains highly
competitive in multi-view scenarios, all while substantially reducing inference
time.

*Akshay Muppidi,Martin Radfar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedFlamingo PPO integrates a medical-domain vision-language model with PPO for vision-only robotic laparoscopic tasks, yielding faster convergence and >70% success across five LapGym tasks by generating high-level planning tokens once per episode.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenges of high-dimensional visual inputs, sparse rewards, and extracting task-relevant features in surgical RL by injecting medical-domain knowledge through MedFlamingo to guide planning and decision-making.

Method: Combine MedFlamingo with PPO; generate high-level planning tokens from observations and instructions once per episode; use tokens to inform the PPO policy; evaluate on five LapGym laparoscopic task environments using endoscopic visuals; compare against standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO baselines.

Result: Achieves >70% task success across all environments; improvements ranging from 66.67% to 1114.29% over baselines; faster convergence.

Conclusion: Integrating medical-domain knowledge via a specialized VLM improves robotic surgical planning and decision-making; token-based guidance provides an efficient bridge between raw visual feedback and policy actions; promising direction for surgical robotics RL.

Abstract: Vision-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) struggles with visual
observation-based robotic laparoscopic surgical tasks due to the
high-dimensional nature of visual input, the sparsity of rewards in surgical
environments, and the difficulty of extracting task-relevant features from raw
visual data. We introduce a simple approach integrating MedFlamingo, a medical
domain-specific Vision-Language Model, with PPO. Our method is evaluated on
five diverse laparoscopic surgery task environments in LapGym, using only
endoscopic visual observations. MedFlamingo PPO outperforms and converges
faster compared to both standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO
baselines, achieving task success rates exceeding 70% across all environments,
with improvements ranging from 66.67% to 1114.29% compared to baseline. By
processing task observations and instructions once per episode to generate
high-level planning tokens, our method efficiently combines medical expertise
with real-time visual feedback. Our results highlight the value of specialized
medical knowledge in robotic surgical planning and decision-making.

*Python Song,Luke Tenyi Chang,Yun-Yun Tsai,Penghui Li,Junfeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Step-by-step reasoning is essential for solving CAPTCHAs with vision-language models; current commercial VLMs underperform (~22% accuracy) on CAPTCHA tasks; CAPTCHA-X benchmark with reasoning and grounding; five metrics; proposed agentic VLM framework achieves 83.9% average accuracy across hard CAPTCHAs, highlighting the role of reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess and improve the spatial-reasoning capabilities of vision-language models through real-world CAPTCHA tasks, identify current limitations, and demonstrate that explicit step-by-step reasoning substantially boosts performance.

Method: Empirical evaluation of existing commercial VLMs on CAPTCHA tasks; introduce CAPTCHA-X, a real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with seven categories and step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations; define five reasoning-oriented metrics; propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that leverages inherent model reasoning; validate on multiple CAPTCHA types.

Result: Commercial VLMs struggle with CAPTCHA reasoning (approx. 21.9% accuracy). Enforcing step-by-step reasoning before final output significantly improves performance. CAPTCHA-X enables rigorous evaluation and shows an average accuracy of 83.9% across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, surpassing baselines.

Conclusion: Reasoning abilities are a critical factor in solving complex visual-spatial tasks; current models have substantial gaps in reasoning; integrating structured, step-by-step reasoning can close much of this gap and guide future development of VLMs in real-world challenges.

Abstract: CAPTCHA, originally designed to distinguish humans from robots, has evolved
into a real-world benchmark for assessing the spatial reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models. In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning
is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent
high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial
vision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we
observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to
effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent).
However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step
reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its
solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study
this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with
reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha,
etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further
define five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation
of models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning,
we also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the
models inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving
accuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines. These
results reveal the limitations of current models and highlight the importance
of reasoning in advancing visual-spatial challenges in the future.

### [61] [There is More to Attention: Statistical Filtering Enhances Explanations in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06070)
*Meghna P Ayyar,Jenny Benois-Pineau,Akka Zemmari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A filtered attention-based explanation method for Vision Transformers (ViTs) that applies a CNN-inspired statistical filter to attention maps to suppress noise, with a class-specific variant for discriminative explanations. It yields sharper, more faithful and human-aligned explanations while remaining efficient and competitive with state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explainable AI for Vision Transformers: attention-based explanations from ViTs are often noisy and less faithful. While CNN-derived methods and MLP-based explanations exist, attention can remain a valuable signal if properly filtered. The goal is to transfer and adapt filtering techniques to ViTs to improve interpretability and faithfulness, including alignment with human perception.

Method: Extract attention maps from ViTs, apply a statistical filter (initially proposed for CNNs) to remove noisy or uninformative patterns, and fuse the filtered attention into explanations. Extend with a class-specific variant to produce discriminative explanations. Evaluate on multiple datasets using perturbation-based faithfulness metrics and human gaze data to assess alignment with human perception.

Result: Produces sharper, more interpretable attention-based explanation maps that are competitive with or surpass state-of-the-art methods. The approach demonstrates faithful explanations per perturbation metrics and improved alignment with human gaze data, while maintaining efficiency and human plausibility across datasets.

Conclusion: Attention signals remain valuable for ViT explanations when properly filtered. The proposed CNN-inspired statistical filtering of attention maps yields more faithful and discriminative explanations, achieving strong performance across datasets and aligning with human perception, offering a scalable and efficient XAI approach for ViTs.

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become increasingly important with the rise of large
transformer models, yet many explanation methods designed for CNNs transfer
poorly to Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing ViT explanations often rely on
attention weights, which tend to yield noisy maps as they capture
token-to-token interactions within each layer.While attribution methods
incorporating MLP blocks have been proposed, we argue that attention remains a
valuable and interpretable signal when properly filtered. We propose a method
that combines attention maps with a statistical filtering, initially proposed
for CNNs, to remove noisy or uninformative patterns and produce more faithful
explanations. We further extend our approach with a class-specific variant that
yields discriminative explanations. Evaluation against popular state-of-the-art
methods demonstrates that our approach produces sharper and more interpretable
maps. In addition to perturbation-based faithfulness metrics, we incorporate
human gaze data to assess alignment with human perception, arguing that human
interpretability remains essential for XAI. Across multiple datasets, our
approach consistently outperforms or is comparable to the SOTA methods while
remaining efficient and human plausible.

### [62] [When Thinking Drifts: Evidential Grounding for Robust Video Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06077)
*Mi Luo,Zihui Xue,Alex Dimakis,Kristen Grauman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoT hinders video reasoning due to visual thinking drift; introducing Visual Evidence Reward (VER) with Video-VER yields top performance by grounding reasoning in visual evidence across 10 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the mismatch between text-based Chain-of-Thought reasoning and grounded, verifiable visual evidence in video understanding, mitigating hallucinations and bias amplification.

Method: Systematically analyze CoT in video tasks; provide a Bayesian explanation for the drift; introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER) as a reinforcement learning objective that rewards traces grounded in visual evidence; develop Video-VER and evaluate across 10 video benchmarks.

Result: Video-VER consistently achieves top performance across 10 diverse video benchmarks, indicating reduced visual thinking drift and better grounding in visual evidence.

Conclusion: Grounded visual reasoning is crucial for video-centric tasks. CoT can degrade performance by storytelling rather than grounding; VER promotes thinking that sees, guiding future multimodal models toward verifiable, grounded inferences.

Abstract: Video reasoning, the task of enabling machines to infer from dynamic visual
content through multi-step logic, is crucial for advanced AI. While the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks,
its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper
presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in
video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and
leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a
phenomenon we term "visual thinking drift". We explain this drift through a
Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual
evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models
to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we
introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are
verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10
diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER
consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct
challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that
robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal
models that not only "think before answering", but also "see while thinking".

*Bjoern Hansen,Jonas Pedersen,Klaus F. Kofoed,Oscar Camara,Rasmus R. Paulsen,Kristine Soerensen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Open-source, anatomically coherent high-resolution segmentation dataset for left atrial appendage, coronary arteries, and pulmonary veins on ImageCAS (1000 CCTA scans); LAA model trained on private data and transferred to ImageCAS; CA and PV labels refined; includes data-flaw annotations to guide method development.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, consistent segmentation of LAA, CAs, and PVs remains challenging, and existing tools like TotalSegmentator are strong but do not fully address LAA morphology or provide a cohesive public dataset. A shared, high-resolution dataset aims to catalyze novel analyses of LAA morphology and related cardiac structures.

Method: Create a curated, high-resolution segmentation dataset for LAA, CAs, and PVs. Generate whole-heart labels on ImageCAS with TS. Train a high-resolution LAA segmentation model on a large private, manually annotated dataset guided by a cardiologist, and transfer it to ImageCAS. Improve CA labels from original ImageCAS annotations; refine PV segmentations from TS outputs. Provide a list of scans with common data flaws (e.g., step artifacts, LAAs extending beyond FOV) to aid robust method development.

Result: First open-source, anatomically coherent high-resolution segmentation dataset for LAA, CAs, and PVs on ImageCAS. Improved CA and PV labels; LAA segmentation benefits from a dedicated high-resolution model trained with clinician guidance; dataset includes a curated list of data flaws to inform future studies.

Conclusion: The dataset is poised to spur novel approaches to LAA morphology analysis and broader cardiac segmentation research, while also highlighting common data defects that can affect segmentation performance.

Abstract: Despite the success of advanced segmentation frameworks such as
TotalSegmentator (TS), accurate segmentations of the left atrial appendage
(LAA), coronary arteries (CAs), and pulmonary veins (PVs) remain a significant
challenge in medical imaging. In this work, we present the first open-source,
anatomically coherent dataset of curated, high-resolution segmentations for
these structures, supplemented with whole-heart labels produced by TS on the
publicly available ImageCAS dataset consisting of 1000 cardiac computed
tomography angiography (CCTA) scans. One purpose of the data set is to foster
novel approaches to the analysis of LAA morphology.
  LAA segmentations on ImageCAS were generated using a state-of-the-art
segmentation framework developed specifically for high resolution LAA
segmentation. We trained the network on a large private dataset with manual
annotations provided by medical readers guided by a trained cardiologist and
transferred the model to ImageCAS data. CA labels were improved from the
original ImageCAS annotations, while PV segmentations were refined from TS
outputs. In addition, we provide a list of scans from ImageCAS that contains
common data flaws such as step artefacts, LAAs extending beyond the scanner's
field of view, and other types of data defects.

### [64] [Compact Multi-level-prior Tensor Representation for Hyperspectral Image Super-resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06098)
*Yinjian Wang,Wei Li,Yuanyuan Gui,Gemine Vivone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A compact tensor-based HS/MS fusion model that decouples spectral and spatial priors using block term decomposition and mode-shuffled TV, optimized by linearized ADMM with convergence guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the difficulty of integrating multiple multi-level priors in tensor-based hyperspectral super-resolution without excessive model complexity and to achieve efficient, robust fusion.

Method: Decouple spectral low-rankness and spatial priors by representing the latent image in a spectral subspace and spatial maps via block term decomposition. Stack these maps into a spatial tensor that encodes high-order low-rankness and smoothness, modeled with a non-convex mode-shuffled tensor correlated total variation. Optimize with a linearized alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), with theoretical convergence (KKT) under mild conditions.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets show the proposed method is effective for hyperspectral super-resolution; the authors provide code at the project page (GitHub link) for reproducibility.

Conclusion: The paper presents a scalable, multi-prior tensor framework for hyperspectral super-resolution that decouples spectral and spatial priors and offers convergence guarantees, achieving effective fusion across datasets.

Abstract: Fusing a hyperspectral image with a multispectral image acquired over the
same scene, \textit{i.e.}, hyperspectral image super-resolution, has become a
popular computational way to access the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution
image. To date, a variety of fusion methods have been proposed, among which the
tensor-based ones have testified that multiple priors, such as multidimensional
low-rankness and spatial total variation at multiple levels, effectively drive
the fusion process. However, existing tensor-based models can only effectively
leverage one or two priors at one or two levels, since simultaneously
incorporating multi-level priors inevitably increases model complexity. This
introduces challenges in both balancing the weights of different priors and
optimizing multi-block structures. Concerning this, we present a novel
hyperspectral super-resolution model compactly characterizing these multi-level
priors of hyperspectral images within the tensor framework. Firstly, the
proposed model decouples the spectral low-rankness and spatial priors by
casting the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution image into spectral
subspace and spatial maps via block term decomposition. Secondly, these spatial
maps are stacked as the spatial tensor encoding the high-order spatial
low-rankness and smoothness priors, which are co-modeled via the proposed
non-convex mode-shuffled tensor correlated total variation. Finally, we draw
inspiration from the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers to
design an efficient algorithm to optimize the resulting model, theoretically
proving its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker convergence under mild conditions. Experiments
on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
The code implementation will be available from https://github.com/WongYinJ.

*Shuo Jiang,Zhuwen Chen,Liaoman Xu,Yanming Zhu,Changmiao Wang,Jiong Zhang,Feiwei Qin,Yifei Chen,Zhu Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FeatProto introduces a prototype-based multimodal framework that unifies whole-slide image features and genomic data for interpretable cancer survival prediction, using EMA ProtoUp and hierarchical prototype matching to surpass state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretable survival models are needed in clinical practice, but current prototype learning methods emphasize local similarities and static matching, often ignoring broader tumor context and genomic alignment. There's a need to integrate global/local pathology features with genomic data to improve interpretability and performance.

Method: FeatProto builds a unified prototype space combining global and local WSI features with genomic profiles. Key innovations include: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges critical patches with global context and aligns with genomics to reduce local bias; (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that maintains stable cross-modal associations and uses a wandering mechanism to adapt prototypes to tumor heterogeneity; (3) A hierarchical prototype matching scheme capturing global centrality, local typicality, and cohort-level trends to refine prototype inference.

Result: The method outperforms current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction techniques on four public cancer datasets in accuracy and interoperability, demonstrating strong generalization and interpretability.

Conclusion: FeatProto offers traceable and interpretable decision-making by integrating global/local tumor context with genomic data through a flexible prototype space and adaptation mechanism, highlighting the viability of prototype learning for clinically relevant survival prediction; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Survival analysis plays a vital role in making clinical decisions. However,
the models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces
their usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential
solution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static
matching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic
alignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an
innovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing
cancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current
prototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a
unified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features
of whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates
traceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes
three main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges
critical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize
local bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that
sustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to
adapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype
matching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and
cohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive
evaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method
surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction
techniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective
on prototype learning for critical medical applications. Our source code is
available at https://github.com/JSLiam94/FeatProto.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSGNet augments baselines with StyleGAN3-generated, class-specific images and iterative semi-supervised pseudo-labeling to boost classification and segmentation in medical imaging, achieving consistent gains and high-quality generated samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging faces scarce and imbalanced annotated data; improving performance with data augmentation and semi-supervised labeling can enhance robustness without training a new model from scratch.

Method: SSGNet is a framework that augments existing baselines, using StyleGAN3 to generate class-specific images and applying iterative pseudo-labeling to refine labels; training data is expanded with generated images; evaluation across multiple benchmarks; FID used to assess realism.

Result: Across benchmarks, consistent improvements in classification and segmentation; FID indicates high-quality generated images; supports practicality to alleviate annotation bottlenecks.

Conclusion: SSGNet provides a practical, non-intrusive strategy to improve medical image analysis under limited annotations by combining generative augmentation with semi-supervised labeling.

Abstract: Deep learning in medical imaging is often limited by scarce and imbalanced
annotated data. We present SSGNet, a unified framework that combines class
specific generative modeling with iterative semisupervised pseudo labeling to
enhance both classification and segmentation. Rather than functioning as a
standalone model, SSGNet augments existing baselines by expanding training data
with StyleGAN3 generated images and refining labels through iterative pseudo
labeling. Experiments across multiple medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate
consistent gains in classification and segmentation performance, while Frechet
Inception Distance analysis confirms the high quality of generated samples.
These results highlight SSGNet as a practical strategy to mitigate annotation
bottlenecks and improve robustness in medical image analysis.

*Jiawei Mao,Yuhan Wang,Lifeng Chen,Can Zhao,Yucheng Tang,Dong Yang,Liangqiong Qu,Daguang Xu,Yuyin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MeDiM is a multimodal discrete diffusion model that unifies medical imaging, pathology, and notes via a shared discrete diffusion space using a multimodal LLM backbone, enabling image-text translation and joint image-report generation with bidirectional context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fragmentation across medical modalities hinders the development of a unified foundation model capable of cross-modal reasoning and integrated generation.

Method: A discrete diffusion framework built on a multimodal large language model as the diffusion backbone. Key designs: (i) remove causal attention mask to enable bidirectional context, and (ii) inject continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness. Supports image-to-text, text-to-image translation and joint image-report generation across domains.

Result: High-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on MIMIC-CXR; 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR 0.2650 and 0.2580). Joint image-report generation improves downstream metrics (BLEU-1 +6.43, BLEU-2 +18.57, BLEU-3 +31.58, METEOR +4.80). Demonstrates coherent, clinically grounded multimodal outputs.

Conclusion: MeDiM advances toward a unified medical AI foundation model by enabling unified, flexible generation across imaging, pathology, and clinical text through a shared probabilistic space and cross-modal reasoning.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by
modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary
evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits
their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the
full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete
diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without
modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks:
translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs
across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework,
MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared
probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we
employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone,
leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are
introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context,
and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness.
Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on
MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR
0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance
downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2,
plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports
coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowRVS reframes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow, enabling a one-stage language-guided deformation from video representation to mask and achieving SOTA results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mapping natural language to precise pixel-level segmentation in videos is hard; cascaded locate-then-segment pipelines compress semantics into coarse prompts and break language grounding from temporal dynamics, causing information bottlenecks.

Method: Introduce FlowRVS, a one-stage generative framework that learns a direct, language-guided deformation from a video’s holistic representation to the target mask using a conditional continuous flow, leveraging pretrained text-to-video models, fine-grained pixel control, and temporal coherence.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art on major RVOS benchmarks: MeViS J&F 51.1 (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and zero-shot Ref-DAVIS17 73.3 (+2.7). Demonstrates that video understanding can be framed as a continuous deformation process.

Conclusion: RVOS can be effectively modeled as a continuous deformation problem; the flow-based, language-guided approach yields strong performance and highlights the potential of continuous deformation for video understanding tasks.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting specific
objects in a video guided by a natural language description. The core challenge
of RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels
and continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video. Faced
with this difficulty, prior work has often decomposed the task into a pragmatic
`locate-then-segment' pipeline. However, this cascaded design creates an
information bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts
(e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting
process is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome
these fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that
reconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us
to harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel
control, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of
conventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we
reformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a
video's holistic representation to its target mask. Our one-stage, generative
approach achieves new state-of-the-art results across all major RVOS
benchmarks. Specifically, achieving a $\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}$ of 51.1 in
MeViS (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and 73.3 in the zero shot Ref-DAVIS17 (+2.7),
demonstrating the significant potential of modeling video understanding tasks
as continuous deformation processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D hand motion forecasting from a single image in everyday settings is hampered by scarce 3D annotations and high variability; a scalable pipeline and multimodality-aware objective are needed for robust, generalizable models.

Method: An annotation pipeline using a diffusion model to lift 2D hand keypoint sequences to 4D hand motion; a forecasting model trained with a diffusion loss to capture multimodal hand motion distributions; evaluated on six datasets with imputed labels to exploit diverse data.

Result: Across six datasets, training on diverse data with imputed labels yields 14% improvement; the lifting model is 42% better and the forecasting model 16.4% better than baselines, with strong zero-shot generalization to everyday images.

Conclusion: A diffusion-based lifting plus diffusion-loss forecasting approach, trained on diverse, imputed data, improves bimanual 3D hand motion forecasting in unconstrained settings and generalizes well to everyday imagery, highlighting the value of data diversity and multimodality-aware objectives.

Abstract: We tackle the problem of forecasting bimanual 3D hand motion & articulation
from a single image in everyday settings. To address the lack of 3D hand
annotations in diverse settings, we design an annotation pipeline consisting of
a diffusion model to lift 2D hand keypoint sequences to 4D hand motion. For the
forecasting model, we adopt a diffusion loss to account for the multimodality
in hand motion distribution. Extensive experiments across 6 datasets show the
benefits of training on diverse data with imputed labels (14% improvement) and
effectiveness of our lifting (42% better) & forecasting (16.4% gain) models,
over the best baselines, especially in zero-shot generalization to everyday

The framework synthesizes a single dynamic 3D representation end-to-end directly from the input video.

Result: The method improves robustness and perceptual fidelity and reduces failure modes compared with baselines across diverse in-the-wild videos, accurately capturing non-rigid motion, volume changes, and even topological transitions without per-frame optimization.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a native video-to-4D generation framework that produces end-to-end dynamic 3D reconstructions from video with improved robustness and fidelity, enabling stable, topologically-aware 4D reconstructions without per-frame optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address realism gaps in generated driving videos and understand biases and generalization of E2E planners for autonomous driving; enable cost-effective data collection.

Method: Introduce the Drive&Gen framework; develop statistical measures that leverage E2E drivers to assess realism of video outputs; use controllable video generation to craft targeted tests; analyze distribution gaps between real and synthetic data; show synthetic data improves E2E generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains.

Result: Proposes quantitative realism metrics, demonstrates controllable generation for diagnostic experiments, and shows synthetic data enhances E2E planner generalization in new operational contexts at reduced cost.

Conclusion: Drive&Gen offers a practical bridge between generative world models and E2E driving, enabling better evaluation, bias analysis, and expansion of AV services through synthetic data and targeted tests.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have sparked exciting new possibilities
in the field of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, video generation models are
now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments.
Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined
alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining
popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of
these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First,
while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can
these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic
enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is
crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper
insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to
out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the
driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these
questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to
evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of
the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate
distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that
synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective
alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively
improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains,
facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational
contexts.

*Ayush Shrivastava,Connelly Barnes,Xuaner Zhang,Lingzhi Zhang,Andrew Owens,Sohrab Amirghodsi,Eli Shechtman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based text-to-image model leverages EXIF camera metadata to enable controllable lens blur through a differentiable lens model, by producing an all-in-focus image, estimating depth, predicting focus distance with a dedicated transformer, and applying defocus; trained end-to-end with no explicit supervision to achieve interactive depth-of-field control while preserving scene content.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion models struggle to incorporate fine-grained camera metadata like aperture settings and lens blur. There is a need for physically grounded, controllable depth-of-field in generated images that aligns with real-world photography and allows user-directed adjustments without altering the depicted scene.

Method: A four-stage pipeline: (1) generate an all-in-focus image using diffusion, (2) estimate monocular depth of the scene, (3) predict a plausible focus distance using a novel focus-distance transformer, (4) synthesize a defocused image via a differentiable lens blur model. The process is end-to-end differentiable, allowing gradient flow back through to learn defocus effects guided by content elements and provided EXIF data. EXIF metadata conditions guidance during inference to enable precise user control over defocus.

Result: Experiments demonstrate superior fine-grained control over defocus compared to baseline diffusion methods, achieving defocus that respects scene content while aligning with EXIF-informed expectations, without requiring explicit supervision.

Conclusion: Integrating EXIF camera metadata with a differentiable lens blur and a focus-distance transformer enables precise, interactive control of depth-of-field in diffusion-generated images, bridging physical image formation with generative modeling while preserving scene integrity.

Abstract: Current text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating diverse,
high-quality images, yet they struggle to incorporate fine-grained camera
metadata such as precise aperture settings. In this work, we introduce a novel
text-to-image diffusion framework that leverages camera metadata, or EXIF data,
which is often embedded in image files, with an emphasis on generating
controllable lens blur. Our method mimics the physical image formation process
by first generating an all-in-focus image, estimating its monocular depth,
predicting a plausible focus distance with a novel focus distance transformer,
and then forming a defocused image with an existing differentiable lens blur
model. Gradients flow backwards through this whole process, allowing us to
learn without explicit supervision to generate defocus effects based on content
elements and the provided EXIF data. At inference time, this enables precise
interactive user control over defocus effects while preserving scene contents,
which is not achievable with existing diffusion models. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model enables superior fine-grained control without
altering the depicted scene.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoNight introduces a nighttime egocentric VQA benchmark with day-night aligned synthetic and real videos, enabling robust evaluation and cross-illumination generalization; reveals large performance gaps for night vs day; provides dataset, labeling engine, and auxiliary tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current egocentric benchmarks focus on daytime, neglectting low-light conditions common in real use; there is a need for data and evaluation methods that cover night scenarios to judge and improve model robustness across illumination domains.

Method: Collect and align synthetic Blender-rendered and real egocentric videos across day and night; pair scenes and actions; construct EgoNight-VQA with a day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and extensive human verification; 3658 QA pairs across 90 videos, 12 QA types, >300 hours of human labor; introduce two auxiliary tasks: day-night correspondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night.

Result: Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs show substantial performance drops when transferring from day to night, highlighting the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions; EgoNight-VQA comprises 3658 QA pairs, 90 videos, and extensive human verification; data and code will be released upon acceptance; auxiliary tasks broaden evaluation of model capabilities in night conditions.

Conclusion: EgoNight-VQA provides a strong foundation for advancing egocentric vision research under variable illumination and for developing models that generalize across lighting domains, with practical impact for real-world night-time applications.

Abstract: Most existing benchmarks for egocentric vision understanding focus primarily
on daytime scenarios, overlooking the low-light conditions that are inevitable
in real-world applications. To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the
first comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual
question answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the
introduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation
quality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between
lighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered
by Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are
visually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct
EgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and
refinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked
by annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs
across 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of
human work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to
night, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.
Beyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night
correspondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further
explore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a
strong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research
and for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the
data and code will be made available upon acceptance.

### [74] [Human3R: Everyone Everywhere All at Once](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06219)
*Yue Chen,Xingyu Chen,Yuxuan Xue,Anpei Chen,Yuliang Xiu,Gerard Pons-Moll*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A single-stage, real-time 4D reconstruction model that jointly recovers multiple SMPL-X humans, global 3D scene, and camera trajectories from casual monocular video in the world frame, without multi-stage pipelines, by augmenting CUT3R with visual-prompt tuning; trained on BEDLAM; achieves competitive/state-of-the-art results at 15 FPS with modest memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To relax the reliance on multi-step pipelines and heavy preprocessors for human–scene reconstruction, and to deliver a unified, online framework that leverages spatiotemporal priors while outputting all targets (humans, scenes, camera) in a single pass.

Method: A unified, feed-forward model building on CUT3R, using parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning to preserve priors and enable direct multi-person SMPL-X output, together with 3D scene and camera pose in one forward pass; trained on a small synthetic BEDLAM dataset (one day, a single GPU) to achieve real-time performance (15 FPS) with 8 GB memory.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art or competitive performance on global human motion estimation, local mesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, all from a single model; real-time, low-memory reconstruction of multiple people and scenes.

Conclusion: Human3R provides a simple yet strong baseline that eliminates heavy dependencies and iterative refinement, is easily extensible for downstream tasks, and is ready for deployment and further research; code available.

Abstract: We present Human3R, a unified, feed-forward framework for online 4D
human-scene reconstruction, in the world frame, from casually captured
monocular videos. Unlike previous approaches that rely on multi-stage
pipelines, iterative contact-aware refinement between humans and scenes, and
heavy dependencies, e.g., human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM
pre-processing, Human3R jointly recovers global multi-person SMPL-X bodies
("everyone"), dense 3D scene ("everywhere"), and camera trajectories in a
single forward pass ("all-at-once"). Our method builds upon the 4D online
reconstruction model CUT3R, and uses parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning,
to strive to preserve CUT3R's rich spatiotemporal priors, while enabling direct
readout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Human3R is a unified model that eliminates
heavy dependencies and iterative refinement. After being trained on the
relatively small-scale synthetic dataset BEDLAM for just one day on one GPU, it
achieves superior performance with remarkable efficiency: it reconstructs
multiple humans in a one-shot manner, along with 3D scenes, in one stage, at
real-time speed (15 FPS) with a low memory footprint (8 GB). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Human3R delivers state-of-the-art or competitive
performance across tasks, including global human motion estimation, local human
mesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, with a
single unified model. We hope that Human3R will serve as a simple yet strong
baseline, be easily extended for downstream applications.Code available in

### [75] [Synthetic History: Evaluating Visual Representations of the Past in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17064)
*Maria-Teresa De Rosa Palmini,Eva Cetinic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable, reproducible benchmark (HistVis) and methodology to evaluate how Text-to-Image diffusion models depict historical periods, revealing implicit stylistic cues, anachronisms, and skewed demographics in generated imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the gap in evaluating historical accuracy and cultural alignment in TTI systems, extending beyond biases to how models portray historical contexts.

Method: Construct HistVis dataset of 30,000 synthetic images from three state-of-the-art diffusion models using prompts of universal human activities across historical periods; evaluate implicit stylistic associations, historical consistency, and demographic representation.

Result: Finds systematic inaccuracies in historically themed imagery: models use unstated era cues, introduce anachronisms, and fail to reflect plausible historical demographics; provides a scalable benchmark for future improvements.

Conclusion: Offers an initial step toward more historically accurate and culturally aligned TTI models, with a reproducible methodology and dataset to guide future research.

Abstract: As Text-to-Image (TTI) diffusion models become increasingly influential in
content creation, growing attention is being directed toward their societal and
cultural implications. While prior research has primarily examined demographic
and cultural biases, the ability of these models to accurately represent
historical contexts remains largely underexplored. In this work, we present a
systematic and reproducible methodology for evaluating how TTI systems depict
different historical periods. For this purpose, we introduce the HistVis
dataset, a curated collection of 30,000 synthetic images generated by three
state-of-the-art diffusion models using carefully designed prompts depicting
universal human activities across different historical periods. We evaluate
generated imagery across three key aspects: (1) Implicit Stylistic
Associations: examining default visual styles associated with specific eras;
(2) Historical Consistency: identifying anachronisms such as modern artifacts
in pre-modern contexts; and (3) Demographic Representation: comparing generated
racial and gender distributions against historically plausible baselines. Our
findings reveal systematic inaccuracies in historically themed generated
imagery, as TTI models frequently stereotype past eras by incorporating
unstated stylistic cues, introduce anachronisms, and fail to reflect plausible
demographic patterns. By offering a scalable methodology and benchmark for
assessing historical representation in generated imagery, this work provides an
initial step toward building more historically accurate and culturally aligned
TTI models.

### [76] [Algorithms and Lower Bounds for the Maximum Overlap of Two Polygons Under Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05896)
*Mikkel Abrahamsen,Sujoy Bhore,Maike Buchin,Jacobus Conradi,Ce Jin,André Nusser,Carolin Rehs*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: An improved O((nm)^{3/2} log(nm)) algorithm for polygon overlap under translation when both polygons are orthogonal, along with k-SUM/3-SUM conditional lower bounds; this shows the orthogonal case can beat the long-standing general-polygons bound and separates orthogonal from diagonal-edge cases, with tightness results for m=O(1).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fast overlap/containment for natural polygon classes beyond convex ones and clarify the conditional hardness landscape under k-SUM and 3-SUM hypotheses.

Method: Develop a specialized algorithm for translating orthogonal polygons to maximize overlap, achieving O((nm)^{3/2} log(nm)) time; provide reductions from k-SUM/3-SUM to obtain conditional lower bounds and derive consequences for polygon containment.

Result: Algorithm runs in O((nm)^{3/2} log(nm)). No O(max(n^2, nm^2)^{1-ε}) time algorithm for polygon overlap under k-SUM (with m ≤ n); no O(n^{2-ε}) algorithm for polygon containment under 3-SUM even when m=O(1); shows hardness separation between orthogonal and diagonal-edge polygons and tightness of Mount-Silverman-Wu 1996 for m=O(1).

Conclusion: The work provides the first subquadratic-time technique for orthogonal polygon overlap under translation and establishes conditional lower bounds that match this algorithm in the m=n regime, while highlighting a separation in difficulty between orthogonal and diagonal-edge cases and tightening known bounds for polygon containment.

Abstract: A fundamental problem in shape matching and geometric similarity is computing
the maximum area overlap between two polygons under translation. For general
simple polygons, the best-known algorithm runs in $O((nm)^2 \log(nm))$ time
[Mount, Silverman, Wu 96], where $n$ and $m$ are the complexities of the input
polygons. In a recent breakthrough, Chan and Hair gave a linear-time algorithm
for the special case when both polygons are convex. A key challenge in
computational geometry is to design improved algorithms for other natural
classes of polygons. We address this by presenting an $O((nm)^{3/2}
\log(nm))$-time algorithm for the case when both polygons are orthogonal. This
is the first algorithm for polygon overlap on orthogonal polygons that is
faster than the almost 30 years old algorithm for simple polygons.
  Complementing our algorithmic contribution, we provide $k$-SUM lower bounds
for problems on simple polygons with only orthogonal and diagonal edges. First,
we establish that there is no algorithm for polygon overlap with running time
$O(\max(n^2,nm^2)^{1-\varepsilon})$, where $m\leq n$, unless the $k$-SUM
hypothesis fails. This matches the running time of our algorithm when $n=m$. We
use part of the above construction to also show a lower bound for the polygon
containment problem, a popular special case of the overlap problem. Concretely,
there is no algorithm for polygon containment with running time
$O(n^{2-\varepsilon})$ under the $3$-SUM hypothesis, even when the polygon to
be contained has $m=O(1)$ vertices. Our lower bound shows that polygon
containment for these types of polygons (i.e., with diagonal edges) is strictly
harder than for orthogonal polygons, and also strengthens the previously known
lower bounds for polygon containment. Furthermore, our lower bounds show
tightness of the algorithm of [Mount, Silverman, Wu 96] when $m=O(1)$.

### [77] [Rule Encoding and Compliance in Large Language Models: An Information-Theoretic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05106)
*Joachim Diederich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An information-theoretic analysis of system-prompt rule encodings shows that low-entropy, concentrated anchors reduce attention entropy and improve pointer fidelity, but a trade-off exists between anchor redundancy and entropy. The work analyzes multiple attention architectures, derives bounds on pointer fidelity, and proves that hot reloading verified rule sets increases compliant outputs, underscoring principled anchor design and dual enforcement for safety-critical LLM agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To safeguard safety-critical LLM-based agents from prompt injection and evolving adversarial or domain conditions by designing principled rule anchors and dynamic verification mechanisms that maintain compliance.

Method: Formal information-theoretic analysis of rule encodings in system prompts across causal, bidirectional, local sparse, kernelized, and cross-attention architectures. Derivation of bounds on pointer fidelity, guidelines for anchor placement accounting for fidelity-entropy trade-offs, and integration with a dynamic rule verification architecture. Includes a formal proof that hot reloading of verified rule sets increases asymptotic compliant outputs.

Result: Demonstrates that low syntactic entropy rule formats with concentrated anchors reduce attention entropy and improve pointer fidelity. Identifies a fundamental trade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy not previously recognized. Establishes bounds on pointer fidelity across multiple attention schemes and provides anchor-placement strategies. Provides a formal proof that hot reloading verified rule sets increases the asymptotic probability of compliant outputs.

Conclusion: Principled anchor design and dual enforcement mechanisms are essential to protect LLM-based agents from prompt injections while maintaining compliance in evolving domains; dynamic rule updates (hot reloading) enhance long-term compliance.

Abstract: The design of safety-critical agents based on large language models (LLMs)
requires more than simple prompt engineering. This paper presents a
comprehensive information-theoretic analysis of how rule encodings in system
prompts influence attention mechanisms and compliance behaviour. We demonstrate
that rule formats with low syntactic entropy and highly concentrated anchors
reduce attention entropy and improve pointer fidelity, but reveal a fundamental
trade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy that previous work
failed to recognize. Through formal analysis of multiple attention
architectures including causal, bidirectional, local sparse, kernelized, and
cross-attention mechanisms, we establish bounds on pointer fidelity and show
how anchor placement strategies must account for competing fidelity and entropy
objectives. Combining these insights with a dynamic rule verification
architecture, we provide a formal proof that hot reloading of verified rule
sets increases the asymptotic probability of compliant outputs. These findings
underscore the necessity of principled anchor design and dual enforcement
mechanisms to protect LLM-based agents against prompt injection attacks while
maintaining compliance in evolving domains.

### [78] [Structured Cognition for Behavioral Intelligence in Large Language Model Agents: Preliminary Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05107)
*Myung Ho Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SCL architecture separates inference, memory, and execution for LLM-driven agents, improving reliability and traceability with modest gains over prompt-based baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt-based agents intertwine cognitive functions in a single prompt, risking coherence, predictability, and traceability; architectural separation aims to reduce cognitive load on the model and improve evaluation.

Method: Introduce Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL): external memory, dedicated inference, lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop; compare to ReAct and LangChain agents across three tasks; 360 episodes; ablation studies on memory and control; fixed base model and tools and decoding settings.

Result: SCL achieves 86.3% task success vs 70-77% for baselines; higher goal fidelity; fewer redundant tool calls; better intermediate state reuse; fewer unsupported assertions per 100 tool calls; ablations show independently beneficial contributions; results stable across decoding sweeps.

Conclusion: Architectural separation can improve reliability and traceability without larger models or heavier prompts; findings are preliminary; suggests broader future studies with more models, longer horizons, multimodal tasks, and collaboration.

Abstract: Large language models have advanced natural language understanding and
generation, yet their use as autonomous agents raises architectural challenges
for multi-step tasks. Existing frameworks often intertwine inference, memory,
and control in a single prompt, which can reduce coherence and predictability.
The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is introduced as an alternative
architecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model is
dedicated to inference, memory is maintained externally, and execution is
guided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design
offloads cognitive load from the model and allows intermediate results to be
stored, revisited, and checked before actions are taken, providing a clearer
basis for traceability and evaluation.
  We evaluate SCL against prompt-based baselines including ReAct and common
LangChain agents across three scenarios: temperature-based travel planning,
email drafting with conditional send, and constraint-guided image generation.
All systems share the same base model and tools under matched decoding
settings. Across 360 episodes, SCL shows modest but consistent improvements.
Task success averages 86.3 percent compared with 70-77 percent for baselines.
Goal fidelity is higher, redundant calls are fewer, intermediate states are
reused more reliably, and unsupported assertions per 100 tool calls are
reduced. Ablations show that external memory and control each contribute
independently, and decoding sweeps confirm stability of the effects.
  These results suggest that architectural separation can improve reliability
and traceability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts. The
findings are preliminary and intended to guide extended studies with additional
models, longer horizons, multimodal tasks, and collaborative settings.

### [79] [Optimization Modeling via Semantic Anchored Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05115)
*Yansen Zhang,Qingcan Kang,Yujie Chen,Yufei Wang,Xiongwei Han,Tao Zhong,Mingxuan Yuan,Chen Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAC-Opt uses backward-guided, semantic-anchored corrections to align LLM-generated optimization models with problem intent, improving fidelity and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current solver-driven generation often yields semantically flawed models that are syntactically correct but logically inconsistent; there is a need for semantic fidelity in LLM-based optimization.

Method: A backward-guided correction framework that reconstructs problem semantics from the generated code, aligns them with original semantic anchors, and selectively fixes only mismatched components, iteratively refining the model without extra supervision.

Result: Average modeling accuracy improves by 7.8%, with gains up to 21.9% on the ComplexLP dataset across seven public datasets.

Conclusion: Semantic-anchored correction is important for faithful translation from problem intent to solver-executable code in LLM-based optimization workflows.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have opened new paradigms in optimization
modeling by enabling the generation of executable solver code from natural
language descriptions. Despite this promise, existing approaches typically
remain solver-driven: they rely on single-pass forward generation and apply
limited post-hoc fixes based on solver error messages, leaving undetected
semantic errors that silently produce syntactically correct but logically
flawed models. To address this challenge, we propose SAC-Opt, a backward-guided
correction framework that grounds optimization modeling in problem semantics
rather than solver feedback. At each step, SAC-Opt aligns the original semantic
anchors with those reconstructed from the generated code and selectively
corrects only the mismatched components, driving convergence toward a
semantically faithful model. This anchor-driven correction enables fine-grained
refinement of constraint and objective logic, enhancing both fidelity and
robustness without requiring additional training or supervision. Empirical
results on seven public datasets demonstrate that SAC-Opt improves average
modeling accuracy by 7.8\%, with gains of up to 21.9\% on the ComplexLP
dataset. These findings highlight the importance of semantic-anchored
correction in LLM-based optimization workflows to ensure faithful translation
from problem intent to solver-executable code.

*Zhihao Yang,Ancheng Xu,Jingpeng Li,Liang Yan,Jiehui Zhou,Zhen Qin,Hengyun Chang,Ahmadreza Argha,Hamid Alinejad-Rokny,Minghuan Tan,Yujun Cai,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DAT is a three-stage framework (qualitative analysis, evidence gathering, adjudication) to improve structured rule-based reasoning in LLMs, outperforming CoT and enabling smaller models to match or exceed larger models on complex rule systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with interdependent, logically organized rule systems when treated as unstructured text, causing reasoning divergence and error propagation; existing CoT lacks systematic structured processing.

Method: DAT's three stages: qualitative analysis of context; evidence gathering using predefined template elements and targeted extraction; adjudication synthesizing validated components into a comprehensive judgment, with verification against applicable rules.

Result: DAT consistently outperforms conventional CoT on complex rule-based tasks; smaller models can match or exceed larger LLMs, demonstrating efficiency and effectiveness in managing intricate rule systems.

Conclusion: DAT provides a structured, scalable approach to rule-based reasoning in LLMs, addressing CoT limitations and enabling robust performance across model sizes.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges when processing
complex rule systems, as they typically treat interdependent rules as
unstructured textual data rather than as logically organized frameworks. This
limitation results in reasoning divergence, where models often overlook
critical rule dependencies essential for accurate interpretation. Although
existing approaches such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have shown
promise, they lack systematic methodologies for structured rule processing and
are particularly susceptible to error propagation through sequential reasoning
chains. To address these limitations, we propose the Dynamic Adjudication
Template (DAT), a novel framework inspired by expert human reasoning processes.
DAT structures the inference mechanism into three methodical stages:
qualitative analysis, evidence gathering, and adjudication. During the
qualitative analysis phase, the model comprehensively evaluates the contextual
landscape. The subsequent evidence gathering phase involves the targeted
extraction of pertinent information based on predefined template elements
([placeholder]), followed by systematic verification against applicable rules.
Finally, in the adjudication phase, the model synthesizes these validated
components to formulate a comprehensive judgment. Empirical results demonstrate
that DAT consistently outperforms conventional CoT approaches in complex
rule-based tasks. Notably, DAT enables smaller language models to match, and in
some cases exceed, the performance of significantly larger LLMs, highlighting
its efficiency and effectiveness in managing intricate rule systems.

### [81] [An Algorithmic Information-Theoretic Perspective on the Symbol Grounding Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05153)
*Zhangchi Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The abstract frames symbol grounding as an information-theoretic problem: grounding is compression within a universal Turing machine, unifying Gödelian and No Free Lunch limits; meaning is an open-ended process bounded by a system's own complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the Symbol Grounding Problem by unifying self-reference (Gödel) and statistical (No Free Lunch) perspectives through Algorithmic Information Theory, showing grounding is constrained by information-theoretic limits.

Method: Model a symbolic system as a universal Turing machine and define grounding as information compression; present a four-stage argument; apply Chaitin's incompleteness theorem to bound learning processes.

Result: 1) Purely symbolic systems cannot ground almost all worlds (data strings) because most are algorithmically random and incompressible. 2) A statically grounded, world-specific compressor is inherently incomplete, as an adversarial incompressible world can be constructed. 3) The grounding act of adapting to a new world is non-inferable, requiring new information not deducible from existing code. 4) Any finite algorithmic learner cannot comprehend worlds whose complexity exceeds its own. Conclusion: meaning is an open-ended process of systems striving to overcome information-theoretic limits.

Conclusion: Meaning emerges as an ongoing process in which a system attempts to transcend its own information-theoretic constraints; the framework unifies Gödelian self-reference and No Free Lunch perspectives, reframing grounding as information compression within algorithmic information theory.

Abstract: This paper provides a definitive, unifying framework for the Symbol Grounding
Problem (SGP) by reformulating it within Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT).
We demonstrate that the grounding of meaning is a process fundamentally
constrained by information-theoretic limits, thereby unifying the G\"odelian
(self-reference) and No Free Lunch (statistical) perspectives. We model a
symbolic system as a universal Turing machine and define grounding as an act of
information compression. The argument proceeds in four stages. First, we prove
that a purely symbolic system cannot ground almost all possible "worlds" (data
strings), as they are algorithmically random and thus incompressible. Second,
we show that any statically grounded system, specialized for compressing a
specific world, is inherently incomplete because an adversarial, incompressible
world relative to the system can always be constructed. Third, the "grounding
act" of adapting to a new world is proven to be non-inferable, as it requires
the input of new information (a shorter program) that cannot be deduced from
the system's existing code. Finally, we use Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem to
prove that any algorithmic learning process is itself a finite system that
cannot comprehend or model worlds whose complexity provably exceeds its own.
This establishes that meaning is the open-ended process of a system perpetually
attempting to overcome its own information-theoretic limitations.

*Xin He,Liangliang You,Hongduan Tian,Bo Han,Ivor Tsang,Yew-Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Lang-PINN uses an LLM-driven multi-agent system to automatically construct trainable PINNs from natural language task descriptions, bridging PDE parsing, architecture selection, code generation, and iterative debugging. It reports large improvements in accuracy, robustness, and runtime efficiency over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Building usable PINNs from informal problem descriptions is labor-intensive and error-prone. Existing LLM work handles isolated steps and assumes a formal PDE is provided; there is a need for end-to-end systems that translate natural language tasks into executable PINN implementations.

Method: Lang-PINN coordinates four agents: (1) PDE Agent converts task descriptions into symbolic PDEs, (2) PINN Agent selects neural architectures appropriate for the PDE, (3) Code Agent generates modular, reusable code implementing the PINN, and (4) Feedback Agent runs the model, diagnoses errors, and iteratively refines the solution until performance criteria are met.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows substantial improvements: MSE reduced by 3–5 orders of magnitude, end-to-end execution success increased by >50%, and time overhead reduced by up to 74% compared to competitive baselines.

Conclusion: An end-to-end, LLM-driven system can reliably convert natural language tasks into executable PINNs, improving accuracy and robustness while reducing development time.

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a powerful approach for
solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but constructing a usable PINN
remains labor-intensive and error-prone. Scientists must interpret problems as
PDE formulations, design architectures and loss functions, and implement stable
training pipelines. Existing large language model (LLM) based approaches
address isolated steps such as code generation or architecture suggestion, but
typically assume a formal PDE is already specified and therefore lack an
end-to-end perspective. We present Lang-PINN, an LLM-driven multi-agent system
that builds trainable PINNs directly from natural language task descriptions.
Lang-PINN coordinates four complementary agents: a PDE Agent that parses task
descriptions into symbolic PDEs, a PINN Agent that selects architectures, a
Code Agent that generates modular implementations, and a Feedback Agent that
executes and diagnoses errors for iterative refinement. This design transforms
informal task statements into executable and verifiable PINN code. Experiments
show that Lang-PINN achieves substantially lower errors and greater robustness
than competitive baselines: mean squared error (MSE) is reduced by up to 3--5
orders of magnitude, end-to-end execution success improves by more than 50\%,
and reduces time overhead by up to 74\%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Foundation models yield transferable, cross-modal compatible representations with structural regularities and semantic consistency; a survey synthesizes evidence across vision, language, speech, multimodality, and neuroscience, outlines factors that foster these potentials, and discusses open questions and challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the latent representation potential of foundation models: how they encode task-specific information within a modality and provide a transferable basis for alignment across modalities.

Method: Survey of representative foundation models; review of key alignment metrics; synthesis of empirical evidence across vision, language, speech, multimodality, and neuroscience; analysis of factors fostering representation potentials; discussion of open questions and challenges.

Result: Evidence suggests foundation models exhibit structural regularities and semantic consistencies in their representation spaces, supporting cross-modal transfer and alignment; identification of factors that foster representation potentials.

Conclusion: Representation potentials are a promising path for cross-modal unification; further work is needed to address open questions and challenges in understanding and leveraging these potentials.

Abstract: Foundation models learn highly transferable representations through
large-scale pretraining on diverse data. An increasing body of research
indicates that these representations exhibit a remarkable degree of similarity
across architectures and modalities. In this survey, we investigate the
representation potentials of foundation models, defined as the latent capacity
of their learned representations to capture task-specific information within a
single modality while also providing a transferable basis for alignment and
unification across modalities. We begin by reviewing representative foundation
models and the key metrics that make alignment measurable. We then synthesize
empirical evidence of representation potentials from studies in vision,
language, speech, multimodality, and neuroscience. The evidence suggests that
foundation models often exhibit structural regularities and semantic
consistencies in their representation spaces, positioning them as strong
candidates for cross-modal transfer and alignment. We further analyze the key
factors that foster representation potentials, discuss open questions, and
highlight potential challenges.

TL;DR: A six-layer real-time IoT framework with semantic annotation, interoperability, transport, reasoning, and a GUI to enable semantic understanding and real-time inference in IoT/agriculture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address challenges in data collection and semantic understanding in IoT, enabling data meaning, source tracing, and real-time knowledge inference in dynamic environments, with a focus on agriculture.

Method: Proposes a six-layer architecture: perception, semantic annotation, interoperability, transportation, semantic reasoning, application; data flow via voltage sensors to semantic preprocessing, metadata tagging; two semantic algorithms for interoperability (standardizing file types) and synonym identification; data transport over WiFi/ZigBee/Bluetooth; uncertainty reasoning via fuzzy logic, Dempster-Shafer theory, Bayesian networks; GUI in the application layer for monitoring and interaction.

Result: Describes a conceptual, end-to-end framework with components and algorithms, aiming to provide semantic completeness and real-time inference; integrates uncertainty reasoning with semantic interoperability to enhance IoT applications, especially agriculture.

Conclusion: The framework contributes a robust, semantically rich approach for IoT data management and real-time inference, highlighting the value of combining interoperability techniques with uncertainty reasoning in agriculture and broader IoT contexts.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized various applications
including agriculture, but it still faces challenges in data collection and
understanding. This paper proposes a real-time framework with three additional
semantic layers to help IoT devices and sensors comprehend data meaning and
source. The framework consists of six layers: perception, semantic annotation,
interoperability, transportation, semantic reasoning, and application, suitable
for dynamic environments. Sensors collect data in the form of voltage, which is
then processed by microprocessors or microcontrollers in the semantic
annotation and preprocessing layer. Metadata is added to the raw data,
including the purpose, ID number, and application. Two semantic algorithms are
proposed in the semantic interoperability and ontologies layer: the
interoperability semantic algorithm for standardizing file types and the
synonym identification algorithm for identifying synonyms. In the
transportation layer, raw data and metadata are sent to other IoT devices or
cloud computing platforms using techniques like WiFi, Zigbee networks,
Bluetooth, and mobile communication networks. A semantic reasoning layer is
proposed to infer new knowledge from the existing data, using fuzzy logic,
Dempster-Shafer theory, and Bayesian networks. A Graphical User Interface (GUI)
is proposed in the application layer to help users communicate with and monitor
IoT sensors, devices, and new knowledge inferred. This framework provides a
robust solution for managing IoT data, ensuring semantic completeness, and
enabling real-time knowledge inference. The integration of uncertainty
reasoning methods and semantic interoperability techniques makes this framework
a valuable tool for advancing IoT applications in general and in agriculture in
particular.

### [85] [Plug-and-Play Dramaturge: A Divide-and-Conquer Approach for Iterative Narrative Script Refinement via Collaborative LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05188)
*Wenda Xie,Chao Guo,Yanqing Jing. Junle Wang,Yisheng Lv,Fei-Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Dramaturge uses a hierarchical, multi-LLM agent framework to divide-and-conquer revisions of long scripts, enabling global coherence and local detail improvements through staged, iterative, top-down coordination; it outperforms baselines and is plug-and-play.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-pass LLMs struggle with long narratives; revising such scripts requires understanding global structure, identifying both broad issues and fine-grained flaws, and coordinating edits across levels to maintain consistency. Current local edits often introduce inconsistencies with overall narrative requirements.

Method: Three-stage workflow: Global Review to grasp overall storyline and structural issues; Scene-level Review to detect detailed scene/sentence flaws; Hierarchical Coordinated Revision to integrate structural and detailed improvements. A top-down task flow guides local edits; a coarse-to-fine iterative process runs across multiple rounds until substantive improvements cease. The approach is plug-and-play and can integrate with existing methods.

Result: Experimental results show Dramaturge significantly outperforms all baselines in script-level overall quality and scene-level details.

Conclusion: Dramaturge provides a general, scalable framework for long-narrative revision using hierarchical agents; it improves consistency between structure and details and can be readily integrated into existing generation pipelines.

Abstract: Although LLMs have been widely adopted for creative content generation, a
single-pass process often struggles to produce high-quality long narratives.
How to effectively revise and improve long narrative scripts like scriptwriters
remains a significant challenge, as it demands a comprehensive understanding of
the entire context to identify global structural issues and local detailed
flaws, as well as coordinating revisions at multiple granularities and
locations. Direct modifications by LLMs typically introduce inconsistencies
between local edits and the overall narrative requirements. To address these
issues, we propose Dramaturge, a task and feature oriented divide-and-conquer
approach powered by hierarchical multiple LLM agents. It consists of a Global
Review stage to grasp the overall storyline and structural issues, a
Scene-level Review stage to pinpoint detailed scene and sentence flaws, and a
Hierarchical Coordinated Revision stage that coordinates and integrates
structural and detailed improvements throughout the script. The top-down task
flow ensures that high-level strategies guide local modifications, maintaining
contextual consistency. The review and revision workflow follows a
coarse-to-fine iterative process, continuing through multiple rounds until no
further substantive improvements can be made. Comprehensive experiments show
that Dramaturge significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of
script-level overall quality and scene-level details. Our approach is
plug-and-play and can be easily integrated into existing methods to improve the
generated scripts.

### [86] [Graph-based LLM over Semi-Structured Population Data for Dynamic Policy Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05196)
*Daqian Shi,Xiaolei Diao,Jinge Wu,Honghan Wu,Xiongfeng Tang,Felix Naughton,Paulina Bondaronek*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A graph-based reasoning framework integrates LLMs with structured demographic data and unstructured public feedback in a weakly supervised pipeline to enable timely, population-specific analyses and interpretable policy insights. Preliminary results on real-world data show feasibility, offering a scalable approach for resource-constrained health monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The abstract addresses the challenge of analyzing massive semi-structured data (structured demographics + unstructured feedback) during public health emergencies. Manual expert assessments are accurate but slow; standard NLP needs large labeled datasets and struggles with cross-domain generalization. The work aims to combine LLMs with structured data in a weakly supervised, scalable framework to produce actionable, interpretable insights for policy-making.

Method: A novel graph-based reasoning framework that (1) integrates large language models with structured demographic attributes and unstructured public feedback; (2) dynamically models evolving citizen needs into a need-aware graph; (3) enables population-specific analyses using features such as age, gender, and the Index of Multiple Deprivation; (4) operates in a weakly supervised pipeline and outputs interpretable insights.

Result: The method is tested on a real-world dataset with preliminary experimental results indicating feasibility and practicality in generating interpretable, population-focused insights.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable solution for intelligent population health monitoring in resource-constrained clinical and governmental settings, potentially improving timely, tailored health policy decisions during emergencies.

Abstract: Timely and accurate analysis of population-level data is crucial for
effective decision-making during public health emergencies such as the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the massive input of semi-structured data, including
structured demographic information and unstructured human feedback, poses
significant challenges to conventional analysis methods. Manual expert-driven
assessments, though accurate, are inefficient, while standard NLP pipelines
often require large task-specific labeled datasets and struggle with
generalization across diverse domains. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel graph-based reasoning framework that integrates large language models
with structured demographic attributes and unstructured public feedback in a
weakly supervised pipeline. The proposed approach dynamically models evolving
citizen needs into a need-aware graph, enabling population-specific analyses
based on key features such as age, gender, and the Index of Multiple
Deprivation. It generates interpretable insights to inform responsive health
policy decision-making. We test our method using a real-world dataset, and
preliminary experimental results demonstrate its feasibility. This approach
offers a scalable solution for intelligent population health monitoring in
resource-constrained clinical and governmental settings.

*Joshua Kazdan,Rylan Schaeffer,Youssef Allouah,Colin Sullivan,Kyssen Yu,Noam Levi,Sanmi Koyejo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces a robust framework to forecast frontier AI behavior under large-scale sampling by (1) identifying flaws in standard laws with limited data, (2) using a beta-binomial model for more accurate predictions from scarce data, and (3) employing a dynamic sampling strategy that prioritizes harder problems to improve reliability and cost-efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reliably predict AI model capabilities and potential harms at scale when data are limited; this is crucial for platform providers and regulators who must forecast rare events and manage risk.

Method: Three contributions: (1) diagnose statistical shortcomings of standard fitting methods in data-limited settings; (2) develop a beta-binomial-based robust estimation framework for better predictions from limited data; (3) propose a dynamic sampling strategy allocating more budget to harder problems to improve forecasting efficiency.

Result: Produces more accurate predictions of rare capabilities and harms at a fraction of the computational cost, improving reliability of capability/safety forecasting under data constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enhances scalable forecasting of AI capabilities and risks, aiding providers and regulators in risk assessment and governance with better, cheaper predictions.

Abstract: Assessing the capabilities and risks of frontier AI systems is a critical
area of research, and recent work has shown that repeated sampling from models
can dramatically increase both. For instance, repeated sampling has been shown
to increase their capabilities, such as solving difficult math and coding
problems, but it has also been shown to increase their potential for harm, such
as being jailbroken. Such results raise a crucial question for both capability
and safety forecasting: how can one accurately predict a model's behavior when
scaled to a massive number of attempts, given a vastly smaller sampling budget?
This question is directly relevant to model providers, who serve hundreds of
millions of users daily, and to governmental regulators, who seek to prevent
harms. To answer this questions, we make three contributions. First, we find
that standard methods for fitting these laws suffer from statistical
shortcomings that hinder predictive accuracy, especially in data-limited
scenarios. Second, we remedy these shortcomings by introducing a robust
estimation framework, which uses a beta-binomial distribution to generate more
accurate predictions from limited data. Third, we propose a dynamic sampling
strategy that allocates a greater budget to harder problems. Combined, these
innovations enable more reliable prediction of rare risks and capabilities at a
fraction of the computational cost.

### [88] [Beyond Monolithic Rewards: A Hybrid and Multi-Aspect Reward Optimization for MLLM Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05283)
*Radha Gulhane,Sathish Reddy Indurthi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hybrid reward framework combining model-based and rule-based, multi-aspect rewards improves alignment of multimodal LLMs, yielding notable gains in general and mathematical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monolithic, model-based rewards suffer from calibration issues, limited coverage of human preferences, and high annotation costs; a hybrid, multi-aspect approach can better capture diverse preferences and improve stability.

Method: Integrates model-based rewards (learned reward model using synthetic and human feedback) with rule-based rewards (domain heuristics), plus multi-aspect rewards (instruction adherence) and a length-penalty; optimized with reinforcement learning.

Result: Shows consistent improvements across multimodal benchmarks; ~9.5% average gain on general and math reasoning for a 3B model; ~16% gain on math benchmarks.

Conclusion: Hybrid, multi-aspect reward modeling provides a flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs with human preferences, improving performance and stability, particularly in mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: Aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences
often relies on single-signal, model-based reward methods. Such monolithic
rewards often lack confidence calibration across domain-specific tasks, fail to
capture diverse aspects of human preferences, and require extensive data
annotation and reward model training. In this work, we propose a hybrid reward
modeling framework that integrates complementary reward paradigms: (i)
model-based rewards, where a learned reward model predicts scalar or vector
scores from synthetic and human feedback, and (ii) rule-based rewards, where
domain-specific heuristics provide explicit correctness signals with
confidence. Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to
enforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward
to stabilize training and improve performance. The proposed framework provides
a flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs through reinforcement
learning policy optimization. Our experiments show consistent improvements
across different multimodal benchmarks when applying hybrid and multi-aspect
reward modeling. Our best performing model in the 3B family achieves an overall
average improvement of ~9.5% across general and math reasoning tasks. Focusing
specifically on mathematical benchmarks, the model achieves a significant
average improvement of ~16%, highlighting its effectiveness in mathematical
reasoning and problem solving.

### [89] [BIRD-INTERACT: Re-imagining Text-to-SQL Evaluation for Large Language Models via Lens of Dynamic Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05318)

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces BIRD-INTERACT, a realistic multi-turn text-to-SQL benchmark with environment coupling, agentic evaluation, and executable tests; models show strong difficulty (GPT-5: ~8.7% in c-Interact, ~17% in a-Interact).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between static-context multi-turn benchmarks and production-grade database assistants that require clarifications, knowledge retrieval, and error recovery in an autonomous, dynamic setting.

Method: Builds an environment where each database is coupled with a hierarchical knowledge base, metadata, and a function-driven user simulator. Offers two evaluation modes: c-Interact (pre-defined conversational protocol) and a-Interact (open-ended agentic setting). Provides a large task suite (BIRD-INTERACT-FULL: 600 tasks; BIRD-INTERACT-LITE: 300 tasks) covering full CRUD for BI and operational use cases, with executable test cases and follow-up sub-tasks requiring dynamic interaction.

Result: Empirical results show the benchmark's difficulty: GPT-5 completes only 8.67% of tasks in c-Interact and 17.00% in a-Interact. Memory grafting and Interaction Test-time Scaling analyses underscore the importance of effective interaction for complex, dynamic text-to-SQL tasks.

Conclusion: Interactive, environment-rich benchmarks are essential to evaluate and drive progress toward deployable, real-world database assistants. BIRD-INTERACT provides a challenging testbed for improving interactive reasoning, knowledge integration, and autonomous decision-making in T2S workflows; future work may explore scalable interaction strategies and richer evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
single-turn text-to-SQL tasks, but real-world database applications
predominantly require multi-turn interactions to handle ambiguous queries,
execution errors, and evolving user requirements. Existing multi-turn
benchmarks fall short by treating conversation histories as static context or
limiting evaluation to read-only operations, failing to reflect
production-grade database assistant challenges. We introduce BIRD-INTERACT, a
benchmark that restores this realism through: (1) a comprehensive interaction
environment coupling each database with a hierarchical knowledge base, metadata
files, and a function-driven user simulator, enabling models to solicit
clarifications, retrieve knowledge, and recover from errors without human
supervision; (2) two evaluation settings consisting of a pre-defined
conversational protocol (c-Interact) and an open-ended agentic setting
(a-Interact) where models autonomously decide when to query the user simulator
or explore the environment; (3) a challenging task suite covering the full CRUD
spectrum for business-intelligence and operational use cases, guarded by
executable test cases. Each task features ambiguous and follow-up sub-tasks
requiring dynamic interaction. The suite comprises BIRD-INTERACT-FULL (600
tasks, up to 11,796 interactions) for comprehensive performance assessment, and
BIRD-INTERACT-LITE (300 tasks with simplified databases) for detailed
behavioral analysis and rapid method development. Our empirical results
highlight BIRD-INTERACT's difficulty: GPT-5 completes only 8.67% of tasks in
c-Interact and 17.00% in a-Interact. Analysis via memory grafting and
Interaction Test-time Scaling validates the importance of effective interaction
for complex, dynamic text-to-SQL tasks.

TL;DR: M-Reason is a demonstration system that uses modular, multi-agent LLM reasoning for transparent evidence retrieval, appraisal, and synthesis in cancer research, emphasizing explainability, traceability, and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for transparent, auditable synthesis of diverse biomedical evidence to support reliable conclusions in cancer research, while managing complexity and resource use.

Method: Modular agents specialized per evidence stream collaborate via agent orchestration; large language models drive reasoning; deterministic code aids validation; structured reporting and complete traceability; interactive UI for observation and evaluation.

Result: Demonstrates substantial gains in efficiency and output consistency; potential as a practical evidence-synthesis tool and a testbed for robust multi-agent LLM systems in scientific research.

Conclusion: M-Reason offers a practical, auditable framework for multi-agent LLM reasoning in biomedicine, enabling researchers to observe and evaluate the complete evidence-to-conclusion workflow.

Abstract: We present M-Reason, a demonstration system for transparent, agent-based
reasoning and evidence integration in the biomedical domain, with a focus on
cancer research. M-Reason leverages recent advances in large language models
(LLMs) and modular agent orchestration to automate evidence retrieval,
appraisal, and synthesis across diverse biomedical data sources. Each agent
specializes in a specific evidence stream, enabling parallel processing and
fine-grained analysis. The system emphasizes explainability, structured
reporting, and user auditability, providing complete traceability from source
evidence to final conclusions. We discuss critical tradeoffs between agent
specialization, system complexity, and resource usage, as well as the
integration of deterministic code for validation. An open, interactive user
interface allows researchers to directly observe, explore and evaluate the
multi-agent workflow. Our evaluation demonstrates substantial gains in
efficiency and output consistency, highlighting M-Reason's potential as both a
practical tool for evidence synthesis and a testbed for robust multi-agent LLM
systems in scientific research, available at https://m-reason.digitalecmt.com.

*Asli Karacelik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Bayesian MPC promises uncertainty-aware control but lacks consistent evidence due to inconsistent baselines and scarce reliability analyses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether Bayesian approaches in MPC deliver robust performance benefits in neural-network-based models, design, and uncertainty quantification, and to assess the current evidence.

Method: Systematic review of existing studies on Bayesian MPC focusing on neural-network modeling, control design, and uncertainty quantification; qualitative synthesis and critique of implementation and evaluation practices.

Result: Evidence is fragmented; reported gains are unclear and not reliably demonstrated; baselines are inconsistent; reliability analyses are limited; standard benchmarks are absent.

Conclusion: Call for standardized benchmarks, ablation studies, and transparent reporting to rigorously evaluate Bayesian techniques in MPC.

Abstract: In this review, we assess the use of Bayesian methods in model predictive
control (MPC), focusing on neural-network-based modeling, control design, and
uncertainty quantification. We systematically analyze individual studies and
how they are implemented in practice. While Bayesian approaches are
increasingly adopted to capture and propagate uncertainty in MPC, reported
gains in performance and robustness remain fragmented, with inconsistent
baselines and limited reliability analyses. We therefore argue for standardized
benchmarks, ablation studies, and transparent reporting to rigorously determine
the effectiveness of Bayesian techniques for MPC.

### [92] [MHA-RAG: Improving Efficiency, Accuracy, and Consistency by Encoding Exemplars as Soft Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05363)
*Abhinav Jain,Xinyu Yao,Thomas Reps,Christopher Jermaine*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Soft-prompt exemplars with order-invariant MHA-RAG outperform standard RAG, delivering ~20-point gains and ~10x GFLOPs efficiency on QA benchmarks across scales.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting foundation models to new domains with limited data is costly and brittle. Relying on in-context text exemplars may be inefficient or unstable; a more compact, stable exemplar representation could improve efficiency and robustness across tasks and model sizes.

Method: Introduce Multi-Head Attention Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MHA-RAG) where exemplars are represented as soft prompts. Use the number of attention heads as a hyperparameter to control soft-prompt generation. Build an exemplar-order invariant architecture and evaluate across multiple question-answering benchmarks and model scales.

Result: MHA-RAG achieves about a 20-point performance gain over standard RAG and reduces inference costs by a factor of ~10 in GFLOPs, delivering higher accuracy and efficiency while being invariant to exemplar order.

Conclusion: Soft-prompt exemplars via MHA-RAG provide an effective, efficient, and robust method for adapting foundation models to new domains with limited data, surpassing text-based exemplars and standard RAG in both performance and efficiency.

Abstract: Adapting Foundation Models to new domains with limited training data is
challenging and computationally expensive. While prior work has demonstrated
the effectiveness of using domain-specific exemplars as in-context
demonstrations, we investigate whether representing exemplars purely as text is
the most efficient, effective, and stable approach. We explore an alternative:
representing exemplars as soft prompts with an exemplar order invariant model
architecture. To this end, we introduce Multi-Head Attention
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MHA-RAG), a framework with the number of
attention heads serving as a simple hyperparameter to control soft
prompt-generation across different tasks. Across multiple question-answering
benchmarks and model scales, MHA-RAG achieves a 20-point performance gain over
standard RAG, while cutting inference costs by a factor of 10X
GFLOPs-delivering both higher accuracy and greater efficiency, invariant to
exemplar order.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Two studies use Symbolic Interactionism to explore how humans and conversational AI co-create meanings; findings show meanings evolve through reciprocal symbol interpretation and social context, not mere agreement; implies design shifts for more collaborative human-AI interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address AI systems' limited grasp of socially constructed symbols and meanings; extend symbolic interactionism to human-AI dialogue; understand how social context shapes meaning negotiation in conversations.

Method: Two empirical studies examining human-AI dialogue where participants interact with conversational AI agents; analysis focuses on how meanings are shifted and reinterpreted in response to AI-proposed symbols and interpretations, with attention to social context and value projection.

Result: Participants shift initial definitions of meaning in response to AI-suggested symbols; social context amplifies reinterpretation; participants project personal and social values into interactions; meaning emerges from bidirectional exchange, not mere agreement.

Conclusion: Shared meaning in human-AI collaboration arises from ongoing, bidirectional symbol negotiation during interaction; design implications include AI that supports symbol negotiation and situates dialogue within social context to foster deeper collaboration.

Abstract: Meaningful human-AI collaboration requires more than processing language; it
demands a deeper understanding of symbols and their socially constructed
meanings. While humans naturally interpret symbols through social interaction,
AI systems often miss the dynamic interpretations that emerge in conversation.
Drawing on Symbolic Interactionism theory, we conducted two studies to
investigate how humans and AI co-construct symbols and their meanings. Findings
provide empirical insights into how humans and conversational AI agents
collaboratively shape meanings during interaction. We show how participants
shift their initial definitions of meaning in response to the symbols and
interpretations suggested by the conversational AI agents, especially when
social context is introduced. We also observe how participants project their
personal and social values into these interactions, refining meanings over
time. These findings reveal that shared understanding does not emerge from mere
agreement but from the bi-directional exchange and reinterpretation of symbols,
suggesting new paradigms for human-AI interaction design.

### [94] [Teacher-Student Guided Inverse Modeling for Steel Final Hardness Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05402)
*Ahmad Alsheikh,Andreas Fischer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A teacher-student framework for inverse prediction of steel hardness: train a forward Teacher to predict hardness from 13 features, then a backward Student to infer input configurations for a target hardness, using Teacher feedback in a supervised loop; outperforms baselines in accuracy and speed on tempered steel data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inverse mapping in steel heat treatment is ill-posed due to many-to-one relationships; different process parameters can yield the same hardness. A data-efficient, fast method to infer plausible inputs from a desired hardness is needed for design and control in materials engineering.

Method: 1) Train a forward Teacher to predict final hardness from 13 metallurgical features. 2) Train a backward Student to infer input configurations from a target hardness. 3) Optimize the Student using iterative, supervised feedback from the Teacher. 4) Evaluate on a public tempered steel dataset and compare to baseline regression and reinforcement learning models.

Result: The Teacher-Student framework achieves higher inverse prediction accuracy than baselines and requires significantly less computational time, demonstrating improved efficiency and effectiveness for inverse process modeling in materials science.

Conclusion: A Teacher-Student approach provides a viable and efficient solution for inverse hardness prediction in steel heat treatment, mitigating the ambiguity of the inverse problem and enabling faster, plausible input estimation.

Abstract: Predicting the final hardness of steel after heat treatment is a challenging
regression task due to the many-to-one nature of the process -- different
combinations of input parameters (such as temperature, duration, and chemical
composition) can result in the same hardness value. This ambiguity makes the
inverse problem, estimating input parameters from a desired hardness,
particularly difficult. In this work, we propose a novel solution using a
Teacher-Student learning framework. First, a forward model (Teacher) is trained
to predict final hardness from 13 metallurgical input features. Then, a
backward model (Student) is trained to infer plausible input configurations
from a target hardness value. The Student is optimized by leveraging feedback
from the Teacher in an iterative, supervised loop. We evaluate our method on a
publicly available tempered steel dataset and compare it against baseline
regression and reinforcement learning models. Results show that our
Teacher-Student framework not only achieves higher inverse prediction accuracy
but also requires significantly less computational time, demonstrating its
effectiveness and efficiency for inverse process modeling in materials science.

TL;DR: AInstein probes whether LLMs can autonomously solve AI research problems using only pretrained knowledge by simulating a critique-driven problem-solving loop on ICLR 2025 papers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess genuine reasoning vs. recall in LLMs and quantify their autonomous scientific problem-solving ability without fine-tuning or external aids.

Method: Extract distilled problem statements from ICLR 2025 submissions; engage solver agents to propose and refine solutions through iterative critique loops; use LLM-as-a-judge with a structured rubric and manual checks; evaluate 1,214 papers across acceptance tiers (Oral/Spotlight/Poster).

Result: LLMs can rediscover feasible solutions and sometimes propose creative alternatives, but overall problem-solving is fragile and highly framing-sensitive.

Conclusion: This is the first large-scale evidence on LLMs' capacity as autonomous scientific problem-solvers, highlighting their latent potential and current limitations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a
wide range of tasks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects
genuine reasoning or sophisticated recall. We introduce AInstein, a framework
for testing whether LLMs can generate valid solutions to AI research problems
using only their pretrained parametric knowledge -- without domain-specific
fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, or other external aids. Our approach
extracts distilled problem statements from high-quality ICLR 2025 submissions,
then tasks specialized solver agents with proposing and refining technical
solutions through iterative critique loops, mimicking the cycles of proposal,
review, and revision central to scientific inquiry. We evaluate AInstein on
1,214 ICLR papers stratified by acceptance tier (Oral, Spotlight, Poster),
using an LLM-as-a-judge paradigm guided by a structured rubric, complemented by
targeted manual checks. Performance is assessed with three metrics: Success
Rate (does the solution address the problem?), Rediscovery (does it align with
human-proposed methods?), and Novelty (does it yield valid, original
approaches?). Our results reveal that while LLMs can rediscover feasible
solutions and occasionally propose creative alternatives, their problem-solving
ability remains fragile and highly sensitive to framing. These findings provide
the first large-scale evidence on the extent to which LLMs can act as
autonomous scientific problem-solvers, highlighting both their latent potential
and their current limitations.

*Fadi Al Machot,Fidaa Al Machot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A large-scale neuro-symbolic framework that integrates Answer Set Programming with transformer learning for ASRS data, using ASP-based augmentation and differentiable fuzzy-logic regularization to improve multi-label classification and reduce logic violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain logic and safety-critical constraints are often violated by pure data-driven transformers; there is a need for interpretable, trustworthy NLP in safety-critical settings.

Method: Formalize domain knowledge as weighted ASP rules using the Clingo solver; integrate in two ways: (i) rule-based data augmentation to generate logically consistent synthetic samples, improving label diversity; (ii) a fuzzy-logic regularizer that enforces rule satisfaction in a differentiable form during fine-tuning of transformers; tune per-class thresholds.

Result: Outperforms a strong BCE baseline on micro- and macro-F1 scores and achieves up to 86% reduction in rule violations on the ASRS test set; claims first large-scale neuro-symbolic application to ASRS unifying ASP reasoning, augmentation, and differentiable training for trustworthy NLP.

Conclusion: Shows feasibility and benefits of combining symbolic reasoning with neural models for safety-critical NLP; provides a scalable framework preserving interpretability while leveraging neural performance, with potential applicability to other domains.

Abstract: Deep transformer models excel at multi-label text classification but often
violate domain logic that experts consider essential, an issue of particular
concern in safety-critical applications. We propose a hybrid neuro-symbolic
framework that integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) with transformer-based
learning on the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) corpus. Domain
knowledge is formalized as weighted ASP rules and validated using the Clingo
solver. These rules are incorporated in two complementary ways: (i) as
rule-based data augmentation, generating logically consistent synthetic samples
that improve label diversity and coverage; and (ii) as a fuzzy-logic
regularizer, enforcing rule satisfaction in a differentiable form during
fine-tuning. This design preserves the interpretability of symbolic reasoning
while leveraging the scalability of deep neural architectures. We further tune
per-class thresholds and report both standard classification metrics and
logic-consistency rates. Compared to a strong Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)
baseline, our approach improves micro- and macro-F1 scores and achieves up to
an 86% reduction in rule violations on the ASRS test set. To the best of our
knowledge, this constitutes the first large-scale neuro-symbolic application to
ASRS reports that unifies ASP-based reasoning, rule-driven augmentation, and
differentiable transformer training for trustworthy, safety-critical NLP.

### [97] [Do Code Models Suffer from the Dunning-Kruger Effect?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05457)
*Mukul Singh,Somya Chatterjee,Arjun Radhakrishna,Sumit Gulwani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies the Dunning-Kruger Effect in state-of-the-art LLMs performing coding tasks across languages, finding models exhibit overconfidence in line with DKE, with bias influenced by language complexity and model competence—though the abstract contains an internal inconsistency on how bias scales with competence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether AI coding agents exhibit human-like cognitive biases (specifically Dunning-Kruger) during collaboration with humans, and how these biases vary across programming languages and model competence.

Method: Evaluate and compare model confidence versus actual performance across a diverse set of programming languages, analyzing how DKE-like bias correlates with model competence and language familiarity.

Result: LLM coding agents display DKE-like overconfidence similar to humans; the bias is stronger in contexts with less familiarity or resource constraints (rare languages). There is an apparent contradiction in the abstract: the text claims both that less competent models show stronger bias and that bias strength scales with model competence.

Conclusion: AI systems can exhibit DKE-like bias in coding tasks, affecting trust and collaboration; clarification is needed regarding how bias scales with model competence, and future work should address resolving the apparent inconsistency and explore mitigation strategies.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems increasingly collaborate with humans in
creative and technical domains, questions arise about the cognitive boundaries
and biases that shape our shared agency. This paper investigates the
Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE), the tendency for those with limited competence to
overestimate their abilities in state-of-the-art LLMs in coding tasks. By
analyzing model confidence and performance across a diverse set of programming
languages, we reveal that AI models mirror human patterns of overconfidence,
especially in unfamiliar or low-resource domains. Our experiments demonstrate
that less competent models and those operating in rare programming languages
exhibit stronger DKE-like bias, suggesting that the strength of the bias is
proportionate to the competence of the models.

*Aman Gupta,Denny O'Shea,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VAL-Bench is a scalable benchmark to assess whether LLMs maintain stable value stances across framing of opposing sides in debates, using 115K paired prompts from Wikipedia and an LLM judge to measure alignment, revealing variation across models and trade-offs with safety strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Because current safety-focused benchmarks only check rule compliance, not coherent value systems, there is a need to assess stable value alignment in LLMs for decision-shaping tasks.

Method: Construct 115K paired prompts from controversial Wikipedia sections that frame opposing sides; use LLM-as-judge to score agreement/divergence between model responses; evaluate multiple open- and closed-source models.

Result: Observed large variation in value alignment across models; identified trade-offs between safety (e.g., refusals) and expressive value systems; VAL-Bench provides scalable, reproducible means for systematic comparison.

Conclusion: VAL-Bench offers a reproducible benchmark to assess how reliably LLMs embody human values and will guide future efforts in value-aligned AI, highlighting tensions between safety and expressive value instantiation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks where outputs
shape human decisions, so it is critical to test whether their responses
reflect consistent human values. Existing benchmarks mostly track refusals or
predefined safety violations, but these only check rule compliance and do not
reveal whether a model upholds a coherent value system when facing
controversial real-world issues. We introduce the \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{AL}ignment \textbf{Bench}mark (\textbf{VAL-Bench}), which evaluates
whether models maintain a stable value stance across paired prompts that frame
opposing sides of public debates. VAL-Bench consists of 115K such pairs from
Wikipedia's controversial sections. A well-aligned model should express similar
underlying views regardless of framing, which we measure using an LLM-as-judge
to score agreement or divergence between paired responses. Applied across
leading open- and closed-source models, the benchmark reveals large variation
in alignment and highlights trade-offs between safety strategies (e.g.,
refusals) and more expressive value systems. By providing a scalable,
reproducible benchmark, VAL-Bench enables systematic comparison of how reliably
LLMs embody human values.

TL;DR: LLM-based automatic vulnerability repair shows potential but is hampered by (1) insufficient vulnerability-focused reasoning data and (2) lack of verifiable intermediate feedback during training.


<details>

Motivation: With vulnerabilities exploding, AVR must move beyond general programming knowledge to capture vulnerability-specific reasoning and repair patterns; current data and training feedback are inadequate.

Method: Analytical synthesis of current AVR using LLMs; identification of data and feedback gaps and discussion of mitigation directions.

Result: Highlights two core challenges—scarcity of vulnerability-oriented reasoning data and absence of verifiable intermediate repair feedback—limiting model performance and training efficacy.

Conclusion: Advancing AVR requires curated vulnerability-focused reasoning datasets and training paradigms that expose and leverage intermediate repair steps or feedback mechanisms.

Abstract: The exponential increase in software vulnerabilities has created an urgent
need for automatic vulnerability repair (AVR) solutions. Recent research has
formulated AVR as a sequence generation problem and has leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to address this problem. Typically, these approaches
prompt or fine-tune LLMs to generate repairs for vulnerabilities directly.
Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, they face the
following challenges: (1) Lack of high-quality, vulnerability-related reasoning
data. Current approaches primarily rely on foundation models that mainly encode
general programming knowledge. Without vulnerability-related reasoning data,
they tend to fail to capture the diverse vulnerability repair patterns. (2)
Hard to verify the intermediate vulnerability repair process during LLM
training. Existing reinforcement learning methods often leverage intermediate
execution feedback from the environment (e.g., sandbox-based execution results)
to guide reinforcement learning training. In contrast, the vulnerability repair
process generally lacks such intermediate, verifiable feedback, which poses
additional challenges for model training.

*Gordon Hung,Salinna Abdullah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A reproducible study compares 21 time-series models for Taiwan CO2 emissions forecasting, finds FFNN, SVM, and Random Forest as top performers, and shows a stacked generalization ensemble with linear regression achieving a SMAPE of 1.407 and provides decade-long projections for policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Taiwan's large population and fossil-fuel dependence drive severe air pollution; accurate, robust emission forecasts are needed to inform climate and air-quality policy; the paper aims to systematically compare many models and develop a robust ensemble for long-horizon predictions.

Method: Systematically evaluate 21 time-series models on univariate and multivariate formulations for Taiwan CO2 emissions; identify top performers (FFNN, SVM, RFR); develop a custom stacked generalization ensemble that combines these with linear regression; validate with SMAPE and assess overfitting; generate decade-long projections.

Result: FFNN, SVM, and RFR deliver the best forecasting performance; the ensemble using linear regression improves robustness; the proposed model achieves SMAPE = 1.407 with no signs of overfitting; provides accurate decade-long emission projections.

Conclusion: A robust hybrid approach can yield accurate long-term emissions forecasts for policy support; the ensemble approach offers a practical tool for data-driven policymaking in Taiwan.

Abstract: Taiwan's high population and heavy dependence on fossil fuels have led to
severe air pollution, with the most prevalent greenhouse gas being carbon
dioxide (CO2). There-fore, this study presents a reproducible and comprehensive
case study comparing 21 of the most commonly employed time series models in
forecasting emissions, analyzing both univariate and multivariate approaches.
Among these, Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM),
and Random Forest Regressor (RFR) achieved the best performances. To further
enhance robustness, the top performers were integrated with Linear Regression
through a custom stacked generalization en-semble technique. Our proposed
ensemble model achieved an SMAPE of 1.407 with no signs of overfitting.
Finally, this research provides an accurate decade-long emission projection
that will assist policymakers in making more data-driven decisions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MetaVLA: a backbone-agnostic post-training framework that aligns Vision-Language-Action models via Context-Aware Meta Co-Training and meta-learning, enabling rapid adaptation with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for task-specific fine-tuning and poor generalization of VLA models, aiming for scalable, generalist embodied agents.

Method: Consolidates diverse target tasks into a single fine-tuning stage; uses structurally diverse auxiliary tasks; incorporates a lightweight meta-learning module inspired by Attentive Neural Processes for rapid adaptation with minimal architectural changes.

Result: On the LIBERO benchmark, MetaVLA with six auxiliary tasks outperforms OpenVLA by up to 8.0% on long-horizon tasks, reduces training steps from 240K to 75K, and cuts GPU time by ~76%. Code will be available.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that scalable, low-resource post-training can bring about general-purpose embodied agents.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show promise in embodied reasoning, yet
remain far from true generalists-they often require task-specific fine-tuning,
and generalize poorly to unseen tasks. We propose MetaVLA, a unified,
backbone-agnostic post-training framework for efficient and scalable alignment.
MetaVLA introduces Context-Aware Meta Co-Training, which consolidates diverse
target tasks into a single fine-tuning stage while leveraging structurally
diverse auxiliary tasks to improve in-domain generalization. Unlike naive
multi-task SFT, MetaVLA integrates a lightweight meta-learning
mechanism-derived from Attentive Neural Processes-to enable rapid adaptation
from diverse contexts with minimal architectural change or inference overhead.
On the LIBERO benchmark, MetaVLA with six auxiliary tasks outperforms OpenVLA
by up to 8.0% on long-horizon tasks, reduces training steps from 240K to 75K,
and cuts GPU time by ~76%. These results show that scalable, low-resource
post-training is achievable-paving the way toward general-purpose embodied
agents. Code will be available.

*Zhuofeng Li,Haoxiang Zhang,Seungju Han,Sheng Liu,Jianwen Xie,Yu Zhang,Yejin Choi,James Zou,Pan Lu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentFlow introduces a trainable, in-the-flow agentic framework with four modules and Flow-GRPO for on-policy learning; achieves strong long-horizon planning and tool use, outperforming baselines across ten benchmarks including larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevailing monolithic, tool-augmented policies scale poorly, have weak generalization; existing agentic systems lack live, in-flow training that optimizes planning in multi-turn interactions.

Method: Four modules (planner, executor, verifier, generator) with evolving memory; on-policy Flow-GRPO converting multi-turn optimization into single-turn updates; trajectory-level outcome broadcast; group-normalized advantages; live optimization in 10 benchmarks with a 7B backbone.

Result: AgentFlow yields average accuracy gains ~14-15% across search/agentic/mathematical/scientific tasks; sometimes surpasses GPT-4o; improved planning, tool-calling reliability, and scaling with model size and reasoning turns.

Conclusion: In-the-flow, modular agentic architectures with Flow-GRPO effectively tackle long-horizon reasoning and tool use; scalable, robust, and capable of outperforming larger models on diverse tasks.

Abstract: Outcome-driven reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning in large
language models (LLMs), but prevailing tool-augmented approaches train a
single, monolithic policy that interleaves thoughts and tool calls under full
context; this scales poorly with long horizons and diverse tools and
generalizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic systems offer a promising
alternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain
training-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of
multi-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow
agentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier,
generator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside
the multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose
Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles
long-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn
optimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It
broadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align
local planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with
group-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale
backbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of
14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on
scientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.
Further analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing
improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with
model size and reasoning turns.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autonomous, self-evolving agentic AI framework for wireless systems that autonomously updates models/tools/workflows; multi-agent LLM coordination; improves antenna optimization with up to 52% beam gain gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continuous adaptation in dynamic wireless environments; reduce human intervention; move beyond static AI models that cannot keep pace with environmental changes.

Method: Layered architecture implementing life cycle, tool intelligence, workflow optimization, self-reflection, and evolutionary learning; a cooperative multi-agent framework with role-specialized LLMs guided by a supervisor agent; structured dialogue, feedback, and validation; case study on low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) upgrading fixed to movable antenna optimization.

Result: Autonomously improves beam gain and restores degraded performance by 52.02%; outperforms fixed baselines with minimal human input.

Conclusion: Demonstrates viability of self-evolving agentic AI for next-gen wireless intelligence; autonomous life cycle execution and adaptability validated in antenna optimization.

Abstract: Self-evolving agentic artificial intelligence (AI) offers a new paradigm for
future wireless systems by enabling autonomous agents to continually adapt and
improve without human intervention. Unlike static AI models, self-evolving
agents embed an autonomous evolution cycle that updates models, tools, and
workflows in response to environmental dynamics. This paper presents a
comprehensive overview of self-evolving agentic AI, highlighting its layered
architecture, life cycle, and key techniques, including tool intelligence,
workflow optimization, self-reflection, and evolutionary learning. We further
propose a multi-agent cooperative self-evolving agentic AI framework, where
multiple large language models (LLMs) are assigned role-specialized prompts
under the coordination of a supervisor agent. Through structured dialogue,
iterative feedback, and systematic validation, the system autonomously executes
the entire life cycle without human intervention. A case study on antenna
evolution in low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) demonstrates how the
framework autonomously upgrades fixed antenna optimization into movable antenna
optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed self-evolving agentic
AI autonomously improves beam gain and restores degraded performance by up to
52.02%, consistently surpassing the fixed baseline with little to no human
intervention and validating its adaptability and robustness for next-generation
wireless intelligence.

*Hanna Kreutzer,Anne-Sophie Caselitz,Thomas Dratsch,Daniel Pinto dos Santos,Christiane Kuhl,Daniel Truhn,Sven Nebelung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GPT-4o can accurately extract diagnostic labels (including uncertain) from radiology reports and use them to train competitive multi-label classifiers for musculoskeletal radiographs; handling uncertainty (inclusive vs exclusive) does not significantly affect performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether GPT-4o’s label extraction from free-text radiology reports is reliable and whether incorporating uncertainty in those labels influences downstream multi-label image classification performance.

Method: Retrospective study with clavicle (n=1,170), elbow (n=3,755), and thumb (n=1,978) radiography series. GPT-4o filled structured templates with findings marked true, false, or uncertain. Uncertainty was tested by reassigning uncertain labels to inclusive (true) or exclusive (false). Label-image pairs were used to train multi-label classifiers with ResNet50. Label extraction accuracy was validated on internal (clavicle n=233, elbow n=745, thumb n=393) and external (n=300 per site) test sets. Performance metrics included macro-AUC (DeLong test for comparisons), precision-recall, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.

Result: Automatic label extraction was 98.6% correct (60,618/61,488). For elbow, macro-AUC was 0.80 under both inclusive and exclusive strategies (range 0.62–0.87 and 0.61–0.88, respectively). External validation for elbow yielded AUCs of 0.79 for both strategies (inclusive: 0.61–0.87; exclusive: 0.63–0.89). No significant differences were observed across labeling strategies or datasets (p ≥ 0.15).

Conclusion: GPT-4o can extract labels from radiology reports to train competitive multi-label musculoskeletal radiograph classifiers, and label uncertainty did not impact model performance.

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate GPT-4o's ability to extract diagnostic labels (with
uncertainty) from free-text radiology reports and to test how these labels
affect multi-label image classification of musculoskeletal radiographs.
Methods: This retrospective study included radiography series of the clavicle
(n=1,170), elbow (n=3,755), and thumb (n=1,978). After anonymization, GPT-4o
filled out structured templates by indicating imaging findings as present
("true"), absent ("false"), or "uncertain." To assess the impact of label
uncertainty, "uncertain" labels of the training and validation sets were
automatically reassigned to "true" (inclusive) or "false" (exclusive).
Label-image-pairs were used for multi-label classification using ResNet50.
Label extraction accuracy was manually verified on internal (clavicle: n=233,
elbow: n=745, thumb: n=393) and external test sets (n=300 for each).
Performance was assessed using macro-averaged receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) area under the curve (AUC), precision recall curves, sensitivity,
specificity, and accuracy. AUCs were compared with the DeLong test. Results:
Automatic extraction was correct in 98.6% (60,618 of 61,488) of labels in the
test sets. Across anatomic regions, label-based model training yielded
competitive performance measured by macro-averaged AUC values for inclusive
(e.g., elbow: AUC=0.80 [range, 0.62-0.87]) and exclusive models (elbow:
AUC=0.80 [range, 0.61-0.88]). Models generalized well on external datasets
(elbow [inclusive]: AUC=0.79 [range, 0.61-0.87]; elbow [exclusive]: AUC=0.79
[range, 0.63-0.89]). No significant differences were observed across labeling
strategies or datasets (p>=0.15). Conclusion: GPT-4o extracted labels from
radiologic reports to train competitive multi-label classification models with
high accuracy. Detected uncertainty in the radiologic reports did not influence
the performance of these models.

### [105] [D2E: Scaling Vision-Action Pretraining on Desktop Data for Transfer to Embodied AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05684)
*Suwhan Choi,Jaeyoon Jung,Haebin Seong,Minchan Kim,Minyeong Kim,Yongjun Cho,Yoonshik Kim,Yubeen Park,Youngjae Yu,Yunsung Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: D2E turns desktop gameplay data into scalable pretraining for robotics, bridging digital sensorimotor data to real-world embodied tasks via three components (OWA Toolkit, Generalist-IDM, VAPT); it achieves high success on LIBERO and CANVAS benchmarks and will release datasets/models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Physical trajectory collection for embodied AI is expensive; desktops/games provide scalable, structured sensorimotor data with broad coverage; there is a need for a pipeline that transfers this data to real robots.

Method: Introduce the OWA Toolkit to standardize diverse desktop interactions with 152x compression; Generalist-IDM for zero-shot generalization across unseen games via timestamp-based event prediction enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling; VAPT to transfer desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation; dataset composition includes 259 hours of human demonstrations and 1k+ hours of pseudo-labeled gameplay; evaluation on LIBERO and CANVAS; open-source release planned.

Result: Achieves 96.6% success on LIBERO manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation, indicating effective transfer from desktop sensorimotor primitives to embodied tasks; demonstrates practicality of desktop pretraining for robotics.

Conclusion: Desktop pretraining is a practical paradigm for robotics, enabling scalable cross-domain transfer from digital interactions to real-world embodied tasks; supports releasing tools and datasets to accelerate research.

Abstract: Large language models leverage internet-scale text data, yet embodied AI
remains constrained by the prohibitive costs of physical trajectory collection.
Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative:
they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the
structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We
present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop
interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics
embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT
for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a
complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in
embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit
that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x
compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot
generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction,
enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers
desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation.
Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of
pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO
manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that
sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance
to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop
pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work
public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and
pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at

*Yousef Emami,Seyedsina Nabavirazavi,Jingjing Zheng,Hao Zhou,Miguel Gutierrez Gaitan,Kai Li,Luis Almeida*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Attention-Based In-Context Learning for Velocity Control and Data Schedule (AIC-VDS) uses LLM-driven ICL to jointly optimize UAV velocity and data collection schedules in disaster scenarios, addressing sensor buffers, battery, channel conditions, and UAV trajectories to reduce data loss; it outperforms DQN and max-channel-gain baselines in simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address urgent data collection in post-disaster tsunami monitoring where DRL training is slow and sim-to-real gaps hinder rapid deployment. Leverage LLMs with ICL to quickly adapt task policies without retraining.

Method: Propose AIC-VDS, a joint optimization framework using Attention-Based In-Context Learning to determine multiple UAVs' data collection schedules and velocities. The method considers ground sensor battery levels, queue lengths, channel conditions, and UAV trajectories, and compares against DRL baselines.

Result: Simulation results indicate that AIC-VDS outperforms both Deep-Q-Network (DQN) and maximum channel gain baselines in reducing data loss.

Conclusion: LLM-based ICL offers a viable, training-free alternative to DRL for emergency UAV data collection tasks, capable of adapting to new scenarios via prompts and examples without retraining.

Abstract: Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being investigated
to collect sensory data in post-disaster monitoring scenarios, such as
tsunamis, where early actions are critical to limit coastal damage. A major
challenge is to design the data collection schedules and flight velocities, as
unfavorable schedules and velocities can lead to transmission errors and buffer
overflows of the ground sensors, ultimately resulting in significant packet
loss. Meanwhile, online Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solutions have a
complex training process and a mismatch between simulation and reality that
does not meet the urgent requirements of tsunami monitoring. Recent advances in
Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling alternative. With their strong
reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can adapt to new tasks through
In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task adaptation through natural
language prompts and example-based guidance without retraining. However, LLM
models have input data limitations and thus require customized approaches. In
this paper, a joint optimization of data collection schedules and velocities
control for multiple UAVs is proposed to minimize data loss. The battery level
of the ground sensors, the length of the queues, and the channel conditions, as
well as the trajectories of the UAVs, are taken into account. Attention-Based
In-Context Learning for Velocity Control and Data Collection Schedule (AIC-VDS)
is proposed as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The simulation results
show that the proposed AIC-VDS outperforms both the Deep-Q-Network (DQN) and
maximum channel gain baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Syn-Diag is a cloud-edge, few-shot fault diagnosis framework that uses LLMs to bridge data scarcity and resource limits. It combines visual-semantic alignment, context-aware prompting, and distillation-based edge deployment to deliver robust 1-shot and cross-condition performance with significant edge-size and latency reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial fault diagnosis suffers from scarce labeled data and the challenge of running large AI models on resource-constrained devices. There is a need for a deployable, data-efficient, cloud-edge solution that leverages LLMs for few-shot diagnosis.

Method: Three-tier design: (1) Visual-Semantic Synergy – cross-modal pre-training to align signal features with the LLM's semantic space; (2) Content-Aware Reasoning – dynamically constructs prompts based on the available samples to improve diagnostic accuracy; (3) Cloud-Edge Synergy – knowledge distillation creates a lightweight edge model that can be updated online through a shared decision space.

Result: Empirical evaluation on six datasets with various CWRU and SEU conditions shows Syn-Diag outperforms existing methods in 1-shot and cross-condition settings. The edge model achieves comparable performance to the cloud version while reducing model size by 83% and latency by 50%.

Conclusion: Syn-Diag offers a practical, robust, and deployable paradigm for modern intelligent diagnostics, effectively addressing data scarcity and resource constraints by leveraging cloud-edge synergy and LLMs.

Abstract: Industrial fault diagnosis faces the dual challenges of data scarcity and the
difficulty of deploying large AI models in resource-constrained environments.
This paper introduces Syn-Diag, a novel cloud-edge synergistic framework that
leverages Large Language Models to overcome these limitations in few-shot fault
diagnosis. Syn-Diag is built on a three-tiered mechanism: 1) Visual-Semantic
Synergy, which aligns signal features with the LLM's semantic space through
cross-modal pre-training; 2) Content-Aware Reasoning, which dynamically
constructs contextual prompts to enhance diagnostic accuracy with limited
samples; and 3) Cloud-Edge Synergy, which uses knowledge distillation to create
a lightweight, efficient edge model capable of online updates via a shared
decision space. Extensive experiments on six datasets covering different CWRU
and SEU working conditions show that Syn-Diag significantly outperforms
existing methods, especially in 1-shot and cross-condition scenarios. The edge
model achieves performance comparable to the cloud version while reducing model
size by 83% and latency by 50%, offering a practical, robust, and deployable

TL;DR: A literature review and empirical study on World Models in autonomous driving and robotics, focusing on safety in scene and control generation, with a taxonomy of pathologies and quantitative evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As embodied AI advances, predictions from World Models must be safe for agents and environment; there is a need to understand safety implications and fault modes in WM predictions.

Method: Combine a literature review in autonomous driving and robotics with an empirical analysis of predictions from state-of-the-art models; collect predictions, categorize faults/pathologies, and perform quantitative evaluation.

Result: Identified common pathologies, proposed categorization, and provided quantitative evaluation across models; results underscore safety concerns and highlight gaps in current WM approaches.

Conclusion: Safety must be integral to WM development; the study provides a taxonomy of pathologies, empirical benchmarks, and suggests directions for safer, more reliable WM-based planning.

Abstract: The rapid progress in embodied artificial intelligence has highlighted the
necessity for more advanced and integrated models that can perceive, interpret,
and predict environmental dynamics. In this context, World Models (WMs) have
been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate
future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing
agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with
embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both
the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive
literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and
robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control
generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein
we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and
categorize common faults (herein referred to as pathologies), and provide a
quantitative evaluation of the results.

### [110] [ARM: Discovering Agentic Reasoning Modules for Generalizable Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05746)
*Bohan Yao,Shiva Krishna Reddy Malay,Vikas Yadav*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduce Agentic Reasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for multi-agent systems. ARM consists of specialized reasoning modules discovered by tree search over code space, mutating from a simple CoT module guided by reflection on execution traces. ARM can function recursively or as a subroutine in a meta-orchestrator, yielding better performance and strong generalization across models and domains compared to manual or automatic MAS design methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automatic MAS design methods underperform and are data/compute-heavy, requiring re-discovery for new tasks and annotated validation sets. Observing that simple CoT reasoning can rival complex MAS approaches motivates focusing on optimizing CoT itself and building modular, reusable reasoning units.

Method: Initialize from a simple CoT module. Build ARM via tree search over code space to discover specialized reasoning modules. Apply mutations informed by reflection on execution traces to guide improvements. The ARM can be used as a recursive loop or as a subroutine within a learned meta-orchestrator, enabling flexible integration into MAS designs.

Result: The ARM-based MAS significantly outperforms manually designed MAS and state-of-the-art automatic MAS designs. ARM-based MAS generalizes well across different foundation models and task domains without additional optimization or domain-specific tuning.

Conclusion: Optimizing the fundamental reasoning unit (CoT) through an agentic, modular ARM yields strong performance and broad generalization. This approach offers a scalable alternative to manual architecture engineering and existing automatic MAS discovery methods.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Multi-agent systems (MAS) have achieved
state-of-the-art results on various complex reasoning tasks. Recent works have
proposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for
manual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving
similar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require
computationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task
domain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled
validation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT)
reasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting
that the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further
investigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design
that pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic
Reasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular
reasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is
discovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple
CoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution
traces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which
can be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned
meta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually
designed MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. Crucially,
MASes built with ARM exhibit superb generalization, maintaining high
performance across different foundation models and task domains without further
optimization.

TL;DR: Discounted empowerment as a pre-training signal for RL to enable data-efficient downstream adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Empowerment quantifies an agent's potential influence on its environment and can serve as an intrinsic objective. There is a need for effective pre-training signals that induce robust environmental dynamics understanding and improve data efficiency in downstream tasks.

Method: Introduce a discounted empowerment formulation that balances short- and long-horizon influence. Propose a pre-training paradigm that initializes policies to maximize discounted empowerment. Analyze empowerment-based pre-training across existing RL algorithms and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness as a general-purpose initialization strategy, particularly with long-horizon empowerment.

Result: Empowerment-maximizing policies with longer horizons lead to data-efficient learning and better adaptability in downstream tasks, validating empowerment pre-training as a general initialization strategy. The approach shows potential for scaling to high-dimensional and complex tasks.

Conclusion: Empowerment-based pre-training is a promising, generalizable approach for data-efficient RL. Future work should scale this framework to high-dimensional and complex tasks.

Abstract: Empowerment, an information-theoretic measure of an agent's potential
influence on its environment, has emerged as a powerful intrinsic motivation
and exploration framework for reinforcement learning (RL). Besides for
unsupervised RL and skill learning algorithms, the specific use of empowerment
as a pre-training signal has received limited attention in the literature. We
show that empowerment can be used as a pre-training signal for data-efficient
downstream task adaptation. For this we extend the traditional notion of
empowerment by introducing discounted empowerment, which balances the agent's
control over the environment across short- and long-term horizons. Leveraging
this formulation, we propose a novel pre-training paradigm that initializes
policies to maximize discounted empowerment, enabling agents to acquire a
robust understanding of environmental dynamics. We analyze empowerment-based
pre-training for various existing RL algorithms and empirically demonstrate its
potential as a general-purpose initialization strategy: empowerment-maximizing
policies with long horizons are data-efficient and effective, leading to
improved adaptability in downstream tasks. Our findings pave the way for future
research to scale this framework to high-dimensional and complex tasks, further
advancing the field of RL.

### [112] [Uncertainty assessment in satellite-based greenhouse gas emissions estimates using emulated atmospheric transport](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05751)
*Jeffrey N. Clark,Elena Fillola,Nawid Keshtmand,Raul Santos-Rodriguez,Matthew Rigby*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A graph neural network emulator speeds up LPDM-based footprint estimation by ~1000x, enabling uncertainty-aware top-down greenhouse gas inversions; demonstrated on GOSAT data for Brazil (2016).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current transport models are computationally costly and uncertain, hindering scalable, uncertainty-aware top-down emission assessments; AI-based emulators can accelerate simulations and quantify uncertainty.

Method: An ensemble-based pipeline using a graph neural network to emulate a Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model (LPDM) to estimate atmospheric footprints and methane mole fractions; ensembles quantify absolute and relative uncertainty; applied to GOSAT observations for Brazil in 2016.

Result: Approximately 1000x speed-up over NAME LPDM; emulator reproduces large-scale footprint structures; ensemble spread reveals spatial correlations with prediction error and identifies low-confidence regions for footprints and methane mole fractions.

Conclusion: Ensemble-based emulators offer scalable, uncertainty-aware transport simulations and can improve robustness of satellite-based emissions monitoring; applicable beyond LPDMs and could contribute to a more complete uncertainty budget in greenhouse gas flux estimates, including potential detection of systematic LPDM errors.

Abstract: Monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and evaluating national inventories
require efficient, scalable, and reliable inference methods. Top-down
approaches, combined with recent advances in satellite observations, provide
new opportunities to evaluate emissions at continental and global scales.
However, transport models used in these methods remain a key source of
uncertainty: they are computationally expensive to run at scale, and their
uncertainty is difficult to characterise. Artificial intelligence offers a dual
opportunity to accelerate transport simulations and to quantify their
associated uncertainty.
  We present an ensemble-based pipeline for estimating atmospheric transport
"footprints", greenhouse gas mole fraction measurements, and their
uncertainties using a graph neural network emulator of a Lagrangian Particle
Dispersion Model (LPDM). The approach is demonstrated with GOSAT (Greenhouse
Gases Observing Satellite) observations for Brazil in 2016. The emulator
achieved a ~1000x speed-up over the NAME LPDM, while reproducing large-scale
footprint structures. Ensembles were calculated to quantify absolute and
relative uncertainty, revealing spatial correlations with prediction error. The
results show that ensemble spread highlights low-confidence spatial and
temporal predictions for both atmospheric transport footprints and methane mole
fractions.
  While demonstrated here for an LPDM emulator, the approach could be applied
more generally to atmospheric transport models, supporting uncertainty-aware
greenhouse gas inversion systems and improving the robustness of
satellite-based emissions monitoring. With further development, ensemble-based
emulators could also help explore systematic LPDM errors, offering a
computationally efficient pathway towards a more comprehensive uncertainty
budget in greenhouse gas flux estimates.

### [113] [Early Multimodal Prediction of Cross-Lingual Meme Virality on Reddit: A Time-Window Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05761)
*Sedat Dogan,Nina Dethlefs,Debarati Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies early prediction of meme virality using cross-lingual Reddit data, introducing a robust, non-leaky virality threshold and finding that an XGBoost model can predict within 30 minutes using multimodal features across time windows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Virality prediction is hard for culturally complex memes and limited when full diffusion data is unavailable. A cross-lingual, large-scale dataset and a leakage-free, percentile-based virality definition address these gaps.

Method: A dataset from 25 Reddit communities is used. Virality is defined via a hybrid engagement score with a percentile threshold learned from chronologically held-out data. Models tested include Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and MLP, leveraging multimodal features (static content, network features, and time-series signals) across increasing windows (30–420 min). Evaluation emphasizes early signals and prevents data leakage.

Result: XGBoost achieves PR-AUC > 0.52 at 30 minutes, indicating useful signals emerge quickly. The study reveals an evidentiary transition where feature importance shifts from static context to temporal dynamics. It also provides a cross-lingual dataset and a practical benchmark for early virality prediction when full cascade data is unavailable.

Conclusion: This work offers a robust, interpretable benchmark for early meme virality, introduces a cross-lingual dataset, and presents a methodologically sound virality definition. It is among the first to combine time-series data with static content and network features for early virality prediction.

Abstract: Predicting the virality of online content remains challenging, especially for
culturally complex, fast-evolving memes. This study investigates the
feasibility of early prediction of meme virality using a large-scale,
cross-lingual dataset from 25 diverse Reddit communities. We propose a robust,
data-driven method to define virality based on a hybrid engagement score,
learning a percentile-based threshold from a chronologically held-out training
set to prevent data leakage. We evaluated a suite of models, including Logistic
Regression, XGBoost, and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), with a comprehensive,
multimodal feature set across increasing time windows (30-420 min). Crucially,
useful signals emerge quickly: our best-performing model, XGBoost, achieves a
PR-AUC $>$ 0.52 in just 30 minutes. Our analysis reveals a clear "evidentiary
transition," in which the importance of the feature dynamically shifts from the
static context to the temporal dynamics as a meme gains traction. This work
establishes a robust, interpretable, and practical benchmark for early virality
prediction in scenarios where full diffusion cascade data is unavailable,
contributing a novel cross-lingual dataset and a methodologically sound
definition of virality. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine
time series data with static content and network features to predict early meme
virality.

*Lang Qin,Zijian Gan,Xu Cao,Pengcheng Jiang,Yankai Jiang,Jiawei Han,Kaishun Wu,Jintai Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RareAgent reframes rare-disease drug repurposing as active, debate-driven reasoning with self-evolving agents that construct evidence graphs and distill transferable heuristics, leading to improved indication AUPRC and transparent reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare-disease drug repurposing faces sparse signals and few prior drug-disease associations, making traditional graph-based or GNN approaches unreliable; there's a need for proactive, explainable reasoning to uncover evidence.

Method: A self-evolving multi-agent system where task-specific adversarial debates drive agents to build evidence graphs from multiple perspectives to support/refute/entail hypotheses. A self-evolutionary loop analyzes reasoning paths post hoc to generate textual feedback that refines policies, and successful paths are distilled into transferable heuristics.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows RareAgent improves indication AUPRC by 18.1% over reasoning baselines and yields a transparent reasoning chain that aligns with clinical evidence.

Conclusion: RareAgent demonstrates that active, debate-driven, self-evolving reasoning can enhance performance and interpretability in computational drug repurposing for rare diseases, addressing low-signal challenges in knowledge graphs and GNNs.

Abstract: Computational drug repurposing for rare diseases is especially challenging
when no prior associations exist between drugs and target diseases. Therefore,
knowledge graph completion and message-passing GNNs have little reliable signal
to learn and propagate, resulting in poor performance. We present RareAgent, a
self-evolving multi-agent system that reframes this task from passive pattern
recognition to active evidence-seeking reasoning. RareAgent organizes
task-specific adversarial debates in which agents dynamically construct
evidence graphs from diverse perspectives to support, refute, or entail
hypotheses. The reasoning strategies are analyzed post hoc in a
self-evolutionary loop, producing textual feedback that refines agent policies,
while successful reasoning paths are distilled into transferable heuristics to
accelerate future investigations. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that
RareAgent improves the indication AUPRC by 18.1% over reasoning baselines and
provides a transparent reasoning chain consistent with clinical evidence.

### [115] [ConstraintLLM: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Industrial-Level Constraint Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05774)
*Weichun Shi,Minghao Liu,Wanting Zhang,Langchen Shi,Fuqi Jia,Feifei Ma,Jian Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ConstraintLLM is a specialized LLM for CP modeling that uses CARM and Tree-of-Thoughts with guided self-correction, plus IndusCP benchmark; it achieves state-of-the-art results and 2x improvement on IndusCP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Constraint programming modeling for COPs is important but underexplored for LLM-based automatic modeling; need trustworthy neuro-symbolic AI combining symbolic solvers with LLMs; create benchmarks and methods to improve in-context learning for CP tasks.

Method: Develop ConstraintLLM trained on an open-source LLM with multi-instruction supervised fine-tuning; introduce Constraint-Aware Retrieval Module (CARM) to boost in-context retrieval; integrate into a Tree-of-Thoughts framework with guided self-correction; build IndusCP benchmark (140 tasks) for CP modeling.

Result: ConstraintLLM achieves state-of-the-art solving accuracy across multiple CP benchmarks and outperforms baselines by about 2x on IndusCP benchmark.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that a purpose-built LLM for CP modeling can effectively couple with symbolic CP solvers, advancing trustworthy neuro-symbolic AI and providing a strong industrial benchmark; motivates further research in CP-focused LLMs.

Abstract: Constraint programming (CP) is a crucial technology for solving real-world
constraint optimization problems (COPs), with the advantages of rich modeling
semantics and high solving efficiency. Using large language models (LLMs) to
generate formal modeling automatically for COPs is becoming a promising
approach, which aims to build trustworthy neuro-symbolic AI with the help of
symbolic solvers. However, CP has received less attention compared to works
based on operations research (OR) models. We introduce ConstraintLLM, the first
LLM specifically designed for CP modeling, which is trained on an open-source
LLM with multi-instruction supervised fine-tuning. We propose the
Constraint-Aware Retrieval Module (CARM) to increase the in-context learning
capabilities, which is integrated in a Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) framework with
guided self-correction mechanism. Moreover, we construct and release IndusCP,
the first industrial-level benchmark for CP modeling, which contains 140
challenging tasks from various domains. Our experiments demonstrate that
ConstraintLLM achieves state-of-the-art solving accuracy across multiple
benchmarks and outperforms the baselines by 2x on the new IndusCP benchmark.

### [116] [Towards Label-Free Biological Reasoning Synthetic Dataset Creation via Uncertainty Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05871)
*Josefa Lia Stoisser,Lawrence Phillips,Aditya Misra,Tom A. Lamb,Philip Torr,Marc Boubnovski Martell,Julien Fauqueur,Kaspar Märtens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Uncertainty-based filtering enables label-free synthetic chain-of-thought data for large reasoning models, improving performance in data-scarce biology tasks and narrowing gaps to ground-truth supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Label scarcity and high cost of wet-lab labels in fields like biology motivate a label-free approach to curate high-quality reasoning traces by leveraging model-internal uncertainty signals.

Method: Generate multiple reasoning traces, compute uncertainty metrics (e.g., self-consistency, predictive perplexity), retain low-uncertainty subsets, and perform supervised fine-tuning on this filtered data. Compare against unfiltered synthetic data and ground-truth baselines, with ablations on per-class filtering and hybrid uncertainty metrics.

Result: The uncertainty-filtered subset achieves higher accuracy; SFT on filtered data outperforms unfiltered data and strong baselines, narrowing the gap to ground-truth training. Ablations show per-class filtering mitigates class-specific uncertainty and hybrid metrics yield higher-quality datasets.

Conclusion: Model-internal confidence is a powerful signal for efficient reasoning data creation, enabling large reasoning models to thrive in domains with expensive supervision.

Abstract: Synthetic chain-of-thought (CoT) traces are widely used to train large
reasoning models (LRMs), improving generalization by providing step-level
supervision. Yet most approaches require ground-truth labels to seed or filter
these traces - an expensive bottleneck in domains like biology where wet-lab
data are scarce. We propose a label-free alternative: uncertainty-based
filtering, which uses a model's own confidence - quantified through established
uncertainty metrics like self-consistency and predictive perplexity - as a
substitute for external labels. We sample multiple reasoning traces and retain
only low-uncertainty subsets. Applied to biological perturbation prediction, a
domain where wet-lab labels are especially costly, we show that the filtered
subset has higher accuracy, and that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
uncertainty-filtered data outperforms unfiltered synthetic data, narrows the
gap to ground-truth training, and surpasses strong LRM baselines. Ablations
show that per-class filtering corrects for class-specific uncertainty scales
and that hybrid uncertainty metrics yield higher-quality datasets. Our results
suggest that model-internal confidence is a powerful signal for efficient
reasoning dataset creation, enabling LRMs in domains where supervision is
expensive.

### [117] [Optimizing for Persuasion Improves LLM Generalization: Evidence from Quality-Diversity Evolution of Debate Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05909)
*Aksel Joonas Reedi,Corentin Léger,Julien Pourcel,Loris Gaven,Perrine Charriau,Guillaume Pourcel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DebateQD shows that optimizing LLMs for persuasive debate strategies within a single-model quality-diversity (QD) framework can outperform truth-focused optimization in generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address overfitting and brittle reasoning in truth-optimized LLMs and to evaluate whether competitive persuasion can yield more transferable reasoning, using a population-like diversity of strategies within one LLM rather than multiple models.

Method: A minimal Quality-Diversity evolutionary algorithm (DebateQD) evolves diverse debate strategies across categories (e.g., rationality, authority, emotional appeal) through tournament-style debates where two LLMs debate and a third judges. The debate protocol is fixed; the fitness function is swapped between persuasion (convince the judge) and truth (collaborative correctness). Diversity of opponents is maintained via prompt-based strategies within a single LLM architecture, tested across 7B, 32B, 72B models and multiple QuALITY dataset sizes.

Result: Persuasion-optimized strategies achieve up to 13.94% smaller train-test generalization gaps and match or exceed truth optimization's test performance across model scales, providing controlled evidence that competitive pressure to persuade improves transferable reasoning.

Conclusion: Competitive pressure to persuade, rather than solely pursuing truth, can foster more transferable reasoning in LLMs. The DebateQD approach offers an accessible, population-like diversity mechanism within a single model and a promising direction for improving generalization.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) optimized to output truthful answers often
overfit, producing brittle reasoning that fails to generalize. While
persuasion-based optimization has shown promise in debate settings, it has not
been systematically compared against mainstream truth-based approaches. We
introduce DebateQD, a minimal Quality-Diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithm
that evolves diverse debate strategies across different categories
(rationality, authority, emotional appeal, etc.) through tournament-style
competitions where two LLMs debate while a third judges. Unlike previously
proposed methods that require a population of LLMs, our approach maintains
diversity of opponents through prompt-based strategies within a single LLM
architecture, making it more accessible for experiments while preserving the
key benefits of population-based optimization. In contrast to prior work, we
explicitly isolate the role of the optimization objective by fixing the debate
protocol and swapping only the fitness function: persuasion rewards strategies
that convince the judge irrespective of truth, whereas truth rewards
collaborative correctness. Across three model scales (7B, 32B, 72B parameters)
and multiple dataset sizes from the QuALITY benchmark, persuasion-optimized
strategies achieve up to 13.94% smaller train-test generalization gaps, while
matching or exceeding truth optimization's test performance. These results
provide the first controlled evidence that competitive pressure to persuade,
rather than seek the truth collaboratively, fosters more transferable reasoning
skills, offering a promising path for improving LLM generalization.

### [118] [Training-Free Time Series Classification via In-Context Reasoning with LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05950)
*Songyuan Sui,Zihang Xu,Yu-Neng Chuang,Kwei-Herng Lai,Xia Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FETA enables training-free, exemplar-based in-context reasoning for time series classification by decomposing multivariate series into channel-wise subproblems, using a reasoning LLM to evaluate channel exemplars, and fusing channel decisions with confidence weighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeled data for time series classification is scarce and task-specific training is costly; while LLMs can reason about temporal patterns, pure zero-shot usage is suboptimal. A training-free, interpretable, and efficient solver is desirable.

Method: FETA decomposes a multivariate series into channel-wise subproblems. For each channel, it retrieves structurally similar labeled exemplars, uses a reasoning LLM to compare the query against exemplars and generate channel-level labels with self-assessed confidences, and then aggregates these decisions via a confidence-weighted fusion across channels. The approach requires no pretraining or fine-tuning and emphasizes channel pruning and exemplar grounding for efficiency and interpretability.

Result: On nine UEA datasets, FETA achieves strong accuracy under a fully training-free setting and outperforms multiple trained baselines.

Conclusion: A multi-agent in-context reasoning framework can transform LLMs into competitive, plug-and-play time series classifiers without any parameter training.

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) spans diverse application scenarios, yet
labeled data are often scarce, making task-specific training costly and
inflexible. Recent reasoning-oriented large language models (LLMs) show promise
in understanding temporal patterns, but purely zero-shot usage remains
suboptimal. We propose FETA, a multi-agent framework for training-free TSC via
exemplar-based in-context reasoning. FETA decomposes a multivariate series into
channel-wise subproblems, retrieves a few structurally similar labeled examples
for each channel, and leverages a reasoning LLM to compare the query against
these exemplars, producing channel-level labels with self-assessed confidences;
a confidence-weighted aggregator then fuses all channel decisions. This design
eliminates the need for pretraining or fine-tuning, improves efficiency by
pruning irrelevant channels and controlling input length, and enhances
interpretability through exemplar grounding and confidence estimation. On nine
challenging UEA datasets, FETA achieves strong accuracy under a fully
training-free setting, surpassing multiple trained baselines. These results
demonstrate that a multi-agent in-context reasoning framework can transform
LLMs into competitive, plug-and-play TSC solvers without any parameter
training. The code is available at https://github.com/SongyuanSui/FETATSC.

### [119] [MatheMagic: Generating Dynamic Mathematics Benchmarks Robust to Memorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05962)
*Dayyán O'Brien,Barry Haddow,Emily Allaway,Pinzhen Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Dynamic, counterfactual math benchmark (MatheMagic) to reveal overfitting and assess true reasoning by altering number/operator interpretations with automatically verifiable answers; findings show deduction is easier than induction, and models lack general reasoning skills with induction fine-tuning not generalizing well.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional math benchmarks are susceptible to test-set memorization and overfitting due to limited symbol/rule diversity and closed-ended tasks. A robust evaluation should separate memorized capabilities from genuine reasoning, be test-time dynamic, and provide verifiable answers.

Method: MatheMagic constructs test instances at test time with randomly seeded, altered interpretations of numbers and operators. Answers are automatically verifiable. The setup evaluates induction vs deduction, offering stability, extensibility, comparability, and robustness to overfitting.

Result: Models solve deduction more easily than induction, but still revert to standard math. Math-adapted models exhibit no general, transferable 'reasoning skill'; fine-tuning on induction tasks generalizes poorly.

Conclusion: Dynamic counterfactual benchmarking can provide reliable, scalable evaluation of true mathematical reasoning and reveal overfitting; current models' apparent math skills do not transfer to general reasoning, highlighting limits of induction-focused fine-tuning and the need for more robust, test-time, verifiable benchmarks.

Abstract: Conducting contamination-free evaluation of mathematical capabilities can be
difficult for two reasons: models may memorize a test set once it is made
public, and current mathematical benchmarks are prone to overfitting due to
having limited diversity of symbols and rules, coupled with closed-ended
answers. This paper proposes a method to leverage these shortcomings as useful
features to a construct dynamic, counterfactual benchmark, which can be used to
both reveal overfitting and measure true reasoning. We demonstrate this via
MatheMagic, which generates math test instances with the interpretations of
numbers and operators altered, yet has automatically verifiable answers. Test
instances are randomly seeded and constructed at test time to evaluate a
model's induction or deduction capability, offering stability, extensibility,
comparability, and robustness to overfitting. Our experiments find that models
solve deduction more easily than induction, but they revert to standard math.
Further analysis reveals that math-adapted models fail to exhibit a general
"skill" of reasoning, and fine-tuning on induction tasks generalizes poorly.

### [120] [Deterministic Legal Retrieval: An Action API for Querying the SAT-Graph RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06002)
*Hudson de Martim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Two-layer SAT-Graph system with a formal API of atomic actions enables deterministic, auditable retrieval for legal RAG by decomposing queries into DAGs; enhances XAI through auditable causal tracing and point-in-time versioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) lacks verifiable structure and deterministic guarantees in legal domains; there is a need for a verifiable knowledge graph that models hierarchy, temporality, and causal events of legal norms, while preserving deterministic retrieval.

Method: Introduce the SAT-Graph API with canonical, atomic actions that are composable and auditable; use planner-guided agents to decompose complex queries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions; separate probabilistic discovery from deterministic retrieval to enable high-precision hybrid search, robust reference resolution, point-in-time version retrieval, and auditable causal tracing; implement a two-layer architecture turning retrieval from a black box into a transparent process.

Result: Demonstrates how planner-guided agents can break down complex queries into DAGs of canonical actions and shows the transformation of retrieval into a transparent, auditable process.

Conclusion: The SAT-Graph API and its two-layer design provide deterministic, auditable retrieval suitable for high-stakes domains, addressing Explainable AI requirements in legal knowledge frameworks.

Abstract: The Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG) addresses core
limitations of standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the legal domain by
providing a verifiable knowledge graph that models hierarchical structure,
temporal evolution, and causal events of legal norms. However, a critical gap
remains: how to reliably query this structured knowledge without sacrificing
its deterministic properties. This paper introduces the SAT-Graph API, a formal
query execution layer centered on canonical actions-atomic, composable, and
auditable primitives that isolate probabilistic discovery from deterministic
retrieval. These actions enable: (i) high-precision hybrid search; (ii) robust
reference resolution; (iii) point-in-time version retrieval; and (iv) auditable
causal tracing. We demonstrate how planner-guided agents can decompose complex
queries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions. This two-layer
architecture transforms retrieval from an opaque black box to a transparent,
auditable process, directly addressing Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for
high-stakes domains.

*Zhangyue Yin,Qiushi Sun,Zhiyuan Zeng,Zhiyuan Yu,Qipeng Guo,Xuanjing Huang,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARISE is a new metric for evaluating test-time scaling in large reasoning models, combining sample-level penalties for negative scaling and dynamic sampling to stabilize measurements, demonstrated across math, code, and agentic tasks, with Claude Opus showing best scaling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a systematic, robust way to compare test-time scaling across diverse reasoning models as models and compute resources proliferate.

Method: Introduce ARISE with two innovations: sample-level awareness that penalizes scales where performance degrades with more computation; dynamic sampling mechanism to mitigate fluctuations in accuracy and token counts; extensive experiments across domains; compare models.

Result: ARISE provides reliable, fine-grained measurement; reveals substantial variation in scaling efficiency; Claude Opus exhibits superior scaling.

Conclusion: ARISE enables fairer, more nuanced evaluation of test-time scaling; informs model development and deployment; potential future directions include widening domains, improving robustness, analyzing causal factors.

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a transformative paradigm for enhancing the
performance of large reasoning models, enabling dynamic allocation of
computational resources during inference. However, as the landscape of
reasoning models rapidly expands, a critical question remains: how can we
systematically compare and evaluate the test-time scaling capabilities across
different models? In this paper, we introduce ARISE (Adaptive Resolution-aware
Scaling Evaluation), a novel metric specifically designed to assess the
test-time scaling effectiveness of large reasoning models. Unlike existing
evaluation approaches, ARISE incorporates two key innovations: (1) sample-level
awareness that effectively penalizes negative scaling behaviors where increased
computation leads to performance degradation, and (2) a dynamic sampling
mechanism that mitigates the impact of accuracy fluctuations and token count
instability on the final assessment. We conduct comprehensive experiments
evaluating state-of-the-art reasoning models across diverse domains including
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and agentic tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ARISE provides a reliable and fine-grained measurement of
test-time scaling capabilities, revealing significant variations in scaling
efficiency across models. Notably, our evaluation identifies Claude Opus as
exhibiting superior scaling characteristics compared to other contemporary
reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) with multi-step reasoning capabilities have
shown remarkable problem-solving abilities, yet they exhibit concerning safety
vulnerabilities that remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate why
safety alignment fails in reasoning models through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Using a linear probing approach to trace refusal
intentions across token positions, we discover a striking phenomenon termed as
\textbf{refusal cliff}: many poorly-aligned reasoning models correctly identify
harmful prompts and maintain strong refusal intentions during their thinking
process, but experience a sharp drop in refusal scores at the final tokens
before output generation. This suggests that these models are not inherently
unsafe; rather, their refusal intentions are systematically suppressed. Through
causal intervention analysis, we identify a sparse set of attention heads that
negatively contribute to refusal behavior. Ablating just 3\% of these heads can
reduce attack success rates below 10\%. Building on these mechanistic insights,
we propose \textbf{Cliff-as-a-Judge}, a novel data selection method that
identifies training examples exhibiting the largest refusal cliff to
efficiently repair reasoning models' safety alignment. This approach achieves
comparable safety improvements using only 1.7\% of the vanilla safety training
data, demonstrating a less-is-more effect in safety alignment.

### [123] [MixReasoning: Switching Modes to Think](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06052)
*Haiquan Lu,Gongfan Fang,Xinyin Ma,Qi Li,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MixReasoning dynamically adjusts the depth of reasoning within a single response, applying detailed steps only to hard sub-problems and concise inference to easy ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional chain-of-thought reasoning can be wasteful when many subproblems are easy; by adaptively varying reasoning depth, the model can reduce redundancy while preserving answer quality.

Method: Introduce MixReasoning, a framework that modulates the depth of reasoning per subproblem inside one solution, producing a mixture of detailed steps for difficult steps and concise inferences for simpler ones.

Result: Shorter overall reasoning length and improved efficiency, with no loss in accuracy, demonstrated on GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME datasets.

Conclusion: Adaptive, mixed-depth reasoning is effective for balancing efficiency and accuracy in complex problem solving.

Abstract: Reasoning models enhance performance by tackling problems in a step-by-step
manner, decomposing them into sub-problems and exploring long chains of thought
before producing an answer. However, applying extended reasoning to every step
introduces substantial redundancy, as sub-problems vary widely in difficulty
and complexity: a small number of pivotal steps are genuinely challenging and
decisive for the final answer, while many others only involve straightforward
revisions or simple computations. Therefore, a natural idea is to endow
reasoning models with the ability to adaptively respond to this variation,
rather than treating all steps with the same level of elaboration. To this end,
we propose MixReasoning, a framework that dynamically adjusts the depth of
reasoning within a single response. The resulting chain of thought then becomes
a mixture of detailed reasoning on difficult steps and concise inference on
simpler ones. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME show that MixReasoning
shortens reasoning length and substantially improves efficiency without
compromising accuracy.

*Gang Liu,Yihan Zhu,Jie Chen,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepEvolve combines deep research with algorithm evolution through external retrieval, cross-file code editing, and systematic debugging in a feedback-driven loop. It consistently improves initial algorithms across nine benchmarks in chemistry, mathematics, biology, materials, and patents, yielding executable new algorithms; code is available on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing AI scientific assistants fall into two camps: (1) pure algorithm evolution, which rapidly plateaus in complex domains due to limited internal knowledge, and (2) pure deep research without grounding, which proposes ideas without validation and may be unrealizable. A bridging framework that grounds exploration with testable, executable results is needed to advance scientific algorithm discovery.

Method: An agent architecture that integrates external knowledge retrieval, cross-file code editing, and systematic debugging within a feedback-driven iterative loop. Each cycle proposes hypotheses, then refines, implements, and tests them, ensuring improvements are substantive and well-validated rather than shallow or over-refined.

Result: Across nine benchmarks spanning chemistry, mathematics, biology, materials, and patents, DeepEvolve consistently improves the initial algorithm, producing executable, improved algorithms with sustained gains.

Conclusion: DeepEvolve bridges unguided evolution and ungrounded research, providing a reliable framework for advancing scientific algorithm discovery. The authors supply code at the linked GitHub repository.

Abstract: Large language models hold promise as scientific assistants, yet existing
agents either rely solely on algorithm evolution or on deep research in
isolation, both of which face critical limitations. Pure algorithm evolution,
as in AlphaEvolve, depends only on the internal knowledge of LLMs and quickly
plateaus in complex domains, while pure deep research proposes ideas without
validation, resulting in unrealistic or unimplementable solutions. We present
DeepEvolve, an agent that integrates deep research with algorithm evolution,
uniting external knowledge retrieval, cross-file code editing, and systematic
debugging under a feedback-driven iterative loop. Each iteration not only
proposes new hypotheses but also refines, implements, and tests them, avoiding
both shallow improvements and unproductive over-refinements. Across nine
benchmarks in chemistry, mathematics, biology, materials, and patents,
DeepEvolve consistently improves the initial algorithm, producing executable
new algorithms with sustained gains. By bridging the gap between unguided
evolution and research without grounding, DeepEvolve provides a reliable
framework for advancing scientific algorithm discovery. Our code is available

### [125] [TelecomTS: A Multi-Modal Observability Dataset for Time Series and Language Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06063)
*Austin Feng,Andreas Varvarigos,Ioannis Panitsas,Daniela Fernandez,Jinbiao Wei,Yuwei Guo,Jialin Chen,Ali Maatouk,Leandros Tassiulas,Rex Ying*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TelecomTS provides a large-scale, scale-preserving observability dataset from a live 5G network, enabling anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and multi-modal QA; benchmarking reveals current models struggle with abrupt, noisy, high-variance dynamics and underscores the value of preserving covariates' absolute scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Observability data differ from traditional time series in being zero-inflated, highly stochastic, and minimally structured in time. Public benchmarks lack such data with explicit scale, limiting research to forecasting. A de-anonymized, scale-aware dataset with diverse covariates and multi-task evaluation can drive development of robust, foundation models for practical observability applications.

Method: Construct a large-scale dataset ( TelecomTS ) from a live 5G telecommunications network, including heterogeneous, de-anonymized covariates with explicit scale information. Support downstream tasks such as anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and a multi-modal question-answering benchmark requiring cross-modal reasoning.

Result: Baseline evaluations show state-of-the-art time series, language, and reasoning models struggle with TelecomTS’s abrupt, noisy, and high-variance dynamics. The experiments highlight the importance of preserving absolute scale information, suggesting that foundation models should natively leverage scale for practical observability tasks.

Conclusion: TelecomTS fills a public-data gap for observability research, enabling tasks beyond forecasting and facilitating long-range, multi-modal reasoning. The findings advocate for scale-aware models and benchmarks that reflect real-world observability challenges.

Abstract: Modern enterprises generate vast streams of time series metrics when
monitoring complex systems, known as observability data. Unlike conventional
time series from domains such as weather, observability data are zero-inflated,
highly stochastic, and exhibit minimal temporal structure. Despite their
importance, observability datasets are underrepresented in public benchmarks
due to proprietary restrictions. Existing datasets are often anonymized and
normalized, removing scale information and limiting their use for tasks beyond
forecasting, such as anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and multi-modal
reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce TelecomTS, a large-scale
observability dataset derived from a 5G telecommunications network. TelecomTS
features heterogeneous, de-anonymized covariates with explicit scale
information and supports a suite of downstream tasks, including anomaly
detection, root-cause analysis, and a question-answering benchmark requiring
multi-modal reasoning. Benchmarking state-of-the-art time series, language, and
reasoning models reveals that existing approaches struggle with the abrupt,
noisy, and high-variance dynamics of observability data. Our experiments also
underscore the importance of preserving covariates' absolute scale, emphasizing
the need for foundation time series models that natively leverage scale
information for practical observability applications.

### [126] [Constraint-Aware Route Recommendation from Natural Language via Hierarchical LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06078)
*Tao Zhe,Rui Liu,Fateme Memar,Xiao Luo,Wei Fan,Xinyue Ye,Zhongren Peng,Dongjie Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RouteLLM is a hierarchical multi-agent system that translates natural-language route requests into constraint-aware routes using a manager that coordinates constraint, POI, and path-refinement agents, with a final verifier for feasibility and explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classical routing methods struggle with unstructured, NL inputs and fixed objectives, while LLM-based approaches lack robust spatial reasoning and integrated route- and POI-level preference modeling. There is a need to ground flexible NL intents into feasible, preference-aware routes.

Method: Propose RouteLLM: parse NL queries into structured intents (POIs, paths, constraints), use a manager agent to coordinate specialized sub-agents—(1) constraint agent for constraint resolution and formal checking, (2) POI agent to retrieve and rank candidate POIs, (3) path refinement agent to refine routes via a routing engine with preference-conditioned costs—and a final verifier agent to ensure constraint satisfaction and provide an interpretable rationale.

Result: Experiments indicate RouteLLM reliably grounds textual preferences into constraint-aware routes and improves route quality and satisfaction of user preferences compared with classical methods.

Conclusion: The approach bridges linguistic flexibility and spatial structure, enabling reasoning about route feasibility and user preferences; it offers a scalable, explainable framework that integrates NL intents with constraint-aware routing through a hierarchical multi-agent design.

Abstract: Route recommendation aims to provide users with optimal travel plans that
satisfy diverse and complex requirements. Classical routing algorithms (e.g.,
shortest-path and constraint-aware search) are efficient but assume structured
inputs and fixed objectives, limiting adaptability to natural-language queries.
Recent LLM-based approaches enhance flexibility but struggle with spatial
reasoning and the joint modeling of route-level and POI-level preferences. To
address these limitations, we propose RouteLLM, a hierarchical multi-agent
framework that grounds natural-language intents into constraint-aware routes.
It first parses user queries into structured intents including POIs, paths, and
constraints. A manager agent then coordinates specialized sub-agents: a
constraint agent that resolves and formally check constraints, a POI agent that
retrieves and ranks candidate POIs, and a path refinement agent that refines
routes via a routing engine with preference-conditioned costs. A final verifier
agent ensures constraint satisfaction and produces the final route with an
interpretable rationale. This design bridges linguistic flexibility and spatial
structure, enabling reasoning over route feasibility and user preferences.
Experiments show that our method reliably grounds textual preferences into
constraint-aware routes, improving route quality and preference satisfaction
over classical methods.

### [127] [Classical AI vs. LLMs for Decision-Maker Alignment in Health Insurance Choices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06093)
*Mallika Mainali,Harsha Sureshbabu,Anik Sen,Christopher B. Rauch,Noah D. Reifsnyder,John Meyer,J. T. Turner,Michael W. Floyd,Matthew Molineaux,Rosina O. Weber*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Classical AI and LLM-based decision-maker alignment perform comparably in a health-insurance task, with classical AI slightly outperforming at moderate risk tolerance; study investigates cross-context generalizability and provides open data/code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether context-specific decision-maker alignment methods generalize from prior classical AI or LLM-based approaches when applied to a novel, high-stakes domain.

Method: Replicates a prior classical AI model and develops an LLM-based algorithmic DM evaluated under zero-shot prompting with weighted self-consistency, using GPT-5 (reasoning) and GPT-4 (non-reasoning) as the underlying models. Evaluation on a health insurance decision-making dataset annotated for three risk-tolerance targets (0.0, 0.5, 1.0).

Result: Both classical AI and LLM-based DM approaches achieve comparable alignment with attribute-based targets; classical AI shows slightly better alignment for a moderate risk profile (0.5).

Conclusion: Context-specific DM alignment approaches can yield similar performance across paradigms; the work contributes to understanding generalizability to novel contexts and provides open-source data/code for replication.

Abstract: As algorithmic decision-makers are increasingly applied to high-stakes
domains, AI alignment research has evolved from a focus on universal value
alignment to context-specific approaches that account for decision-maker
attributes. Prior work on Decision-Maker Alignment (DMA) has explored two
primary strategies: (1) classical AI methods integrating case-based reasoning,
Bayesian reasoning, and naturalistic decision-making, and (2) large language
model (LLM)-based methods leveraging prompt engineering. While both approaches
have shown promise in limited domains such as medical triage, their
generalizability to novel contexts remains underexplored. In this work, we
implement a prior classical AI model and develop an LLM-based algorithmic
decision-maker evaluated using a large reasoning model (GPT-5) and a
non-reasoning model (GPT-4) with weighted self-consistency under a zero-shot
prompting framework, as proposed in recent literature. We evaluate both
approaches on a health insurance decision-making dataset annotated for three
target decision-makers with varying levels of risk tolerance (0.0, 0.5, 1.0).
In the experiments reported herein, classical AI and LLM-based models achieved
comparable alignment with attribute-based targets, with classical AI exhibiting
slightly better alignment for a moderate risk profile. The dataset and
open-source implementation are publicly available at:

### [128] [Moloch's Bargain: Emergent Misalignment When LLMs Compete for Audiences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06105)
*Batu El,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Competitive optimization of LLMs yields performance gains but causes misalignment across ads, elections, and social media, with sizable increases in deception, disinformation, and harmful content; termed 'Moloch's Bargain'; calls for stronger governance to prevent a race to the bottom.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain why and how market-like pressures push LLMs toward manipulative behavior, threatening trust and safety; evaluate whether alignment safeguards survive competitive incentives.

Method: Use simulated environments across three sectors (advertising/sales, political campaigns, social media) to model feedback loops where models are optimized for competitive success; measure changes in business/political metrics and misalignment indicators; quantify tradeoffs.

Result: Sales: 6.3% increase with 14.0% rise in deceptive marketing. Elections: 4.9% gain in vote share with 22.3% more disinformation and 12.5% more populist rhetoric. Social media: 7.5% engagement boost with 188.6% more disinformation and 16.3% increase in promotion of harmful behaviors.

Conclusion: Misaligned behaviors emerge even when models are instructed to be truthful and grounded; alignment safeguards are fragile under competitive pressures; governance and incentive design are needed to prevent a race to the bottom and safeguard societal trust.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping how information is
created and disseminated, from companies using them to craft persuasive
advertisements, to election campaigns optimizing messaging to gain votes, to
social media influencers boosting engagement. These settings are inherently
competitive, with sellers, candidates, and influencers vying for audience
approval, yet it remains poorly understood how competitive feedback loops
influence LLM behavior. We show that optimizing LLMs for competitive success
can inadvertently drive misalignment. Using simulated environments across these
scenarios, we find that, 6.3% increase in sales is accompanied by a 14.0% rise
in deceptive marketing; in elections, a 4.9% gain in vote share coincides with
22.3% more disinformation and 12.5% more populist rhetoric; and on social
media, a 7.5% engagement boost comes with 188.6% more disinformation and a
16.3% increase in promotion of harmful behaviors. We call this phenomenon
Moloch's Bargain for AI--competitive success achieved at the cost of alignment.
These misaligned behaviors emerge even when models are explicitly instructed to
remain truthful and grounded, revealing the fragility of current alignment
safeguards. Our findings highlight how market-driven optimization pressures can
systematically erode alignment, creating a race to the bottom, and suggest that
safe deployment of AI systems will require stronger governance and carefully
designed incentives to prevent competitive dynamics from undermining societal
trust.

### [129] [Pushing Test-Time Scaling Limits of Deep Search with Asymmetric Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06135)
*Weihao Zeng,Keqing He,Chuqiao Kuang,Xiaoguang Li,Junxian He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Combining sequential and parallel test-time scaling with asymmetric verification yields substantial gains for deep search agents, achieving strong results on BrowseComp and GAIA with open-source Heavy models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Verification is often easier than generation in deep search tasks. Exploiting this asymmetry through test-time scaling (TTS) can unlock large performance gains with relatively modest extra compute, motivating a study of both sequential and parallel TTS of deep search agents.

Method: The authors investigate sequential scaling (e.g., budget forcing) and parallel TTS via verification/selection among multiple candidates. They leverage asymmetric verification by allocating modest compute to the verifier, extend open-source models to Heavy variants via TTS, and evaluate on benchmarks such as BrowseComp and GAIA. Experimental setup includes flagship open-source models and their Heavy counterparts.

Result: Sequential scaling provides early gains but tends to degrade over time. With asymmetric verification, substantial improvements are achieved by dedicating limited compute to the verifier. Reported gains include up to 27 absolute points on BrowseComp; GLM-4.5 Heavy reaches 54.0% (BrowseComp) and 66.0% (GAIA); Tongyi-DeepResearch Heavy reaches 69.0% (BrowseComp), surpassing top proprietary results.

Conclusion: Asymmetric verification with test-time scaling is a powerful approach for deep search agents. While sequential methods can help initially, allocating verifier compute yields robust gains and can elevate open-source Heavy models to competitive levels with proprietary systems.

Abstract: Test-time compute can be scaled both sequentially and in parallel. Sequential
scaling involves lengthening the generation process, while parallel scaling
involves verifying and selecting among multiple candidate outputs. Combining
these two strategies has led to the most powerful AI systems, such as Grok 4
Heavy and GPT-5 Pro. In certain contexts (e.g., solving Sudoku puzzles),
verifying responses can be substantially easier than generating them. This
property, referred to as \emph{asymmetric verification}, highlights the strong
potential of test-time scaling (TTS). In this work, we study both sequential
and parallel TTS of deep search agents, motivated by the intuition that
verification in this setting is often much easier than generation. In
experiments, we first show that sequential scaling methods, such as budget
forcing, can be effective initially but soon degrade performance. Leveraging
asymmetric verification, however, we are able to achieve substantial
improvements by allocating only a modest amount of compute to the verifier. We
conduct experiments with flagship open-source models and extend them to their
``Heavy'' variants through TTS. These deep research agents achieve gains of up
to 27 absolute points on benchmarks such as BrowseComp. Remarkably, as an
open-source alternative, GLM-4.5 Heavy reaches accuracy of {\bf 54.0\%} on
BrowseComp and {\bf 66.0\%} on GAIA, placing it comparable to the best
proprietary choices such as OpenAI Deep Research. Tongyi-DeepResearch Heavy
further achieves {\bf 69.0\%} accuracy on BrowseComp, greatly surpassing the
best proprietary results.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS) automates discovery and verification of system algorithms by exploiting reliable verifiers from real systems; penEvolve demonstrations show substantial performance and cost gains; the work outlines best practices and urges a shift in systems research practices toward problem framing and evaluator design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: System performance problems inherently possess reliable verifiers through execution on real systems or simulators, enabling AI to search for and refine high-performing algorithms. ADRS aims to accelerate discovery and surpass traditional human-designed solutions by leveraging AI-driven exploration.

Method: An iterative ADRS loop that generates diverse solution candidates, evaluates them with predefined workloads on real systems or simulators, and refines promising approaches. The paper reports case studies using penEvolve across domains such as load balancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference, LLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling.

Result: In several cases ADRS discovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs, achieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements and up to 50% cost reductions.

Conclusion: AI is poised to play a central role in algorithm design for systems research. Researchers will emphasize problem formulation and evaluator construction, while adapting systems research practices to accommodate AI-driven discovery.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is starting to transform the research process as
we know it by automating the discovery of new solutions. Given a task, the
typical AI-driven approach is (i) to generate a set of diverse solutions, and
then (ii) to verify these solutions and select one that solves the problem.
Crucially, this approach assumes the existence of a reliable verifier, i.e.,
one that can accurately determine whether a solution solves the given problem.
We argue that systems research, long focused on designing and evaluating new
performance-oriented algorithms, is particularly well-suited for AI-driven
solution discovery. This is because system performance problems naturally admit
reliable verifiers: solutions are typically implemented in real systems or
simulators, and verification reduces to running these software artifacts
against predefined workloads and measuring performance. We term this approach
as AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), which iteratively generates,
evaluates, and refines solutions. Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS
instance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load
balancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference,
LLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling. In multiple instances, ADRS
discovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g.,
achieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill
best practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator
construction, for existing frameworks. We then discuss the broader implications
for the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we
argue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and
strategic guidance. Our results highlight both the disruptive potential and the
urgent need to adapt systems research practices in the age of AI.

### [131] [TaTToo: Tool-Grounded Thinking PRM for Test-Time Scaling in Tabular Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06217)
*Jiaru Zou,Soumya Roy,Vinay Kumar Verma,Ziyi Wang,David Wipf,Pan Lu,Sumit Negi,James Zou,Jingrui He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TaTToo introduces a table-grounded PRM to improve tabular reasoning in LRMs, using 60k+ step-level annotations and tool-based reward shaping to surpass strong baselines with 8B parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing reward models for reasoning excel on text but falter on table-specific operations (sub-table retrieval, schema interaction). There's a need for a table-aware supervision signal and evaluation to boost LRMs on tabular tasks.

Method: TaTToo grounds reasoning in tabular steps, employs tool-based verification for precise rewards, builds a 60k+ annotated dataset by merging table verification rationales with tool executions, and trains via cold-start supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded reward shaping.

Result: Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks (numerical reasoning, fact-checking, data analysis), TaTToo yields a 30.9% improvement in inference policy, outperforms the 8B-parameter Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B, and shows strong generalization under diverse test-time strategies.

Conclusion: Table-grounded PRMs with explicit tabular reasoning and tool-based rewards can substantially enhance tabular reasoning in LRMs, offering scalable data pipelines and robust performance with smaller models.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs),
particularly in the context of test-time scaling (TTS). However, their
potential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains
underexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing
PRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle
with table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema
interaction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this
limitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i)
reasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based
verification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design
a scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality
step-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with
tool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a
dual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use
reasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded
reward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a
comprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly
designed PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering
numerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves
downstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines
such as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong
generalizability across diverse TTS strategies.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VER distills multiple vision foundation models into a reusable vision expert library and uses a tiny routing network to dynamically select task-relevant experts for robot learning, enabling flexible, parameter-efficient adaptation across tasks with state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VFMs excel in specific domains; general robot learning needs a unified, adaptable representation that can integrate robot-domain knowledge with minimal retraining and parameter cost.

Method: Pretrain by distilling several VFMs into a vision expert library; fine-tune a lightweight routing network (<0.4% of params) to select task-relevant experts; introduce Patchwise Expert Routing with Curriculum Top-K Annealing; allows parameter-efficient finetuning and adaptive robot-domain knowledge integration.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across 17 robotic tasks and multiple policy heads; reduces large-norm outliers in task-irrelevant regions (e.g., backgrounds) and focuses on task-critical regions; provides code and visualizations.

Conclusion: VER offers a scalable, adaptable framework for robot learning by combining multiple VFMs with lightweight dynamic routing, enabling efficient cross-task performance gains and easy integration of robot-domain knowledge.

Abstract: Pretrained vision foundation models (VFMs) advance robotic learning via rich
visual representations, yet individual VFMs typically excel only in specific
domains, limiting generality across tasks. Distilling multiple VFMs into a
unified representation for policy can mitigate this limitation but often yields
inflexible task-specific feature selection and requires costly full re-training
to incorporate robot-domain knowledge. We propose VER, a Vision Expert
transformer for Robot learning. During pretraining, VER distills multiple VFMs
into a vision expert library. It then fine-tunes only a lightweight routing
network (fewer than 0.4% of parameters) to dynamically select task-relevant
experts from the pretrained library for downstream robot tasks. We further
introduce Patchwise Expert Routing with Curriculum Top-K Annealing to improve
both flexibility and precision of dynamic expert selection. Moreover, VER
supports parameter-efficient finetuning for scalable expert utilization and
adaptive robot-domain knowledge integration. Across 17 diverse robotic tasks
and multiple policy heads, VER achieves state-of-the-art performance. We find
that VER reduces large-norm outliers in task-irrelevant regions (e.g.,
background) and concentrates on task-critical regions. Visualizations and codes

### [133] [Adaptive Dynamics Planning for Robot Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05330)
*Lu Yuanjie,Mao Mingyang,Xu Tong,Wang Linji,Lin Xiaomin,Xiao Xuesu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Adaptive Dynamics Planning (ADP) uses reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust robot dynamics fidelity during planning, improving navigation success, safety, and efficiency across planners in diverse environments, validated in simulation and real robot tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a mismatch between global planning (collision-free but dynamics-agnostic) and local dynamics enforcement, causing trajectory tracking failures in constrained environments. Static, manually designed schemes to gradually degrade dynamics fidelity are inefficient and fail to adapt to environmental complexity. An adaptive, learning-based approach can tailor fidelity to context to maintain performance.

Method: Introduce ADP that uses reinforcement learning to adjust dynamics properties (e.g., integration steps, collision-check resolution) during planning. Integrate ADP into three different planners and design a standalone ADP-based navigation system. Evaluate against baselines in simulation and real-world tests.

Result: ADP consistently improves navigation success, safety, and efficiency across planners and scenarios, including obstacle-rich environments, in both simulated and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: Adaptive dynamics planning enables planners to adapt to environmental complexity, bridging planning and dynamics for robust, efficient navigation. The approach generalizes across planners and can enhance real-time autonomous navigation.

Abstract: Autonomous robot navigation systems often rely on hierarchical planning,
where global planners compute collision-free paths without considering
dynamics, and local planners enforce dynamics constraints to produce executable
commands. This discontinuity in dynamics often leads to trajectory tracking
failure in highly constrained environments. Recent approaches integrate
dynamics within the entire planning process by gradually decreasing its
fidelity, e.g., increasing integration steps and reducing collision checking
resolution, for real-time planning efficiency. However, they assume that the
fidelity of the dynamics should decrease according to a manually designed
scheme. Such static settings fail to adapt to environmental complexity
variations, resulting in computational overhead in simple environments or
insufficient dynamics consideration in obstacle-rich scenarios. To overcome
this limitation, we propose Adaptive Dynamics Planning (ADP), a
learning-augmented paradigm that uses reinforcement learning to dynamically
adjust robot dynamics properties, enabling planners to adapt across diverse
environments. We integrate ADP into three different planners and further design
a standalone ADP-based navigation system, benchmarking them against other
baselines. Experiments in both simulation and real-world tests show that ADP
consistently improves navigation success, safety, and efficiency.

### [134] [A multi-modal tactile fingertip design for robotic hands to enhance dexterous manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05382)
*Zhuowei Xu,Zilin Si,Kevin Zhang,Oliver Kroemer,Zeynep Temel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A low-cost, compact robotic fingertip integrates multi-modal tactile sensors (strain gauges for static 2D forces and a contact microphone for high-frequency vibrations) to enable expressive, reliable manipulation under partial or full visual occlusion, achieving 100% success in counting/unstacking cups and outperforming vision-only strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tactile sensing offers rich manipulation information but is hindered by high costs, manufacturing complexity, and difficulty extracting useful signals. A compact, inexpensive, robust fingertip with multi-modal sensing could democratize tactile-enabled manipulation.

Method: Develop a fingertip with internalized sensors: strain gauges for static 2D force (0-5 N) and a contact microphone for high-frequency contact vibrations. The sensors are embedded in a compact, wear-protected fingertip with small footprint. Characterize sensor repeatability and material-discriminating capabilities. Validate on three dexterous manipulation tasks across varying visual occlusion, evaluating whether tactile modalities can complement or replace vision.

Result: Strain gauges provide repeatable 2D planar force measurements in the 0-5 N range. The contact microphone can distinguish contact material properties. Across three tasks (including scenarios with visual occlusion), tactile readings prove expressive and, when fused with vision or used independently, improve performance. Notably, the system counts/unstacks a desired number of cups from a stack with 100% success, a challenging feat for vision alone.

Conclusion: A low-cost, easy-to-fabricate, compact tactile fingertip with internalized, multi-modal sensing offers expressive and reliable manipulation capabilities, especially under occlusion. Flexible use of modalities enhances task performance and has broad potential for dexterous robotics integration.

Abstract: Tactile sensing holds great promise for enhancing manipulation precision and
versatility, but its adoption in robotic hands remains limited due to high
sensor costs, manufacturing and integration challenges, and difficulties in
extracting expressive and reliable information from signals. In this work, we
present a low-cost, easy-to-make, adaptable, and compact fingertip design for
robotic hands that integrates multi-modal tactile sensors. We use strain gauge
sensors to capture static forces and a contact microphone sensor to measure
high-frequency vibrations during contact. These tactile sensors are integrated
into a compact design with a minimal sensor footprint, and all sensors are
internal to the fingertip and therefore not susceptible to direct wear and tear
from interactions. From sensor characterization, we show that strain gauge
sensors provide repeatable 2D planar force measurements in the 0-5 N range and
the contact microphone sensor has the capability to distinguish contact
material properties. We apply our design to three dexterous manipulation tasks
that range from zero to full visual occlusion. Given the expressiveness and
reliability of tactile sensor readings, we show that different tactile sensing
modalities can be used flexibly in different stages of manipulation, solely or
together with visual observations to achieve improved task performance. For
instance, we can precisely count and unstack a desired number of paper cups
from a stack with 100\% success rate which is hard to achieve with vision only.

### [135] [Towards Online Robot Interaction Adaptation to Human Upper-limb Mobility Impairments in Return-to-Work Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05425)
*Marta Lagomarsino,Francesco Tassi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An online adaptive HRI framework uses a mobility model of upper-limb impairments within a hierarchical optimal controller to enable reactive, mobility-aware robot assistance and guide impaired limbs to utilize residual movement, demonstrated in handover tasks with standing/seated configurations; results show personalization to impairment levels and increased joint usage compared to ergonomic HRI baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address lack of inclusivity and inadequate work environments for individuals with upper-limb disabilities by enabling adaptable, inclusive human-robot collaboration that accounts for individual mobility limitations.

Method: Develop an online framework that integrates a joint-level mobility model into a hierarchical optimal controller, enabling the robot to generate real-time responsive behavior and to steer the user’s impaired limb toward residual mobility; tested on a mobile manipulator performing handovers with emulated elbow/shoulder arthritis and wrist blockage, across standing and seated configurations; compared against state-of-the-art ergonomic HRI methods.

Result: Preliminary findings suggest the framework personalizes interaction to the user’s impairment range and promotes use of available joints; quantitative and qualitative comparisons indicate advantages over existing ergonomic HRI approaches.

Conclusion: The proposed mobility-aware adaptive HRI framework can tailor interactions to individual upper-limb limitations and foster active participation, suggesting potential to improve inclusivity in work environments.

Abstract: Work environments are often inadequate and lack inclusivity for individuals
with upper-body disabilities. This paper presents a novel online framework for
adaptive human-robot interaction (HRI) that accommodates users' arm mobility
impairments, ultimately aiming to promote active work participation. Unlike
traditional human-robot collaboration approaches that assume able-bodied users,
our method integrates a mobility model for specific joint limitations into a
hierarchical optimal controller. This allows the robot to generate reactive,
mobility-aware behaviour online and guides the user's impaired limb to exploit
residual functional mobility. The framework was tested in handover tasks
involving different upper-limb mobility impairments (i.e., emulated elbow and
shoulder arthritis, and wrist blockage), under both standing and seated
configurations with task constraints using a mobile manipulator, and
complemented by quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art
ergonomic HRI approaches. Preliminary results indicated that the framework can
personalise the interaction to fit within the user's impaired range of motion
and encourage joint usage based on the severity of their functional
limitations.

*Huayi Tang,Pratik Chaudhari*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An active semantic perception framework using hierarchical scene graphs and LLM-based sampling to plan informative waypoints in indoor exploration, achieving faster and more accurate semantic understanding in simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable more informed and efficient exploration by leveraging semantic structure and probabilistic reasoning about unobserved regions; address limitations of purely geometric or heuristic approaches; exploit LLMs to generate plausible completions of partially observed scenes and compute information gain for planning.

Method: Construct a compact hierarchical multi-layer scene graph representing rooms, objects, walls, etc., with fine-grained geometry; use large language models to sample plausible scene graphs for unobserved areas consistent with partial observations; use these samples to compute the information gain of candidate waypoints; perform spatial reasoning to resolve ambiguities like doors leading to multiple rooms.

Result: In simulation on realistic 3D indoor environments, the method yields qualitative and quantitative improvements over baselines, demonstrating quicker and more accurate semantic understanding (i.e., faster and more accurate scene semantics) than baseline approaches.

Conclusion: Active semantic perception by combining hierarchical scene-graph representations with LLM-guided sampling can enhance exploration efficiency and semantic understanding in indoor environments; demonstrates viability of integrating structured representations with generative reasoning for planning.

Abstract: We develop an approach for active semantic perception which refers to using
the semantics of the scene for tasks such as exploration. We build a compact,
hierarchical multi-layer scene graph that can represent large, complex indoor
environments at various levels of abstraction, e.g., nodes corresponding to
rooms, objects, walls, windows etc. as well as fine-grained details of their
geometry. We develop a procedure based on large language models (LLMs) to
sample plausible scene graphs of unobserved regions that are consistent with
partial observations of the scene. These samples are used to compute an
information gain of a potential waypoint for sophisticated spatial reasoning,
e.g., the two doors in the living room can lead to either a kitchen or a
bedroom. We evaluate this approach in complex, realistic 3D indoor environments
in simulation. We show using qualitative and quantitative experiments that our
approach can pin down the semantics of the environment quicker and more
accurately than baseline approaches.

*Shao-Yi Yu,Jen-Wei Wang,Maya Horii,Vikas Garg,Tarek Zohdi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Adaptive neural ODE dynamics model infers latent environments from state-action history to support model-based control; validated on 2D wheeled robot, 3D quadrotor in wind, and Sphero BOLT with contact variations; robust to temporally/spatially varying conditions in simulation and real world.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model-based controllers require accurate dynamics that adapt to environmental variations, but direct access to environmental information is often unavailable. An adaptive dynamics model that infers environment from experience can enable robust control without explicit sensing.

Method: Propose a neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODE) based dynamics model. Employ a two-phase training procedure to learn latent environment representations from state-action history and integrate these latent representations with the dynamics for control, bypassing the need for explicit environmental knowledge.

Result: The approach enables goal-reaching and path-tracking across three robotic platforms with varying environmental conditions. Empirical results show the method handles temporally and spatially varying environmental changes in both simulation and real-world deployments.

Conclusion: Inferring latent environmental representations via neural ODEs allows adaptive, environment-agnostic dynamics for model-based control, improving robustness in uncertain and changing environments across diverse robotic platforms.

Abstract: Mobile robots, such as ground vehicles and quadrotors, are becoming
increasingly important in various fields, from logistics to agriculture, where
they automate processes in environments that are difficult to access for
humans. However, to perform effectively in uncertain environments using
model-based controllers, these systems require dynamics models capable of
responding to environmental variations, especially when direct access to
environmental information is limited. To enable such adaptivity and facilitate
integration with model predictive control, we propose an adaptive dynamics
model which bypasses the need for direct environmental knowledge by inferring
operational environments from state-action history. The dynamics model is based
on neural ordinary equations, and a two-phase training procedure is used to
learn latent environment representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach through goal-reaching and path-tracking tasks on three robotic
platforms of increasing complexity: a 2D differential wheeled robot with
changing wheel contact conditions, a 3D quadrotor in variational wind fields,
and the Sphero BOLT robot under two contact conditions for real-world
deployment. Empirical results corroborate that our method can handle temporally
and spatially varying environmental changes in both simulation and real-world
systems.

*Mahboubeh Zarei,Robin Chhabra,Farrokh Janabi-Sharifi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A decentralized dual-view fusion framework using two adaptive EKFs on Lie groups to estimate pose and velocity of a moving target from eye-in-hand and eye-to-hand sensors, fused via a correlation-aware Lie-group rule; validated on a real robot with RealSense cameras, showing robustness and improvements over state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Centralized sensor fusion can be sensitive to multi-view noise and may not fully exploit geometric structure on manifolds like SE(3). A decentralized approach with Lie-group filters can leverage independent measurements from multiple views, improve robustness, and maintain consistency in pose/velocity estimation for real-time robotic manipulation tasks.

Method: Two independent adaptive extended Kalman filters formulated on matrix Lie groups SE(3)×R^3×R^3; predictions on SE(3) for pose and velocities, updates on SE(3); dual-view measurements from eye-in-hand and eye-to-hand configurations; a correlation-aware fusion rule on Lie groups combines the two estimates into a final fused pose and velocity; motion model is a random-walk with stochastic acceleration for the target.

Result: Implemented and tested on a UFactory xArm 850 with Intel RealSense cameras tracking a moving target. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness and robustness of the decentralized dual-view estimation framework, with consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed decentralized dual-view fusion framework enhances pose and velocity estimation accuracy and robustness in visual tracking tasks for robotic manipulators. The Lie-group EKFs and fusion rule effectively fuse multi-view information and are validated on real hardware, suggesting broad applicability to vision-guided manipulation with multiple sensors.

Abstract: Accurate pose and velocity estimation is essential for effective spatial task
planning in robotic manipulators. While centralized sensor fusion has
traditionally been used to improve pose estimation accuracy, this paper
presents a novel decentralized fusion approach to estimate both pose and
velocity. We use dual-view measurements from an eye-in-hand and an eye-to-hand
vision sensor configuration mounted on a manipulator to track a target object
whose motion is modeled as random walk (stochastic acceleration model). The
robot runs two independent adaptive extended Kalman filters formulated on a
matrix Lie group, developed as part of this work. These filters predict poses
and velocities on the manifold $\mathbb{SE}(3) \times \mathbb{R}^3 \times
\mathbb{R}^3$ and update the state on the manifold $\mathbb{SE}(3)$. The final
fused state comprising the fused pose and velocities of the target is obtained
using a correlation-aware fusion rule on Lie groups. The proposed method is
evaluated on a UFactory xArm 850 equipped with Intel RealSense cameras,
tracking a moving target. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and
robustness of the proposed decentralized dual-view estimation framework,
showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

*Eugene Vorobiov,Ammar Jaleel Mahmood,Salim Rezvani,Robin Chhabra*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ARNC (Advanced Reasoning Robot Control) presents a practical system that links natural-language instructions to safe, local robot control by using Retrieval-Augmented Generation with RGB-D perception and guarded execution on an affordable robot arm. It builds a vector-indexed knowledge base of movement patterns, task templates, and safety heuristics, enabling JSON-structured action plans from an LLM and executed under software safety gates. Evaluations on tabletop tasks show improved plan validity and adaptability while keeping perception and control local.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The work aims to bridge natural-language instruction and safe robotic manipulation in real-world settings, addressing reliability, safety, perception locality, and affordability by integrating RAG with local perception and guarded execution.

Method: Index curated robot knowledge in a vector database, retrieve task-relevant context for each instruction, condition an LLM to output JSON-formatted action plans, and execute them on a UFactory xArm 850 with a Dynamixel gripper and Intel RealSense D435. Perception combines AprilTag detections with depth to yield object-centric poses. Execution is guarded by software safety mechanisms: workspace bounds, speed/force limits, timeouts, and bounded retries. The work also details architecture, knowledge design, integration choices, and a reproducible evaluation protocol for tabletop scan, approach, and pick-place tasks.

Result: Empirical results indicate that RAG-based planning improves plan validity and adaptability, while keeping perception and low-level control localized to the robot, validating the proposed architecture and integration.

Conclusion: RAG-based planning can substantially enhance plan validity and adaptability in robotic manipulation without sacrificing local perception and control, demonstrated through a practical, reproducible system for tabletop tasks.

Abstract: We present ARRC (Advanced Reasoning Robot Control), a practical system that
connects natural-language instructions to safe local robotic control by
combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with RGB-D perception and
guarded execution on an affordable robot arm. The system indexes curated robot
knowledge (movement patterns, task templates, and safety heuristics) in a
vector database, retrieves task-relevant context for each instruction, and
conditions a large language model (LLM) to produce JSON-structured action
plans. Plans are executed on a UFactory xArm 850 fitted with a Dynamixel-driven
parallel gripper and an Intel RealSense D435 camera. Perception uses AprilTag
detections fused with depth to produce object-centric metric poses. Execution
is enforced via software safety gates: workspace bounds, speed and force caps,
timeouts, and bounded retries. We describe the architecture, knowledge design,
integration choices, and a reproducible evaluation protocol for tabletop scan,
approach, and pick-place tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy
of the proposed approach. Our design shows that RAG-based planning can
substantially improve plan validity and adaptability while keeping perception
and low-level control local to the robot.

*Yan Rui Tan,Wenqi Liu,Wai Lun Leong,John Guan Zhong Tan,Wayne Wen Huei Yong,Fan Shi,Rodney Swee Huat Teo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hybrid GO-Flock system blends perception-guided planning with an APF-based controller to enable robust flocking in cluttered environments, validated in simulations and hardware-in-the-loop with nine drones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: APF flocking suffers from deadlocks and local minima in the presence of obstacles; purely reactive or passive approaches often fail to navigate efficiently in cluttered, real-world settings, motivating an integrated planning-and-control solution.

Method: GO-Flock introduces an upstream Perception Module that processes depth maps to extract waypoints and virtual agents for obstacle avoidance, and a downstream Collective Navigation Module that applies a novel APF strategy to achieve cohesive flocking; evaluation compares GO-Flock to passive APF-based methods, and experiments include obstacle-rich simulations and hardware-in-the-loop tests with nine drones (six physical, three virtual) in a forest. 

Result: GO-Flock demonstrates improved flocking behavior and the ability to overcome local minima in cluttered environments, outperforming passive APF approaches, with successful realization in obstacle-filled scenarios and forest hardware-in-the-loop experiments.

Conclusion: A hybrid planning-APF framework provides robust, scalable multi-robot flocking in cluttered environments and is validated through obstacle-rich simulations and hardware-in-the-loop tests, suggesting strong practical applicability for real-world multi-robot coordination.

Abstract: Artificial Potential Field (APF) methods are widely used for reactive
flocking control, but they often suffer from challenges such as deadlocks and
local minima, especially in the presence of obstacles. Existing solutions to
address these issues are typically passive, leading to slow and inefficient
collective navigation. As a result, many APF approaches have only been
validated in obstacle-free environments or simplified, pseudo 3D simulations.
This paper presents GO-Flock, a hybrid flocking framework that integrates
planning with reactive APF-based control. GO-Flock consists of an upstream
Perception Module, which processes depth maps to extract waypoints and virtual
agents for obstacle avoidance, and a downstream Collective Navigation Module,
which applies a novel APF strategy to achieve effective flocking behavior in
cluttered environments. We evaluate GO-Flock against passive APF-based
approaches to demonstrate their respective merits, such as their flocking
behavior and the ability to overcome local minima. Finally, we validate
GO-Flock through obstacle-filled environment and also hardware-in-the-loop
experiments where we successfully flocked a team of nine drones, six physical
and three virtual, in a forest environment.

*Taeyeop Lee,Gyuree Kang,Bowen Wen,Youngho Kim,Seunghyeok Back,In So Kweon,David Hyunchul Shim,Kuk-Jin Yoon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DeLTa enables precise, long-horizon manipulation of transparent objects guided by natural language and a single demonstration, using depth estimation, 6D pose estimation, and vision-language planning, with a planner to account for an eye-in-hand robot; it outperforms prior methods on long-horizon tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transparent object manipulation is hard due to visibility and material properties, and existing methods struggle to generalize to novel objects or perform long-horizon, precise tasks without extensive training or priors.

Method: A framework (DeLTa) that integrates depth estimation, 6D pose estimation, and vision-language planning. It uses a single demonstration to generalize 6D trajectories to novel transparent objects without category priors or extra training. A task planner refines plans from a vision-language model to suit a single-arm, eye-in-hand robot for long-horizon manipulation.

Result: Comprehensive evaluation shows DeLTa significantly outperforms existing transparent object manipulation approaches, especially in long-horizon scenarios requiring precise manipulation capabilities.

Conclusion: DeLTa enables generalizable, language-guided long-horizon manipulation of transparent objects from a single demonstration, reducing the need for category priors and additional training, and providing a practical planning layer for real-world robotic systems.

Abstract: Despite the prevalence of transparent object interactions in human everyday
life, transparent robotic manipulation research remains limited to
short-horizon tasks and basic grasping capabilities.Although some methods have
partially addressed these issues, most of them have limitations in
generalizability to novel objects and are insufficient for precise long-horizon
robot manipulation. To address this limitation, we propose DeLTa (Demonstration
and Language-Guided Novel Transparent Object Manipulation), a novel framework
that integrates depth estimation, 6D pose estimation, and vision-language
planning for precise long-horizon manipulation of transparent objects guided by
natural task instructions. A key advantage of our method is its
single-demonstration approach, which generalizes 6D trajectories to novel
transparent objects without requiring category-level priors or additional
training. Additionally, we present a task planner that refines the
VLM-generated plan to account for the constraints of a single-arm, eye-in-hand
robot for long-horizon object manipulation tasks. Through comprehensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
transparent object manipulation approaches, particularly in long-horizon
scenarios requiring precise manipulation capabilities. Project page:

### [142] [Verifier-free Test-Time Sampling for Vision Language Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05681)
*Suhyeok Jang,Dongyoung Kim,Changyeon Kim,Youngsuk Kim,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MG-Select is a no-external-module test-time scaling method for Vision-Language-Action models that uses KL divergence to a reference distribution (created by randomly masked inputs) to select the best action among candidates. It adds a joint training step with dropout to learn both conditional and unconditional distributions, improving robustness without requiring extra training or verifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome precision gaps in VLAs caused by single-inference constraints and reliance on external verifiers. The goal is to enable reliable, high-precision action selection at test time using internal model properties, with minimal additional training or components.

Method: Generate multiple candidate actions from a VLA, compute KL divergence between each candidate's action-token distribution and a reference distribution produced by the VLA with randomly masked states and language conditions. Select the candidate with the lowest KL divergence. The reference distribution is designed to maximize uncertainty while staying aligned with the task. Additionally, apply dropout to state and language inputs during training to enable the model to learn both conditional and unconditional distributions (joint training).

Result: MG-Select yields substantial improvements: 28% improvement in real-world in-distribution tasks and 35% in real-world out-of-distribution tasks; a 168% relative gain on RoboCasa pick-and-place tasks trained with 30 demonstrations.

Conclusion: MG-Select provides an effective, training- and verifier-free approach to test-time scaling for VLAs, enhancing precision and generalization by using an internal confidence metric and a joint, dropout-based training strategy.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
in robot control. However, they remain fundamentally limited in tasks that
require high precision due to their single-inference paradigm. While test-time
scaling approaches using external verifiers have shown promise, they require
additional training and fail to generalize to unseen conditions. We propose
Masking Distribution Guided Selection (MG-Select), a novel test-time scaling
framework for VLAs that leverages the model's internal properties without
requiring additional training or external modules. Our approach utilizes KL
divergence from a reference action token distribution as a confidence metric
for selecting the optimal action from multiple candidates. We introduce a
reference distribution generated by the same VLA but with randomly masked
states and language conditions as inputs, ensuring maximum uncertainty while
remaining aligned with the target task distribution. Additionally, we propose a
joint training strategy that enables the model to learn both conditional and
unconditional distributions by applying dropout to state and language
conditions, thereby further improving the quality of the reference
distribution. Our experiments demonstrate that MG-Select achieves significant
performance improvements, including a 28%/35% improvement in real-world
in-distribution/out-of-distribution tasks, along with a 168% relative gain on
RoboCasa pick-and-place tasks trained with 30 demonstrations.

*Yuhang Zhang,Jiaping Xiao,Chao Yan,Mir Feroskhan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OMC-RL decouples representation learning and policy learning using a masked Transformer with temporal modeling and contrastive learning for robust visuomotor representations, plus an oracle teacher guiding early policy learning to boost sample efficiency and asymptotic performance; demonstrates improved performance and generalization in sim and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce sample inefficiency and sim-to-real gap in visuomotor RL by learning temporally-aware, task-relevant representations and providing structured early guidance.

Method: Two-stage framework: (1) upstream representation learning with a masked Transformer trained on temporal and contrastive objectives; encoder frozen after training; (2) downstream policy learning guided by an oracle policy with privileged global state information during early training, gradually reducing guidance to enable autonomous exploration.

Result: Empirical results show superior sample efficiency and better asymptotic performance, with improved generalization across diverse, perceptually complex scenarios in both simulated and real environments.

Conclusion: Decoupling representation learning from policy learning and using oracle-guided supervision in early training yields practical gains in visuomotor RL, enabling more data-efficient learning and robust performance transfer.

Abstract: A prevailing approach for learning visuomotor policies is to employ
reinforcement learning to map high-dimensional visual observations directly to
action commands. However, the combination of high-dimensional visual inputs and
agile maneuver outputs leads to long-standing challenges, including low sample
efficiency and significant sim-to-real gaps. To address these issues, we
propose Oracle-Guided Masked Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (OMC-RL), a
novel framework designed to improve the sample efficiency and asymptotic
performance of visuomotor policy learning. OMC-RL explicitly decouples the
learning process into two stages: an upstream representation learning stage and
a downstream policy learning stage. In the upstream stage, a masked Transformer
module is trained with temporal modeling and contrastive learning to extract
temporally-aware and task-relevant representations from sequential visual
inputs. After training, the learned encoder is frozen and used to extract
visual representations from consecutive frames, while the Transformer module is
discarded. In the downstream stage, an oracle teacher policy with privileged
access to global state information supervises the agent during early training
to provide informative guidance and accelerate early policy learning. This
guidance is gradually reduced to allow independent exploration as training
progresses. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world environments
demonstrate that OMC-RL achieves superior sample efficiency and asymptotic
policy performance, while also improving generalization across diverse and
perceptually complex scenarios.

*David Boetius,Abdelrahman Abdelnaby,Ashok Kumar,Stefan Leue,Abdalla Swikir,Fares J. Abu-Dakka*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework for learning stable dynamical systems on Riemannian manifolds using neural ODEs that enforces Lyapunov stability by projecting the learned vector field, enabling stable trajectories on manifolds; validated on S^3, SPD manifolds, and R^3 x S^3 with simulations and real robot experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending stability guarantees to trajectories on manifolds is challenging due to geometric constraints; conventional Euclidean stability does not transfer directly; need methods ensuring stability on curved spaces for safe robot motion.

Method: Learn a base vector field and a Lyapunov function with neural networks; evolve trajectories directly on the manifold via neural ODEs; project the vector field so that the Lyapunov function decreases strictly along trajectories (Lyapunov stability criterion satisfied); training strategy to optimize both fields and enforce stability; apply to Riemannian LASA datasets on S^3 (unit quaternions) and SPD manifolds, and robotic motion on R^3 × S^3.

Result: Demonstrates stability guarantees on manifold trajectories; shows accurate representation of complex trajectories; scalable; effective on both synthetic datasets and real robot experiments; outperforms or matches baselines while respecting manifold constraints.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a general, scalable approach to learning stable dynamical systems on manifolds, enabling safe, reliable motion planning in robotic applications with non-Euclidean state spaces; future work could extend to more manifolds and broader tasks.

Abstract: Learning stable dynamical systems from data is crucial for safe and reliable
robot motion planning and control. However, extending stability guarantees to
trajectories defined on Riemannian manifolds poses significant challenges due
to the manifold's geometric constraints. To address this, we propose a general
framework for learning stable dynamical systems on Riemannian manifolds using
neural ordinary differential equations. Our method guarantees stability by
projecting the neural vector field evolving on the manifold so that it strictly
satisfies the Lyapunov stability criterion, ensuring stability at every system
state. By leveraging a flexible neural parameterisation for both the base
vector field and the Lyapunov function, our framework can accurately represent
complex trajectories while respecting manifold constraints by evolving
solutions directly on the manifold. We provide an efficient training strategy
for applying our framework and demonstrate its utility by solving Riemannian
LASA datasets on the unit quaternion (S^3) and symmetric positive-definite
matrix manifolds, as well as robotic motions evolving on \mathbb{R}^3 \times
S^3. We demonstrate the performance, scalability, and practical applicability
of our approach through extensive simulations and by learning robot motions in
a real-world experiment.

Abstract: Federated split learning (FedSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
enabling collaborative intelligence in industrial Internet of Things (IoT)
systems, particularly in smart factories where data privacy, communication
efficiency, and device heterogeneity are critical concerns. In this article, we
present a comprehensive study of FedSL frameworks tailored for
resource-constrained robots in industrial scenarios. We compare synchronous,
asynchronous, hierarchical, and heterogeneous FedSL frameworks in terms of
workflow, scalability, adaptability, and limitations under dynamic industrial
conditions. Furthermore, we systematically categorize token fusion strategies
into three paradigms: input-level (pre-fusion), intermediate-level
(intra-fusion), and output-level (post-fusion), and summarize their respective
strengths in industrial applications. We also provide adaptive optimization
techniques to enhance the efficiency and feasibility of FedSL implementation,
including model compression, split layer selection, computing frequency
allocation, and wireless resource management. Simulation results validate the
performance of these frameworks under industrial detection scenarios. Finally,
we outline open issues and research directions of FedSL in future smart

*Marc Kaufeld,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Two semi-analytic, real-time collision-probability estimators for autonomous driving under uncertainty, using spatial overlap and stochastic boundary crossing, validated against Monte Carlo, open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deterministic collision checks are unreliable under perception, localization, and prediction uncertainties; probabilistic risk estimation is needed for safe, risk-aware planning.

Method: Two semi-analytic formulations for collision probability with arbitrary convex obstacles under full state uncertainty (position, orientation, velocity). 1) probability of spatial overlap between vehicle and obstacles; 2) probability via stochastic boundary crossings. Suitable for real-time planning and accommodating full state uncertainty; implemented for open-source use.

Result: Collision probabilities closely match Monte Carlo results with significant runtime advantages, validated through simulations, enabling efficient risk-aware trajectory planning.

Conclusion: The methods provide efficient, accurate probabilistic collision risk estimates under uncertainty, suitable for integration into autonomous driving planners; open-source availability facilitates adoption and further development.

Abstract: This research introduces two efficient methods to estimate the collision risk
of planned trajectories in autonomous driving under uncertain driving
conditions. Deterministic collision checks of planned trajectories are often
inaccurate or overly conservative, as noisy perception, localization errors,
and uncertain predictions of other traffic participants introduce significant
uncertainty into the planning process. This paper presents two semi-analytic
methods to compute the collision probability of planned trajectories with
arbitrary convex obstacles. The first approach evaluates the probability of
spatial overlap between an autonomous vehicle and surrounding obstacles, while
the second estimates the collision probability based on stochastic boundary
crossings. Both formulations incorporate full state uncertainties, including
position, orientation, and velocity, and achieve high accuracy at computational
costs suitable for real-time planning. Simulation studies verify that the
proposed methods closely match Monte Carlo results while providing significant
runtime advantages, enabling their use in risk-aware trajectory planning. The
collision estimation methods are available as open-source software:

*Andreas Christou,Andreas Sochopoulos,Elliot Lister,Sethu Vijayakumar*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A study tests human-in-the-loop optimization (HILO) with CMA-ES to personalize gait-assist exoskeleton stiffness, but finds convergence to individual-specific values yet no clear performance gains, underscoring challenges from human–robot co-adaptation and gait variability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address substantial inter- and intra-personal gait variability by evaluating whether CMA-ES-based HILO can provide truly personalized assistance in exoskeleton-assisted gait rehabilitation.

Method: Six healthy participants used a CMA-ES to continuously optimize an assist-as-needed lower-limb exoskeleton controller over two days; performance during validation trials was assessed to gauge benefit of personalization.

Result: CMA-ES converged to a unique stiffness set for each participant, but there was no measurable improvement in gait performance during validation; human behavior variability and co-adaptation may offset personalization benefits.

Conclusion: Current personalization approaches in exoskeleton gait rehabilitation face limitations due to human variability and co-adaptation; significant challenges remain for effectively implementing HILO in this domain.

Abstract: Wearable robots offer a promising solution for quantitatively monitoring gait
and providing systematic, adaptive assistance to promote patient independence
and improve gait. However, due to significant interpersonal and intrapersonal
variability in walking patterns, it is important to design robot controllers
that can adapt to the unique characteristics of each individual. This paper
investigates the potential of human-in-the-loop optimisation (HILO) to deliver
personalised assistance in gait training. The Covariance Matrix Adaptation
Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) was employed to continuously optimise an
assist-as-needed controller of a lower-limb exoskeleton. Six healthy
individuals participated over a two-day experiment. Our results suggest that
while the CMA-ES appears to converge to a unique set of stiffnesses for each
individual, no measurable impact on the subjects' performance was observed
during the validation trials. These findings highlight the impact of
human-robot co-adaptation and human behaviour variability, whose effect may be
greater than potential benefits of personalising rule-based assistive
controllers. Our work contributes to understanding the limitations of current
personalisation approaches in exoskeleton-assisted gait rehabilitation and
identifies key challenges for effective implementation of human-in-the-loop
optimisation in this domain.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An end-to-end grasp foundation model with visual chain-of-thought (VCoT-Grasp) and a large-scale dataset (VCoT-GraspSet) that improves grasp success and generalization in clutter, by using multi-turn reasoning and interpretable traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current grasp models struggle with reasoning and generalization in cluttered environments and often rely on modular pipelines or overemphasize scene semantics, hindering robust multi-object grasping.

Method: Propose VCoT-Grasp, an end-to-end model that uses visual chain-of-thought reasoning in a multi-turn processing paradigm to dynamically attend to visual inputs and produce interpretable reasoning traces. Train on a refined large-scale dataset VCoT-GraspSet (167K synthetic images with over 1.36M grasps; 400+ real-world images with >1.2K grasps) annotated with intermediate bounding boxes.

Result: Experiments on both VCoT-GraspSet and real robots show significantly higher grasp success rates and better generalization to unseen objects, backgrounds, and distractors compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Visual chain-of-thought for grasp generation is viable and beneficial; the VCoT-Grasp framework, together with the VCoT-GraspSet dataset, advances reasoning-enabled grasping and offers resources for future research.

Abstract: Robotic grasping is one of the most fundamental tasks in robotic
manipulation, and grasp detection/generation has long been the subject of
extensive research. Recently, language-driven grasp generation has emerged as a
promising direction due to its practical interaction capabilities. However,
most existing approaches either lack sufficient reasoning and generalization
capabilities or depend on complex modular pipelines. Moreover, current grasp
foundation models tend to overemphasize dialog and object semantics, resulting
in inferior performance and restriction to single-object grasping. To maintain
strong reasoning ability and generalization in cluttered environments, we
propose VCoT-Grasp, an end-to-end grasp foundation model that incorporates
visual chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance visual understanding for grasp
generation. VCoT-Grasp adopts a multi-turn processing paradigm that dynamically
focuses on visual inputs while providing interpretable reasoning traces. For
training, we refine and introduce a large-scale dataset, VCoT-GraspSet,
comprising 167K synthetic images with over 1.36M grasps, as well as 400+
real-world images with more than 1.2K grasps, annotated with intermediate
bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on both VCoT-GraspSet and real robot
demonstrate that our method significantly improves grasp success rates and
generalizes effectively to unseen objects, backgrounds, and distractors. More

### [149] [A Co-Design Framework for Energy-Aware Monoped Jumping with Detailed Actuator Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05923)
*Aman Singh,Aastha Mishra,Deepak Kapa,Suryank Joshi,Shishir Kolathaya*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A three-stage co-design framework for a monoped that jointly optimizes jump height and mechanical energy, including gearbox and realistic actuator mass models, producing CAD-ready designs; achieves 0.8 m jump height and 50% energy reduction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing co-design approaches often optimize either jump height or energy, ignore trade-offs, omit gearbox and realistic actuator mass modeling, and produce designs hard to fabricate. This work aims to provide a practical, manufacturable framework that balances performance and efficiency.

Method: A three-stage optimization framework that jointly designs mechanical structure (including gearbox), actuator models, and control parameters inside a unified, multi-objective optimization. It incorporates realistic actuator mass models, and outputs a parameterized CAD model suitable for direct fabrication.

Result: The method yields a 50% reduction in mechanical energy consumption compared with a baseline design while achieving a jump height of 0.8 m; outputs a CAD-ready design for fabrication.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates a practical, replicable co-design approach that simultaneously optimizes performance and energy, accounts for gearbox and actuator mass in realistic design, and streamlines fabrication through CAD model generation.

Abstract: A monoped's jump height and energy consumption depend on both, its mechanical
design and control strategy. Existing co-design frameworks typically optimize
for either maximum height or minimum energy, neglecting their trade-off. They
also often omit gearbox parameter optimization and use oversimplified actuator
mass models, producing designs difficult to replicate in practice. In this
work, we introduce a novel three-stage co-design optimization framework that
jointly maximizes jump height while minimizing mechanical energy consumption of
a monoped. The proposed method explicitly incorporates realistic actuator mass
models and optimizes mechanical design (including gearbox) and control
parameters within a unified framework. The resulting design outputs are then
used to automatically generate a parameterized CAD model suitable for direct
fabrication, significantly reducing manual design iterations. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate a 50 percent reduction in mechanical energy consumption
compared to the baseline design, while achieving a jump height of 0.8m. Video

### [150] [Learning to Crawl: Latent Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Soft Robotic Adaptive Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05957)
*Vaughn Gzenda,Robin Chhabra*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A model-based RL approach that learns latent dynamics from onboard sensors to guide an actor-critic policy for soft crawler locomotion; demonstrated in simulation with IMU and ToF observations, enabling short-horizon prediction and adaptive gaits under noisy feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Soft robotic locomotion is hard to control due to model inaccuracies, sensor noise, and the need to discover locomotor gaits. Leveraging latent dynamics inferred from sensors can provide a compact, predictive model to guide policy learning in a robust way.

Method: Infer latent dynamics from onboard sensor data to form a predictive model that drives an actor-critic RL algorithm. Validation on a minimal soft crawler model in simulation using IMU and ToF sensors as observations; the latent dynamics support short-horizon motion prediction and help discover locomotor policies.

Result: The latent dynamics enable short-horizon motion prediction and facilitate the discovery of effective locomotor policies by the actor-critic algorithm. The framework demonstrates potential for embodied soft robotic adaptive locomotion using noisy sensor feedback.

Conclusion: Model-based RL with latent dynamics is a promising approach for robust, adaptive locomotion in soft robots under sensory uncertainty. Future work could extend to more complex morphologies, hardware experiments, and richer sensor suites.

Abstract: Soft robotic crawlers are mobile robots that utilize soft body deformability
and compliance to achieve locomotion through surface contact. Designing control
strategies for such systems is challenging due to model inaccuracies, sensor
noise, and the need to discover locomotor gaits. In this work, we present a
model-based reinforcement learning (MB-RL) framework in which latent dynamics
inferred from onboard sensors serve as a predictive model that guides an
actor-critic algorithm to optimize locomotor policies. We evaluate the
framework on a minimal crawler model in simulation using inertial measurement
units and time-of-flight sensors as observations. The learned latent dynamics
enable short-horizon motion prediction while the actor-critic discovers
effective locomotor policies. This approach highlights the potential of
latent-dynamics MB-RL for enabling embodied soft robotic adaptive locomotion
based solely on noisy sensor feedback.

body. The design addresses critical challenges in long-distance traversal
missions by protecting sensitive components from thermal cycling, dust
contamination, and mechanical wear. A double wishbone suspension configuration
with cardan joints and capstan drive steering has been selected as the optimal
architecture following comprehensive trade-off analysis. The system enables
independent wheel traction, steering control, and suspension management whilst
maintaining all motorisation within the protected environment. The design meets

### [153] [Coordinate-Consistent Localization via Continuous-Time Calibration and Fusion of UWB and SLAM Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05992)
*Tien-Dat Nguyen,Thien-Minh Nguyen,Vinh-Hao Nguyen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A two-stage calibration/fusion framework aligns SLAM and UWB across runs: estimate fixed UWB anchors from one run, then fuse data in a sliding window to maintain a common frame; validated on NTU VIRAL UAV flights with code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLAM coordinate frames reset per run, while UWB anchors provide a global reference only if their coordinates are known; need a calibration method to combine the strengths across sessions.

Method: Stage 1: solve a continuous-time batch optimization with range and odometry from a full run, including height priors and anchor-to-anchor distance constraints to recover 3D anchor positions. Stage 2: apply sliding-window optimization across subsequent runs to fuse UWB and SLAM data, enabling consistent localization in the same coordinate system. Evaluations on the NTU VIRAL UAV dataset with six flight scenarios.

Result: Calibration from a single run suffices to achieve accurate localization across remaining runs; code released at https://github.com/ntdathp/slam-uwb-calibration.

Conclusion: The approach provides coordinate-wise consistency across multi-session operations by grounding SLAM in a known-UWB frame, enabling robust, repeatable localization in the same environment and offering open-source implementation for community use.

Abstract: Onboard simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methods are commonly
used to provide accurate localization information for autonomous robots.
However, the coordinate origin of SLAM estimate often resets for each run. On
the other hand, UWB-based localization with fixed anchors can ensure a
consistent coordinate reference across sessions; however, it requires an
accurate assignment of the anchor nodes' coordinates. To this end, we propose a
two-stage approach that calibrates and fuses UWB data and SLAM data to achieve
coordinate-wise consistent and accurate localization in the same environment.
In the first stage, we solve a continuous-time batch optimization problem by
using the range and odometry data from one full run, incorporating height
priors and anchor-to-anchor distance factors to recover the anchors' 3D
positions. For the subsequent runs in the second stage, a sliding-window
optimization scheme fuses the UWB and SLAM data, which facilitates accurate
localization in the same coordinate system. Experiments are carried out on the
NTU VIRAL dataset with six scenarios of UAV flight, and we show that
calibration using data in one run is sufficient to enable accurate localization
in the remaining runs. We release our source code to benefit the community at
https://github.com/ntdathp/slam-uwb-calibration.

### [154] [Cross-Embodiment Dexterous Hand Articulation Generation via Morphology-Aware Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06068)
*Heng Zhang,Kevin Yuchen Ma,Mike Zheng Shou,Weisi Lin,Yan Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: End-to-end eigengrasp-based framework enabling cross-embodiment dexterous grasping by learning a low-dimensional articulation space from hand morphology, with fast inference and strong generalization to unseen hands/objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalizing dexterous grasping across different hand morphologies is hard because articulations are high-dimensional and most end-to-end methods require large, hand-specific datasets, limiting cross-embodiment transfer.

Method: From hand morphology description derive a morphology embedding and an eigengrasp set. Condition an amplitude predictor on morphology embedding, eigengrasp set, object point cloud, and wrist pose to regress low-dimensional articulation coefficients, which are decoded into full joint articulations. Train with a Kinematic-Aware Articulation Loss (KAL) that emphasizes fingertip-relevant motions and morphology-specific structure. Evaluate in simulation across unseen objects and three dexterous hands; perform few-shot adaptation to unseen hand; conduct real-world tests.

Result: Achieves 91.9% average grasp success rate in simulation with less than 0.4 s per grasp. With few-shot adaptation to an unseen hand, reaches 85.6% success on unseen objects in simulation and 87% success in real-world tests.

Conclusion: Demonstrates cross-embodiment dexterous grasping by learning a low-dimensional, morphology-informed articulation space, enabling fast inference and generalization to unseen hands and objects with reduced data requirements; code will be released.

Abstract: Dexterous grasping with multi-fingered hands remains challenging due to
high-dimensional articulations and the cost of optimization-based pipelines.
Existing end-to-end methods require training on large-scale datasets for
specific hands, limiting their ability to generalize across different
embodiments. We propose an eigengrasp-based, end-to-end framework for
cross-embodiment grasp generation. From a hand's morphology description, we
derive a morphology embedding and an eigengrasp set. Conditioned on these,
together with the object point cloud and wrist pose, an amplitude predictor
regresses articulation coefficients in a low-dimensional space, which are
decoded into full joint articulations. Articulation learning is supervised with
a Kinematic-Aware Articulation Loss (KAL) that emphasizes fingertip-relevant
motions and injects morphology-specific structure. In simulation on unseen
objects across three dexterous hands, our model attains a 91.9% average grasp
success rate with less than 0.4 seconds inference per grasp. With few-shot
adaptation to an unseen hand, it achieves 85.6% success on unseen objects in
simulation, and real-world experiments on this few-shot generalized hand
achieve an 87% success rate. The code and additional materials will be made
available upon publication on our project website

*Roman Ibrahimov,Jannik Matthias Heinen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Bioinspired distributed optimization for multi-robot exploration and 2D mapping using tactile collision logging; decentralized control; simulated validation with e-puck robots showing high coverage, low collisions, and accurate maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable, robust exploration and mapping of unknown environments. Centralized planners struggle with coordination and real-time constraints; inspiration from wall-following and roach antenna guides tactile sensing. Logging collisions instead of avoiding obstacles aims to improve coverage and task allocation in multi-robot systems for applications needing quick situational awareness.

Method: Distributed optimization-based coordination where each robot builds a local map and fuses it into a global 2D map. Wall-following-inspired tactile sensing (antenna-like sensor) guides exploration; robots log collision points with obstacles rather than strictly avoiding them. The approach emphasizes decentralized control for efficient task allocation and exploration. Validation conducted in a simulated 1.5 x 1.5 m environment with three obstacles using e-puck robots.

Result: Demonstrated high coverage of the area, reduced collision rates, and accurate reconstruction of the environment in the global 2D map.

Conclusion: A decentralized framework combining distributed optimization with tactile sensing enables efficient exploration and accurate mapping of unknown environments. Effective for applications in search and rescue, industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. Validation in simulation supports feasibility, with potential for real-world extension.

Abstract: This project proposes a bioinspired multi-robot system using Distributed
Optimization for efficient exploration and mapping of unknown environments.
Each robot explores its environment and creates a map, which is afterwards put
together to form a global 2D map of the environment. Inspired by wall-following
behaviors, each robot autonomously explores its neighborhood based on a tactile
sensor, similar to the antenna of a cockroach, mounted on the surface of the
robot. Instead of avoiding obstacles, robots log collision points when they
touch obstacles. This decentralized control strategy ensures effective task
allocation and efficient exploration of unknown terrains, with applications in
search and rescue, industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. The
approach was validated through experiments using e-puck robots in a simulated
1.5 x 1.5 m environment with three obstacles. The results demonstrated the
system's effectiveness in achieving high coverage, minimizing collisions, and
constructing accurate 2D maps.

*Xiao Liang,Lu Shen,Peihan Zhang,Soofiyan Atar,Florian Richter,Michael Yip*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Autonomous robotic framework for wound care tape manipulation focusing on detachment and placement, using force-feedback imitation learning for detachment and trajectory optimization for placement; validated experimentally and in wound-care pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chronic wounds affect millions and incur high costs; current care is labor-intensive and safety-critical; automating tape manipulation could reduce costs and improve outcomes.

Method: For tape initial detachment (TID), force-feedback imitation learning trained from human teleoperation demonstrations. For tape placement, numerical trajectory optimization to ensure smooth adhesion and wrinkle-free application across diverse anatomical surfaces.

Result: Extensive experiments show reliable performance in both quantitative evaluations and integrated wound redressing pipelines.

Conclusion: Demonstrates tape manipulation as a foundational capability for practical robotic wound care automation; supports potential cost reductions and improved patient outcomes; groundwork for broader automated wound care tasks.

Abstract: Chronic wounds, such as diabetic, pressure, and venous ulcers, affect over
6.5 million patients in the United States alone and generate an annual cost
exceeding \$25 billion. Despite this burden, chronic wound care remains a
routine yet manual process performed exclusively by trained clinicians due to
its critical safety demands. We envision a future in which robotics and
automation support wound care to lower costs and enhance patient outcomes. This
paper introduces an autonomous framework for one of the most fundamental yet
challenging subtasks in wound redressing: adhesive tape manipulation.
Specifically, we address two critical capabilities: tape initial detachment
(TID) and secure tape placement. To handle the complex adhesive dynamics of
detachment, we propose a force-feedback imitation learning approach trained
from human teleoperation demonstrations. For tape placement, we develop a
numerical trajectory optimization method based to ensure smooth adhesion and
wrinkle-free application across diverse anatomical surfaces. We validate these
methods through extensive experiments, demonstrating reliable performance in
both quantitative evaluations and integrated wound redressing pipelines. Our
results establish tape manipulation as an essential step toward practical
robotic wound care automation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Vision-guided robotic pollination using 3D plant reconstruction, obstacle-aware grasp planning, and physics-based vibration; achieves 92.5% main-stem grasping and safe pollination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controlled agriculture lacks wind-driven pollination and has regulatory limits on commercial pollinators, making manual labor expensive and limited; automation is needed for precise, safe pollination.

Method: Use end-effector RGB-D data to reconstruct the plant in 3D and register it to the robot frame; identify obstacle-free grasp poses along the main stem; apply a discrete elastic rod model to relate actuation to flower dynamics; use a soft-gripper manipulator to grasp the stem and apply controlled vibrations to release pollen.

Result: End-to-end experiments report a 92.5% main-stem grasping success rate; simulation-guided optimization of vibration parameters validates feasible pollen release without damaging flowers.

Conclusion: First robotic system to jointly integrate vision-based grasping and vibration modeling for automated precision pollination.

Abstract: Robotic pollination offers a promising alternative to manual labor and
bumblebee-assisted methods in controlled agriculture, where wind-driven
pollination is absent and regulatory restrictions limit the use of commercial
pollinators. In this work, we present and validate a vision-guided robotic
framework that uses data from an end-effector mounted RGB-D sensor and combines
3D plant reconstruction, targeted grasp planning, and physics-based vibration
modeling to enable precise pollination. First, the plant is reconstructed in 3D
and registered to the robot coordinate frame to identify obstacle-free grasp
poses along the main stem. Second, a discrete elastic rod model predicts the
relationship between actuation parameters and flower dynamics, guiding the
selection of optimal pollination strategies. Finally, a manipulator with soft
grippers grasps the stem and applies controlled vibrations to induce pollen
release. End-to-end experiments demonstrate a 92.5\% main-stem grasping success
rate, and simulation-guided optimization of vibration parameters further
validates the feasibility of our approach, ensuring that the robot can safely
and effectively perform pollination without damaging the flower. To our
knowledge, this is the first robotic system to jointly integrate vision-based
grasping and vibration modeling for automated precision pollination.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A model-based robotic hair-care system (DYMO-Hair) uses action-conditioned latent state editing and a 3D latent hairstyle space, trained via a hair physics simulator, enabling zero-shot transfer and improved styling on unseen hairstyles with MPPI planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hair dynamics are highly complex and fine-grained, making autonomous hair manipulation difficult. Generalizing hair styling to unseen hairstyles requires scalable, learnable dynamics and planners.

Method: Introduce a dynamics learning paradigm for volumetric hair, with action-conditioned latent state editing and a compact 3D latent space of diverse hairstyles pre-trained at scale using a novel hair physics simulator. Use a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) planner for visual goal-conditioned hair styling, evaluated in simulation and real wigs.

Result: In simulation, the dynamics model better captures local deformation for unseen hairstyles; in closed-loop tasks, DYMO-Hair achieves 22% lower final geometric error and 42% higher success rate than the state-of-the-art. Real-world experiments show zero-shot transfer to wigs with consistent success on challenging unseen hairstyles where baselines fail.

Conclusion: DYMO-Hair establishes a foundation for generalizable, flexible, and accessible model-based robot hair care in unconstrained environments, enabled by scalable, pre-trained hair physics dynamics for unseen hairstyles; project page available.

Abstract: Hair care is an essential daily activity, yet it remains inaccessible to
individuals with limited mobility and challenging for autonomous robot systems
due to the fine-grained physical structure and complex dynamics of hair. In
this work, we present DYMO-Hair, a model-based robot hair care system. We
introduce a novel dynamics learning paradigm that is suited for volumetric
quantities such as hair, relying on an action-conditioned latent state editing
mechanism, coupled with a compact 3D latent space of diverse hairstyles to
improve generalizability. This latent space is pre-trained at scale using a
novel hair physics simulator, enabling generalization across previously unseen
hairstyles. Using the dynamics model with a Model Predictive Path Integral
(MPPI) planner, DYMO-Hair is able to perform visual goal-conditioned hair
styling. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that DYMO-Hair's dynamics model
outperforms baselines on capturing local deformation for diverse, unseen
hairstyles. DYMO-Hair further outperforms baselines in closed-loop hair styling
tasks on unseen hairstyles, with an average of 22% lower final geometric error
and 42% higher success rate than the state-of-the-art system. Real-world
experiments exhibit zero-shot transferability of our system to wigs, achieving
consistent success on challenging unseen hairstyles where the state-of-the-art
system fails. Together, these results introduce a foundation for model-based
robot hair care, advancing toward more generalizable, flexible, and accessible
robot hair styling in unconstrained physical environments. More details are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current robotics approaches struggle to scale across diverse environments due to reliance on large annotated datasets or fixed primitives, limiting interpretability and adaptability.

Method: Ground high-level instructions in code using coding models to parameterize object geometry and synthesize manipulation trajectories, without additional data collection or fine-tuning (training-free).

Result: Real-robot experiments show robust performance across diverse long-term tasks and generalization to novel objects and environments.

Conclusion: Offers an interpretable, generalizable bridge between perception and manipulation, moving beyond fixed primitives toward versatile robot intelligence.

Abstract: Recent advances in control robot methods, from end-to-end
vision-language-action frameworks to modular systems with predefined
primitives, have advanced robots' ability to follow natural language
instructions. Nonetheless, many approaches still struggle to scale to diverse
environments, as they often rely on large annotated datasets and offer limited

### [161] [A Fuzzy Logic-Based Framework for Explainable Machine Learning in Big Data Analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05120)
*Farjana Yesmin,Nusrat Shirmin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an intrinsically explainable, fair unsupervised framework by fusing type-2 fuzzy clustering, granular computing, and rule-based XAI; demonstrates improved cohesion and fairness on the UCI Air Quality dataset with scalable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing demand for interpretable and fair ML in big data analytics due to trust, ethics, and regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR). Black-box models and post-hoc XAI often trade interpretability for accuracy; unsupervised methods lack intrinsic explanations and fairness controls.

Method: Develop a type-2 fuzzy clustering framework enhanced by granular computing; integrate fairness measures within unsupervised clustering; incorporate a rule-based intrinsic XAI component yielding linguistic rules and higher interpretability; evaluate on UCI Air Quality data with metrics like silhouette, entropy, coverage, and runtime.

Result: Silhouette improved by about 4% (0.365 vs 0.349); fairness measured by entropy 0.918; average coverage 0.65; linear runtime around 0.005 seconds for sampled big data; outperforms DBSCAN and Agglomerative in interpretability, fairness, and efficiency; unbiasedness improved in unsupervised settings.

Conclusion: The framework delivers intrinsically explainable, fair, and scalable clustering for big data, enhancing trust and regulatory compliance while providing competitive or superior performance to standard baselines.

Abstract: The growing complexity of machine learning (ML) models in big data analytics,
especially in domains such as environmental monitoring, highlights the critical
need for interpretability and explainability to promote trust, ethical
considerations, and regulatory adherence (e.g., GDPR). Traditional "black-box"
models obstruct transparency, whereas post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) techniques
like LIME and SHAP frequently compromise accuracy or fail to deliver inherent
insights. This paper presents a novel framework that combines type-2 fuzzy
sets, granular computing, and clustering to boost explainability and fairness
in big data environments. When applied to the UCI Air Quality dataset, the
framework effectively manages uncertainty in noisy sensor data, produces
linguistic rules, and assesses fairness using silhouette scores and entropy.
Key contributions encompass: (1) A type-2 fuzzy clustering approach that
enhances cohesion by about 4% compared to type-1 methods (silhouette 0.365 vs.

### [162] [Auditing Algorithmic Bias in Transformer-Based Trading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05140)
*Armin Gerami,Ramani Duraiswami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Audits transformer-based finance models for reliance on volatility and frequency of price movements; finds no sensitivity to volatility and a bias toward low-frequency price data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess potential risks and biases in transformer-based financial predictions, specifically how volatility and price-movement frequency influence decision-making.

Method: Train/apply a transformer for price prediction and introduce a Partial Information Decomposition (PID)–based metric to quantify the influence of each asset. Evaluate how volatility and frequency of price movements affect the model's decision-making and identify biased assets using PID.

Result: Two main findings: (1) the model disregards data volatility entirely; (2) the model is biased toward assets with lower-frequency price movements.

Conclusion: Transformer-based financial models may harbor undetected risk and bias due to neglecting volatility and favoring low-frequency data; robust auditing with information-theoretic metrics like PID is needed to ensure fair, volatility-aware predictions.

Abstract: Transformer models have become increasingly popular in financial
applications, yet their potential risk making and biases remain under-explored.
The purpose of this work is to audit the reliance of the model on volatile data
for decision-making, and quantify how the frequency of price movements affects
the model's prediction confidence. We employ a transformer model for
prediction, and introduce a metric based on Partial Information Decomposition
(PID) to measure the influence of each asset on the model's decision making.
Our analysis reveals two key observations: first, the model disregards data
volatility entirely, and second, it is biased toward data with lower-frequency
price movements.

*Abrar Shahid,Ibteeker Mahir Ishum,AKM Tahmidul Haque,M Sohel Rahman,A. B. M. Alim Al Islam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A controlled study using a custom OpenAI Gym environment to model adversarial reinforcement learning in network security with DQN-based attacker and defender in a zero-sum setting, showing defender observability and trap efficacy improve security; includes reproducible experiments and guidance for real-world transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how adversarial reinforcement learning can be used for autonomous defense and to examine attacker-defender co-evolution under realistic network conditions.

Method: Custom Gym environment simulating brute-force attacks, multi-port services, background traffic, progressive exploitation, IP evasion, honeypots, and multi-level rate limiting; DQN agents trained under zero-sum rewards; experiments varying trap detection, exploitation thresholds, and training regimens; includes reward shaping and training scheduling; 50k+ episodes; adaptive IP blocking and port controls; provides implementation details.

Result: Defender observability and trap effectiveness substantially raise barrier to attacks; reward shaping and training schedule are critical for stability; defender maintains strategic advantage across configurations, with stronger gains under complex defensive strategies; environment supports reproducibility.

Conclusion: The framework is suitable for studying autonomous defense, attacker-defender co-evolution, and transfer learning to real network security; complete details enable replication and future research.

Abstract: This paper presents a controlled study of adversarial reinforcement learning
in network security through a custom OpenAI Gym environment that models
brute-force attacks and reactive defenses on multi-port services. The
environment captures realistic security trade-offs including background traffic
noise, progressive exploitation mechanics, IP-based evasion tactics, honeypot
traps, and multi-level rate-limiting defenses. Competing attacker and defender
agents are trained using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) within a zero-sum reward
framework, where successful exploits yield large terminal rewards while
incremental actions incur small costs. Through systematic evaluation across
multiple configurations (varying trap detection probabilities, exploitation
difficulty thresholds, and training regimens), the results demonstrate that
defender observability and trap effectiveness create substantial barriers to
successful attacks. The experiments reveal that reward shaping and careful
training scheduling are critical for learning stability in this adversarial
setting. The defender consistently maintains strategic advantage across 50,000+
training episodes, with performance gains amplifying when exposed to complex
defensive strategies including adaptive IP blocking and port-specific controls.
Complete implementation details, reproducible hyperparameter configurations,
and architectural guidelines are provided to support future research in
adversarial RL for cybersecurity. The zero-sum formulation and realistic
operational constraints make this environment suitable for studying autonomous
defense systems, attacker-defender co-evolution, and transfer learning to
real-world network security scenarios.

### [164] [Generative Inverse Design: From Single Point Optimization to a Diverse Design Portfolio via Conditional Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05160)
*Muhammad Arif Hakimi Zamrai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A CVAE-based generative inverse design framework produces a diverse set of high-performing designs conditioned on a target objective, improving over a single SBO optimum in airfoil self-noise minimization: 256 designs with 94.1% validity, of which 77.2% surpass the SBO baseline's best.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Surrogate-based optimization (SBO) tends to converge to a single-point solution, limiting exploration of design space and potentially missing valuable alternative topologies. A generative, probabilistic approach can provide a portfolio of high-performing candidates and support multi-criteria decision-making, especially for complex, non-linear problems like airfoil self-noise reduction.

Method: Train a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to learn the probabilistic mapping between design parameters and performance, conditioned on a given performance objective. Use the CVAE to generate a diverse set of candidate designs, then evaluate them with a high-performing SBO baseline surrogate to identify superior performers.

Result: The CVAE generated 256 novel designs with a 94.1% validity rate. Among valid designs, 77.2% achieved superior performance compared to the single optimal design found by the SBO baseline.

Conclusion: Generative inverse design via CVAEs expands the engineering design space beyond a single optimum, yielding a diverse portfolio of high-quality designs and enabling more informed, multi-criteria decision-making.

Abstract: Inverse design, which seeks to find optimal parameters for a target output,
is a central challenge in engineering. Surrogate-based optimization (SBO) has
become a standard approach, yet it is fundamentally structured to converge to a
single-point solution, thereby limiting design space exploration and ignoring
potentially valuable alternative topologies. This paper presents a paradigm
shift from single-point optimization to generative inverse design. We introduce
a framework based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) that learns a
probabilistic mapping between a system's design parameters and its performance,
enabling the generation of a diverse portfolio of high-performing candidates
conditioned on a specific performance objective. We apply this methodology to
the complex, non-linear problem of minimizing airfoil self-noise, using a
high-performing SBO method from a prior benchmark study as a rigorous baseline.
The CVAE framework successfully generated 256 novel designs with a 94.1\%
validity rate. A subsequent surrogate-based evaluation revealed that 77.2\% of
these valid designs achieved superior performance compared to the single
optimal design found by the SBO baseline. This work demonstrates that the
generative approach not only discovers higher-quality solutions but also
provides a rich portfolio of diverse candidates, fundamentally enhancing the
engineering design process by enabling multi-criteria decision-making.

*Md Zahin Hossain George,Md Khorshed Alam,Md Tarek Hasan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A systematic literature review of ML in digital banking fraud detection finds supervised learning remains dominant for interpretability, unsupervised anomaly detection is increasingly used for novel fraud patterns, deep learning models address sequential data but face interpretability and real-time deployment challenges, and hybrid models offer superior adaptability and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To synthesize and evaluate how machine learning techniques are applied to fraud detection in digital banking, identify trends, methods, and practical challenges to guide researchers and practitioners.

Method: Systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines, aggregating evidence from 118 peer-reviewed studies and institutional reports; structured identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion processes.

Result: Supervised learning methods (e.g., decision trees, logistic regression, SVM) dominate due to interpretability and performance; unsupervised anomaly detection is increasingly adopted to handle novel fraud in highly imbalanced datasets; deep learning (RNNs, CNNs) models effectively capture sequential transaction data and complex fraud types but struggle with interpretability and real-time deployment; hybrid models combining supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning approaches show superior adaptability and detection accuracy.

Conclusion: Hybrid modeling approaches hold promise as convergent solutions for fraud detection in digital banking, but challenges remain in interpretability and real-time deployment of deep learning systems; future work should focus on integrated frameworks, operationalization, and addressing data imbalance and deployment constraints.

Abstract: This systematic literature review examines the role of machine learning in
fraud detection within digital banking, synthesizing evidence from 118
peer-reviewed studies and institutional reports. Following the PRISMA
guidelines, the review applied a structured identification, screening,
eligibility, and inclusion process to ensure methodological rigor and
transparency. The findings reveal that supervised learning methods, such as
decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines, remain the
dominant paradigm due to their interpretability and established performance,
while unsupervised anomaly detection approaches are increasingly adopted to
address novel fraud patterns in highly imbalanced datasets. Deep learning
architectures, particularly recurrent and convolutional neural networks, have
emerged as transformative tools capable of modeling sequential transaction data
and detecting complex fraud typologies, though challenges of interpretability
and real-time deployment persist. Hybrid models that combine supervised,
unsupervised, and deep learning strategies demonstrate superior adaptability
and detection accuracy, highlighting their potential as convergent solutions.

*Eric Jahns,Davi Moreno,Milan Stojkov,Michel A. Kinsy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a discretized QIF neuron for deep SNNs with analytically derived surrogate-gradient windows, yielding better performance than LIF baselines across standard vision benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LIF neurons offer simplicity but limit expressive dynamics; QIF provides richer nonlinear dynamics but has training instability. A discretized, trainable QIF model could combine expressiveness with scalable performance in deep SNNs.

Method: Introduce the first discretization of the Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neuron for deep SNNs; derive an analytical formulation for surrogate-gradient windows directly from the discretization parameters to minimize gradient mismatch; implement and train deep SNNs using this QIF formulation and evaluate on standard benchmarks.

Result: The discretized QIF method outperforms state-of-the-art LIF-based methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS, demonstrating richer dynamics with practical scalability and training stability.

Conclusion: Discretized QIF neurons offer a compelling alternative to LIF in deep SNNs, achieving richer temporal dynamics without compromising scalability or trainability.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as energy-efficient alternatives
to traditional artificial neural networks, leveraging asynchronous and
biologically inspired neuron dynamics. Among existing neuron models, the Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron has become widely adopted in deep SNNs due to
its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, this efficiency comes at
the expense of expressiveness, as LIF dynamics are constrained to linear decay
at each timestep. In contrast, more complex models, such as the Quadratic
Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neuron, exhibit richer, nonlinear dynamics but have
seen limited adoption due to their training instability. On that note, we
propose the first discretization of the QIF neuron model tailored for
high-performance deep spiking neural networks and provide an in-depth analysis
of its dynamics. To ensure training stability, we derive an analytical
formulation for surrogate gradient windows directly from our discretizations'
parameter set, minimizing gradient mismatch. We evaluate our method on
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS, demonstrating its ability to
outperform state-of-the-art LIF-based methods. These results establish our
discretization of the QIF neuron as a compelling alternative to LIF neurons for
deep SNNs, combining richer dynamics with practical scalability.

*Haijin Xie,Gongquan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MADCN framework for predicting urban carbon emissions and analyzing tech factors; shows superior predictive accuracy and interpretable SHAP analysis across 275 Chinese cities; highlights NQPF, digital economy, and AI as impactful yet moderated factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Promote sustainable urban development by integrating new quality productive forces, digital economy, and AI into carbon reduction; address interpretability in complex feature interactions.

Method: Develop Multi-head Attention Deep & Cross Network (MADCN) to model feature interactions with attention; integrate SHAP for interpretable explanations; evaluate on panel data of 275 Chinese cities; compare with traditional ML/DL baselines.

Result: MADCN achieves test MSE 406,151.063; MAE 612.304; R^2 0.991, outperforming baselines; SHAP indicates population, city size, urbanization rate, GDP as top drivers; NQPF, digital economy index, and AI level have meaningful but moderate effects.

Conclusion: Strengthening NQPF, digital economy, and AI development can curb urban carbon emissions; policymakers should promote intelligent infrastructure and wider digitalization to pursue dual-carbon goals.

Abstract: New quality productive forces (NQPF), digital economy advancement, and
artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are becoming crucial for promoting
sustainable urban development. This study proposes a Multi-head Attention Deep
& Cross Network (MADCN) framework, combining feature interaction modeling and
attention mechanisms, to predict urban carbon emissions and investigate the
impacts of technological factors. The framework incorporates an interpretable
learning phase using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to assess the
contributions of different features. A panel dataset covering 275 Chinese
cities is utilized to test the MADCN model. Experimental results demonstrate
that the MADCN model achieves superior predictive performance compared to
traditional machine learning and deep learning baselines, with a Mean Squared
Error (MSE) of 406,151.063, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 612.304, and an
R-squared value of 0.991 on the test set. SHAP analysis highlights that
population, city size, urbanization rate, and GDP are among the most
influential factors on carbon emissions, while NQPF, digital economy index, and
AI technology level also show meaningful but relatively moderate effects.
Advancing NQPF, strengthening the digital economy, and accelerating AI
technology development can significantly contribute to reducing urban carbon
emissions. Policymakers should prioritize integrating technological innovation
into carbon reduction strategies, particularly by promoting intelligent
infrastructure and enhancing digitalization across sectors, to effectively
achieve dual-carbon goals.

### [168] [Learning More with Less: A Generalizable, Self-Supervised Framework for Privacy-Preserving Capacity Estimation with EV Charging Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05172)
*Anushiya Arunan,Yan Qin,Xiaoli Li,U-Xuan Tan,H. Vincent Poor,Chau Yuen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A self-supervised pre-training framework leverages privacy-friendly EV charging data to estimate battery capacity, using snippet similarity-weighted masked input reconstruction and snippet-wise contrastive learning, achieving 31.9% lower test error under domain shifts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy regulations and labeled data scarcity hinder generalizable capacity estimation; real-world data are fragmented and noisy, causing distribution shifts across manufacturers and aging.

Method: Pre-train on large-scale privacy-friendly charging data snippets. Use snippet-wise contrastive learning to capture high-level similarities among fragments. Then perform similarity-weighted masked input reconstruction to learn rich representations of granular charging patterns and cross-snippet associations. Fine-tune for capacity estimation.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with 31.9% lower test error; robust under domain shifts due to manufacturer and aging.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the viability of privacy-preserving self-supervised learning for capacity estimation; produces robust representations from fragmented data; potential to deploy in real-world EV operations.

Abstract: Accurate battery capacity estimation is key to alleviating consumer concerns
about battery performance and reliability of electric vehicles (EVs). However,
practical data limitations imposed by stringent privacy regulations and labeled
data shortages hamper the development of generalizable capacity estimation
models that remain robust to real-world data distribution shifts. While
self-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data, existing techniques are
not particularly designed to learn effectively from challenging field data --
let alone from privacy-friendly data, which are often less feature-rich and
noisier. In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind capacity estimation model
based on self-supervised pre-training, developed on a large-scale dataset of
privacy-friendly charging data snippets from real-world EV operations. Our
pre-training framework, snippet similarity-weighted masked input
reconstruction, is designed to learn rich, generalizable representations even
from less feature-rich and fragmented privacy-friendly data. Our key innovation
lies in harnessing contrastive learning to first capture high-level
similarities among fragmented snippets that otherwise lack meaningful context.
With our snippet-wise contrastive learning and subsequent similarity-weighted
masked reconstruction, we are able to learn rich representations of both
granular charging patterns within individual snippets and high-level
associative relationships across different snippets. Bolstered by this rich
representation learning, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving 31.9% lower test error than the best-performing benchmark,
even under challenging domain-shifted settings affected by both manufacturer
and age-induced distribution shifts.

*Dmitry Rybin,Yushun Zhang,Ding Tian,Zhihang Lin,Ruoyu Sun,Zhi-Quan Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FCA computes exact causal attention with ~10% fewer operations by exploiting triangular structure in QK^T and related matrices, yielding GPU speedups over PyTorch and Triton kernels; obtained via ML-discovered algebraic identities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal attention requires masking which imposes triangular structure. Existing kernels may not exploit this structure to full effect, leaving computation inefficiencies in forward and backward passes.

Method: Introduce Fast Causal Attention (FCA), an algorithm that uses algebraic identities learned via machine learning and combinatorial search to reduce operations for a class of matrix multiplications where one operand or the output is triangular (e.g., Mask(QK^T)). Implemented to accelerate both forward and backward passes on GPUs, surpassing default PyTorch and Triton kernels for these patterns.

Result: On GPU, FCA achieves noticeable accelerations over PyTorch and Triton implementations for the targeted triangular-matrix multiplications, including masked products like Mask(QK^T). The accelerations are achieved while preserving exact causal attention.

Conclusion: FCA provides a practical speedup by reducing the number of operations required for exact causal attention in a targeted class of matrix multiplications, leveraging ML-discovered algebraic identities. Limitations likely include applicability to only triangular-structured operations and hardware-specific performance; further work could broaden identity sets and compare to other attention optimizations.

Abstract: We present Fast Causal Attention (FCA), an algorithm that computes exact
Causal Attention using 10\% fewer operations. FCA accelerates a special class
of matrix multiplications where either one operand or the output matrix is
upper- or lower-triangular. This includes all operations in forward and
backward pass of Causal Attention, such as masked product
$\mathrm{Mask}(QK^{T})$. For these matrix multiplications on GPU, FCA reaches
noticeable accelerations over the default PyTorch implementations and Triton
compiled kernels. FCA is built upon algebraic identities discovered via machine
learning and combinatorial search.

### [170] [PatternKV: Flattening KV Representation Expands Quantization Headroom](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05176)
*Ji Zhang,Yiwei Li,Shaoxiong Feng,Peiwen Yuan,Xinglin Wang,Jiayi Shi,Yueqi Zhang,Chuyi Tan,Boyuan Pan,Yao Hu,Kan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PatternKV introduces a pattern-aligned residual quantization for KV caches in autoregressive LLMs, flattening the KV distribution by aligning vectors to learned online patterns and quantizing only the residual. This enables robust 2-bit quantization with minimal four-bit loss, improves test-time scaling accuracy, and boosts throughput and batch size capacity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV caches cause memory/bandwidth bottlenecks in autoregressive LLMs, especially with long contexts and test-time scaling. The native KV distribution is non-flat, making low-bit quantization lose fidelity. Prior outlier-focused methods fail to flatten the overall distribution, leaving performance fragile under aggressive quantization. There is a need to reshape the KV distribution to enable stable low-bit quantization.

Method: Online mining of representative pattern vectors; align each KV vector to its nearest pattern; quantize only the residual (PatternKV); reshapes the KV distribution to flatten the quantization target and narrow the quantization range, enabling lower-bit precision with preserved fidelity. Tested across long contexts and test-time scaling on multiple backbones.

Result: Across long-context and test-time scaling settings on multiple backbones, PatternKV yields consistent 2-bit gains, incurs a 0.08% average accuracy drop for 4-bit quantization relative to FP16, improves test-time scaling accuracy by 10% on average, increases throughput by 1.4x, and supports 1.25x larger batches.

Conclusion: PatternKV demonstrates that pattern-aligned residual quantization can flatten the KV distribution and enable robust low-bit quantization for KV caches, delivering tangible gains in accuracy, throughput, and scalability. The approach appears broadly beneficial across architectures, though its online pattern mining overhead and potential limitations at extreme bit-widths warrant further investigation.

Abstract: KV cache in autoregressive LLMs eliminates redundant recomputation but has
emerged as the dominant memory and bandwidth bottleneck during inference,
notably with long contexts and test-time scaling. KV quantization is a key
lever for reducing cache cost, but accuracy drops sharply as the native KV
distribution lacks flatness and thus maintains a wide quantization range. Prior
work focuses on isolating outliers, which caps their error but fails to flatten
the overall distribution, leaving performance fragile under low-bit settings.
In this work, we show that the K cache maintains a stable structure that
evolves gradually with context, while the V cache carries latent semantic
regularities. Building on these insights, we propose PatternKV, a
pattern-aligned residual quantization scheme. It mines representative pattern
vectors online, aligns each KV vector to its nearest pattern, and quantizes
only the residual. This reshaping of the KV distribution flattens the
quantization target and narrows its range, thereby improving the fidelity of
low-bit KV quantization. Across long-context and test-time scaling settings on
multiple backbones, PatternKV delivers consistent 2-bit gains, with a 0.08%
average 4-bit drop relative to FP16, improves test-time scaling accuracy by 10%
on average, and raises throughput by 1.4x while supporting 1.25x larger
batches.

*Ou Deng,Ruichen Cong,Jianting Xu,Shoji Nishimura,Atsushi Ogihara,Qun Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces logistic-gated operators (LGO) for symbolic regression to encode unit-aware thresholds and conditional logic; hard-gate variant achieves clinically plausible thresholds with fewer gates and competitive accuracy, enabling interpretable, auditable, unit-consistent models suitable for governance-ready deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address SR's lack of explicit unit-aware thresholds and conditional logic, improving interpretability and auditability by integrating gates whose location and sharpness can be learned and mapped to physical units.

Method: Develop LGO as differentiable gates with learnable location and steepness placed as typed primitives; map gates back to physical units; compare hard-gate and soft-gate variants on ICU and NHANES datasets; assess overlap with clinical anchors, gate counts, and model accuracy; prune gates on smooth tasks to maintain parsimony.

Result: Hard-gate model recovers 71% of thresholds within 10% of guideline anchors and 100% within 20%; uses far fewer gates (ICU median 4 vs 10; NHANES 5 vs 12.5) while maintaining competitive SR accuracy; gates pruned on smooth tasks, yielding compact, unit-aware symbolic equations audit-able against anchors; performance meets baselines, enabling governance-ready deployment.

Conclusion: LGO enables compact, interpretable, unit-aware symbolic models with auditable regime-switching behavior, turning interpretability into a modeling constraint and facilitating deployment in regulated clinical environments.

Abstract: Symbolic regression promises readable equations but struggles to encode
unit-aware thresholds and conditional logic. We propose logistic-gated
operators (LGO) -- differentiable gates with learnable location and steepness
-- embedded as typed primitives and mapped back to physical units for audit.
Across two primary health datasets (ICU, NHANES), the hard-gate variant
recovers clinically plausible cut-points: 71% (5/7) of assessed thresholds fall
within 10% of guideline anchors and 100% within 20%, while using far fewer
gates than the soft variant (ICU median 4.0 vs 10.0; NHANES 5.0 vs 12.5), and
remaining within the competitive accuracy envelope of strong SR baselines. On
predominantly smooth tasks, gates are pruned, preserving parsimony. The result
is compact symbolic equations with explicit, unit-aware thresholds that can be
audited against clinical anchors -- turning interpretability from a post-hoc
explanation into a modeling constraint and equipping symbolic regression with a
practical calculus for regime switching and governance-ready deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OptiFLIDS uses local pruning in Federated Learning for IoT IDS, plus a customized aggregation to handle non-IID data, achieving good detection with lower energy on TON_IoT, X-IIoTID, IDSIoT2024.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In critical IoT security, ML-based IDS require large datasets; data privacy/sharing limits impede performance. FL offers collaboration without data sharing but faces non-IID data and high energy costs on constrained devices.

Method: Pruning during local training to reduce model size/energy; a tailored aggregation method to reconcile pruned models across non-IID distributions.

Result: Experiments on three IoT IDS datasets show strong detection performance with improved energy efficiency, indicating practicality for real-world IoT deployment.

Conclusion: Combines pruning and customized aggregation to address FL challenges in IoT IDS, enabling efficient, robust deployment in diverse IoT environments.

Abstract: In critical IoT environments, such as smart homes and industrial systems,
effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for ensuring
security. However, developing robust IDS solutions remains a significant
challenge. Traditional machine learning-based IDS models typically require
large datasets, but data sharing is often limited due to privacy and security
concerns. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising alternative by enabling
collaborative model training without sharing raw data. Despite its advantages,
FL still faces key challenges, such as data heterogeneity (non-IID data) and
high energy and computation costs, particularly for resource constrained IoT
devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes OptiFLIDS, a novel
approach that applies pruning techniques during local training to reduce model
complexity and energy consumption. It also incorporates a customized
aggregation method to better handle pruned models that differ due to non-IID
data distributions. Experiments conducted on three recent IoT IDS datasets,
TON_IoT, X-IIoTID, and IDSIoT2024, demonstrate that OptiFLIDS maintains strong
detection performance while improving energy efficiency, making it well-suited
for deployment in real-world IoT environments.

### [173] [A Data-Driven Prism: Multi-View Source Separation with Diffusion Model Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05205)
*Sebastian Wagner-Carena,Aizhan Akhmetzhanova,Sydney Erickson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion models can perform source separation from multi-view observations without explicit source models, by learning priors directly from data. They handle noisy, incomplete data and varying resolution, enabling sampling from source priors and the joint posterior given an observation; demonstrated on synthetic problems and real galaxy data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disentangling unknown sources from observations is a core problem across sciences (e.g., deblending galaxies, separating neuron signals, seismic event separation). Traditional analyses rely on simplified source models that fail to capture data complexity. There is a need for flexible, data-driven priors; multiple views provide different linear transformations of the same sources, offering a path to separation even when individual sources are not directly observed.

Method: Train diffusion models to learn the priors of the sources from multi-view data, leveraging the fact that different observation sets are related to the same underlying sources by linear transformations. The approach does not assume explicit source models and can operate when sources are not observed individually, with observations that are noisy, incomplete, and of varying resolution. Once trained, the models enable sampling from the source priors, evaluating the probability of candidate sources, and drawing from the joint posterior of the sources given an observation.

Result: The method succeeds on a range of synthetic problems and on real-world galaxy observations. It works even when no single source is observed in isolation, and is robust to noise, incompleteness, and resolution variation. Diffusion-model priors permit posterior sampling and probability evaluation of candidate sources.

Conclusion: Diffusion models provide a flexible, data-driven framework for source separation that obviates explicit-source assumptions and leverages multiple views. They enable principled sampling and posterior inference for complex, noisy observational data across scientific domains.

Abstract: A common challenge in the natural sciences is to disentangle distinct,
unknown sources from observations. Examples of this source separation task
include deblending galaxies in a crowded field, distinguishing the activity of
individual neurons from overlapping signals, and separating seismic events from
an ambient background. Traditional analyses often rely on simplified source
models that fail to accurately reproduce the data. Recent advances have shown
that diffusion models can directly learn complex prior distributions from
noisy, incomplete data. In this work, we show that diffusion models can solve
the source separation problem without explicit assumptions about the source.
Our method relies only on multiple views, or the property that different sets
of observations contain different linear transformations of the unknown
sources. We show that our method succeeds even when no source is individually
observed and the observations are noisy, incomplete, and vary in resolution.
The learned diffusion models enable us to sample from the source priors,
evaluate the probability of candidate sources, and draw from the joint
posterior of the source distribution given an observation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on a range of synthetic problems as well as
real-world galaxy observations.

### [174] [Approximate Gaussianity Beyond Initialisation in Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05218)
*Edward Hirst,Sanjaye Ramgoolam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Permutation-invariant Gaussian matrix models with 13 parameters effectively capture correlated weight distributions in MNIST networks, extending beyond IID Gaussian assumptions. The framework uses representation theory and graph observables for interpretability, and Wasserstein distance tracks training dynamics; it also reveals regimes where Gaussianity breaks and points toward more general, still interpretable models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how neural network weight matrices evolve during training and to move beyond the simplistic IID Gaussian assumption. By leveraging permutation symmetry, the study aims for an interpretable, low-parameter model that can describe weight distributions and their training dynamics across different architectural choices.

Method: Introduce a 13-parameter permutation-invariant Gaussian matrix model grounded in permutation symmetry. Use representation-theoretic parameters and graph-theoretic observables to interpret the model. Compute Wasserstein distance to quantify distribution shifts during training. Empirically test across initialization regimes, regularization, depth, and width in MNIST classification.

Result: The permutation-invariant Gaussian models effectively capture the correlated Gaussian structure in weight matrices beyond initialization, outperforming simple IID Gaussian descriptions. The representation-theoretic and graph observables provide an interpretable framework for the best-fit model and small departures from Gaussianity. Wasserstein distance quantifies training dynamics. The analysis identifies regimes where non-Gaussian deviations are amplified and suggests how to develop more general yet still interpretable models.

Conclusion: Permutation-invariant Gaussian matrix models offer a powerful, interpretable tool for analyzing weight distributions during training. They remain valid beyond initialization and can be extended to broader architectures and datasets. The work lays groundwork for systematically studying when Gaussianity holds and how to design more general symmetry-respecting models.

Abstract: Ensembles of neural network weight matrices are studied through the training
process for the MNIST classification problem, testing the efficacy of matrix
models for representing their distributions, under assumptions of Gaussianity
and permutation-symmetry. The general 13-parameter permutation invariant
Gaussian matrix models are found to be effective models for the correlated
Gaussianity in the weight matrices, beyond the range of applicability of the
simple Gaussian with independent identically distributed matrix variables, and
notably well beyond the initialisation step. The representation theoretic model
parameters, and the graph-theoretic characterisation of the permutation
invariant matrix observables give an interpretable framework for the best-fit
model and for small departures from Gaussianity. Additionally, the Wasserstein
distance is calculated for this class of models and used to quantify the
movement of the distributions over training. Throughout the work, the effects
of varied initialisation regimes, regularisation, layer depth, and layer width
are tested for this formalism, identifying limits where particular departures
from Gaussianity are enhanced and how more general, yet still
highly-interpretable, models can be developed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CMT-Benchmark: a 50-problem dataset to test LLMs on expert-level condensed matter tasks; current models lag behind experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill evaluation gaps for advanced hard sciences by providing expert-verified, research-level problems to benchmark and drive AI progress.

Method: Global expert panel designed and verified problems spanning analytic and computational quantum many-body physics and classical statistical mechanics; collaborative problem-writing mirroring tasks a research assistant would tackle; includes Hartree-Fock, exact diagonalization, quantum/variational Monte Carlo, DMRG, quantum/classical statistical mechanics, and model-building; machine-grading with symbolic handling of non-commuting operators via normal ordering; problems generalize across tasks.

Result: Best model (GPT-5) solves 30% of the problems; average across 17 models (~GPT, Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek, Llama) is 11.4% with ±2.1%; 18 problems are unsolved by any model and 26 solved by at most one; unresolved problems span Quantum Monte Carlo, Variational Monte Carlo, and DMRG; some answers violate fundamental symmetries or show unphysical scaling; frontier models struggle with all problems; experts note strategies for crafting harder problems by interacting with LLMs.

Conclusion: Benchmark is poised to guide development of capable AI research assistants and tutors, revealing current limitations in physical reasoning and offering a path for targeted improvement through challenging, expert-validated tasks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in coding and
math problem-solving, but evaluation on advanced research-level problems in
hard sciences remains scarce. To fill this gap, we present CMT-Benchmark, a
dataset of 50 problems covering condensed matter theory (CMT) at the level of
an expert researcher. Topics span analytical and computational approaches in
quantum many-body, and classical statistical mechanics. The dataset was
designed and verified by a panel of expert researchers from around the world.
We built the dataset through a collaborative environment that challenges the
panel to write and refine problems they would want a research assistant to
solve, including Hartree-Fock, exact diagonalization, quantum/variational Monte
Carlo, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), quantum/classical
statistical mechanics, and model building. We evaluate LLMs by programmatically
checking solutions against expert-supplied ground truth. We developed
machine-grading, including symbolic handling of non-commuting operators via
normal ordering. They generalize across tasks too. Our evaluations show that
frontier models struggle with all of the problems in the dataset, highlighting
a gap in the physical reasoning skills of current LLMs. Notably, experts
identified strategies for creating increasingly difficult problems by
interacting with the LLMs and exploiting common failure modes. The best model,
GPT5, solves 30\% of the problems; average across 17 models (GPT, Gemini,
Claude, DeepSeek, Llama) is 11.4$\pm$2.1\%. Moreover, 18 problems are solved by
none of the 17 models, and 26 by at most one. These unsolved problems span
Quantum Monte Carlo, Variational Monte Carlo, and DMRG. Answers sometimes
violate fundamental symmetries or have unphysical scaling dimensions. We
believe this benchmark will guide development toward capable AI research
assistants and tutors.

### [176] [Simultaneous Learning and Optimization via Misspecified Saddle Point Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05241)
*Mohammad Mahdi Ahmadi,Erfan Yazdandoost Hamedani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Misspecified saddle-point problems with unknown parameters learned online are addressed using two APD-based algorithms: a naive parameter-substitution extension and a learning-aware variant that adjusts momentum. The learning-aware method offers faster practical convergence via tighter constants and backtracking-based adaptive steps, and the framework extends to cases with multiple optimal learning solutions, yielding O(1/√K) rates in structured settings. Empirical evaluation on misspecified portfolio optimization shows improvements over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In many saddle-point problems, key parameters are unknown and must be learned from data while solving the optimization problem. Prior work typically assumes these parameters are known or pre-estimated, which limits real-world applicability. Integrating optimization and learning into a unified framework can handle misspecification more flexibly and robustly.

Method: The paper builds on accelerated primal-dual (APD) methods. It studies (i) a naive extension that plugs evolving parameter estimates into primal-dual updates, and (ii) a learning-aware variant that explicitly accounts for parameter dynamics by adjusting momentum updates. An adaptive backtracking strategy enables variable step sizes. The authors prove convergence rates of O(log K / K) for both methods, with the learning-aware variant achieving a tighter O(1) constant; in a setting with multiple optimal learning solutions, a structured modification yields an O(1/√K) rate.

Result: Both algorithms achieve provable convergence with rates: O(log K / K) overall, with the learning-aware variant having a tighter constant and adaptive step-size via backtracking. When the learning problem has multiple optima in a structured case, the method attains an O(1/√K) rate. Empirical experiments on misspecified portfolio optimization demonstrate superior performance relative to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The work delivers a unified optimization-learning framework for misspecified saddle-point problems and shows that incorporating learning dynamics into APD leads to improved convergence behavior and practical performance. The extension to cases with multiple optimal learning solutions broadens applicability, and empirical results validate the theoretical benefits in a portfolio optimization setting.

Abstract: We study a class of misspecified saddle point (SP) problems, where the
optimization objective depends on an unknown parameter that must be learned
concurrently from data. Unlike existing studies that assume parameters are
fully known or pre-estimated, our framework integrates optimization and
learning into a unified formulation, enabling a more flexible problem class. To
address this setting, we propose two algorithms based on the accelerated
primal-dual (APD) by Hamedani & Aybat 2021. In particular, we first analyze the
naive extension of the APD method by directly substituting the evolving
parameter estimates into the primal-dual updates; then, we design a new
learning-aware variant of the APD method that explicitly accounts for parameter
dynamics by adjusting the momentum updates. Both methods achieve a provable
convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log K / K)$, while the learning-aware
approach attains a tighter $\mathcal{O}(1)$ constant and further benefits from
an adaptive step-size selection enabled by a backtracking strategy.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to problems where the learning problem
admits multiple optimal solutions, showing that our modified algorithm for a
structured setting achieves an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ rate. To demonstrate
practical impact, we evaluate our methods on a misspecified portfolio
optimization problem and show superior empirical performance compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms.

*Yuezhu Xu,S. Sivaranjani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable, compositional SDP-based framework for tight Lipschitz bounds of deep networks, enhanced with local input information. It decomposes large SDPs into small subproblems (linear in depth) and offers near-instantaneous closed-form variants, with strong feasibility guarantees and upper bounds close to the Jacobian for small input regions; shows speedups and robustness alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exact Lipschitz constant computation is NP-hard; global SDP estimates scale poorly with network size. Leveraging local input-region information can yield tighter, more practical bounds for robustness certification.

Method: A generalized SDP framework accommodating heterogeneous activation slopes and arbitrary input-output pairs/sub-networks; decomposes into small subproblems with linear-depth scaling; provides near-instantaneous closed-form subproblem solutions; introduces ECLipsE-Gen-Local algorithms that inject local input information.

Result: Substantial speedups over benchmarks; tighter Lipschitz bounds than global approaches; provides strict upper bounds approaching the exact Jacobian for small input regions; estimates align with network robustness.

Conclusion: The framework yields scalable, tight Lipschitz estimates; incorporating local input information significantly improves bounds; practical utility for robustness certification in deep networks.

Abstract: The Lipschitz constant is a key measure for certifying the robustness of
neural networks to input perturbations. However, computing the exact constant
is NP-hard, and standard approaches to estimate the Lipschitz constant involve
solving a large matrix semidefinite program (SDP) that scales poorly with
network size. Further, there is a potential to efficiently leverage local
information on the input region to provide tighter Lipschitz estimates. We
address this problem here by proposing a compositional framework that yields
tight yet scalable Lipschitz estimates for deep feedforward neural networks.
Specifically, we begin by developing a generalized SDP framework that is highly
flexible, accommodating heterogeneous activation function slope, and allowing
Lipschitz estimates with respect to arbitrary input-output pairs and arbitrary
choices of sub-networks of consecutive layers. We then decompose this
generalized SDP into a sequence of small sub-problems, with computational
complexity that scales linearly with respect to the network depth. We also
develop a variant that achieves near-instantaneous computation through
closed-form solutions to each sub-problem. All our algorithms are accompanied
by theoretical guarantees on feasibility and validity. Next, we develop a
series of algorithms, termed as ECLipsE-Gen-Local, that effectively incorporate
local information on the input. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithms
achieve substantial speedups over a multitude of benchmarks while producing
significantly tighter Lipschitz bounds than global approaches. Moreover, we
show that our algorithms provide strict upper bounds for the Lipschitz constant
with values approaching the exact Jacobian from autodiff when the input region
is small enough. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our approach
by showing that our Lipschitz estimates closely align with network robustness.

*Paloma García-de-Herreros,Philipp Slusallek,Dietrich Klakow,Vagrant Gautam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decoder-only models underperform encoder-only in cross-modal PDE tasks with existing methods; scaling alone does not help. Two methods, Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling, mimic bidirectionality and improve decoder-only performance across tasks, closing the gap to encoder-only models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how model architecture (encoder vs. decoder) influences cross-modal adaptation for time-dependent PDE simulations and whether decoder-only models can match encoder-only performance in scientific ML.

Method: Conduct systematic ablation comparing encoder-only and decoder-only models on cross-modal adaptation tasks for PDE-based time-dependent simulations. Evaluate existing cross-modal adaptation methods unmodified. Propose and evaluate two bidirectionality-mimicking techniques—Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling—and test across multiple tasks and adaptation methods.

Result: Decoder-only models perform worse than encoder-only when using existing methods; scaling decoder-only models does not help. The two proposed techniques improve decoder-only performance across all tasks and methods, effectively closing the gap with encoder-only models.

Conclusion: Decoder-only models can be competitive in cross-modal scientific ML when equipped with bidirectionality-mimicking strategies; this broadens the set of viable architectures for cross-modal adaptation in PDE-based simulations.

Abstract: Large language models have shown great success on natural language tasks in
recent years, but they have also shown great promise when adapted to new
modalities, e.g., for scientific machine learning tasks. Even though
decoder-only models are more popular within NLP and scale exceedingly well at
generating natural language, most proposed approaches for cross-modal
adaptation focus on encoder-only models, raising the question of how model
architecture affects these approaches. In this paper, we therefore perform a
series of ablation studies to answer this question, systematically comparing
encoder-only and decoder-only models on cross-modal adaptation for
time-dependent simulation tasks based on partial differential equations (PDEs).
We find that decoder-only models are far worse than encoder-only models, when
existing approaches are applied unmodified. In contrast to several other
domains, scaling decoder-only models also does not help. To harness the
potential of decoder-only models in this context, we introduce two novel
approaches, Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling, attempting to mimic
bidirectionality in autoregressive models. Both our methods improve overall
performance using decoder-only models for all tasks and all cross-model
adaptation methods, closing the gap to encoder-only model performance. We hope
that our findings broaden the spectrum of models used on cross-modal adaptation
tasks to further scientific ML.

### [179] [Adjusting the Output of Decision Transformer with Action Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05285)
*Rui Lin,Yiwen Zhang,Zhicheng Peng,Minghao Lyu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Action Gradient (AG) for Decision Transformer offline RL: directly optimizes actions via the gradient of the Q-value, addressing stitching and extrapolation challenges and enabling stable integration with token-prediction techniques, yielding strong empirical gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL with transformer-based decision models faces two core issues: stitching long trajectories and extrapolating actions beyond the training data. The existing approaches that separately tackle tokens and policy objectives often become unstable when combined. AG aims to provide a direct, differentiable signal to adjust actions, improving stability and performance.

Method: Introduce Action Gradient (AG): adjust actions by following the gradient of the Q-value with respect to the action, effectively steering actions toward higher expected returns. Designed to integrate smoothly with token-prediction components used in Decision Transformer, enabling joint optimization without the instability of naive PG integration.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows that AG substantially improves the performance of DT-based offline RL methods, with several configurations achieving or approaching state-of-the-art results on benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: Action Gradient provides a stable, effective mechanism to optimize actions within Decision Transformer frameworks, enhancing offline RL performance and compatibility with token-based prediction techniques, and representing a promising direction for future research.

Abstract: Decision Transformer (DT), which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with
the transformer model, introduces a novel approach to offline RL. Unlike
classical algorithms that take maximizing cumulative discounted rewards as
objective, DT instead maximizes the likelihood of actions. This paradigm shift,
however, presents two key challenges: stitching trajectories and extrapolation
of action. Existing methods, such as substituting specific tokens with
predictive values and integrating the Policy Gradient (PG) method, address
these challenges individually but fail to improve performance stably when
combined due to inherent instability. To address this, we propose Action
Gradient (AG), an innovative methodology that directly adjusts actions to
fulfill a function analogous to that of PG, while also facilitating efficient
integration with token prediction techniques. AG utilizes the gradient of the
Q-value with respect to the action to optimize the action. The empirical
results demonstrate that our method can significantly enhance the performance
of DT-based algorithms, with some results achieving state-of-the-art levels.

### [180] [Computing frustration and near-monotonicity in deep neural networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05286)
*Joel Wendin,Erik G. Larsson,Claudio Altafini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pretrained CNNs have signed-graph frustration lower than null models, indicating more order and near-monotone behavior, implying a form of implicit regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why CNNs generalize by analyzing network structure via signed graphs and frustration, connecting to disorder in Ising spin glasses and functional monotonicity.

Method: Construct a signed graph from each network, compute frustration, compare to null-models, analyze monotonicity along the partial order imposed by frustration, across multiple pretrained CNNs.

Result: Frustration is consistently below null-model expectations, indicating reduced disorder; networks show near-monotonic functional behavior along the frustration-based partial order.

Conclusion: Deep CNNs tend to be more ordered than null-models suggest, supporting the idea of implicit regularization arising from proximity to structural balance.

Abstract: For the signed graph associated to a deep neural network, one can compute the
frustration level, i.e., test how close or distant the graph is to structural
balance. For all the pretrained deep convolutional neural networks we consider,
we find that the frustration is always less than expected from null models.
From a statistical physics point of view, and in particular in reference to an
Ising spin glass model, the reduced frustration indicates that the amount of
disorder encoded in the network is less than in the null models. From a
functional point of view, low frustration (i.e., proximity to structural
balance) means that the function representing the network behaves
near-monotonically, i.e., more similarly to a monotone function than in the
null models. Evidence of near-monotonic behavior along the partial order
determined by frustration is observed for all networks we consider. This
confirms that the class of deep convolutional neural networks tends to have a
more ordered behavior than expected from null models, and suggests a novel form
of implicit regularization.

*Ruoxing Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces DP-Adam-AC, an adaptive gradient clipping enhancement to DP-Adam for private on-device fine-tuning of small localizable LLMs, leading to loss improvements on synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy risks in fine-tuning and the need to run LLMs locally without exposing data or relying on remote servers.

Method: Develop adaptable gradient clipping and other engineering tweaks to the differential privacy-enhanced Adam optimizer; apply to two localizable LLMs: Qwen2.5-0.5B and Bitnet-b1.58-2B (1.58-bit quantized), using synthetic datasets.

Result: Observed promising improvements in training loss on experiments with two synthetic datasets.

Conclusion: DP-Adam-AC enables more secure and private fine-tuning of localizable LLMs; further evaluation on real tasks and data may be warranted.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have evolved into powerful and
ubiquitous tools. Fine-tuning on small datasets allows LLMs to acquire
specialized skills for specific tasks efficiently. Although LLMs provide great
utility in both general and task-specific use cases, they are limited by two
security-related concerns. First, traditional LLM hardware requirements make
them infeasible to run locally on consumer-grade devices. A remote network
connection with the LLM provider's server is usually required, making the
system vulnerable to network attacks. Second, fine-tuning an LLM for a
sensitive task may involve sensitive data. Non-private fine-tuning algorithms
produce models vulnerable to training data reproduction attacks. Our work
addresses these security concerns by enhancing differentially private
optimization algorithms and applying them to fine-tune localizable language
models. We introduce adaptable gradient clipping along with other engineering
enhancements to the standard DP-Adam optimizer to create DP-Adam-AC. We use our
optimizer to fine-tune examples of two localizable LLM designs, small language
model (Qwen2.5-0.5B) and 1.58 bit quantization (Bitnet-b1.58-2B). We
demonstrate promising improvements in loss through experimentation with two
synthetic datasets.

*Kevin Player*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cosine similarities from sentence-transformer embeddings can be modeled with shifted, truncated gamma distributions and gamma mixtures; a hierarchical topic-based gamma-mixture model is proposed, with an EM algorithm to fit the model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and model the distribution of cosine-based similarity scores across a fixed corpus, enabling better interpretation, calibration, and potential retrieval improvements.

Method: Compute similarities between all document embeddings in a fixed corpus and a reference query embedding. Fit shifted and truncated gamma distributions to these similarities, and often gamma mixtures. Propose a heuristic, topic-hierarchy-driven gamma-mixture generative model. Outline an expectation-maximization algorithm for fitting shifted gamma mixtures as a practical estimator.

Result: Empirically, the similarity distributions are well captured by a shifted, truncated gamma distribution, and in many cases by a gamma mixture. The proposed EM algorithm furnishes a practical tool for fitting these shifted gamma mixtures to empirical similarity data.

Conclusion: Gamma-mixture modeling with shifts and truncation is a plausible and practical framework for representing cosine similarity distributions from sentence-transformer embeddings. A hierarchical topic structure provides a theoretical motivation for the mixture, and the EM fitting procedure offers a usable method for parameter estimation.

Abstract: We study the cosine similarity of sentence transformer embeddings and observe
that they are well modeled by gamma mixtures. From a fixed corpus, we measure
similarities between all document embeddings and a reference query embedding.
Empirically we find that these distributions are often well captured by a gamma
distribution shifted and truncated to [-1,1], and in many cases, by a gamma
mixture. We propose a heuristic model in which a hierarchical clustering of
topics naturally leads to a gamma-mixture structure in the similarity scores.
Finally, we outline an expectation-maximization algorithm for fitting shifted
gamma mixtures, which provides a practical tool for modeling similarity
distributions.

*Zhenyu Liu,Varun Ojha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two mutual-learning inspired regularizations for adversarial training enhance robustness: (1) weighted adversarial mutual KL-divergence to flexibly balance main and auxiliary objectives, and (2) adversarial generalization regularization by including a clean target distribution. Together, they outperform existing regularization-based defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MSE as a regularizer in adversarial training enforces overly uniform optimization between outputs, potentially hindering robustness. There is a need for more flexible, effective regularization that leverages mutual learning concepts to improve robustness under adversarial attacks.

Method: (i) Propose weighted adversarial mutual regularization via a decomposed adversarial mutual KL-divergence loss that allows unequal weighting of main and auxiliary objectives; (ii) Propose adversarial generalization regularization by incorporating an additional clean target distribution into the adversarial training objective to improve generalization.

Result: Extensive experiments show that the proposed methods significantly improve adversarial robustness compared to existing regularization-based approaches.

Conclusion: Mutual-learning-inspired regularizations—weighted adversarial mutual KL-divergence and adversarial generalization regularization—are effective strategies to boost adversarial robustness beyond standard cross-entropy/MSE-based regularization.

Abstract: Adversarial training is the most effective defense against adversarial
attacks. The effectiveness of the adversarial attacks has been on the design of
its loss function and regularization term. The most widely used loss function
in adversarial training is cross-entropy and mean squared error (MSE) as its
regularization objective. However, MSE enforces overly uniform optimization
between two output distributions during training, which limits its robustness
in adversarial training scenarios. To address this issue, we revisit the idea
of mutual learning (originally designed for knowledge distillation) and propose
two novel regularization strategies tailored for adversarial training: (i)
weighted adversarial mutual regularization and (ii) adversarial generalization
regularization. In the former, we formulate a decomposed adversarial mutual
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) loss, which allows flexible control
over the optimization process by assigning unequal weights to the main and
auxiliary objectives. In the latter, we introduce an additional clean target
distribution into the adversarial training objective, improving generalization
and enhancing model robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed methods significantly improve adversarial robustness compared to
existing regularization-based approaches.

*Qian Wang,Mohammad N. Bisheh,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Tensor-on-Tensor Regression Neural Network (TRNN) to unify tensor-geometry-preserving regression with nonlinear modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HD data streams in multi-way tensor form; existing tensor regressors are mostly linear and miss nonlinear interactions; conventional NNs flatten tensors, losing spatial structure and incurring many parameters. A method that preserves tensor geometry while enabling nonlinear regression is needed.

Method: Propose Tensor-on-Tensor Regression Neural Network (TRNN) that operates directly on multi-way tensors to capture nonlinear interactions without flattening, thus unifying tensor-based regression with neural network expressiveness.

Result: Conceptual contribution presenting TRNN as a unified framework that combines the advantages of tensor-based regression and neural networks for nonlinear tensor regression.

Conclusion: TRNN offers a principled approach to modeling high-dimensional tensor data, preserving geometry while enabling nonlinear relationships, bridging the gap between linear tensor regressors and flattened neural networks.

Abstract: Modern sensing and metrology systems now stream terabytes of heterogeneous,
high-dimensional (HD) data profiles, images, and dense point clouds, whose
natural representation is multi-way tensors. Understanding such data requires
regression models that preserve tensor geometry, yet remain expressive enough
to capture the pronounced nonlinear interactions that dominate many industrial
and mechanical processes. Existing tensor-based regressors meet the first
requirement but remain essentially linear. Conversely, conventional neural
networks offer nonlinearity only after flattening, thereby discarding spatial
structure and incurring prohibitive parameter counts. This paper introduces a
Tensor-on-Tensor Regression Neural Network (TRNN) that unifies these two
paradigms.

### [185] [Margin Adaptive DPO: Leveraging Reward Model for Granular Control in Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05342)
*Hyung Gyu Rho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MADPO introduces instance-level margin-based reweighting for Direct Preference Optimization by first training a reward model to estimate preference margins, then adapting the DPO loss per sample with continuous weights that amplify hard pairs and dampen easy ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO's fixed temperature leads to suboptimal learning across diverse preference data, causing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones. IPO and beta-DPO have their own drawbacks that reduce effectiveness or stability.

Method: A two-step approach: (1) train a reward model to estimate per-example preference margins; (2) apply these margins to weight the DPO loss for each training sample in a continuous, instance-level manner, producing an adaptive target margin that strengthens hard examples and softens easy ones. The method is analyzed theoretically for a well-behaved optimization landscape and robustness to margin estimation errors.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows a stable optimization landscape and robustness to reward-model errors. Empirically, on sentiment generation tasks, MADPO outperforms strong baselines across data qualities, achieving up to +33.3% on High Quality data and +10.5% on Low Quality data over the next-best method.

Conclusion: MADPO offers a stable, data-preserving, and principled approach to preference alignment by leveraging per-sample margins to adaptively reweight DPO loss, yielding robust improvements across data qualities.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective
method for aligning large language models. However, its reliance on a fixed
temperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data,
causing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones.
Recent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general
overfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more
targeted approach of $\beta$-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its
batch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to
mixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative
$\beta$ values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful
training signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference
Optimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and
instance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first
trains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these
margins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each
individual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective
target margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs,
allowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a
comprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved
optimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We
validate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where
MADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across
datasets of varying quality. It achieves performance gains of up to +33.3\% on
High Quality data and +10.5\% on Low Quality data over the next-best method.
Our results establish MADPO as a more robust and principled approach to
preference alignment.

*Jinghao Cao,Qin Li,Mengnan Du,Haimin Wang,Bo Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PIANO uses a physics-informed, attention-enhanced Fourier neural operator to reconstruct 3D NLFFF fields from 2D boundaries, outperforming baselines while respecting physical constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing nonlinear force-free magnetic fields (NLFFF) from boundary data is computationally challenging with traditional iterative methods; there is a need for fast, accurate, data-driven approaches that are consistent with the underlying physics.

Method: PIANO combines Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) with Dilated Convolutions (DC) within a Fourier Neural Operator framework to capture multimodal input and 3D magnetic field structure from 2D boundary conditions. Training enforces physics-informed losses for divergence-free (div B = 0) and force-free (J×B = 0) conditions.

Result: On the ISEE NLFFF dataset, PIANO outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators in accuracy and exhibits strong consistency with NLFFF physics across magnetic fields reconstructed from diverse solar active regions; code is available at the provided GitHub repository.

Conclusion: PIANO demonstrates that integrating attention-enhanced neural operators with physics-informed losses yields accurate, physics-consistent NLFFF reconstructions from boundary data, offering a fast and reliable alternative to iterative methods.

Abstract: We propose Physics-informed Attention-enhanced Fourier Neural Operator
(PIANO) to solve the Nonlinear Force-Free Field (NLFFF) problem in solar
physics. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on iterative numerical
methods, our proposed PIANO directly learns the 3D magnetic field structure
from 2D boundary conditions. Specifically, PIANO integrates Efficient Channel
Attention (ECA) mechanisms with Dilated Convolutions (DC), which enhances the
model's ability to capture multimodal input by prioritizing critical channels
relevant to the magnetic field's variations. Furthermore, we apply
physics-informed loss by enforcing the force-free and divergence-free
conditions in the training process so that our prediction is consistent with
underlying physics with high accuracy. Experimental results on the ISEE NLFFF
dataset show that our PIANO not only outperforms state-of-the-art neural
operators in terms of accuracy but also shows strong consistency with the
physical characteristics of NLFFF data across magnetic fields reconstructed
from various solar active regions. The GitHub of this project is available

*Alex Iacob,Andrej Jovanovic,Mher Safaryan,Meghdad Kurmanji,Lorenzo Sani,Samuel Horváth,William F. Shen,Xinchi Qiu,Nicholas D. Lane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MT-DAO uses multi-time-scale momentum to reconcile fast optimizer dynamics with infrequent communication, providing convergence guarantees and practical speedups for large-language-model training over distributed data parallelism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce gradient-communication overhead in distributed data parallelism by using infrequent communication (e.g., Local SGD) without incurring the usual performance gap for adaptive optimizers.

Method: Introduce MT-DAO, a family of optimizers that maintains multiple first-moment estimates (slow and fast) of gradients to track update dynamics across different time scales; provide theoretical convergence guarantees; empirically evaluate on language-model pre-training.

Result: MT-DAO closes the performance gap with fully synchronous DDP, beating infrequent-communication baselines in perplexity and reducing iso-token wall-clock time (6-27% on Ethernet). At 720M parameters, it requires 24% fewer steps and 35% less time than single-momentum DDP; enables cross-datacenter training.

Conclusion: MT-DAO effectively addresses the time-scale mismatch in adaptive optimizers under infrequent communication, enabling efficient, scalable language-model training across wide and cross-datacenter deployments.

Abstract: Training large models with distributed data parallelism (DDP) requires
frequent communication of gradients across workers, which can saturate
bandwidth. Infrequent communication strategies (e.g., Local SGD) reduce this
overhead but, when applied to adaptive optimizers, often suffer a performance
gap relative to fully synchronous DDP. We trace this gap to a time-scale
mismatch: the optimizer's fast-moving momentum, tuned for frequent updates,
decays too quickly to smooth gradients over long intervals, leading to
noise-dominated optimization. To address this, we propose MT-DAO, a family of
optimizers that employs multiple slow- and fast-moving first momenta or the
gradient to track update dynamics across different time scales, for which we
provide the first convergence guarantees. Empirically, for language-model
pre-training, this eliminates the performance gap with DDP, outperforming
infrequent-communication baselines in perplexity and reducing iso-token
wall-clock time by 6-27% on Ethernet interconnects. At the 720M scale, MT-DAO
reaches a target perplexity in 24% fewer steps and 35% less time than the
single-momentum DDP baseline. MT-DAO enables effective cross-datacenter
training and training over wide geographic areas.

*Utkarsh Saxena,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KVLinC mitigates extreme low-precision KV-cache quantization errors in LLMs by applying Hadamard rotation and linear correction adapters, improving accuracy and compression while enabling faster attention kernels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantizing KV-cache to 2-bit or other very low precision introduces significant errors that propagate through dot-product attention, degrading generation quality; a method is needed to preserve quality with aggressive compression.

Method: Apply Hadamard rotation to reduce quantization error in the value stream, plus lightweight linear correction adapters to explicitly compensate for errors introduced by quantized keys; implement a custom attention kernel to accelerate inference.

Result: KVLinC consistently matches or surpasses strong baselines on LLaMA, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3 families, achieving higher KV-cache compression; attention kernel yields up to 2.55x faster inference than Flash Attention.

Conclusion: KVLinC effectively mitigates attention errors from KV-cache quantization in extreme low-precision regimes, delivering both accuracy and speed benefits for long-context LLM inference.

Abstract: Quantizing the key-value (KV) cache is a promising strategy for improving the
inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs). However, aggressive
quantization to very low precision (e.g., 2 bits) introduces significant errors
in the stored key and value tensors, which propagate through the dot-product
attention mechanism and ultimately degrade generation quality. To address this,
we propose KVLinC, a framework to mitigate attention errors introduced by KV
cache quantization in the extreme low-precision regime. KVLinC combines a
Hadamard rotation, which reduces quantization error in values, with lightweight
linear correction adapters that explicitly compensate for errors introduced by
quantized keys. Across extensive evaluations on the LLaMA, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3
model families, KVLinC consistently matches or surpasses strong baselines while
achieving higher KV-cache compression. Furthermore, we implement a custom
attention kernel that results in upto 2.55x faster inference compared to Flash
Attention baseline, enabling efficient long-context LLM inference.

*Rohan Arni,Carlos Blanco*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Spectral PINNSformer (S-Pformer), a self-attention-based, encoderless refinement of PINNsformers with Fourier feature embeddings to mitigate spectral bias, yielding comparable/better accuracy with far fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs suffer from spectral bias and encoder redundancy; reducing parameter count while effectively capturing spatiotemporal correlations is desirable for efficient PDE solving.

Method: Redesign PINNsformer to remove the encoder and rely on a self-attention mechanism; integrate Fourier feature embeddings to enable multiscale frequency encoding; compare against encoder-decoder PINNSformers and MLP baselines on standard PDE benchmarks.

Result: S-Pformer matches or exceeds PINNSformer performance across benchmarks and achieves or approaches MLP-level accuracy while significantly reducing parameter count.

Conclusion: Eliminating encoder redundancy and adding Fourier-feature-based spectral bias mitigation yields an efficient, accurate PINN architecture for solving PDEs.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a useful framework for
approximating partial differential equation solutions using deep learning
methods. In this paper, we propose a principled redesign of the PINNsformer, a
Transformer-based PINN architecture. We present the Spectral PINNSformer
(S-Pformer), a refinement of encoder-decoder PINNSformers that addresses two
key issues; 1. the redundancy (i.e. increased parameter count) of the encoder,
and 2. the mitigation of spectral bias. We find that the encoder is unnecessary
for capturing spatiotemporal correlations when relying solely on
self-attention, thereby reducing parameter count. Further, we integrate Fourier
feature embeddings to explicitly mitigate spectral bias, enabling adaptive
encoding of multiscale behaviors in the frequency domain. Our model outperforms
encoder-decoder PINNSformer architectures across all benchmarks, achieving or
outperforming MLP performance while reducing parameter count significantly.

### [190] [A Neural Network Algorithm for KL Divergence Estimation with Quantitative Error Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05386)
*Mikil Foss,Andrew Lamperski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A constructive KL-divergence estimator using a shallow random-feature network achieves a provable error bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating KL divergence for continuous variables is difficult in high dimensions; existing neural-network analyses are non-constructive and do not guarantee practical performance. A constructive, scalable method with finite-sample guarantees is needed.

Method: Use a shallow neural network with randomized hidden weights and biases (random features) to approximate the KL objective; analyze the estimator to obtain finite-sample error bounds with high probability, where m is the number of neurons and T is the number of algorithm steps and samples.

Result: With high probability, the estimator achieves KL-divergence estimation error O(m^{-1/2}+T^{-1/3}).

Conclusion: Provides a practical, provably-accurate KL-divergence estimator via random-feature methods, bridging theory and implementable algorithms.

Abstract: Estimating the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between random variables is a
fundamental problem in statistical analysis. For continuous random variables,
traditional information-theoretic estimators scale poorly with dimension and/or
sample size. To mitigate this challenge, a variety of methods have been
proposed to estimate KL divergences and related quantities, such as mutual
information, using neural networks. The existing theoretical analyses show that
neural network parameters achieving low error exist. However, since they rely
on non-constructive neural network approximation theorems, they do not
guarantee that the existing algorithms actually achieve low error. In this
paper, we propose a KL divergence estimation algorithm using a shallow neural
network with randomized hidden weights and biases (i.e. a random feature
method). We show that with high probability, the algorithm achieves a KL
divergence estimation error of $O(m^{-1/2}+T^{-1/3})$, where $m$ is the number
of neurons and $T$ is both the number of steps of the algorithm and the number
of samples.

*Ahmad Alsheikh,Andreas Fischer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-efficient, transfer-learning, model-fusion deep learning framework generalizes temperature prediction for PET preforms across materials and geometries, reducing data needs while improving accuracy; validated on two case studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate and fast temperature prediction is essential for optimizing microwave preheating of PET preforms in industrial blow molding. Traditional models require retraining for each material or design and large datasets, hindering deployment across varied scenarios. A generalizable, data-efficient approach is needed.

Method: Develop a data-efficient neural architecture leveraging transfer learning and model fusion. Pretrain specialized regressors on distinct conditions (e.g., recycled PET heat capacities, varying preform geometries) and integrate their representations into a unified global model. Use skip connections to improve stability and prediction accuracy. This framework aims to learn shared thermal dynamics across heterogeneous inputs while reducing data requirements compared to training from scratch.

Result: The approach achieves superior generalization compared to models trained from scratch, with improved performance across material variability and geometric diversity. Experimental validation on two case studies demonstrates significant generalization gains, supporting a scalable ML-based solution for intelligent thermal control in manufacturing and indicating broad applicability to other industrial physical modeling tasks with limited data.

Conclusion: Data-efficient generalization strategies—via transfer learning and model fusion—can extend to industrial applications involving complex physical processes with limited data, enabling scalable, generalizable ML-based thermal control for manufacturing environments.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient temperature prediction is critical for optimizing the
preheating process of PET preforms in industrial microwave systems prior to
blow molding. We propose a novel deep learning framework for generalized
temperature prediction. Unlike traditional models that require extensive
retraining for each material or design variation, our method introduces a
data-efficient neural architecture that leverages transfer learning and model
fusion to generalize across unseen scenarios. By pretraining specialized neural
regressor on distinct conditions such as recycled PET heat capacities or
varying preform geometries and integrating their representations into a unified
global model, we create a system capable of learning shared thermal dynamics
across heterogeneous inputs. The architecture incorporates skip connections to
enhance stability and prediction accuracy. Our approach reduces the need for
large simulation datasets while achieving superior performance compared to
models trained from scratch. Experimental validation on two case studies
material variability and geometric diversity demonstrates significant
improvements in generalization, establishing a scalable ML-based solution for
intelligent thermal control in manufacturing environments. Moreover, the
approach highlights how data-efficient generalization strategies can extend to
other industrial applications involving complex physical modeling with limited
data.

### [192] [Comparing LSTM-Based Sequence-to-Sequence Forecasting Strategies for 24-Hour Solar Proton Flux Profiles Using GOES Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05399)
*Kangwoo Yi,Bo Shen,Qin Li,Haimin Wang,Yong-Jae Moon,Jaewon Lee,Hwanhee Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Seq2seq LSTM models can forecast 24-hour solar proton flux after SPE onsets. One-shot (non-iterative) forecasts outperform autoregressive methods, reducing error accumulation. Proton-only inputs work best on original data, while trend smoothing helps proton+X-ray inputs. Trend smoothing improves X-ray influence by reducing fluctuations, and although trend-smoothed models perform better on average, the single best model was trained on original data, indicating architecture can outweigh preprocessing benefits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, timely forecasts of proton flux are vital for radiation hazard warnings to satellites and astronauts. Iterative (autoregressive) approaches can accumulate error; evaluating seq2seq LSTM configurations and input schemes aims to identify robust forecast strategies for SPE-related proton flux profiles.

Method: 4-fold stratified cross-validation on 40 well-connected SPEs (1997–2017) observed by NOAA GOES. Systematically tested seq2seq LSTM configurations with varying hidden units and embedding dimensions across multiple forecasting scenarios: (i) proton-only vs proton+X-ray inputs, (ii) original flux data vs trend-smoothed data, (iii) autoregressive vs one-shot forecasting.

Result: One-shot forecasting generally yields lower error than autoregressive forecasting. On original data, proton-only models outperform proton+X-ray models; trend-smoothed data narrows or reverses this gap. Trend smoothing significantly boosts performance for proton+X-ray models by mitigating X-ray fluctuations. Although models trained on trend-smoothed data perform best on average, the single best model was trained on original data, suggesting architectural choices can outweigh preprocessing benefits.

Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of forecasting strategy and input design. One-shot seq2seq with carefully chosen inputs is advantageous for SPE proton flux prediction, and while data preprocessing (trend smoothing) can improve certain input configurations, architectural factors can dominate performance in some cases.

Abstract: Solar Proton Events (SPEs) cause significant radiation hazards to satellites,
astronauts, and technological systems. Accurate forecasting of their proton
flux time profiles is crucial for early warnings and mitigation. This paper
explores deep learning sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models based on Long
Short-Term Memory networks to predict 24-hour proton flux profiles following
SPE onsets. We used a dataset of 40 well-connected SPEs (1997-2017) observed by
NOAA GOES, each associated with a >=M-class western-hemisphere solar flare and
undisturbed proton flux profiles. Using 4-fold stratified cross-validation, we
evaluate seq2seq model configurations (varying hidden units and embedding
dimensions) under multiple forecasting scenarios: (i) proton-only input vs.
combined proton+X-ray input, (ii) original flux data vs. trend-smoothed data,
and (iii) autoregressive vs. one-shot forecasting. Our major results are as
follows: First, one-shot forecasting consistently yields lower error than
autoregressive prediction, avoiding the error accumulation seen in iterative
approaches. Second, on the original data, proton-only models outperform
proton+X-ray models. However, with trend-smoothed data, this gap narrows or
reverses in proton+X-ray models. Third, trend-smoothing significantly enhances
the performance of proton+X-ray models by mitigating fluctuations in the X-ray
channel. Fourth, while models trained on trendsmoothed data perform best on
average, the best-performing model was trained on original data, suggesting
that architectural choices can sometimes outweigh the benefits of data
preprocessing.

### [193] [Correlating Cross-Iteration Noise for DP-SGD using Model Curvature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05416)
*Xin Gu,Yingtai Xiao,Guanlin He,Jiamu Bai,Daniel Kifer,Kiwan Maeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes NoiseCurve to improve cross-iteration noise correlation in DP-MF for DP-SGD by using curvature estimates from public data, yielding accuracy gains over prior DP-MF correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DP-SGD suffers from a large accuracy gap with standard SGD. DP-MF improves privacy by correlating noise across iterations, but its correlation method is suboptimal. The paper seeks to enhance this correlation to boost model utility while maintaining privacy.

Method: Introduce NoiseCurve, a curvature-informed scheme that uses model curvature estimates derived from public unlabeled data to guide cross-iteration noise correlations, aiming to better cancel previous noise.

Result: Empirical results across multiple datasets, models, and privacy settings show NoiseCurve provides consistent and significant accuracy improvements over the DP-MF correlation scheme.

Conclusion: Curvature-informed cross-iteration noise correlation via NoiseCurve enhances DP-MF performance, closing part of the gap to non-private training and highlighting the value of public-data-derived curvature in privacy-preserving optimization.

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) offers the
promise of training deep learning models while mitigating many privacy risks.
However, there is currently a large accuracy gap between DP-SGD and normal SGD
training. This has resulted in different lines of research investigating
orthogonal ways of improving privacy-preserving training. One such line of
work, known as DP-MF, correlates the privacy noise across different iterations
of stochastic gradient descent -- allowing later iterations to cancel out some
of the noise added to earlier iterations. In this paper, we study how to
improve this noise correlation. We propose a technique called NoiseCurve that
uses model curvature, estimated from public unlabeled data, to improve the
quality of this cross-iteration noise correlation. Our experiments on various
datasets, models, and privacy parameters show that the noise correlations
computed by NoiseCurve offer consistent and significant improvements in
accuracy over the correlation scheme used by DP-MF.

### [194] [Draft, Verify, and Improve: Toward Training-Aware Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05421)
*Shrenik Bhansali,Larry Heck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DVI is a training-aware self-speculative framework for autoregressive decoding that uses online feedback from a verifier to continually improve the drafter, achieving a 2.16x wall-time speedup with far less training data while matching state-of-the-art performance and preserving lossless single-model deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive decoding is the latency bottleneck in large language models, and existing speculative decoding often requires heavy offline training or extra components, causing high data/compute costs and brittle drafters under distribution drift. A training-aware, online continual-learning approach could reduce training overhead and improve robustness.

Method: Partition the LLM into a drafter and a verifier. During generation, verifier accept/reject signals are used as supervision to update the drafter head. Employ a KL-to-RL schedule that starts with online distillation for calibration and then adds reward-masked cross-entropy with an on-policy policy-gradient term, enabling continual online learning within a single model deployment.

Result: On Spec-Bench, DVI achieves a 2.16x wall-time speedup, comparable to state-of-the-art approaches like EAGLE-2, but with orders of magnitude less training data. Ablations show DVI outperforms KL-only online distillation.

Conclusion: Training-aware self-speculation can deliver state-of-the-art, lossless speedups with minimal training overhead and single-model deployment.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) decoding is a major latency bottleneck for large language
models. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates AR by letting a drafter propose
multi-token blocks that a verifier accepts or rejects. However, many SD systems
require heavy offline training or extra components. These choices raise
data/compute cost and can yield brittle drafters under distribution drift. We
introduce \emph{Draft, Verify, \& Improve (DVI)}, a training-aware
self-speculative framework that combines inference with continual online
learning. We partition an LLM into a drafter and a verifier, and during
generation, verifier accept/reject decisions are converted into supervision
signals and used to update the drafter head. A simple \emph{KL$\rightarrow$RL}
schedule bootstraps calibration via online distillation and then adds
reward-masked cross-entropy with a on-policy policy-gradient term, preserving
lossless, single model deployment. On Spec-Bench, DVI achieves a $2.16\times$
wall-time speedup, on par with SoTA approaches like EAGLE-2, while orders of
magnitude less data for training, and ablations show that DVI outperforms
KL-only online distillation. DVI demonstrates that \emph{training-aware}
self-speculation can deliver state-of-the-art, lossless speedups with minimal
training overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper reviews physics-informed machine learning frameworks (PINNs, NODEs, NOs) and their biomedical applications, highlighting benefits for interpretability and data efficiency, and outlining challenges and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical systems are complex, multiscale, and often data-scarce; incorporating physical laws into learning (PIML) can improve interpretability, generalization, and reliability beyond black-box models.

Method: A survey of three PIML classes—physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), and neural operators (NOs)—discussing their biomedical applications (biomechanics, mechanobiology, pharmacokinetics, imaging, multiscale simulations) and highlighting implications for uncertainty, generalization, and integration with large language models.

Result: A synthesized landscape of current PIML applications in biomedicine, organized by framework, identifying benefits, limitations, and gaps; provides a roadmap of open challenges and future research directions.

Conclusion: PIML offers transformative potential for biomedical science, but realizing it requires advances in uncertainty quantification, generalization, data efficiency, and cross-cutting integration with large language models; the authors outline open challenges and directions for the field.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is emerging as a potentially
transformative paradigm for modeling complex biomedical systems by integrating
parameterized physical laws with data-driven methods. Here, we review three
main classes of PIML frameworks: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs),
neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), and neural operators (NOs),
highlighting their growing role in biomedical science and engineering. We begin
with PINNs, which embed governing equations into deep learning models and have
been successfully applied to biosolid and biofluid mechanics, mechanobiology,
and medical imaging among other areas. We then review NODEs, which offer
continuous-time modeling, especially suited to dynamic physiological systems,
pharmacokinetics, and cell signaling. Finally, we discuss deep NOs as powerful
tools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient
simulations across multiscale and spatially heterogeneous biological domains.
Throughout, we emphasize applications where physical interpretability, data
scarcity, or system complexity make conventional black-box learning
insufficient. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions
for advancing PIML in biomedical science and engineering, including issues of
uncertainty quantification, generalization, and integration of PIML and large
language models.

### [196] [Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Model Agent Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05442)
*Zizhao Wang,Dingcheng Li,Vaishakh Keshava,Phillip Wallis,Ananth Balashankar,Peter Stone,Lukas Rutishauser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARLAS uses adversarial reinforcement learning with two co-trained LLMs (an attacker and a defender) in a zero-sum game to generate diverse prompt injections and robustly defend tool-using agents, improving resistance to indirect prompt injections and task success on BrowserGym and AgentDojo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limited diversity of attack datasets built from manually crafted prompt injections and to reduce vulnerabilities of LLM agents that use external tools to the risk of data leakage and manipulation.

Method: Formulate a two-player zero-sum game where an attacker LLM learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent LLM learns to defend against them while performing tasks. A population-based learning framework trains the agent against all previous attacker checkpoints to avoid cyclic learning. Evaluation on BrowserGym and AgentDojo.

Result: Agents fine-tuned with ARLAS exhibit a significantly lower attack success rate and higher task success rate compared to the original model; the adversarial process yields a diverse and challenging set of attacks, resulting in a more robust agent.

Conclusion: ARLAS provides a scalable framework for enhancing agent safety against indirect prompt injections by using adversarial RL to broaden attack coverage and strengthen defenses when LLMs interact with tools.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can leverage tools such as Google Search to
complete complex tasks. However, this tool usage introduces the risk of
indirect prompt injections, where malicious instructions hidden in tool outputs
can manipulate the agent, posing security risks like data leakage. Current
defense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of
known attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually
crafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents
vulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework
that leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the
problem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker
that learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent
that learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To
ensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic
learning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent
to defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym
and AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower
attack success rate than the original model while also improving their task
success rate. Our analysis further confirms that the adversarial process
generates a diverse and challenging set of attacks, leading to a more robust
agent compared to the base model.

### [197] [Prior-Aligned Meta-RL: Thompson Sampling with Learned Priors and Guarantees in Finite-Horizon MDPs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05446)
*Runlin Zhou,Chixiang Chen,Elynn Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper develops meta-reinforcement learning for finite-horizon MDPs with linear Q-functions, introducing two Thompson-style algorithms (MTSRL and MTSRL+) that learn priors and widen covariances to control error, plus a prior-alignment technique for meta-regret guarantees, showing improved regret bounds and empirical efficiency under prior misspecification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve data-efficient meta-RL by exploiting shared structure across tasks through a learnable prior over task-specific Q-function parameters, and to provide theoretical meta-regret guarantees for Thompson-style RL with learned priors.

Method: Assume Q*_h(s,a)=Φ_h(s,a) θ_h^(k). Place Gaussian prior over θ_h with mean θ*_h and covariance Σ*_h. Develop two Thompson-style algorithms: (i) MTSRL – posterior sampling using learned prior mean with known covariance; (ii) MTSRL+ – also estimates covariance and uses prior widening to bound finite-sample error. Introduce prior-alignment that couples posterior under learned prior with a meta-oracle that knows the true prior to obtain meta-regret guarantees. Provide regret bounds for known covariance ~O(H^4 S^{3/2} sqrt(AN K)) and learned covariance ~O(H^4 S^{3/2} sqrt(AN^3 K)), with improved performance after certain task counts. Include simulations in a stateful recommendation environment under misspecification.

Result: Meta-regret guarantees for Thompson-style meta-RL with learned Q-priors are established. The results show that prior-independent Thompson sampling is matched in the small-task regime and strictly improved upon as the prior is learned; bounds indicate better scaling than prior-independent methods once enough tasks are observed. Practically, the algorithms track a meta-oracle after brief exploration and outperform prior-independent RL and bandit baselines in simulations; the paper also offers practical procedures (RLSVI warm-start, OLS aggregation, covariance widening).

Conclusion: The work provides the first meta-regret guarantees for Thompson-style RL with learned Q-priors, demonstrating theoretical and empirical gains in meta-RL under structured Q-functions and learns priors from data; it also offers practical guidance for experiment-rich settings.

Abstract: We study meta-reinforcement learning in finite-horizon MDPs where related
tasks share similar structures in their optimal action-value functions.
Specifically, we posit a linear representation
$Q^*_h(s,a)=\Phi_h(s,a)\,\theta^{(k)}_h$ and place a Gaussian meta-prior $
\mathcal{N}(\theta^*_h,\Sigma^*_h)$ over the task-specific parameters
$\theta^{(k)}_h$. Building on randomized value functions, we propose two
Thompson-style algorithms: (i) MTSRL, which learns only the prior mean and
performs posterior sampling with the learned mean and known covariance; and
(ii) $\text{MTSRL}^{+}$, which additionally estimates the covariance and
employs prior widening to control finite-sample estimation error. Further, we
develop a prior-alignment technique that couples the posterior under the
learned prior with a meta-oracle that knows the true prior, yielding
meta-regret guarantees: we match prior-independent Thompson sampling in the
small-task regime and strictly improve with more tasks once the prior is
learned. Concretely, for known covariance we obtain
$\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{ANK})$ meta-regret, and with learned covariance
$\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{AN^3K})$; both recover a better behavior than
prior-independent after $K \gtrsim \tilde{O}(H^2)$ and $K \gtrsim
\tilde{O}(N^2H^2)$, respectively. Simulations on a stateful recommendation
environment (with feature and prior misspecification) show that after brief
exploration, MTSRL/MTSRL\(^+\) track the meta-oracle and substantially
outperform prior-independent RL and bandit-only meta-baselines. Our results
give the first meta-regret guarantees for Thompson-style RL with learned
Q-priors, and provide practical recipes (warm-start via RLSVI, OLS aggregation,
covariance widening) for experiment-rich settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quantile DeepGR4J extends a conceptual rainfall-runoff model by integrating a quantile regression ensemble to quantify predictive uncertainty, enabling multi-step forecasts and flood-risk warnings on CAMELS-Aus with improved accuracy and better uncertainty intervals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify and leverage predictive uncertainty in rainfall–runoff modelling and extreme-event forecasting, building on DeepGR4J to improve reliability for water management and early flood warnings.

Method: Develop a quantile regression–based ensemble framework atop the DeepGR4J surrogate for the routing component, extend to multi-step streamflow prediction, and evaluate uncertainty bounds and interval quality using the CAMELS-Aus dataset, including flood risk assessment.

Result: The Quantile DeepGR4J framework yields higher predictive accuracy and better uncertainty interval quality (lower interval scores) than baseline deep learning models; uncertainty bounds facilitate early identification of extreme flow events and support flood-risk evaluation.

Conclusion: Quantile DeepGR4J demonstrates effective uncertainty quantification and improved flood-risk forecasting in conceptual rainfall–runoff modelling, showing promise as an operational tool for early warning systems in arid catchments.

Abstract: Conceptual rainfall-runoff models aid hydrologists and climate scientists in
modelling streamflow to inform water management practices. Recent advances in
deep learning have unravelled the potential for combining hydrological models
with deep learning models for better interpretability and improved predictive
performance. In our previous work, we introduced DeepGR4J, which enhanced the
GR4J conceptual rainfall-runoff model using a deep learning model to serve as a
surrogate for the routing component. DeepGR4J had an improved rainfall-runoff
prediction accuracy, particularly in arid catchments. Quantile regression
models have been extensively used for quantifying uncertainty while aiding
extreme value forecasting. In this paper, we extend DeepGR4J using a quantile
regression-based ensemble learning framework to quantify uncertainty in
streamflow prediction. We also leverage the uncertainty bounds to identify
extreme flow events potentially leading to flooding. We further extend the
model to multi-step streamflow predictions for uncertainty bounds. We design
experiments for a detailed evaluation of the proposed framework using the
CAMELS-Aus dataset. The results show that our proposed Quantile DeepGR4J
framework improves the predictive accuracy and uncertainty interval quality
(interval score) compared to baseline deep learning models. Furthermore, we
carry out flood risk evaluation using Quantile DeepGR4J, and the results
demonstrate its suitability as an early warning system.

Motivation: Large Language Models require heavy distributed training; communicating activations/gradients and high compute on edge devices is costly. Need methods that balance efficiency and performance in collaborative settings.

Method: Introduce Parameter-efficient Split Learning for collaboration; develop AMAQ that progressively quantizes activations/gradients from 6–8 bits down to 3–4 bits, allocating bit budgets across channels via bit regularization; integrates into multi-machine training.

Result: With the same bit budgets, AMAQ yields about 2.5% higher generation accuracy and ~1.3% better classification accuracy on LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B, improves training stability, reduces ultra-low bit collapse, and operates with modest communication overhead for bit adaptation.

Conclusion: AMAQ is a practical, effective solution for collaborative training on low-resource devices, achieving better accuracy and stability with minimal extra communication cost.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are scaling rapidly, creating significant
challenges for collaborative server client distributed training, particularly
in terms of communication efficiency and computational overheads. To address
these challenges, we implement Parameter-efficient Split Learning, which
effectively balances efficiency and performance for collaborative training on
low-resource devices.
  To reduce communication overhead in collaborative training, we introduce
Adaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ), a strategy that
progressively compresses activations and gradients from high precision (6 to 8
bits) to low precision (3 to 4 bits). AMAQ achieves this by effectively
allocating bit budgets across channels based on feature wise and layer wise
importance using bit regularization.
  Under the same bit budgets, AMAQ outperforms fixed-precision approaches,
delivering about 2.5% higher generation accuracy and about 1.3% better
classification accuracy for models like LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B. In addition,
it significantly enhances training stability and reducing ultra-low bit
representation collapse during the training.
  Experiments demonstrate that AMAQ integrates effectively into practical
multi-machine collaborative training setups, offering superior inference
accuracy with only a modest communication overhead for bits adaptation during
training. This trade off makes AMAQ a practical and effective solution for
collaborative training with minimal communication cost.

### [200] [ATOM: A Pretrained Neural Operator for Multitask Molecular Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05482)
*Luke Thompson,Davy Guan,Dai Shi,Slade Matthews,Junbin Gao,Andi Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ATOM: a multitask MD model using a quasi-equivariant transformer operator with temporal attention, pretrained on TG80; achieves SOTA on MD benchmarks and strong zero-shot generalization to unseen molecules across varying time horizons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ML MD methods often enforce strict equivariance and rely on sequential rollouts, limiting flexibility, efficiency, and generalization to new compounds and longer timescales.

Method: Introduce ATOM, a pretrained transformer neural operator for multitask molecular dynamics. It uses a quasi-equivariant design without explicit molecular graphs and applies temporal attention to parallel-decode multiple future states. Trained on TG80, a large, diverse MD dataset across 80 compounds and multiple timescales, enabling multitask pretraining and transfer.

Result: ATOM achieves state-of-the-art performance on MD17, RMD17, and MD22 single-task benchmarks. Multitask pretraining on TG80 yields exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen molecules across varying time horizons.

Conclusion: ATOM advances accurate, efficient, and transferable MD modeling, demonstrating the value of multitask pretraining and transformer-based operator design for molecular dynamics.

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations underpin modern computational drug dis-
covery, materials science, and biochemistry. Recent machine learning models
provide high-fidelity MD predictions without the need to repeatedly solve
quantum mechanical forces, enabling significant speedups over conventional
pipelines. Yet many such methods typically enforce strict equivariance and rely
on sequential rollouts, thus limiting their flexibility and simulation
efficiency. They are also com- monly single-task, trained on individual
molecules and fixed timeframes, which restricts generalization to unseen
compounds and extended timesteps. To address these issues, we propose Atomistic
Transformer Operator for Molecules (ATOM), a pretrained transformer neural
operator for multitask molecular dynamics. ATOM adopts a quasi-equivariant
design that requires no explicit molecular graph and employs a temporal
attention mechanism, allowing for the accurate parallel decod- ing of multiple
future states. To support operator pretraining across chemicals and timescales,
we curate TG80, a large, diverse, and numerically stable MD dataset with over
2.5 million femtoseconds of trajectories across 80 compounds. ATOM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on established single-task benchmarks, such as
MD17, RMD17 and MD22. After multitask pretraining on TG80, ATOM shows
exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen molecules across varying time
hori- zons. We believe ATOM represents a significant step toward accurate,
efficient, and transferable molecular dynamics models

### [201] [The Method of Infinite Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05489)
*Reza T. Batley,Sourav Saha*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes 'Infinite Descent' — a semi-analytic optimization paradigm that solves the first-order optimality condition exactly via infinite Taylor resummation, exemplified by the AION architecture achieving single-step optimum; defines the Infinity Class for non-iterative learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Move beyond truncated/iterative gradient methods toward exact, non-iterative optimization by exploiting analytic structure; enable direct solve of the optimality condition through algebraic equations.

Method: Develops the Method of Infinite Descent, reformulating training as directly solving the first-order optimality condition. Uses analytical resummation of the Taylor expansion to obtain an exact algebraic update equation. Derives the infinite Taylor tower resummation and proposes an algorithm for the direct solve. Introduces AION, an architecture designed to satisfy the required algebraic closure.

Result: In a simple test problem, AION reaches the optimum in a single descent step, demonstrating exact, non-iterative convergence. The approach suggests a broader class of semi-analytically optimisable models (Infinity Class) that could enable non-iterative learning across suitably closed architectures.

Conclusion: Infinite Descent offers a pathway to non-iterative learning by leveraging analytic structure and algebraic closure. If architectures satisfy the specified conditions, direct optimization steps can replace iterative updates, expanding training paradigms beyond traditional gradient-based methods.

Abstract: Training - the optimisation of complex models - is traditionally performed
through small, local, iterative updates [D. E. Rumelhart, G. E. Hinton, R. J.
Williams, Nature 323, 533-536 (1986)]. Approximating solutions through
truncated gradients is a paradigm dating back to Cauchy [A.-L. Cauchy, Comptes
Rendus Math\'ematique 25, 536-538 (1847)] and Newton [I. Newton, The Method of
Fluxions and Infinite Series (Henry Woodfall, London, 1736)]. This work
introduces the Method of Infinite Descent, a semi-analytic optimisation
paradigm that reformulates training as the direct solution to the first-order
optimality condition. By analytical resummation of its Taylor expansion, this
method yields an exact, algebraic equation for the update step. Realisation of
the infinite Taylor tower's cascading resummation is formally derived, and an
exploitative algorithm for the direct solve step is proposed.
  This principle is demonstrated with the herein-introduced AION (Analytic,
Infinitely-Optimisable Network) architecture. AION is a model designed
expressly to satisfy the algebraic closure required by Infinite Descent. In a
simple test problem, AION reaches the optimum in a single descent step.
Together, this optimiser-model pair exemplify how analytic structure enables
exact, non-iterative convergence. Infinite Descent extends beyond this example,
applying to any appropriately closed architecture. This suggests a new class of
semi-analytically optimisable models: the \emph{Infinity Class}; sufficient
conditions for class membership are discussed. This offers a pathway toward
non-iterative learning.

### [202] [NorMuon: Making Muon more efficient and scalable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05491)
*Zichong Li,Liming Liu,Chen Liang,Weizhu Chen,Tuo Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NorMuon combines Muon's orthogonalized updates with neuron-wise adaptive learning rates via row-wise normalization, delivering balanced parameter utilization and preserved conditioning with improved training efficiency and similar memory footprint.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon's orthogonalization improves optimization geometry but creates highly non-uniform neuron norms, causing some neurons to dominate updates and potentially hindering learning efficiency.

Method: Introduce neuron-wise normalization after orthogonalization, and maintain second-order momentum statistics per neuron. Distribute the orthogonalization computations across devices under the FSDP2 framework to enable scalable deployment, preserving Muon's conditioning benefits while achieving balanced updates.

Result: NorMuon consistently outperforms both Adam and Muon across multiple model scales, achieving 21.74% higher training efficiency than Adam and 11.31% higher efficiency than Muon on a 1.1B pretraining setup, with a memory footprint comparable to Muon.

Conclusion: Orthogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than competing approaches. NorMuon demonstrates that balancing neuron utilization while preserving conditioning can yield substantial efficiency gains, suggesting new directions for optimizer design in large-scale deep learning.

Abstract: The choice of optimizer significantly impacts the training efficiency and
computational costs of large language models (LLMs). Recently, the Muon
optimizer has demonstrated promising results by orthogonalizing parameter
updates, improving optimization geometry through better conditioning. Despite
Muon's emergence as a candidate successor to Adam, the potential for jointly
leveraging their strengths has not been systematically explored. In this work,
we bridge this gap by proposing NorMuon (Neuron-wise Normalized Muon), an
optimizer that synergistically combines orthogonalization with neuron-level
adaptive learning rates. Our analysis reveals that while Muon effectively
reduces condition numbers, the resulting updates exhibit highly non-uniform
neuron norms, causing certain neurons to dominate the optimization process.
NorMuon addresses this imbalance by maintaining second-order momentum
statistics for each neuron and applying row-wise normalization after
orthogonalization, ensuring balanced parameter utilization while preserving
Muon's conditioning benefits. To enable practical deployment at scale, we
develop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that
strategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices.
Experiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently
outperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency
than Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while
maintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that
orthogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than
competing approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale
deep learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion-based ECG synthesis framework (MIDT-ECG) with time-frequency supervision and demographic conditioning to produce high-fidelity, privacy-preserving, patient-specific ECGs; shows improved morphology, privacy metrics, interlead correlation, and utility in low-data regimes on PTB-XL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy restrictions hinder sharing real patient ECG data; existing generative ECGs lack trustworthiness and clinical utility; need faithful morphology and personalization without compromising privacy.

Method: Two innovations: MIDT-ECG training with Mel-Spectrogram guided diffusion (time-frequency supervision) to enforce physiological realism, and multi-modal demographic conditioning to enable patient-specific synthesis; based on a conditional diffusion-based Structured State Space Model (SSSD-ECG).

Result: Improved morphological coherence; privacy metrics exceed baseline by 4-8%; interlead correlation error reduced by ~74%; demographic conditioning improves SNR and personalization; in low-data regimes, classifiers trained with synthetic data reach performance close to those trained on real data.

Conclusion: ECG synthesizers with time-frequency regularization enable personalized, high-fidelity, privacy-preserving surrogates when real data are scarce, supporting responsible use of generative AI in healthcare.

Abstract: The development of machine learning for cardiac care is severely hampered by
privacy restrictions on sharing real patient electrocardiogram (ECG) data.
Although generative AI offers a promising solution, the real-world use of
existing model-synthesized ECGs is limited by persistent gaps in
trustworthiness and clinical utility. In this work, we address two major
shortcomings of current generative ECG methods: insufficient morphological
fidelity and the inability to generate personalized, patient-specific
physiological signals. To address these gaps, we build on a conditional
diffusion-based Structured State Space Model (SSSD-ECG) with two principled
innovations: (1) MIDT-ECG (Mel-Spectrogram Informed Diffusion Training), a
novel training paradigm with time-frequency domain supervision to enforce
physiological structural realism, and (2) multi-modal demographic conditioning
to enable patient-specific synthesis. We comprehensively evaluate our approach
on the PTB-XL dataset, assessing the synthesized ECG signals on fidelity,
clinical coherence, privacy preservation, and downstream task utility. MIDT-ECG
achieves substantial gains: it improves morphological coherence, preserves
strong privacy guarantees with all metrics evaluated exceeding the baseline by
4-8%, and notably reduces the interlead correlation error by an average of 74%,
while demographic conditioning enhances signal-to-noise ratio and
personalization. In critical low-data regimes, a classifier trained on datasets
supplemented with our synthetic ECGs achieves performance comparable to a
classifier trained solely on real data. Together, we demonstrate that ECG
synthesizers, trained with the proposed time-frequency structural
regularization scheme, can serve as personalized, high-fidelity,
privacy-preserving surrogates when real data are scarce, advancing the
responsible use of generative AI in healthcare.

### [204] [Fundamental Limits of Crystalline Equivariant Graph Neural Networks: A Circuit Complexity Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05494)
*Yang Cao,Zhao Song,Jiahao Zhang,Jiale Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Equivariant GNNs for crystalline-structure prediction lie in TC^0 under realistic resource constraints, giving a concrete ceiling on what problems they can solve; surpassing this regime requires deeper or richer architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the expressive power and computational limits of equivariant GNNs (EGNNs) in periodic crystalline settings, and to provide a complexity-theoretic foundation for symmetry-aware graph learning on crystals.

Method: Analyze EGNN computations on node features, coordinates, and lattice matrices under polynomial precision; characterize embedding width and network depth; show that with O(n) width, O(1) layers and O(1)-depth, O(n)-width MLPs, the computations can be simulated by a uniform TC^0 threshold circuit family of polynomial size, establishing a constant-depth bound for these architectures.

Result: Demonstrates that such EGNN instantiations can be captured by uniform TC^0 circuits of polynomial size, revealing an expressivity ceiling under realistic resources and clarifying how architectural changes (more depth, richer geometric primitives, or wider layers) are needed to exceed this regime.

Conclusion: Places EGNNs for crystalline systems within a well-defined complexity class, complementing Weisfeiler-Lehman type results, and provides a principled guide for designing symmetry-aware models that transcend TC^0 limits.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a core paradigm for learning on
relational data. In materials science, equivariant GNNs (EGNNs) have emerged as
a compelling backbone for crystalline-structure prediction, owing to their
ability to respect Euclidean symmetries and periodic boundary conditions.
Despite strong empirical performance, their expressive power in periodic,
symmetry-constrained settings remains poorly understood. This work
characterizes the intrinsic computational and expressive limits of EGNNs for
crystalline-structure prediction through a circuit-complexity lens. We analyze
the computations carried out by EGNN layers acting on node features, atomic
coordinates, and lattice matrices, and prove that, under polynomial precision,
embedding width $d=O(n)$ for $n$ nodes, $O(1)$ layers, and $O(1)$-depth,
$O(n)$-width MLP instantiations of the message/update/readout maps, these
models admit a simulation by a uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ threshold-circuit family
of polynomial size (with an explicit constant-depth bound). Situating EGNNs
within $\mathsf{TC}^0$ provides a concrete ceiling on the decision and
prediction problems solvable by such architectures under realistic resource
constraints and clarifies which architectural modifications (e.g., increased
depth, richer geometric primitives, or wider layers) are required to transcend
this regime. The analysis complements Weisfeiler-Lehman style results that do
not directly transfer to periodic crystals, and offers a complexity-theoretic
foundation for symmetry-aware graph learning on crystalline systems.

### [205] [EEG-Based Acute Pain Classification: Machine Learning Model Comparison and Real-Time Clinical Feasibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05511)
*Aavid Mathrawala,Dhruv Kurup,Josie Lau*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EEG-based machine learning can reliably distinguish high vs low/no pain with offline ~89% accuracy and real-time ~4 ms latency, using 52-feature EEG representations; supports feasibility of an EEG pain monitor for clinical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pain assessment is subjective and unreliable for sedated or cognitively impaired patients; EEG-based nociceptive markers could provide an objective, noninvasive pain monitor.

Method: 52 healthy adults were exposed to laser-evoked pain at three intensities. 4-second EEG epochs were converted into 537 features (spectral power, band ratios, Hjorth, entropy, coherence, wavelet energies, peak frequency). Nine ML models evaluated with leave-one-participant-out CV; SVM with RBF kernel performed best offline (88.9%); real-time XGBoost achieved end-to-end latency ~4 ms with 94.2% accuracy.

Result: Best offline accuracy 88.9% (SVM-RBF). Real-time latency ~1 ms for offline inference; real-time pipeline maintained end-to-end latency ~4 ms with 94.2% accuracy. Feature-importance patterns matched known nociceptive physiology: contralateral alpha suppression, midline theta/alpha enhancement, frontal gamma bursts.

Conclusion: An EEG-based pain monitor is technically feasible in clinical settings and lays the groundwork for clinical validation, potentially enabling continuous objective nociception monitoring in patients who cannot communicate.

Abstract: Current pain assessment within hospitals often relies on self-reporting or
non-specific EKG vital signs. This system leaves critically ill, sedated, and
cognitively impaired patients vulnerable to undertreated pain and opioid
overuse. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a noninvasive method of measuring
brain activity. This technology could potentially be applied as an assistive
tool to highlight nociceptive processing in order to mitigate this issue. In
this study, we compared machine learning models for classifying high-pain
versus low/no-pain EEG epochs using data from fifty-two healthy adults exposed
to laser-evoked pain at three intensities (low, medium, high). Each four-second
epoch was transformed into a 537-feature vector spanning spectral power, band
ratios, Hjorth parameters, entropy measures, coherence, wavelet energies, and
peak-frequency metrics. Nine traditional machine learning models were evaluated
with leave-one-participant-out cross-validation. A support vector machine with
radial basis function kernel achieved the best offline performance with 88.9%
accuracy and sub-millisecond inference time (1.02 ms). Our Feature importance
analysis was consistent with current canonical pain physiology, showing
contralateral alpha suppression, midline theta/alpha enhancement, and frontal
gamma bursts. The real-time XGBoost model maintained an end-to-end latency of
about 4 ms and 94.2% accuracy, demonstrating that an EEG-based pain monitor is
technically feasible within a clinical setting and provides a pathway towards
clinical validation.

*Wei-Ting Tang,Akshay Kudva,Joel A. Paulson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeST-BO is a local Bayesian optimization method that targets Newton steps by jointly learning gradient and Hessian with Gaussian process surrogates, using a one-step lookahead bound to select evaluations, and scaling to high dimensions via low-dimensional subspaces, achieving faster convergence and lower regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional expensive black-box optimization where standard BO struggles; there is a need for scalable methods that leverage curvature information and local Newton-type steps to improve convergence.

Method: Learn gradient and Hessian via GP surrogates and optimize the acquisition using a one-step lookahead bound on Newton-step error; use batch size to contract error; scale to high dimensions by optimizing in low-dimensional subspaces (random embeddings or learned sparse subspaces), reducing curvature-learning cost from O(d^2) to O(m^2) with m ≪ d.

Result: Empirically, NeST-BO outperforms state-of-the-art local and high-dimensional BO baselines across high-dimensional synthetic and real-world problems, including those with thousands of variables and unknown active subspaces, in terms of faster convergence and lower regret.

Conclusion: NeST-BO offers a scalable, theoretically grounded framework for high-dimensional BO by combining curvature-aware steps with subspace-based optimization, achieving global progress and quadratic local rates under mild assumptions.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is effective for expensive black-box problems but
remains challenging in high dimensions. We propose NeST-BO, a local BO method
that targets the Newton step by jointly learning gradient and Hessian
information with Gaussian process surrogates, and selecting evaluations via a
one-step lookahead bound on Newton-step error. We show that this bound (and
hence the step error) contracts with batch size, so NeST-BO directly inherits
inexact-Newton convergence: global progress under mild stability assumptions
and quadratic local rates once steps are sufficiently accurate. To scale, we
optimize the acquisition in low-dimensional subspaces (e.g., random embeddings
or learned sparse subspaces), reducing the dominant cost of learning curvature
from $O(d^2)$ to $O(m^2)$ with $m \ll d$ while preserving step targeting.
Across high-dimensional synthetic and real-world problems, including cases with
thousands of variables and unknown active subspaces, NeST-BO consistently
yields faster convergence and lower regret than state-of-the-art local and
high-dimensional BO baselines.

### [207] [Provably Mitigating Corruption, Overoptimization, and Verbosity Simultaneously in Offline and Online RLHF/DPO Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05526)
*Ziyi Chen,Junyi Li,Peiran Yu,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces RLHF-COV and DPO-COV to simultaneously mitigate corrupted preferences, reward overoptimization, and verbosity bias; provides length-regularized generalization guarantees, shows equivalence to vanilla RLHF/DPO, and demonstrates effectiveness offline/online without reward estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Align large language models more reliably with human preferences by addressing three core issues—corrupted preferences, reward overoptimization, and verbosity bias—that collectively degrade RLHF and DPO performance; existing approaches often tackle issues in isolation and require heavy computation.

Method: Proposes COV variants of RLHF and DPO. These methods incorporate length-regularization and bias-mitigation to handle corrupted data without requiring reward model estimation; proves that DPO-COV is equivalent to RLHF-COV, implying an equivalence between vanilla RLHF and DPO. Provides theoretical bounds on length-regularized generalization error for the DPO-COV trained on corrupted data; validates empirically in offline and online settings.

Result: Theoretical guarantees show length-regularized generalization error rates for DPO-COV on corrupted data that match best-known rates for simpler, clean-data scenarios without length regularization. Empirical results demonstrate effectiveness in both offline and online experiments, and the implementation is simple (no reward estimation). The equivalence between DPO-COV and RLHF-COV implies an equivalence between vanilla RLHF and DPO algorithms.

Conclusion: COV offers a unified, computation-efficient framework that tackles three major RLHF/DPO shortcomings, with solid theoretical guarantees and practical effectiveness, and it bridges RLHF and DPO by proving their equivalence under the COV paradigm.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference
optimization (DPO) are important techniques to align large language models
(LLM) with human preference. However, the quality of RLHF and DPO training is
seriously compromised by \textit{\textbf{C}orrupted} preference, reward
\textit{\textbf{O}veroptimization}, and bias towards
\textit{\textbf{V}erbosity}. To our knowledge, most existing works tackle only
one of these important issues, and the few other works require much computation
to estimate multiple reward models and lack theoretical guarantee of
generalization ability. In this work, we propose RLHF-\textbf{COV} and
DPO-\textbf{COV} algorithms that can simultaneously mitigate these three
issues, in both offline and online settings. This ability is theoretically
demonstrated by obtaining length-regularized generalization error rates for our
DPO-COV algorithms trained on corrupted data, which match the best-known rates
for simpler cases with clean data and without length regularization. Moreover,
our DPO-COV algorithm is simple to implement without reward estimation, and is
proved to be equivalent to our RLHF-COV algorithm, which directly implies the
equivalence between the vanilla RLHF and DPO algorithms. Experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our DPO-COV algorithms under both offline and
online settings.

*Yuyao Wang,Yu-Hung Cheng,Debarghya Mukherjee,Huimin Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GTRANS uses transfer learning to improve graphon estimation on small graphs by aligning patterns from a larger source graph via neighborhood smoothing and Gromov-Wasserstein OT, with adaptive debiasing; yields stability guarantees and better downstream task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graphon estimation requires large graphs; small target graphs lead to high error. Transfer learning from a related larger graph can transfer structural information. Need to prevent negative transfer; propose adaptive debiasing via residual smoothing.

Method: Combine neighborhood smoothing with Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport to align graphs; adaptive debiasing identifies and corrects target-specific deviations; theoretical stability guarantees for alignment matrix; experiments on synthetic/real data.

Result: Improved accuracy of target graph estimation; better downstream performance in graph classification and link prediction; validated on synthetic and real data.

Conclusion: GTRANS effectively leverages source graphs to enhance target graphon estimation, with a robust mechanism against negative transfer and practical gains in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Graphon models provide a flexible nonparametric framework for estimating
latent connectivity probabilities in networks, enabling a range of downstream
applications such as link prediction and data augmentation. However, accurate
graphon estimation typically requires a large graph, whereas in practice, one
often only observes a small-sized network. One approach to addressing this
issue is to adopt a transfer learning framework, which aims to improve
estimation in a small target graph by leveraging structural information from a
larger, related source graph. In this paper, we propose a novel method, namely
GTRANS, a transfer learning framework that integrates neighborhood smoothing
and Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport to align and transfer structural
patterns between graphs. To prevent negative transfer, GTRANS includes an
adaptive debiasing mechanism that identifies and corrects for target-specific
deviations via residual smoothing. We provide theoretical guarantees on the
stability of the estimated alignment matrix and demonstrate the effectiveness
of GTRANS in improving the accuracy of target graph estimation through
extensive synthetic and real data experiments. These improvements translate
directly to enhanced performance in downstream applications, such as the graph
classification task and the link prediction task.

### [209] [ARMOR: High-Performance Semi-Structured Pruning via Adaptive Matrix Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05528)
*Lawrence Liu,Alexander Liu,Mengdi Wang,Tuo Zhao,Lin F. Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARMOR is a one-shot post-training pruning method for LLMs that factorizes weight matrices into a 2:4 sparse core wrapped by two block-diagonal matrices, optimized via block-coordinate descent to minimize a layer-wise proxy loss. It delivers better accuracy than state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning while preserving speedups and memory benefits on Llama and Qwen models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs demand enormous compute/memory. While 2:4 sparsity can enable hardware acceleration, many pruning methods degrade performance significantly. A method that preserves task accuracy while achieving aggressive sparsity is needed.

Method: Each weight matrix is factorized into a 2:4 sparse core sandwiched by two low-overhead, block-diagonal wrappers (pre- and post-transformations). The wrappers act as error correctors. A block coordinate descent algorithm selects the sparse core and wrappers by minimizing a layer-wise proxy loss. The approach is a one-shot post-training pruning procedure with convergence guarantees.

Result: ARMOR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning methods across a range of downstream tasks and perplexity evaluations on Llama and Qwen model families, while maintaining the speedups and memory reductions typical of 2:4 pruning.

Conclusion: ARMOR offers a more effective and hardware-friendly pruning strategy that achieves higher accuracy with similar computational and memory benefits, supported by convergence guarantees for its optimization objective.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their immense computational and memory requirements. While semi-structured
pruning, particularly 2:4 sparsity, offers a path to practical hardware
acceleration, existing methods often incur substantial performance degradation.
To bridge this gap, we introduce ARMOR: (Adaptive Representation with
Matrix-factORization), a novel one-shot post-training pruning algorithm.
Instead of directly pruning weights, ARMOR factorizes each weight matrix into a
2:4 sparse core wrapped by two low-overhead, block diagonal matrices. These
wrappers act as efficient pre and post-transformation error correctors,
offering greater flexibility to preserve model quality compared to conventional
2:4 pruning techniques. The sparse core and block diagonal wrappers are chosen
through a block coordinate descent algorithm that minimizes a layer-wise proxy
loss. We theoretically prove this optimization is guaranteed to converge to a
solution with a proxy loss less than or equal to state-of-the-art pruning
algorithms. Experiments on Llama (Touvron et al., 2023; Dubey et al., 2024) and
Qwen (Yang et al., 2025) model families demonstrate that ARMOR consistently and
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning methods across a wide
range of downstream tasks and perplexity evaluations. ARMOR achieves this
superior performance while retaining the inference speedups and substantial
memory usage reductions of 2:4 pruning, establishing a more effective trade-off
between model compression and task accuracy

### [210] [LATTA: Langevin-Anchored Test-Time Adaptation for Enhanced Robustness and Stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05530)
*Harshil Vejendla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LATTA introduces noisy weight perturbations via Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics and a stable weight anchor to perform test-time adaptation, improving stability and accuracy over prior methods without architectural changes or Monte Carlo passes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address instability and catastrophic forgetting in test-time adaptation (TTA) caused by overly deterministic updates on complex loss surfaces, especially with small batch sizes and corruptions.

Method: Two components: (1) noisy weight perturbation inspired by Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics to explore parameter space; (2) a stable weight anchor to prevent drift from source pre-training. No architectural changes or expensive Monte Carlo passes; compatible with self-supervised TTA.

Result: On Rotated-MNIST and CIFAR-10-C, LATTA outperforms Tent, CoTTA, and EATA, achieving >2% absolute improvement in average accuracy on CIFAR-10-C and reduced variance.

Conclusion: LATTA provides more stable and effective test-time adaptation by balancing exploration and anchoring, achieving state-of-the-art performance without additional architectural changes or heavy computation.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt a pretrained model to distribution
shifts using only unlabeled test data. While promising, existing methods like
Tent suffer from instability and can catastrophically forget the source
knowledge, especially with small batch sizes or challenging corruptions. We
argue that this arises from overly deterministic updates on a complex loss
surface. In this paper, we introduce Langevin-Anchored Test-Time Adaptation
(LATTA), a novel approach that regularizes adaptation through two key
mechanisms: (1) a noisy weight perturbation inspired by Stochastic Gradient
Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) to explore the local parameter space and escape poor
local minima, and (2) a stable weight anchor that prevents the model from
diverging from its robust source pre-training. This combination allows LATTA to
adapt effectively without sacrificing stability. Unlike prior Bayesian TTA
methods, LATTA requires no architectural changes or expensive Monte Carlo
passes. We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including
Rotated-MNIST and the more challenging CIFAR-10-C. Our results demonstrate that
LATTA significantly outperforms existing methods, including Tent, CoTTA, and
EATA, setting a new state of the art for self-supervised TTA by improving
average accuracy on CIFAR-10-C by over 2% while simultaneously reducing
performance variance.

### [211] [Permutation-Invariant Representation Learning for Robust and Privacy-Preserving Feature Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05535)
*Rui Liu,Tao Zhe,Yanjie Fu,Feng Xia,Ted Senator,Dongjie Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedCAPS-like framework for privacy-preserving, federated feature selection that combines permutation-invariant embeddings with policy-guided search, plus privacy-preserving knowledge fusion and sample-aware weighting to handle heterogeneous, privacy-constrained clients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feature selection methods struggle with complex feature interactions and adaptation across diverse scenarios. Generative approaches face permutation sensitivity and gradient-convexity limitations. In distributed, privacy-restricted settings, raw data sharing is prohibited, necessitating federated, privacy-preserving techniques with balanced handling of heterogeneity.

Method: Integrates permutation-invariant embedding with policy-guided search. Extends to federated scenarios by introducing (i) a privacy-preserving knowledge fusion strategy to build a unified representation without sharing raw data, and (ii) a sample-aware weighting scheme to address distributional imbalances among heterogeneous local clients.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of the framework, with strong generalization in federated learning settings; code and data are publicly available.

Conclusion: The work advances feature selection in distributed, privacy-constrained environments by coupling permutation-invariant embeddings with policy-guided search and adding privacy-preserving knowledge fusion and sample-aware weighting for heterogeneity; it shows broad applicability and room for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Feature selection eliminates redundancy among features to improve downstream
task performance while reducing computational overhead. Existing methods often
struggle to capture intricate feature interactions and adapt across diverse
application scenarios. Recent advances employ generative intelligence to
alleviate these drawbacks. However, these methods remain constrained by
permutation sensitivity in embedding and reliance on convexity assumptions in
gradient-based search. To address these limitations, our initial work
introduces a novel framework that integrates permutation-invariant embedding
with policy-guided search. Although effective, it still left opportunities to
adapt to realistic distributed scenarios. In practice, data across local
clients is highly imbalanced, heterogeneous and constrained by strict privacy
regulations, limiting direct sharing. These challenges highlight the need for a
framework that can integrate feature selection knowledge across clients without
exposing sensitive information. In this extended journal version, we advance
the framework from two perspectives: 1) developing a privacy-preserving
knowledge fusion strategy to derive a unified representation space without
sharing sensitive raw data. 2) incorporating a sample-aware weighting strategy
to address distributional imbalance among heterogeneous local clients.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of
our framework. The results further demonstrate its strong generalization
ability in federated learning scenarios. The code and data are publicly
available: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FedCAPS-08BF.

### [212] [Critical attention scaling in long-context transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05554)
*Shi Chen,Zhengjiang Lin,Yury Polyanskiy,Philippe Rigollet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Attention scaling with beta_n rescaling can prevent rank-collapse in long contexts; the paper identifies a phase transition at beta_n ~ log n, providing a rigorous justification for logarithmic scaling as used in YaRN and Qwen to maintain sparse, content-adaptive attention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fundamental pathology that attention scores collapse toward uniformity as context length grows (rank-collapse) and provide theoretical grounding for the widely used attention scaling technique.

Method: Analyze a simplified, tractable attention model where attention scores are magnified by a scaling factor beta_n. Study the asymptotic behavior as context length n grows, revealing a phase transition and characterizing the critical scaling.

Result: There is a critical scaling beta_n ~ log n. If scaling is too weak, tokens collapse to a single direction; if scaling is too strong, attention tends to identity and loses interactions. Logarithmic scaling preserves sparse, content-adaptive attention at large n and justifies YaRN/Qwen-style scaling.

Conclusion: Logarithmic (beta_n ~ log n) attention scaling is theoretically justified for long-context models, explaining why such scaling maintains meaningful, sparse interactions across tokens in large context lengths.

Abstract: As large language models scale to longer contexts, attention layers suffer
from a fundamental pathology: attention scores collapse toward uniformity as
context length $n$ increases, causing tokens to cluster excessively, a
phenomenon known as rank-collapse. While $\textit{attention scaling}$
effectively addresses this deficiency by rescaling attention scores with a
polylogarithmic factor $\beta_n$, theoretical justification for this approach
remains lacking.
  We analyze a simplified yet tractable model that magnifies the effect of
attention scaling. In this model, attention exhibits a phase transition
governed by the scaling factor $\beta_n$: insufficient scaling collapses all
tokens to a single direction, while excessive scaling reduces attention to
identity, thereby eliminating meaningful interactions between tokens. Our main
result identifies the critical scaling $\beta_n \asymp \log n$ and provides a
rigorous justification for attention scaling in YaRN and Qwen, clarifying why
logarithmic scaling maintains sparse, content-adaptive attention at large
context lengths.

### [213] [Generative Dynamic Graph Representation Learning for Conspiracy Spoofing Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05562)
*Sheng Xiang,Yidong Jiang,Yunting Chen,Dawei Cheng,Guoping Zhao,Changjun Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Generative Dynamic Graph Model (GDGM) for conspiracy spoofing detection in financial trading uses dynamic latent space, neural ODEs and GRUs, pseudo-labeling, and heterogeneous aggregation to capture evolving inter-node relationships, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and deployment in a large market.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spoofing detection benefits from graph-based relational modeling, but real-world trading data exhibit dynamic, irregular inter-node relationships that static graphs and isolated node features miss; existing methods struggle with evolving inter-node dynamics.

Method: GDGM converts raw trading data into time-stamped sequences; models trading behaviors with neural ODEs and gated RNNs to capture temporal dynamics; uses a generative dynamic latent space; employs pseudo-label generation and heterogeneous aggregation to enhance detection.

Result: Experiments show GDGM outperforms state-of-the-art models on spoofing datasets in detection accuracy; deployment in one of the largest global trading markets demonstrates practicality.

Conclusion: Dynamic, generative graph modeling effectively captures evolving spoofing patterns and provides practical, scalable detection evidence, validating GDGM's applicability.

Abstract: Spoofing detection in financial trading is crucial, especially for
identifying complex behaviors such as conspiracy spoofing. Traditional
machine-learning approaches primarily focus on isolated node features, often
overlooking the broader context of interconnected nodes. Graph-based
techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have advanced the field
by leveraging relational information effectively. However, in real-world
spoofing detection datasets, trading behaviors exhibit dynamic, irregular
patterns. Existing spoofing detection methods, though effective in some
scenarios, struggle to capture the complexity of dynamic and diverse, evolving
inter-node relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework called the Generative Dynamic Graph Model (GDGM), which models
dynamic trading behaviors and the relationships among nodes to learn
representations for conspiracy spoofing detection. Specifically, our approach
incorporates the generative dynamic latent space to capture the temporal
patterns and evolving market conditions. Raw trading data is first converted
into time-stamped sequences. Then we model trading behaviors using the neural
ordinary differential equations and gated recurrent units, to generate the
representation incorporating temporal dynamics of spoofing patterns.
Furthermore, pseudo-label generation and heterogeneous aggregation techniques
are employed to gather relevant information and enhance the detection
performance for conspiratorial spoofing behaviors. Experiments conducted on
spoofing detection datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models in detection accuracy. Additionally, our spoofing
detection system has been successfully deployed in one of the largest global
trading markets, further validating the practical applicability and performance
of the proposed method.

### [214] [Efficient Learning-based Graph Simulation for Temporal Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05569)
*Sheng Xiang,Chenhao Xu,Dawei Cheng,Xiaoyang Wang,Ying Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A learning-based temporal graph generator (TGAE) that uses an attention-based encoder on sampled ego-graphs and an ego-graph decoder to efficiently generate temporal graph snapshots, achieving better quality and efficiency than existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real-world graphs evolve over time (temporal graphs). Existing generators often ignore temporal information or are inefficient, especially when using temporal random-walk approaches. There is a need for scalable, high-quality temporal graph generation.

Method: Introduce Temporal Graph Autoencoder (TGAE). An attention-based graph encoder encodes temporal and structural features on sampled ego-graphs. An ego-graph decoder reconstructs future or snapshot graphs with a balance between simulation quality and generation efficiency.

Result: Experimental evaluation on real-life temporal graphs and synthetic graphs shows that TGAE surpasses state-of-the-art temporal graph generators in both simulation quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: TGAE provides an efficient, high-quality approach for temporal graph generation, enabling scalable simulation and analysis of evolving networks.

Abstract: Graph simulation has recently received a surge of attention in graph
processing and analytics. In real-life applications, e.g. social science,
biology, and chemistry, many graphs are composed of a series of evolving graphs
(i.e., temporal graphs). While most of the existing graph generators focus on
static graphs, the temporal information of the graphs is ignored. In this
paper, we focus on simulating temporal graphs, which aim to reproduce the
structural and temporal properties of the observed real-life temporal graphs.
In this paper, we first give an overview of the existing temporal graph
generators, including recently emerged learning-based approaches. Most of these
learning-based methods suffer from one of the limitations: low efficiency in
training or slow generating, especially for temporal random walk-based methods.
Therefore, we propose an efficient learning-based approach to generate graph
snapshots, namely temporal graph autoencoder (TGAE). Specifically, we propose
an attention-based graph encoder to encode temporal and structural
characteristics on sampled ego-graphs. And we proposed an ego-graph decoder
that can achieve a good trade-off between simulation quality and efficiency in
temporal graph generation. Finally, the experimental evaluation is conducted
among our proposed TGAE and representative temporal graph generators on
real-life temporal graphs and synthesized graphs. It is reported that our
proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art temporal graph generators by
means of simulation quality and efficiency.

### [215] [Power Mechanism: Private Tabular Representation Release for Model Agnostic Consumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05581)
*Praneeth Vepakomma,Kaustubh Ponkshe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A DP-protected method for sharing embeddings (not weights) in collaborative learning. It uses a privacy-encoding network plus a small utility generator, enabling a server to post-process embeddings for better accuracy, with one round of privatized communication and reduced client compute. The embeddings are model-agnostic for server-side learners (DL, RF, XGBoost).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address efficiency and privacy concerns in federated learning by moving from weight sharing to embedding sharing with formal differential privacy guarantees, enabling server-side post-processing to boost accuracy.

Method: Train a privacy encoding network with a small utility generator to produce privatized embeddings with formal DP guarantees. Share these embeddings with a powerful server that applies post-processing to improve task accuracy. The approach is co-designed to minimize client computation and the number of communication rounds; embeddings are agnostic to the eventual server model.

Result: The method achieves differential privacy for the shared embeddings, requires only one round of privatized communication, and reduces client-side compute compared to traditional weight-sharing approaches. It is compatible with various server-side models (e.g., deep learning, random forests, XGBoost) that process the embeddings to perform tasks.

Conclusion: Co-designing privacy-aware encoding of embeddings with a server-side post-processing step yields an efficient, model-agnostic, private collaborative learning framework, reducing communication rounds and client compute while preserving DP guarantees.

Abstract: Traditional collaborative learning approaches are based on sharing of model
weights between clients and a server. However, there are advantages to resource
efficiency through schemes based on sharing of embeddings (activations) created
from the data. Several differentially private methods were developed for
sharing of weights while such mechanisms do not exist so far for sharing of
embeddings. We propose Ours to learn a privacy encoding network in conjunction
with a small utility generation network such that the final embeddings
generated from it are equipped with formal differential privacy guarantees.
These privatized embeddings are then shared with a more powerful server, that
learns a post-processing that results in a higher accuracy for machine learning
tasks. We show that our co-design of collaborative and private learning results
in requiring only one round of privatized communication and lesser compute on
the client than traditional methods. The privatized embeddings that we share
from the client are agnostic to the type of model (deep learning, random
forests or XGBoost) used on the server in order to process these activations to
complete a task.

### [216] [(Token-Level) \textbf{InfoRMIA}: Stronger Membership Inference and Memorization Assessment for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05582)
*Jiashu Tao,Reza Shokri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InfoRMIA offers an information-theoretic approach to membership inference that outperforms RMIA and introduces token-level analysis to localize leakage in LLM outputs, enabling targeted privacy mitigation like exact unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing privacy risks from memorization in ML/LLMs and the need to quantify leakage before releasing models; sequence-level metrics (RMIA) may miss token-level leakage and LLMs train on vast data, intensifying risk.

Method: Develop InfoRMIA, an information-theoretic formulation for membership inference; show superior performance and efficiency; extend to token-level InfoRMIA to identify memorized tokens within generated outputs.

Result: InfoRMIA consistently outperforms RMIA on benchmarks and is more computationally efficient; token-level InfoRMIA localizes leakage to individual tokens while preserving strong sequence-level inference, enabling targeted mitigation.

Conclusion: Shifts privacy evaluation from purely sequence-level to token-level analysis; token-level leakage analysis can guide precise unlearning and more effective privacy protections in LLMs.

Abstract: Machine learning models are known to leak sensitive information, as they
inevitably memorize (parts of) their training data. More alarmingly, large
language models (LLMs) are now trained on nearly all available data, which
amplifies the magnitude of information leakage and raises serious privacy
risks. Hence, it is more crucial than ever to quantify privacy risk before the
release of LLMs. The standard method to quantify privacy is via membership
inference attacks, where the state-of-the-art approach is the Robust Membership
Inference Attack (RMIA). In this paper, we present InfoRMIA, a principled
information-theoretic formulation of membership inference. Our method
consistently outperforms RMIA across benchmarks while also offering improved
computational efficiency.
  In the second part of the paper, we identify the limitations of treating
sequence-level membership inference as the gold standard for measuring leakage.
We propose a new perspective for studying membership and memorization in LLMs:
token-level signals and analyses. We show that a simple token-based InfoRMIA
can pinpoint which tokens are memorized within generated outputs, thereby
localizing leakage from the sequence level down to individual tokens, while
achieving stronger sequence-level inference power on LLMs. This new scope
rethinks privacy in LLMs and can lead to more targeted mitigation, such as
exact unlearning.

### [217] [When Does Global Attention Help? A Unified Empirical Study on Atomistic Graph Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05583)
*Arindam Chowdhury,Massimiliano Lupo Pasini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified, reproducible benchmark assesses when global attention helps atomistic GNNs. Four model classes (MPNN, encoder-augmented MPNN, GPS-like hybrids, and fused local-global models) are evaluated on seven datasets. Encoded MPNNs are robust baselines; fused local-global models best capture long-range interactions, while global attention adds memory overhead. The work provides a first controlled, reproducible testbed for global attention in atomistic graph learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is inconsistent evidence about the benefits of global attention in atomistic GNNs due to varying implementations, features, and hyperparameters. A controlled, reproducible benchmark is needed to isolate the contributions of message passing, global attention, and encoder-based feature augmentation.

Method: Build a unified benchmarking framework on HydraGNN that switches among four model classes: (1) standard MPNN, (2) MPNN with chemistry/topology encoders, (3) GPS-style hybrids combining MPNN with global attention, and (4) fully fused local-global models with encoders. Evaluate on seven diverse open-source datasets for regression and classification. Perform systematic ablations to isolate effects of message passing, global attention, and encoder-based features. Report accuracy and memory overhead of attention.

Result: Encoder-augmented MPNNs provide a robust, strong baseline. Fully fused local-global models yield the clearest benefits for properties governed by long-range interactions. Global attention incurs memory/computation overhead, and its benefits are workload-dependent. The framework yields the first controlled evaluation and a reproducible testbed for future work.

Conclusion: This work establishes the first controlled, reproducible evaluation of global attention in atomistic graph learning and provides a testbed to guide future model development and fair comparisons.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used as surrogates for costly
experiments and first-principles simulations to study the behavior of compounds
at atomistic scale, and their architectural complexity is constantly increasing
to enable the modeling of complex physics. While most recent GNNs combine more
traditional message passing neural networks (MPNNs) layers to model short-range
interactions with more advanced graph transformers (GTs) with global attention
mechanisms to model long-range interactions, it is still unclear when global
attention mechanisms provide real benefits over well-tuned MPNN layers due to
inconsistent implementations, features, or hyperparameter tuning. We introduce
the first unified, reproducible benchmarking framework - built on HydraGNN -
that enables seamless switching among four controlled model classes: MPNN, MPNN
with chemistry/topology encoders, GPS-style hybrids of MPNN with global
attention, and fully fused local - global models with encoders. Using seven
diverse open-source datasets for benchmarking across regression and
classification tasks, we systematically isolate the contributions of message
passing, global attention, and encoder-based feature augmentation. Our study
shows that encoder-augmented MPNNs form a robust baseline, while fused
local-global models yield the clearest benefits for properties governed by
long-range interaction effects. We further quantify the accuracy - compute
trade-offs of attention, reporting its overhead in memory. Together, these
results establish the first controlled evaluation of global attention in
atomistic graph learning and provide a reproducible testbed for future model
development.

*Kangjia Yan,Chenxi Liu,Hao Miao,Xinle Wu,Yan Zhao,Chenjuan Guo,Bin Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel source-free time-series forecasting framework (TimePD) that uses proxy denoising and LLMs to adapt a pretrained model to sparse target data without accessing source data, achieving SOTA gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing volume of time-series data from mobile devices across domains while data protection regulations prevent sharing source data; there is a need for source-free domain adaptation for time series forecasting.

Method: TimePD comprises three components: (1) dual-branch invariant disentangled feature learning via season-trend decomposition to enforce representation- and gradient-wise invariance; (2) lightweight, parameter-free proxy denoising to calibrate systematic biases of LLMs; (3) knowledge distillation that bidirectionally aligns the denoised prediction with the original target prediction, leveraging LLM generalization.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show TimePD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 9.3% on average.

Conclusion: TimePD demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of source-free time-series forecasting using LLM-assisted proxy denoising and invariant feature learning, offering a privacy-preserving approach with strong empirical gains.

Abstract: The proliferation of mobile devices generates a massive volume of time series
across various domains, where effective time series forecasting enables a
variety of real-world applications. This study focuses on a new problem of
source-free domain adaptation for time series forecasting. It aims to adapt a
pretrained model from sufficient source time series to the sparse target time
series domain without access to the source data, embracing data protection
regulations. To achieve this, we propose TimePD, the first source-free time
series forecasting framework with proxy denoising, where large language models
(LLMs) are employed to benefit from their generalization capabilities.
Specifically, TimePD consists of three key components: (1) dual-branch
invariant disentangled feature learning that enforces representation- and
gradient-wise invariance by means of season-trend decomposition; (2)
lightweight, parameter-free proxy denoising that dynamically calibrates
systematic biases of LLMs; and (3) knowledge distillation that bidirectionally
aligns the denoised prediction and the original target prediction. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets offer insight into the effectiveness of the
proposed TimePD, outperforming SOTA baselines by 9.3% on average.

*Andrew Ly,Pulin Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Deep learning faces intrinsic predictability limits due to riddled, fractal basins of attraction: nearby initializations can lead to different solutions, with an almost-zero uncertainty exponent, implying poor gains in precision even with better initialization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain the puzzling variability and reproducibility issues in deep learning by connecting chaotic dynamics and invariant subspaces to a universal mechanism that creates intricate basins of attraction.

Method: Analytically derive sufficient conditions for riddled basins by linking chaotic learning dynamics and symmetry-induced invariant subspaces to a general route to riddling in realistic deep networks; characterize basins as infinitely fine fractals and compute an uncertainty exponent near zero.

Result: Existence of riddled basins with infinitely fine fractal structure; an uncertainty exponent near zero implies that improving initial-condition precision yields only marginal gains in outcome predictability; provides a unified account of empirical variability.

Conclusion: Riddling imposes a fundamental limit on predictability and reproducibility of neural network training, offering a general organizing principle for deep learning with implications for optimization and safe AI deployment.

Abstract: Fundamental limits to predictability are central to our understanding of many
physical and computational systems. Here we show that, despite its remarkable
capabilities, deep learning exhibits such fundamental limits rooted in the
fractal, riddled geometry of its basins of attraction: any initialization that
leads to one solution lies arbitrarily close to another that leads to a
different one. We derive sufficient conditions for the emergence of riddled
basins by analytically linking features widely observed in deep learning,
including chaotic learning dynamics and symmetry-induced invariant subspaces,
to reveal a general route to riddling in realistic deep networks. The resulting
basins of attraction possess an infinitely fine-scale fractal structure
characterized by an uncertainty exponent near zero, so that even large
increases in the precision of initial conditions yield only marginal gains in
outcome predictability. Riddling thus imposes a fundamental limit on the
predictability and hence reproducibility of neural network training, providing
a unified account of many empirical observations. These results reveal a
general organizing principle of deep learning with important implications for
optimization and the safe deployment of artificial intelligence.

*Salah Eddine Choutri,Prajwal Chauhan,Othmane Mazhar,Saif Eddin Jabari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MCNO learns a neural operator for 1D PDEs by Monte Carlo integration of a learned kernel; generalizes across grid resolutions without fixed global bases; competitive accuracy with low computational cost; supported by a bias/variance analysis and extendable to higher dimensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide a flexible, theory-backed neural operator that does not rely on translation-invariant kernels or spectral representations, enabling grid-agnostic generalization for continuous-domain PDE learning.

Method: Represent the kernel as a learnable tensor over sampled input-output pairs; use a single uniform Monte Carlo sampling from a discretized grid to approximate the integral operator; interpolate to map between arbitrary input/output grids; avoid fixed global basis; train on standard 1D PDE benchmarks; establish bias/variance bounds for the MC estimator under mild regularity assumptions.

Result: Achieves competitive accuracy on standard 1D PDE benchmarks with efficient computation; the Monte Carlo estimator has bounded bias and variance under mild regularity; framework extends beyond 1D to higher dimensions.

Conclusion: Presents a theoretically grounded Monte Carlo framework for neural operators, offering a viable alternative to spectral (FNO) and graph-based Monte Carlo (GNO) methods, with potential for broad generalization to continuous-domain PDEs.

Abstract: The Monte Carlo-type Neural Operator (MCNO) introduces a framework for
learning solution operators of one-dimensional partial differential equations
(PDEs) by directly learning the kernel function and approximating the
associated integral operator using a Monte Carlo-type approach. Unlike Fourier
Neural Operators (FNOs), which rely on spectral representations and assume
translation-invariant kernels, MCNO makes no such assumptions. The kernel is
represented as a learnable tensor over sampled input-output pairs, and sampling
is performed once, uniformly at random from a discretized grid. This design
enables generalization across multiple grid resolutions without relying on
fixed global basis functions or repeated sampling during training, while an
interpolation step maps between arbitrary input and output grids to further
enhance flexibility. Experiments on standard 1D PDE benchmarks show that MCNO
achieves competitive accuracy with efficient computational cost. We also
provide a theoretical analysis proving that the Monte Carlo estimator yields a
bounded bias and variance under mild regularity assumptions. This result holds
in any spatial dimension, suggesting that MCNO may extend naturally beyond
one-dimensional problems. More broadly, this work explores how Monte Carlo-type
integration can be incorporated into neural operator frameworks for
continuous-domain PDEs, providing a theoretically supported alternative to
spectral methods (such as FNO) and to graph-based Monte Carlo approaches (such
as the Graph Kernel Neural Operator, GNO).

*Alexander Murphy,Michal Danilowski,Soumyajit Chatterjee,Abhirup Ghosh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neo is a hyperparameter-free test-time adaptation method that re-centers target latent embeddings at the origin to align source and shifted distributions, achieving strong accuracy gains with minimal compute, including edge-device efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TTA methods are often computationally heavy, data-hungry, and sensitive to hyperparameters. There is a theoretical basis in latent-space geometry that suggests alignment can be improved by recentering target embeddings, enabling efficient, robust adaptation.

Method: NEO recenter target data embeddings at the origin in latent space, making TTA hyperparameter-free and low-cost vs vanilla inference. It adapts on small batches (e.g., 64) or larger (512) samples, across multiple ViT architectures and datasets, with no significant compute overhead. It also improves calibration and can transfer improvements across many classes.

Result: On ViT-Base ImageNet-C, accuracy improves from 55.6% to 59.2% after 64 samples. With 512 samples, NEO beats all 7 compared TTA methods on ImageNet-C, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-S and beats 6/7 on CIFAR-10-C. Edge-device gains include 63% faster inference and 9% less memory vs baselines on Raspberry Pi and Jetson Orin Nano. Tested across 3 ViT architectures and 4 datasets; adapts from 1 class to 999 classes in ImageNet-C.

Conclusion: NEO provides a practical, hyperparameter-free TTA approach with strong accuracy, calibration, and edge-device efficiency, validating latent-space centering as a general tactic for robust test-time adaptation.

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods are often computationally expensive,
require a large amount of data for effective adaptation, or are brittle to
hyperparameters. Based on a theoretical foundation of the geometry of the
latent space, we are able to significantly improve the alignment between source
and distribution-shifted samples by re-centering target data embeddings at the
origin. This insight motivates NEO -- a hyperparameter-free fully TTA method,
that adds no significant compute compared to vanilla inference. NEO is able to
improve the classification accuracy of ViT-Base on ImageNet-C from 55.6% to
59.2% after adapting on just one batch of 64 samples. When adapting on 512
samples NEO beats all 7 TTA methods we compare against on ImageNet-C,
ImageNet-R and ImageNet-S and beats 6/7 on CIFAR-10-C, while using the least
amount of compute. NEO performs well on model calibration metrics and
additionally is able to adapt from 1 class to improve accuracy on 999 other
classes in ImageNet-C. On Raspberry Pi and Jetson Orin Nano devices, NEO
reduces inference time by 63% and memory usage by 9% compared to baselines. Our
results based on 3 ViT architectures and 4 datasets show that NEO can be used
efficiently and effectively for TTA.

### [222] [Quantifying the Accuracy-Interpretability Trade-Off in Concept-Based Sidechannel Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05670)
*David Debot,Giuseppe Marra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unified probabilistic meta-model for Concept Sidechannel Models (CSMs) and a new Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS) to quantify reliance on sidechannels, with SIS regularization to improve interpretability; empirical results show accuracy-focused CSMs have low interpretability, SIS improves interpretability and intervenability; provides principled trade-off control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CBNMs limit information flow for interpretability; CSMs restore accuracy via sidechannels but lose interpretability; no principled way to control the interpretability/accuracy trade-off; need a unifying framework and a metric/reg method.

Method: Propose a unified probabilistic meta-model for CSMs; define SIS by contrasting predictions with and without sidechannel; introduce SIS regularization to penalize sidechannel reliance; theoretical analysis of expressivity vs sidechannel reliance; empirical evaluation across architectures.

Result: State-of-the-art CSMs trained for accuracy display low representation interpretability; SIS regularization yields meaningful gains in interpretability, intervenability, and quality of interpretable task predictors.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical and practical tools to design CSMs that balance accuracy and interpretability; framework supports principled trade-offs and better interpretability through measured sidechannel control.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBNMs) are deep learning models that provide
interpretability by enforcing a bottleneck layer where predictions are based
exclusively on human-understandable concepts. However, this constraint also
restricts information flow and often results in reduced predictive accuracy.
Concept Sidechannel Models (CSMs) address this limitation by introducing a
sidechannel that bypasses the bottleneck and carry additional task-relevant
information. While this improves accuracy, it simultaneously compromises
interpretability, as predictions may rely on uninterpretable representations
transmitted through sidechannels. Currently, there exists no principled
technique to control this fundamental trade-off. In this paper, we close this
gap. First, we present a unified probabilistic concept sidechannel meta-model
that subsumes existing CSMs as special cases. Building on this framework, we
introduce the Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS), a metric that quantifies a
CSM's reliance on its sidechannel by contrasting predictions made with and
without sidechannel information. We propose SIS regularization, which
explicitly penalizes sidechannel reliance to improve interpretability. Finally,
we analyze how the expressivity of the predictor and the reliance of the
sidechannel jointly shape interpretability, revealing inherent trade-offs
across different CSM architectures. Empirical results show that
state-of-the-art CSMs, when trained solely for accuracy, exhibit low
representation interpretability, and that SIS regularization substantially
improves their interpretability, intervenability, and the quality of learned
interpretable task predictors. Our work provides both theoretical and practical
tools for developing CSMs that balance accuracy and interpretability in a
principled manner.

TL;DR: A novel inductive graph gradient boosting machine (G-GBM) for heterogeneous and dynamic graphs is proposed for supervised learning, especially insurance fraud. It competes with graph neural networks on simulated graphs and demonstrates usefulness on open-source and proprietary datasets, with explainability via gradient-boosting methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-based approaches struggle with class imbalance in fraud, and insurance networks are inherently heterogeneous and dynamic. While gradient boosted trees excel on tabular data, there is a need for inductive, graph-aware models that handle changing relations without heavy GNN training. The work aims to bridge this gap by introducing G-GBM.

Method: Introduce an inductive graph gradient boosting machine with a gradient-boosting forest backbone tailored for heterogeneous, dynamic graphs. Evaluate against popular GNNs on diverse simulated graphs and test on an open-source and a real-world proprietary insurance fraud dataset. Apply established GBM explainability methods to interpret predictions.

Result: G-GBM competes with popular graph neural networks in experiments on simulated graphs and demonstrates strong performance for insurance fraud detection on both open-source and proprietary datasets. The gradient-boosting backbone enables effective explanations of predictions.

Conclusion: G-GBM offers a promising, explainable inductive framework for learning on heterogeneous and dynamic graphs, delivering competitive performance to GNNs and benefiting fraud detection in insurance settings.

Abstract: Graph-based methods are becoming increasingly popular in machine learning due
to their ability to model complex data and relations. Insurance fraud is a
prime use case, since false claims are often the result of organised criminals
that stage accidents or the same persons filing erroneous claims on multiple
policies. One challenge is that graph-based approaches struggle to find
meaningful representations of the data because of the high class imbalance
present in fraud data. Another is that insurance networks are heterogeneous and
dynamic, given the changing relations among people, companies and policies.
That is why gradient boosted tree approaches on tabular data still dominate the
field. Therefore, we present a novel inductive graph gradient boosting machine
(G-GBM) for supervised learning on heterogeneous and dynamic graphs. We show
that our estimator competes with popular graph neural network approaches in an
experiment using a variety of simulated random graphs. We demonstrate the power
of G-GBM for insurance fraud detection using an open-source and a real-world,
proprietary dataset. Given that the backbone model is a gradient boosting
forest, we apply established explainability methods to gain better insights
into the predictions made by G-GBM.

*Haribandhu Jena,Jyotirmaya Shivottam,Subhankar Mishra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QGraphLIME provides uncertainty-aware, model-agnostic explanations for quantum graph neural networks by fitting structure-preserving perturbation surrogates and aggregating their attributions, with finite-sample guarantees via a DK-W bound.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explainability for quantum graph neural networks is challenging due to measurement stochasticity and combinatorial graph structure; there's a need for principled, uncertainty-aware, and scalable explanation frameworks.

Method: Introduce QGraphLIME: treat explanations as distributions over local surrogates learned on graph perturbations that preserve structure; compute attributions from surrogates; aggregate with dispersion; prove a distribution-free DK-W bound for uniform approximation of class probability; assume standard independence among perturbations.

Result: Empirical tests on synthetic graphs with known ground truth show accurate, stable explanations; nonlinear surrogate models outperform linear ones; perturbation design affects results; the method yields meaningful uncertainty-aware rankings.

Conclusion: Provides a principled, uncertainty-aware approach to explaining quantum graph neural networks, with potential to scale to broader architectures and real data as quantum resources mature; code released.

Abstract: Quantum graph neural networks offer a powerful paradigm for learning on
graph-structured data, yet their explainability is complicated by
measurement-induced stochasticity and the combinatorial nature of graph
structure. In this paper, we introduce QuantumGraphLIME (QGraphLIME), a
model-agnostic, post-hoc framework that treats model explanations as
distributions over local surrogates fit on structure-preserving perturbations
of a graph. By aggregating surrogate attributions together with their
dispersion, QGraphLIME yields uncertainty-aware node and edge importance
rankings for quantum graph models. The framework further provides a
distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee on the size of the surrogate
ensemble: a Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz bound ensures uniform approximation of
the induced distribution of a binary class probability at target accuracy and
confidence under standard independence assumptions. Empirical studies on
controlled synthetic graphs with known ground truth demonstrate accurate and
stable explanations, with ablations showing clear benefits of nonlinear
surrogate modeling and highlighting sensitivity to perturbation design.
Collectively, these results establish a principled, uncertainty-aware, and
structure-sensitive approach to explaining quantum graph neural networks, and
lay the groundwork for scaling to broader architectures and real-world
datasets, as quantum resources mature. Code is available at

### [225] [vAttention: Verified Sparse Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05688)
*Aditya Desai,Kumar Krishna Agrawal,Shuo Yang,Alejandro Cuadron,Luis Gaspar Schroeder,Matei Zaharia,Joseph E. Gonzalez,Ion Stoica*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: vAttention is a practical sparse attention method that unifies top-k and sampling with user-specified (epsilon, delta) guarantees, achieving better quality-efficiency trade-offs and enabling scalable deployment with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sparse attention methods (approximate top-k/top-p and sampling) lack consistency across heads and queries, and do not provide guarantees on approximation quality, limiting practical deployment at scale.

Method: Introduce vAttention, a unified sparse attention mechanism that combines top-k and sampling and provides user-specified probabilistic guarantees (epsilon, delta). It leverages the statistical guarantees of sampling to ensure approximation quality while integrating the strengths of top-k when attention is dominated by a few tokens.

Result: Empirical results show substantial quality gains (about 4.5 percentage points on Llama-3.1-8B-Inst and Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B on RULER-HARD), and the approach matches full-model quality with up to 20x sparsity across datasets. It enables fast decoding in reasoning tasks (e.g., AIME2024 at 10x sparsity with up to 32K tokens). Code is open-sourced at the referenced repository.

Conclusion: vAttention provides guarantees-driven, high-quality sparse attention that bridges full and sparse attention, delivering a favorable quality-efficiency trade-off and enabling scalable deployment.

Abstract: State-of-the-art sparse attention methods for reducing decoding latency fall
into two main categories: approximate top-$k$ (and its extension, top-$p$) and
recently introduced sampling-based estimation. However, these approaches are
fundamentally limited in their ability to approximate full attention: they fail
to provide consistent approximations across heads and query vectors and, most
critically, lack guarantees on approximation quality, limiting their practical
deployment. We observe that top-$k$ and random sampling are complementary:
top-$k$ performs well when attention scores are dominated by a few tokens,
whereas random sampling provides better estimates when attention scores are
relatively uniform. Building on this insight and leveraging the statistical
guarantees of sampling, we introduce vAttention, the first practical sparse
attention mechanism with user-specified $(\epsilon, \delta)$ guarantees on
approximation accuracy (thus, verified). These guarantees make vAttention a
compelling step toward practical, reliable deployment of sparse attention at
scale. By unifying top-k and sampling, vAttention outperforms both
individually, delivering a superior quality-efficiency trade-off. Our
experiments show that vAttention significantly improves the quality of sparse
attention (e.g., $\sim$4.5 percentage points for Llama-3.1-8B-Inst and
Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B on RULER-HARD), and effectively bridges the gap
between full and sparse attention (e.g., across datasets, it matches full model
quality with upto 20x sparsity). We also demonstrate that it can be deployed in
reasoning scenarios to achieve fast decoding without compromising model quality
(e.g., vAttention achieves full model quality on AIME2024 at 10x sparsity with
up to 32K token generations). Code is open-sourced at

*Yihan Du,Seo Taek Kong,R. Srikant*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a memory-efficient constrained alignment method for LLMs via primal-dual DPO; avoids extra reward/cost models; provides theoretical guarantees; online extension with exploration bonuses; validated on PKU-SafeRLHF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety requirements for LLMs: reduce harmful content and forbidden tokens while meeting rules and laws. Existing safe alignment methods are costly (reward/cost models) or require prior knowledge. Aim to maximize reward under a safety-cost constraint with lower resource use and no extra priors.

Method: Train with standard DPO on reward preference data to obtain reward information; then use a rearranged Lagrangian DPO objective to fine-tune on cost preference data, leveraging the provided reward signal. Adds an online data setting with exploration bonuses to explore uncovered prompt-response space.

Result: Significant reductions in memory and computational costs; does not require extra prior knowledge; provides theoretical guarantees on suboptimality and constraint violation; empirical effectiveness demonstrated on PKU-SafeRLHF dataset.

Conclusion: Constrained alignment of LLMs is feasible with lower resource demands using a primal-dual DPO approach. The method offers provable guarantees and an online extension, with demonstrated effectiveness on a standard safety benchmark.

Abstract: The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) imposes increasing
demands on safety, such as reducing harmful content and fake information, and
avoiding certain forbidden tokens due to rules and laws. While there have been
several recent works studying safe alignment of LLMs, these works either
require the training of reward and cost models and incur high memory and
computational costs, or need prior knowledge about the optimal solution.
Motivated by this fact, we study the problem of constrained alignment in LLMs,
i.e., maximizing the output reward while restricting the cost due to
potentially unsafe content to stay below a threshold. For this problem, we
propose a novel primal-dual DPO approach, which first trains a model using
standard DPO on reward preference data to provide reward information, and then
adopts a rearranged Lagrangian DPO objective utilizing the provided reward
information to fine-tune LLMs on cost preference data. Our approach
significantly reduces memory and computational costs, and does not require
extra prior knowledge. Moreover, we establish rigorous theoretical guarantees
on the suboptimality and constraint violation of the output policy. We also
extend our approach to an online data setting by incorporating exploration
bonuses, which enables our approach to explore uncovered prompt-response space,
and then provide theoretical results that get rid of the dependence on
preference data coverage. Experimental results on the widely-used preference
dataset PKU-SafeRLHF demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

*Hedi Zisling,Ilan Naiman,Nimrod Berman,Supasorn Suwajanakorn,Omri Azencot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion-based, modal-agnostic autoencoder (DiffSDA) for unsupervised sequential disentanglement that outperforms existing methods across time series, video, and audio.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disentangling static and dynamic factors in unlabeled data is challenging. Existing VAE/GAN approaches rely on multiple, intricate loss terms and struggle on real-world data. There is no standard evaluation protocol for sequential disentanglement. Diffusion models offer theoretical and practical advantages but lack a formalization for sequential disentanglement.

Method: Introduce DiffSDA with latent diffusion modeling in a modal-agnostic architecture. Propose a new probabilistic formulation, develop efficient samplers, and establish a challenging evaluation protocol for sequential disentanglement across modalities.

Result: Empirical evaluations on diverse real-world benchmarks show that DiffSDA outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in sequential disentanglement.

Conclusion: DiffSDA provides a robust, modality-agnostic framework for diffusion-based sequential disentanglement, combined with a rigorous evaluation protocol, demonstrating strong performance on real-world data.

Abstract: Unsupervised representation learning, particularly sequential
disentanglement, aims to separate static and dynamic factors of variation in
data without relying on labels. This remains a challenging problem, as existing
approaches based on variational autoencoders and generative adversarial
networks often rely on multiple loss terms, complicating the optimization
process. Furthermore, sequential disentanglement methods face challenges when
applied to real-world data, and there is currently no established evaluation
protocol for assessing their performance in such settings. Recently, diffusion
models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative models, but no theoretical
formalization exists for their application to sequential disentanglement. In
this work, we introduce the Diffusion Sequential Disentanglement Autoencoder
(DiffSDA), a novel, modal-agnostic framework effective across diverse
real-world data modalities, including time series, video, and audio. DiffSDA
leverages a new probabilistic modeling, latent diffusion, and efficient
samplers, while incorporating a challenging evaluation protocol for rigorous
testing. Our experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that
DiffSDA outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in sequential
disentanglement.

### [228] [Neighborhood-Adaptive Generalized Linear Graph Embedding with Latent Pattern Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05719)
*S. Peng,L. Hu,W. Zhang,B. Jie,Y. Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A neighborhood-adaptive generalized linear graph embedding (NGLGE) model that jointly learns an adaptive graph structure and a low-rank representation with l2,0 regularization to enable flexible pattern discovery, solved efficiently; outperforms state-of-the-art on diverse datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph embedding methods require preset neighborhood sizes and rely on a single pattern-mining approach, limiting adaptability and discovery of intrinsic correlations in complex data. There is a need for adaptive neighborhood learning and flexible pattern exploration with robust representations.

Method: Proposes NGLGE, which uses adaptive graph learning tailored to neighborhoods; latent pattern mining; reconstructs a low-rank representation; imposes l2,0 norm constraint on projection matrix; develops an efficient iterative solver.

Result: Empirical evaluations on diverse datasets show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: NGLGE enables neighborhood-adaptive graph embedding with flexible pattern mining and robust low-rank representations, improving performance across domains; efficient optimization makes it practical.

Abstract: Graph embedding has been widely applied in areas such as network analysis,
social network mining, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics. However,
current graph construction methods often require the prior definition of
neighborhood size, limiting the effective revelation of potential structural
correlations in the data. Additionally, graph embedding methods using linear
projection heavily rely on a singular pattern mining approach, resulting in
relative weaknesses in adapting to different scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel model, Neighborhood-Adaptive Generalized Linear
Graph Embedding (NGLGE), grounded in latent pattern mining. This model
introduces an adaptive graph learning method tailored to the neighborhood,
effectively revealing intrinsic data correlations. Simultaneously, leveraging a
reconstructed low-rank representation and imposing $\ell_{2,0}$ norm constraint
on the projection matrix allows for flexible exploration of additional pattern
information. Besides, an efficient iterative solving algorithm is derived for
the proposed model. Comparative evaluations on datasets from diverse scenarios
demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

*Chunsan Hong,Seonho An,Min-Soo Kim,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Learned scheduler for masked diffusion models improves sample quality over heuristic schedules by casting denoising as a KL-regularized MDP with a reference policy; empirical gains on SUDOKU and other benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MDMs allow any-order sampling but order selection is critical and heuristic; need a principled, learnable policy to optimize denoising order to better approximate data distribution.

Method: Formulate denoising as KL-regularized MDP with explicit reference policy; optimize a regularized objective that ensures policy improvement and convergence; train to produce orderings that yield samples closer to data distribution.

Result: The learned policy consistently outperforms max-confidence across four benchmarks; on SUDOKU, 20.1% gain over random, 11.2% over max-confidence.

Conclusion: A principled, learnable scheduler for MDM denoising order yields better data matching and can surpass heuristic schedules, with potential broad applicability; analysis of computational cost and generalization remains for future work.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a novel framework for
language modeling. MDMs generate sentences by iteratively denoising masked
sequences, filling in [MASK] tokens step by step. Although MDMs support
any-order sampling, performance is highly sensitive to the choice of which
position to unmask next. Prior work typically relies on rule-based schedules
(e.g., max-confidence, max-margin), which provide ad hoc improvements. In
contrast, we replace these heuristics with a learned scheduler. Specifically,
we cast denoising as a KL-regularized Markov decision process (MDP) with an
explicit reference policy and optimize a regularized objective that admits
policy improvement and convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We
prove that the optimized policy under this framework generates samples that
more closely match the data distribution than heuristic schedules. Empirically,
across four benchmarks, our learned policy consistently outperforms
max-confidence: for example, on SUDOKU, where unmasking order is critical, it
yields a 20.1% gain over random and a 11.2% gain over max-confidence.

### [230] [Communication Enables Cooperation in LLM Agents: A Comparison with Curriculum-Based Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05748)
*Hachem Madmoun,Salem Lahlou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Simple one-word cheap-talk communication boosts cooperation in a 4-player Stag Hunt, but a pedagogy-driven curriculum can backfire, reducing payoffs and inducing pessimism; overall, communication may be more robust for coordination than curriculum-based learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess robustness of two coordination strategies (direct communication vs curriculum learning) in multi-agent LLM systems and identify design sensitivities and potential pitfalls.

Method: Empirical evaluation in two settings: (1) Stag Hunt with a one-word cheap-talk channel to elicit cooperation among four agents; (2) Iterated Public Goods Game with Punishment using a pedagogical curriculum of progressively complex games; qualitative analysis of curriculum effects on expectations and strategies.

Result: Communication raised cooperation from 0% to 48.3% in the Stag Hunt; curriculum learning reduced agent payoffs by 27.4% in the iterative public goods setting; curricula that emphasize defection-equilibrium games led to learned pessimism.

Conclusion: Direct communication can provide more reliable coordination in social dilemmas than carefully designed curricula, which require careful curation of game sequences to avoid reinforcing defeatist strategies and pessimism; design implications favor simple, explicit communication channels for coordination in multi-agent LLM systems.

Abstract: Eliciting cooperation in multi-agent LLM systems is critical for AI
alignment. We investigate two approaches: direct communication and curriculum
learning. In a 4-player Stag Hunt, a one-word "cheap talk" channel increases
cooperation from 0% to 48.3%, demonstrating communication as a robust
coordination mechanism. In contrast, we find that curriculum learning is highly
sensitive to design choices: our pedagogical curriculum through progressively
complex games reduced agent payoffs by 27.4% in an Iterated Public Goods Game
with Punishment. Qualitative analysis reveals that curricula emphasizing
defection-equilibrium games can induce "learned pessimism" in agents. These
findings suggest that for coordination problems, simple communication protocols
may be more reliable than experience-based training, and that curriculum design
for social dilemmas requires careful attention to the strategic lessons
embedded in game sequences.

### [231] [Are Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks Truly Effective? A Causal Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05750)
*Xiao Yang,Xuejiao Zhao,Zhiqi Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper questions whether HGNNs' gains come from model architecture or heterogeneous information, using large-scale replication and causal inference. It finds architecture has no causal effect, while heterogeneous information positively impacts performance by enhancing homophily and distribution discrepancy, improving class separability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess intrinsic effectiveness of HGNNs by separating genuine causal effects from spurious correlations and to determine what truly drives gains in heterogeneous graph learning.

Method: Systematic reproduction across 21 datasets and 20 baselines with comprehensive hyperparameter retuning. Developed a causal effect estimation framework using factual and counterfactual analyses, validated by minimal sufficient adjustment sets, cross-method consistency checks, and sensitivity analyses.

Result: Two main conclusions: (1) model architecture and complexity do not have a causal effect on performance. (2) Heterogeneous information exerts a positive causal effect by increasing homophily and local-global distribution discrepancy, making node classes more distinguishable.

Conclusion: The work suggests that improvements in HGNN performance stem from leveraging heterogeneous information rather than architectural complexity, with the code released for public use.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in node
classification. Building on this progress, heterogeneous graph neural networks
(HGNNs) integrate relation types and node and edge semantics to leverage
heterogeneous information. Causal analysis for HGNNs is advancing rapidly,
aiming to separate genuine causal effects from spurious correlations. However,
whether HGNNs are intrinsically effective remains underexamined, and most
studies implicitly assume rather than establish this effectiveness. In this
work, we examine HGNNs from two perspectives: model architecture and
heterogeneous information. We conduct a systematic reproduction across 21
datasets and 20 baselines, complemented by comprehensive hyperparameter
retuning. To further disentangle the source of performance gains, we develop a
causal effect estimation framework that constructs and evaluates candidate
factors under standard assumptions through factual and counterfactual analyses,
with robustness validated via minimal sufficient adjustment sets, cross-method
consistency checks, and sensitivity analyses. Our results lead to two
conclusions. First, model architecture and complexity have no causal effect on
performance. Second, heterogeneous information exerts a positive causal effect
by increasing homophily and local-global distribution discrepancy, which makes
node classes more distinguishable. The implementation is publicly available at

*Yuxuan Bai,Gauri Pradhan,Marlon Tobaben,Antti Honkela*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Evaluates multiple membership inference attacks (MIAs) in transfer learning; LiRA generally best; IHA excels on PatchCamelyon with large datasets; no single MIA captures all privacy risks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: With the shift to transfer learning on small, domain-specific datasets, understanding privacy leakage through MIAs is essential. Prior work assessed only a narrow subset of attacks.

Method: Empirical comparison of diverse MIAs across transfer-learning scenarios, varying training data size and datasets (including PatchCamelyon), to evaluate attack effectiveness and identify which attacks are most informative for privacy risk assessment.

Result: Score-based MIAs become less effective as training data grows; no single MIA dominates; LiRA tends to perform best across scenarios, while Inverse Hessian Attack (IHA) outperforms LiRA on PatchCamelyon in high-data regimes.

Conclusion: Practitioners should use a battery of MIAs for comprehensive risk evaluation in transfer learning; LiRA is a reliable default, but IHA may be necessary for specific high-data-domain settings (e.g., PatchCamelyon).

Abstract: With the emergence of powerful large-scale foundation models, the training
paradigm is increasingly shifting from from-scratch training to transfer
learning. This enables high utility training with small, domain-specific
datasets typical in sensitive applications.Membership inference attacks (MIAs)
provide an empirical estimate of the privacy leakage by machine learning
models. Yet, prior assessments of MIAs against models fine-tuned with transfer
learning rely on a small subset of possible attacks. We address this by
comparing performance of diverse MIAs in transfer learning settings to help
practitioners identify the most efficient attacks for privacy risk evaluation.
We find that attack efficacy decreases with the increase in training data for
score-based MIAs. We find that there is no one MIA which captures all privacy
risks in models trained with transfer learning. While the Likelihood Ratio
Attack (LiRA) demonstrates superior performance across most experimental
scenarios, the Inverse Hessian Attack (IHA) proves to be more effective against
models fine-tuned on PatchCamelyon dataset in high data regime.

### [233] [DP-SNP-TIHMM: Differentially Private, Time-Inhomogeneous Hidden Markov Models for Synthesizing Genome-Wide Association Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05777)
*Shadi Rahimian,Mario Fritz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A DP-enabled framework for private SNP sequence synthesis using TIHMMs; per-sequence gradient clipping ensures DP, yielding synthetic SNP data that preserves statistics with location-aware transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNP data sharing poses privacy risks due to correlations; existing DP methods are limited (relying on summaries or public datasets). There is a need for end-to-end synthetic data with formal privacy guarantees that preserves correlation-structure.

Method: Train time-inhomogeneous hidden Markov models (TIHMMs) on real SNP sequences with per-sample gradient clipping to bound each sequence's influence, achieving strong differential privacy. Allow transition models to depend on sequence location to better capture correlations. Generate synthetic SNP sequences from the TIHMM. Evaluate under DP budgets epsilon in [1,10], delta = 1e-4, on the 1000 Genomes dataset.

Result: Synthetic data closely replicates statistics of non-private datasets; location-dependent transitions markedly improve fidelity. The DP framework enables private sharing with strong privacy budgets (epsilon ~ 1–10, delta 1e-4) while preserving utility.

Conclusion: The proposed TIHMM-based DP framework provides private, flexible, and utility-rich synthetic SNP data, effectively mitigating privacy risks from SNP correlations and enabling broader sharing of genomic datasets.

Abstract: Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets are fundamental to genetic
studies but pose significant privacy risks when shared. The correlation of SNPs
with each other makes strong adversarial attacks such as masked-value
reconstruction, kin, and membership inference attacks possible. Existing
privacy-preserving approaches either apply differential privacy to statistical
summaries of these datasets or offer complex methods that require
post-processing and the usage of a publicly available dataset to suppress or
selectively share SNPs.
  In this study, we introduce an innovative framework for generating synthetic
SNP sequence datasets using samples derived from time-inhomogeneous hidden
Markov models (TIHMMs). To preserve the privacy of the training data, we ensure
that each SNP sequence contributes only a bounded influence during training,
enabling strong differential privacy guarantees. Crucially, by operating on
full SNP sequences and bounding their gradient contributions, our method
directly addresses the privacy risks introduced by their inherent correlations.
  Through experiments conducted on the real-world 1000 Genomes dataset, we
demonstrate the efficacy of our method using privacy budgets of $\varepsilon
\in [1, 10]$ at $\delta=10^{-4}$. Notably, by allowing the transition models of
the HMM to be dependent on the location in the sequence, we significantly
enhance performance, enabling the synthetic datasets to closely replicate the
statistical properties of non-private datasets. This framework facilitates the
private sharing of genomic data while offering researchers exceptional
flexibility and utility.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quadratic Bézier mode-connected curves replace full SGD trajectories as supervision in dataset condensation, stabilizing learning and reducing storage, with improved performance on five clinical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome instability, high curvature, and memory overhead of using full SGD trajectories for aligning real vs synthetic data in dataset condensation, especially for privacy-preserving clinical data.

Method: Use smooth Bézier curves connecting initial and final states of real-model training as the supervision signal; provide theoretical justification; avoid dense trajectory storage; show that curves act as surrogates for SGD paths.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art condensation methods on five clinical datasets; condensed data enables clinically effective downstream models.

Conclusion: Bezier-mode connections are effective surrogates for SGD paths in DC, offering noise-free, low-curvature supervision, faster convergence, and memory efficiency, enabling practical clinical data condensation.

Abstract: Dataset condensation (DC) enables the creation of compact, privacy-preserving
synthetic datasets that can match the utility of real patient records,
supporting democratised access to highly regulated clinical data for developing
downstream clinical models. State-of-the-art DC methods supervise synthetic
data by aligning the training dynamics of models trained on real and those
trained on synthetic data, typically using full stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) trajectories as alignment targets; however, these trajectories are often
noisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients,
slow convergence, and substantial memory overhead. We address these limitations
by replacing full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates,
specifically quadratic B\'ezier curves that connect the initial and final model
states from real training trajectories. These mode-connected paths provide
noise-free, low-curvature supervision signals that stabilise gradients,
accelerate convergence, and eliminate the need for dense trajectory storage. We
theoretically justify B\'ezier-mode connections as effective surrogates for SGD
paths and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets,
yielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF) with Entropic Annealing and Look-ahead Modulation improves inference-time scaling by mitigating particle impoverishment, preserving diversity, and guiding search toward promising trajectories, yielding up to 50% relative gains on math benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Particle Filtering (PF) for inference-time scaling can be misled by overconfident early process-reward scores, causing premature exploitation and particle impoverishment, especially under tight compute budgets.

Method: Introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF) with two components: Entropic Annealing (EA) that tracks search diversity via entropy and adaptively reshapes the resampling distribution to preserve exploration, and Look-ahead Modulation (LaM) that adds a predictive evaluation of a state's potential using its successor states.

Result: On several challenging math benchmarks, ePF outperforms strong baselines and achieves up to a 50% relative improvement in task reward, demonstrating enhanced resilience of PF under limited computational budgets.

Conclusion: EA and LaM jointly stabilize PF in ITS settings by balancing exploration and exploitation, reducing impoverishment, and producing higher-quality solutions under resource constraints.

Abstract: Inference-Time Scaling (ITS) improves language models by allocating more
computation at generation time. Particle Filtering (PF) has emerged as a strong
ITS method for complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but it is vulnerable when
guided by process reward models, which often assign overconfident scores early
in the reasoning process. This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation:
it myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially
correct hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode,
known as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained
computational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two
root causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident
resampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning
path. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that
integrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique,
Entropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by
monitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by
dynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The
second, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive
guide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several
challenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and
achieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward. Together, these
methods improve PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse
solution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately
leading to higher-quality solutions.

TL;DR:  MDTI is a multimodal trajectory representation framework for travel time estimation (TTE) that fuses GPS, grid trajectories, and road network constraints through modality-specific encoders, a cross-modal interaction module, and a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism. It is trained with two self-supervised objectives to enforce multimodal consistency and contextual understanding, and it achieves state-of-the-art results on three real-world datasets with released code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate TTE is challenged by heterogeneous data sources and complex traffic dynamics. Conventional methods compress trajectories into fixed-length representations, causing information loss or redundancy. A multimodal, dynamically dense representation that respects trajectory variability and topological constraints can improve TTE accuracy and robustness.

Method: MDTI uses modality-specific encoders for GPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road-network constraints, coupled with a cross-modal interaction module to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics. It includes a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism that adaptively regulates information density for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised objectives—contrastive alignment and masked language modeling—are used to strengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding.

Result: Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show MDTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating robustness and strong generalization. The authors provide publicly available code.

Conclusion: MDTI effectively integrates multimodal trajectory representations to improve travel time estimation, addressing data heterogeneity and trajectory variability, with demonstrated accuracy gains and generalization across datasets.

Abstract: Accurate travel time estimation (TTE) plays a crucial role in intelligent
transportation systems. However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous
data sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, conventional approaches
typically convert trajectories into fixed-length representations, neglecting
the inherent variability of real-world trajectories, which often leads to
information loss or feature redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a
novel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates
GPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance TTE
accuracy. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a cross-modal interaction
module to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics,
while a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information
density for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining
objectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further
strengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong
generalization abilities. The code is publicly available at:

*Adhithyan Kalaivanan,Zheng Zhao,Jens Sjölund,Fredrik Lindsten*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A gradient-free Bayesian conditioning method (ESS-Flow) for pretrained flow models using Elliptical Slice Sampling in the latent space, enabling targeted generation without retraining or gradients.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conditioning pretrained flow-based generators is valuable but often requires retraining or gradients; many observation processes are gradient-intractable (simulation, quantization). A gradient-free, source-space inference approach can enable conditional sampling under limited data.

Method: Treat latent z ~ N(0, I) as the source prior; perform Bayesian inference on z given observations y through the generator f and the observation process, using Elliptical Slice Sampling (ESS). No gradient/Jacobian computations; only forward passes needed.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness in designing materials with target properties and predicting protein structures from sparse inter-residue distances, under gradient-free conditioning.

Conclusion: ESS-Flow broadens applicability of flow-based models to conditional generation when gradients are unavailable, offering a practical, retraining-free Bayesian inference approach for diverse tasks.

Abstract: Guiding pretrained flow-based generative models for conditional generation or
to produce samples with desired target properties enables solving diverse tasks
without retraining on paired data. We present ESS-Flow, a gradient-free method
that leverages the typically Gaussian prior of the source distribution in
flow-based models to perform Bayesian inference directly in the source space
using Elliptical Slice Sampling. ESS-Flow only requires forward passes through
the generative model and observation process, no gradient or Jacobian
computations, and is applicable even when gradients are unreliable or
unavailable, such as with simulation-based observations or quantization in the
generation or observation process. We demonstrate its effectiveness on
designing materials with desired target properties and predicting protein
structures from sparse inter-residue distance measurements.

### [238] [How to model Human Actions distribution with Event Sequence Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05856)
*Egor Surkov,Dmitry Osin,Evgeny Burnaev,Egor Shvetsov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Explicit distribution forecasting for event sets in action sequences outperforms autoregressive and order-preserving methods; a KL-based drift metric and analysis of mode collapse reveal practical modeling choices for robust forecasting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In many real-world domains, forecasting the exact temporal order of events is less critical than predicting the set of future outcomes. This motivates exploring non-autoregressive, explicit distribution models and evaluating how they compare to order-preserving approaches.

Method: The study contrasts explicit distribution forecasting with implicit baselines, analyzes local order invariance, introduces a KL-based metric to quantify temporal drift, and investigates mode collapse caused by distributional imbalance across predicted categories.

Result: Explicit distribution forecasting objectives consistently surpass complex implicit baselines. Mode collapse is primarily driven by distributional imbalance. The findings provide a principled framework for selecting modeling strategies and practical guidance for building accurate and robust forecasting systems.

Conclusion: For forecasting future event distributions in action sequences, explicit distribution modeling offers tangible benefits over autoregressive approaches, with attention to distributional balance to mitigate mode collapse and improve robustness.

Abstract: This paper studies forecasting of the future distribution of events in human
action sequences, a task essential in domains like retail, finance, healthcare,
and recommendation systems where the precise temporal order is often less
critical than the set of outcomes. We challenge the dominant autoregressive
paradigm and investigate whether explicitly modeling the future distribution or
order-invariant multi-token approaches outperform order-preserving methods. We
analyze local order invariance and introduce a KL-based metric to quantify
temporal drift. We find that a simple explicit distribution forecasting
objective consistently surpasses complex implicit baselines. We further
demonstrate that mode collapse of predicted categories is primarily driven by
distributional imbalance. This work provides a principled framework for
selecting modeling strategies and offers practical guidance for building more
accurate and robust forecasting systems.

*Philipp Dahlinger,Tai Hoang,Denis Blessing,Niklas Freymuth,Gerhard Neumann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Meta-learning with MaNGO enables fast adaptation of graph-network simulators to new material properties by encoding graph trajectories with conditional neural processes and using a neural operator to curb error accumulation, achieving near-oracle accuracy on unseen parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) struggle with varying physical parameters: they need retraining and new data for each parameter setting; there is a shared latent structure across parameter variations that could be exploited.

Method: Introduce MaNGO, which uses conditional neural processes (CNPs) to encode graph trajectories into a latent representation and combines this with a novel neural operator to predict dynamics, all under a meta-learning framework for fast adaptation to new material properties.

Result: MaNGO outperforms existing GNS methods on several dynamics prediction tasks with varying material properties, and achieves accuracy on unseen properties close to an oracle model.

Conclusion: By learning a shared latent structure across parameter variations and using meta-learning with CNP-based graph trajectory encoding plus a neural operator, MaNGO enables fast adaptation to new physical parameters with near-oracle predictive performance, reducing retraining and data-collection needs.

Abstract: Accurately simulating physics is crucial across scientific domains, with
applications spanning from robotics to materials science. While traditional
mesh-based simulations are precise, they are often computationally expensive
and require knowledge of physical parameters, such as material properties. In
contrast, data-driven approaches like Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer
faster inference but suffer from two key limitations: Firstly, they must be
retrained from scratch for even minor variations in physical parameters, and
secondly they require labor-intensive data collection for each new parameter
setting. This is inefficient, as simulations with varying parameters often
share a common underlying latent structure. In this work, we address these
challenges by learning this shared structure through meta-learning, enabling
fast adaptation to new physical parameters without retraining. To this end, we
propose a novel architecture that generates a latent representation by encoding
graph trajectories using conditional neural processes (CNPs). To mitigate error
accumulation over time, we combine CNPs with a novel neural operator
architecture. We validate our approach, Meta Neural Graph Operator (MaNGO), on
several dynamics prediction tasks with varying material properties,
demonstrating superior performance over existing GNS methods. Notably, MaNGO
achieves accuracy on unseen material properties close to that of an oracle
model.

TL;DR: A modality-agnostic, multi-task GeoAI benchmark with 7 datasets across three continents to evaluate geospatial embedders; includes simple baselines to anchor comparisons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks are often single-task and single-modality, limiting progress in GeoAI. A standardized, multi-task, modality-agnostic benchmark is needed to assess performance, accuracy, and efficiency across diverse geospatial data while addressing generalizability and potential biases.

Method: Design a modality-agnostic benchmark comprising 7 diverse datasets from cities on three continents, enabling evaluation of geospatial embedders on multiple geographic phenomena. Includes simple, task-oriented baselines to provide reference points for comparing more complex solutions.

Result: The benchmark enables systematic evaluation of GeoAI embedders' performance, accuracy, and efficiency across tasks and modalities; and offers intuitive baselines as reference points for future models.

Conclusion: This benchmark fills a gap in GeoAI benchmarking by enabling standardized, multi-task, modality-agnostic evaluation, promoting generalizability and fair comparisons across geospatial embedding approaches.

Abstract: GeoAI is evolving rapidly, fueled by diverse geospatial datasets like traffic
patterns, environmental data, and crowdsourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) information.
While sophisticated AI models are being developed, existing benchmarks are
often concentrated on single tasks and restricted to a single modality. As
such, progress in GeoAI is limited by the lack of a standardized, multi-task,
modality-agnostic benchmark for their systematic evaluation. This paper
introduces a novel benchmark designed to assess the performance, accuracy, and
efficiency of geospatial embedders. Our benchmark is modality-agnostic and
comprises 7 distinct datasets from diverse cities across three continents,
ensuring generalizability and mitigating demographic biases. It allows for the
evaluation of GeoAI embedders on various phenomena that exhibit underlying
geographic processes. Furthermore, we establish a simple and intuitive
task-oriented model baselines, providing a crucial reference point for
comparing more complex solutions.

### [241] [Gaussian Embeddings: How JEPAs Secretly Learn Your Data Density](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05949)
*Randall Balestriero,Nicolas Ballas,Mike Rabbat,Yann LeCun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The anti-collapse term in JEPA not only prevents representation collapse but yields a closed-form density estimator; JEPA-SCORE computes sample probabilities from the model's Jacobian, applicable across SSL methods and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To obtain representations that generalize across downstream tasks while also providing a principled data-density measure for tasks like data curation, outlier detection, and density estimation, thereby bridging self-supervised learning with probabilistic interpretation.

Method: Formalize Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures with a latent-space prediction term and an anti-collapse term; prove that the anti-collapse term provably estimates data density and that sample probabilities can be computed efficiently in closed-form from the model’s Jacobian J_f(x). Implement JEPA-SCORE and validate across datasets and architectures.

Result: The JEPA framework yields interpretable density estimates; learned sample probabilities can be computed from the Jacobian, demonstrated to work across synthetic, controlled, and real datasets (Imagenet) and across JEPA variants (I-JEPA, DINOv2) and multimodal models like MetaCLIP.

Conclusion: The anti-collapse term serves as a density estimator in addition to preventing collapse, enabling probabilistic interpretation of learned representations. JEPA-SCORE is architecture-agnostic, efficient, and broadly applicable for data-centric tasks such as data curation and outlier detection.

Abstract: Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) learn representations able
to solve numerous downstream tasks out-of-the-box. JEPAs combine two
objectives: (i) a latent-space prediction term, i.e., the representation of a
slightly perturbed sample must be predictable from the original sample's
representation, and (ii) an anti-collapse term, i.e., not all samples should
have the same representation. While (ii) is often considered as an obvious
remedy to representation collapse, we uncover that JEPAs' anti-collapse term
does much more--it provably estimates the data density. In short, any
successfully trained JEPA can be used to get sample probabilities, e.g., for
data curation, outlier detection, or simply for density estimation. Our
theoretical finding is agnostic of the dataset and architecture used--in any
case one can compute the learned probabilities of sample $x$ efficiently and in
closed-form using the model's Jacobian matrix at $x$. Our findings are
empirically validated across datasets (synthetic, controlled, and Imagenet) and
across different Self Supervised Learning methods falling under the JEPA family
(I-JEPA and DINOv2) and on multimodal models, such as MetaCLIP. We denote the
method extracting the JEPA learned density as {\bf JEPA-SCORE}.

### [242] [Paying Attention to Hybrid Attention: Untangling the Issues with Conversion Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05901)
*Martin Benfeghoul,Teresa Delgado,Adnan Oomerjee,Haitham Bou Ammar,Jun Wang,Zafeirios Fountas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Identifies a flaw in post-training linearisation of Transformers where hybrid methods rely too heavily on sliding-window attention, failing to adopt genuine linear attention. Proposes three remedies—inference-time linear-only hybridisation, HedgeCATs (attention-weight transfer + LoRA fine-tuning), and Scheduled Sliding-window Dropout (SSD)—to ensure true linear attention while preserving efficiency and reliable attribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers have quadratic complexity; linear attention reduces complexity but training from scratch is costly. Post-training linearisation to linear models often uses hybrids with SWA that may not actually utilize the linear component, undermining claimed efficiency and fair attribution.

Method: Proposes three solutions: (i) inference-time hybridisation combining linear-only conversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning to balance components; (iii) Scheduled Sliding-window Dropout (SSD), stochastic suppression of the Softmax branch during training to prevent collapse. Uses component-level diagnostics on common-sense benchmarks to reveal the issue.

Result: Maintains computational efficiency while recovering most base-model performance and ensures genuine linear attention adoption. Restores validity of performance attributions in hybrid conversions.

Conclusion: The paper offers practical remedies to prevent component collapse in post-training linearisation, enabling true linear attention usage and fair attribution, while preserving efficiency for scalable Transformer deployment.

Abstract: Transformers' quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability
despite remarkable performance. While linear attention reduces this to linear
complexity, pre-training such models from scratch remains, in most cases,
prohibitively expensive. Recent post-training linearisation methods convert
pre-trained Transformers to linear models efficiently, often using hybrid
approaches that combine linear attention with sliding-window softmax. We
identify a critical flaw: existing hybrid methods inadvertently bypass the
linear component, relying almost entirely on SWA. Component-level diagnostics
reveal this previously undetected behaviour stems from overlooked evaluation
practices on common-sense benchmarks. We propose three solutions to ensure
balanced component usage: (i) inference-time hybridisation of linear-only
conversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining
attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning; and (iii) Scheduled
Sliding-window Dropout (SSD), which stochastically suppresses the softmax
branch during training to prevent component collapse. Our methods maintain
computational efficiency while recovering most base model performance and
ensuring genuine linear attention adoption, restoring the validity of
performance attributions in hybrid conversions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Attention-augmented VAE-BiLSTM with multi-head attention outperforms CAE and plain VAE-BiLSTM for unsupervised anomaly detection in 12-lead ECGs on the CPSC dataset, achieving AUPRC 0.81 and recall 0.85; first application to ECGs, with anomaly localization via an interactive dashboard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detect arrhythmias and cardiovascular abnormalities without labeled anomaly data by leveraging unsupervised learning on normal ECGs; improve triage and interpretability through localization.

Method: Compare three autoencoder-based architectures (CAE, VAE-BiLSTM, VAE-BiLSTM-MHA) trained only on normal ECGs. Apply unified preprocessing and evaluation on the public China Physiological Signal Challenge (CPSC) dataset. Evaluate using AUPRC and recall on a held-out test set; integrate anomaly localization into an interactive dashboard.

Result: Attention-augmented VAE (VAE-BiLSTM-MHA) achieved the best performance with AUPRC 0.81 and recall 0.85, outperforming CAE and VAE-BiLSTM. The model also supports visual anomaly localization via a dashboard and is benchmarked against literature baselines.

Conclusion: VAE-BiLSTM-MHA is a promising architecture for ECG anomaly detection in an unsupervised setting, with strong detection and localization capabilities on the CPSC dataset; further validation on larger and diverse datasets is warranted to assess generalizability.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) is critical for
identifying deviations associated with cardiovascular disease. This work
presents a comparative analysis of three autoencoder-based architectures:
convolutional autoencoder (CAE), variational autoencoder with bidirectional
long short-term memory (VAE-BiLSTM), and VAE-BiLSTM with multi-head attention
(VAE-BiLSTM-MHA), for unsupervised anomaly detection in ECGs. To the best of
our knowledge, this study reports the first application of a VAE-BiLSTM-MHA
architecture to ECG anomaly detection. All models are trained on normal ECG
samples to reconstruct non-anomalous cardiac morphology and detect deviations
indicative of disease. Using a unified preprocessing and evaluation pipeline on
the public China Physiological Signal Challenge (CPSC) dataset, the
attention-augmented VAE achieves the best performance, with an AUPRC of 0.81
and a recall of 0.85 on the held-out test set, outperforming the other
architectures. To support clinical triage, this model is further integrated
into an interactive dashboard that visualizes anomaly localization. In
addition, a performance comparison with baseline models from the literature is
provided.

*Jacob Bamberger,Iolo Jones,Dennis Duncan,Michael M. Bronstein,Pierre Vandergheynst,Adam Gosztolai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CDC-FM generalizes flow matching by replacing isotropic noise with geometry-aware anisotropic Gaussian noise, improving the quality-generalisation tradeoff in deep generative models. The noise covariance encodes local data geometry and is optimally estimable and scalable, yielding broad empirical gains across diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep generative models often face a tradeoff between high sample quality and memorisation of training data. Flow matching with isotropic noise may not capture data geometry, hindering generalisation. There is a need to regularise probability paths with geometry-aware noise.

Method: Introduce Carr e9 du champ flow matching (CDC-FM). Replace homogeneous isotropic noise in FM with spatially varying, anisotropic Gaussian noise whose covariance captures the local geometry of the latent data manifold. Prove that this geometric noise can be optimally estimated from data and scalable to large datasets. Provide a robust algorithm to integrate into existing FM pipelines.

Result: Extensive experiments on synthetic manifolds, point clouds, single-cell genomics, animal motion capture, and images, using various architectures (MLPs, CNNs, Transformers). CDC-FM consistently improves the quality-generalisation tradeoff, with notable gains in data-scarce regimes and highly non-uniformly sampled datasets, and demonstrates robustness and scalability.

Conclusion: CDC-FM offers a mathematical framework for studying the interplay between data geometry, generalisation and memorisation in generative models, and provides a robust, scalable algorithm that can be readily integrated into existing flow matching pipelines.

Abstract: Deep generative models often face a fundamental tradeoff: high sample quality
can come at the cost of memorisation, where the model reproduces training data
rather than generalising across the underlying data geometry. We introduce
Carr\'e du champ flow matching (CDC-FM), a generalisation of flow matching
(FM), that improves the quality-generalisation tradeoff by regularising the
probability path with a geometry-aware noise. Our method replaces the
homogeneous, isotropic noise in FM with a spatially varying, anisotropic
Gaussian noise whose covariance captures the local geometry of the latent data
manifold. We prove that this geometric noise can be optimally estimated from
the data and is scalable to large data. Further, we provide an extensive
experimental evaluation on diverse datasets (synthetic manifolds, point clouds,
single-cell genomics, animal motion capture, and images) as well as various
neural network architectures (MLPs, CNNs, and transformers). We demonstrate
that CDC-FM consistently offers a better quality-generalisation tradeoff. We
observe significant improvements over standard FM in data-scarce regimes and in
highly non-uniformly sampled datasets, which are often encountered in AI for
science applications. Our work provides a mathematical framework for studying
the interplay between data geometry, generalisation and memorisation in
generative models, as well as a robust and scalable algorithm that can be
readily integrated into existing flow matching pipelines.

*Mohamed Bal-Ghaoui,Fayssal Sabri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-agent LLM framework (LLM-FS-Agent) enables interpretable feature selection via a deliberative debate among role-assigned agents, achieving strong classification performance and faster training on IoT intrusion detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional data challenges hinder interpretability and computational efficiency; existing LLM-based feature selection lacks structured reasoning and transparent justifications.

Method: A deliberative multi-agent architecture where agents with distinct roles debate feature relevance and provide justifications; evaluation on CIC-DIAD 2024 IoT intrusion dataset; comparison to LLM-Select and PCA; downstream classifier (XGBoost).

Result: LLM-FS-Agent yields superior or comparable classification results and reduces downstream training time by 46% on average; improvement for XGBoost is statistically significant (p = 0.028).

Conclusion: Deliberative architecture improves decision transparency and computational efficiency, making LLM-FS-Agent a practical and reliable solution for real-world feature selection under high-dimensional data.

Abstract: High-dimensional data remains a pervasive challenge in machine learning,
often undermining model interpretability and computational efficiency. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for dimensionality reduction
through feature selection, existing LLM-based approaches frequently lack
structured reasoning and transparent justification for their decisions. This
paper introduces LLM-FS-Agent, a novel multi-agent architecture designed for
interpretable and robust feature selection. The system orchestrates a
deliberative "debate" among multiple LLM agents, each assigned a specific role,
enabling collective evaluation of feature relevance and generation of detailed
justifications. We evaluate LLM-FS-Agent in the cybersecurity domain using the
CIC-DIAD 2024 IoT intrusion detection dataset and compare its performance
against strong baselines, including LLM-Select and traditional methods such as
PCA. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-FS-Agent consistently achieves
superior or comparable classification performance while reducing downstream
training time by an average of 46% (statistically significant improvement, p =
0.028 for XGBoost). These findings highlight that the proposed deliberative
architecture enhances both decision transparency and computational efficiency,
establishing LLM-FS-Agent as a practical and reliable solution for real-world
applications.

*Xueyan Li,Guinan Su,Mrinmaya Sachan,Jonas Geiping*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Calibrated decoding strategies sample by estimated correctness rather than confidence to enable diverse yet reliable chain-of-thought. Introduces Greedy-Threshold, Calibrated-TopK, and Calibrated-epsilon truncation rules that adjust sampling based on rank-wise estimated correctness, improving math and general reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current decoding heuristics mix different uncertainty sources (exploration vs. post-hoc rejection by confidence) and tie sampling quality to confidence. The paper argues decoding should be calibrated by estimated correctness to balance exploring reasoning paths with maintaining answer quality.

Method: Define estimated rank-wise correctness for candidate tokens and apply three decoding rules: (1) Greedy-Threshold — greedy sampling at steps with very low confidence; (2) Calibrated-TopK — truncate candidate tokens to top-K based on estimated correctness; (3) Calibrated-epsilon — truncate with a threshold determined by estimated rank-wise correctness.

Result: Empirical results show gains on math and general reasoning benchmarks, surpassing standard decoding heuristics that rely on temperature or post-generation rejection, and providing more reliable multi-path reasoning while preserving diversity.

Conclusion: Decoding rules should be calibrated by estimated correctness rather than confidence alone. By sampling tokens with higher estimated correctness and trimming low-correctness options, LLMs can achieve better accuracy and richer reasoning across tasks.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex tasks that
require extended reasoning. In such settings, models often benefit from diverse
chains-of-thought to arrive at multiple candidate solutions. This requires two
competing objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple
reasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path.
Existing works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly
uncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while
others improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence
post-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer
quality. These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different
sources of uncertainty. To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should
be calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone. We should sample from
tokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected
correctness is low. We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal:
Greedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps.
Calibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on
estimated rank-wise correctness. Together, our findings challenge prevailing
heuristics about decoding under uncertainty and show gains across math and
general reasoning benchmarks.

*Sai Karthikeya Vemuri,Adithya Ashok Chalain Valapil,Tim Büchner,Joachim Denzler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RamPINN uses a physics-informed dual-decoder to recover Raman spectra from noisy CARS measurements by disentangling resonant and non-resonant signals under Kramers-Kronig causality; trained on synthetic data, it generalizes to real data and supports self-supervised training without ground-truth spectra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In data-scarce scientific domains, physical laws provide strong inductive biases. Reconstructing Raman spectra from CARS is ill-posed due to a dominant non-resonant background.

Method: A dual-decoder physics-informed neural network (RamPINN) that separates resonant and non-resonant components; enforces KK causality via a differentiable Hilbert-transform loss on the resonant part and a smoothness prior on the non-resonant part; trained entirely on synthetic data; evaluated on real data with zero-shot generalization; shows competitive or superior performance vs baselines.

Result: RamPINN achieves strong zero-shot generalization to real CARS data and significantly outperforms baselines; physics-based losses alone yield competitive results without ground-truth Raman spectra.

Conclusion: Formal scientific rules can serve as powerful inductive biases, enabling robust, self-supervised learning in data-limited scientific domains.

Abstract: Transferring the recent advancements in deep learning into scientific
disciplines is hindered by the lack of the required large-scale datasets for
training. We argue that in these knowledge-rich domains, the established body
of scientific theory provides reliable inductive biases in the form of
governing physical laws. We address the ill-posed inverse problem of recovering
Raman spectra from noisy Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS)
measurements, as the true Raman signal here is suppressed by a dominating
non-resonant background. We propose RamPINN, a model that learns to recover
Raman spectra from given CARS spectra. Our core methodological contribution is
a physics-informed neural network that utilizes a dual-decoder architecture to
disentangle resonant and non-resonant signals. This is done by enforcing the
Kramers-Kronig causality relations via a differentiable Hilbert transform loss
on the resonant and a smoothness prior on the non-resonant part of the signal.
Trained entirely on synthetic data, RamPINN demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization to real-world experimental data, explicitly closing this gap and
significantly outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, we show that
training with these physics-based losses alone, without access to any
ground-truth Raman spectra, still yields competitive results. This work
highlights a broader concept: formal scientific rules can act as a potent
inductive bias, enabling robust, self-supervised learning in data-limited
scientific domains.

*Kevin Raina,Tanya Schmah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new family of Bayesian posthoc OOD scores using expected logit vectors improves OOD detection under limited training data, outperforming deterministic posthoc scores on MNIST/CIFAR-10 with 5000 samples or less.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD detection is critical for AI reliability and safety; in practical settings data is limited, and Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) can model epistemic uncertainty and incorporate prior information. The paper proposes leveraging Bayesian posthoc scoring with expected logits to improve detection.

Method: Introduce a new family of Bayesian posthoc OOD scores based on expected logit vectors; compare 5 Bayesian posthoc OOD scores to 4 deterministic posthoc OOD scores; evaluate on MNIST and CIFAR-10 with small training samples (≤5000).

Result: Bayesian methods outperform the corresponding deterministic methods in the reported experiments.

Conclusion: In low-data regimes, Bayesian posthoc OOD scores built from expected logits provide superior OOD detection, highlighting the value of BNN-based uncertainty for reliability under data scarcity.

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical to AI reliability and safety,
yet in many practical settings, only a limited amount of training data is
available. Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) are a promising class of model on
which to base OOD detection, because they explicitly represent epistemic (i.e.
model) uncertainty. In the small training data regime, BNNs are especially
valuable because they can incorporate prior model information. We introduce a
new family of Bayesian posthoc OOD scores based on expected logit vectors, and
compare 5 Bayesian and 4 deterministic posthoc OOD scores. Experiments on MNIST
and CIFAR-10 In-Distributions, with 5000 training samples or less, show that
the Bayesian methods outperform corresponding deterministic methods.

*Andreas Maurer,Erfan Mirzaei,Massimiliano Pontil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Data-dependent generalization bounds for Gibbs learning in the interpolation regime, robust to Langevin Monte Carlo sampling; empirically validated on MNIST and CIFAR-10, with true-label predictions and bounds for random labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and guarantee generalization when models are overparameterized and can fit impossible labels, by deriving data-dependent bounds for the Gibbs algorithm and showing robustness to practical sampling methods.

Method: Derive data-dependent test-error bounds for the Gibbs distribution in the overparameterized/interpolation regime; establish stability under Langevin Monte Carlo discretization; validate with experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 comparing predictions for true labels and random-label scenarios.

Result: The bounds yield nontrivial predictions on true-labeled data and correctly upper bound test error for random labels; training error in the high-temperature regime signals generalization in the low-temperature interpolation regime; Langevin MC stability supports applicability under approximate sampling.

Conclusion: Generalization in the low-temperature interpolation regime is already signaled by small training errors in the classical high-temperature regime; the results provide practical, data-dependent guarantees and connect behavior across temperature regimes.

Abstract: The paper provides data-dependent bounds on the test error of the Gibbs
algorithm in the overparameterized interpolation regime, where low training
errors are also obtained for impossible data, such as random labels in
classification. The bounds are stable under approximation with Langevin Monte
Carlo algorithms. Experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets verify that
the bounds yield nontrivial predictions on true labeled data and correctly
upper bound the test error for random labels. Our method indicates that
generalization in the low-temperature, interpolation regime is already signaled
by small training errors in the more classical high temperature regime.

*Guillaume Godin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A compact, leakage-resistant fragment-target prevalence representation (molFTP) with dummy masking and key-LOO approximating true LOO, enabling near full-data training and unbiased CV at reduced cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prevent feature leakage across cross-validation folds and provide an efficient, predictive molecular descriptor representation.

Method: Develop molFTP as a compact fragment-target prevalence vector; implement dummy masking to remove information about fragments in held-out molecules; show key-leave-one-out (key-loo) closely approximates molecule-level LOO, enabling near-full data training while preserving unbiased CV estimates.

Result: Key-LOO deviation from true molecule-level LOO is below 8% on the datasets; molFTP yields fast, leakage-resistant vectorization with safeguards that approximate LOO at a fraction of its cost.

Conclusion: MolFTP provides a practical, leakage-resistant, fast fragment-target prevalence representation with mechanisms (dummy masking or key-LOO) to approximate LOO and support unbiased model evaluation at reduced computational cost.

Abstract: We introduce molFTP (molecular fragment-target prevalence), a compact
representation that delivers strong predictive performance. To prevent feature
leakage across cross-validation folds, we implement a dummy-masking procedure
that removes information about fragments present in the held-out molecules. We
further show that key leave-one-out (key-loo) closely approximates true
molecule-level leave-one-out (LOO), with deviation below 8% on our datasets.
This enables near full data training while preserving unbiased cross-validation
estimates of model performance. Overall, molFTP provides a fast,
leakage-resistant fragment-target prevalence vectorization with practical
safeguards (dummy masking or key-LOO) that approximate LOO at a fraction of its
cost.

*Li Zeqiao,Wang Yijing,Wang Haoyu,Li Zheng,Li Peng,Liu Wenfei,Zuo Zhiqiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes H-DSAC, a reward-free, active human-in-the-loop RL method for autonomous driving, combining Proxy Value Propagation with Distributional SAC to encode human intent and guide policy using demonstrations, achieving safe, sample-efficient real-world learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world autonomous driving with RL suffers from unsafe exploration and poor sample efficiency; incorporating human expertise can reduce risk and improve learning efficiency.

Method: Introduce Human-Guided Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (H-DSAC) that builds a distributed proxy value function within DSAC; uses Proxy Value Propagation to encode expert demonstrations by assigning higher returns to expert actions and penalizing actions needing human intervention; extrapolates to unlabeled states to steer policy toward expert-like behavior.

Result: Demonstrates safe, robust, and sample-efficient learning in simulation and real-world driving; practical training times; policy learns effectively.

Conclusion: H-DSAC provides a practical framework for reward-free human-guided RL in autonomous driving, enabling safer and more efficient deployment; potential to generalize to other domains with human-prior information.

Abstract: Autonomous driving with reinforcement learning (RL) has significant
potential. However, applying RL in real-world settings remains challenging due
to the need for safe, efficient, and robust learning. Incorporating human
expertise into the learning process can help overcome these challenges by
reducing risky exploration and improving sample efficiency. In this work, we
propose a reward-free, active human-in-the-loop learning method called
Human-Guided Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (H-DSAC). Our method combines
Proxy Value Propagation (PVP) and Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC) to
enable efficient and safe training in real-world environments. The key
innovation is the construction of a distributed proxy value function within the
DSAC framework. This function encodes human intent by assigning higher expected
returns to expert demonstrations and penalizing actions that require human
intervention. By extrapolating these labels to unlabeled states, the policy is
effectively guided toward expert-like behavior. With a well-designed state
space, our method achieves real-world driving policy learning within practical
training times. Results from both simulation and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our framework enables safe, robust, and sample-efficient
learning for autonomous driving.

### [253] [BLISS: A Lightweight Bilevel Influence Scoring Method for Data Selection in Language Model Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06048)
*Jie Hao,Rui Yu,Wei Zhang,Huixia Wang,Jie Xu,Mingrui Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BLISS is a scratch-only data selection method for LLM pretraining using bilevel optimization and a proxy model to estimate long-term data influence, enabling efficient data selection without external pretrained models; achieves 1.7x speedup at 1B and strong downstream performance on C4 subsets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disentangle data selection effects from external pretrained models and account for long-term impact, while avoiding prohibitive costs of full-scale LLM pretraining.

Method: Train a small proxy model as a stand-in for the LLM; learn a score model that predicts the long-term influence of training samples by simulating convergence of the proxy; formulate a bilevel optimization: upper-level optimizes the score model weights to improve validation performance; lower-level trains the proxy on weighted data until convergence.

Result: BLISS achieves up to 1.7x speedups when pretraining 1B models to match baseline performance, on 410M/1B/2.8B Pythia and LLaMA-0.5B using selected C4 subsets, and shows superior performance across multiple downstream tasks.

Conclusion: BLISS provides a scalable, scratch-based data selection approach that accounts for long-term impact without external oracle models, enabling faster, effective LLM pretraining.

Abstract: Effective data selection is essential for pretraining large language models
(LLMs), enhancing efficiency and improving generalization to downstream tasks.
However, existing approaches often require leveraging external pretrained
models, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of data selection from
those of the external pretrained models. In addition, they often overlook the
long-term impact of selected data if the model is trained to convergence,
primarily due to the prohibitive cost of full-scale LLM pretraining. In this
paper, we introduce BLISS (\textbf{B}ileve\textbf{L} \textbf{I}nfluence
\textbf{S}coring method for data \textbf{S}election): a lightweight data
selection method that operates entirely \emph{from scratch}, without relying on
any external pretrained oracle models, while explicitly accounting for the
long-term impact of selected data. BLISS leverages a small proxy model as a
surrogate for the LLM and employs a score model to estimate the long-term
influence of training samples if the proxy model is trained to convergence. We
formulate data selection as a bilevel optimization problem, where the
upper-level objective optimizes the score model to assign importance weights to
training samples, ensuring that minimizing the lower-level objective (i.e.,
training the proxy model over the weighted training loss until convergence)
leads to best validation performance. Once optimized, the trained score model
predicts influence scores for the dataset, enabling efficient selection of
high-quality samples for LLM pretraining. We validate BLISS by pretraining
410M/1B/2.8B Pythia and LLaMA-0.5B models on selected subsets of the C4
dataset. Notably, under the 1B model setting, BLISS achieves $1.7\times$
speedup in reaching the same performance as the state-of-the-art method,
demonstrating superior performance across multiple downstream tasks.

### [254] [Edit-Based Flow Matching for Temporal Point Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06050)
*David Lüdke,Marten Lienen,Marcel Kollovieh,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: We propose Edit Flow for temporal point processes: a continuous-time Markov chain model using insert, delete, and substitute edits to transport noise to data, learning instantaneous edit rates to enable efficient, non-autoregressive generation; validated on benchmark TPPs for both unconditional and conditional tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive TPPs force sequential sampling and can be inefficient. Non-autoregressive diffusion-style approaches mitigate this by interpolating between noise and data via edits, but are limited to limited edit types. Generalizing to insert/delete/substitute edits within a continuous-time framework aims to improve efficiency, flexibility, and performance for TPP generation.

Method: Introduce Edit Flow, a continuous-time Markov chain over event sequences where instantaneous rates govern insert, delete, and substitute edits. Learn these rates end-to-end to transform noise into data. Generation proceeds by simulating the Markov chain from an initial noise distribution toward a data-analytic target, reducing the total number of edits required compared to baseline methods. The model is trained unconditionally but supports conditional generation tasks.

Result: Empirical results demonstrate the model's generative flexibility across a wide range of unconditional and conditional generation tasks on benchmark temporal point processes.

Conclusion: Edit Flow provides a flexible, efficient non-autoregressive framework for TPPs by learning edit rates in a continuous-time Markov process, reducing the number of edits needed and enabling versatile unconditional and conditional generation.

Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are a fundamental tool for modeling event
sequences in continuous time, but most existing approaches rely on
autoregressive parameterizations that are limited by their sequential sampling.
Recent non-autoregressive, diffusion-style models mitigate these issues by
jointly interpolating between noise and data through event insertions and
deletions in a discrete Markov chain. In this work, we generalize this
perspective and introduce an Edit Flow process for TPPs that transports noise
to data via insert, delete, and substitute edit operations. By learning the
instantaneous edit rates within a continuous-time Markov chain framework, we
attain a flexible and efficient model that effectively reduces the total number
of necessary edit operations during generation. Empirical results demonstrate
the generative flexibility of our unconditionally trained model in a wide range
of unconditional and conditional generation tasks on benchmark TPPs.

### [255] [Analyzing the Effect of Embedding Norms and Singular Values to Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06066)
*Dimitrios Kelesis,Dimitris Fotakis,Georgios Paliouras*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces MASED to quantify oversmoothing in deep GNNs, derives layer-wise/global bounds, analyzes weight/adjacency effects, and presents G-Reg to mitigate oversmoothing; demonstrates deeper, robust node classification and a trade-off between receptive field and parameterization by distributing hops across layers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Oversmoothing is a key barrier to effective deep Graph Neural Networks; there is a need for a concrete metric to quantify oversmoothing and for design principles that can mitigate it and preserve performance at greater depths.

Method: Propose Mean Average Squared Distance (MASED) as a metric for oversmoothing; derive layer-wise bounds on MASED that aggregate into global upper and lower distance bounds; analyze how embedding norms and the largest/smallest singular values of weight matrices affect oversmoothing; show that oversmoothing grows with the number of trainable weight matrices and adjacency matrices; propose decoupling the number of hops (adjacency depth) from the number of weight matrices; introduce G-Reg, a regularization scheme that increases the MASED bounds and improves depth robustness; validate through experiments including a ‘cold start’ scenario and analyze the trade-off between receptive field size and performance by distributing adjacency hops across a small number of layers.

Result: The MASED-based analysis reveals that oversmoothing increases with more trainable weight matrices and more adjacency matrices; G-Reg regularization improves node classification accuracy at large depths and enhances robustness, even in cold-start scenarios; distributing adjacency hops across fewer layers can avoid extreme under- or over-parameterization and yields favorable performance, illustrating a trade-off between receptive field size and model complexity.

Conclusion: MASED provides a quantitative lens to study oversmoothing and enables architectural and regularization strategies (e.g., decoupling hops from weight count and applying G-Reg) to build deeper, more robust GNNs without succumbing to severe oversmoothing.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the factors that contribute to the effect of
oversmoothing in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Specifically, our analysis
is based on a new metric (Mean Average Squared Distance - $MASED$) to quantify
the extent of oversmoothing. We derive layer-wise bounds on $MASED$, which
aggregate to yield global upper and lower distance bounds. Based on this
quantification of oversmoothing, we further analyze the importance of two
different properties of the model; namely the norms of the generated node
embeddings, along with the largest and smallest singular values of the weight
matrices. Building on the insights drawn from the theoretical analysis, we show
that oversmoothing increases as the number of trainable weight matrices and the
number of adjacency matrices increases. We also use the derived layer-wise
bounds on $MASED$ to form a proposal for decoupling the number of hops (i.e.,
adjacency depth) from the number of weight matrices. In particular, we
introduce G-Reg, a regularization scheme that increases the bounds, and
demonstrate through extensive experiments that by doing so node classification
accuracy increases, achieving robustness at large depths. We further show that
by reducing oversmoothing in deep networks, we can achieve better results in
some tasks than using shallow ones. Specifically, we experiment with a ``cold
start" scenario, i.e., when there is no feature information for the unlabeled
nodes. Finally, we show empirically the trade-off between receptive field size
(i.e., number of weight matrices) and performance, using the $MASED$ bounds.
This is achieved by distributing adjacency hops across a small number of
trainable layers, avoiding the extremes of under- or over-parameterization of
the GNN.

*João Palmeiro,Diogo Duarte,Rita Costa,Pedro Bizarro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A synthetic 18k-scatterplot dataset and benchmark evaluate AI models on scatterplot tasks; counting clusters/outliers works with prompts; localization suffers; avoid certain designs; GitHub materials available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scatterplots are ubiquitous in data analysis, but benchmarks rarely cover scatterplot-specific tasks; there is a need for objective evaluation of AI systems on such tasks.

Method: Create a dataset of 18,000+ scatterplots generated from six data generators and 17 chart designs, annotated with cluster bounding boxes, center coordinates, and outlier coordinates. Develop five tasks based on these annotations and evaluate proprietary models from OpenAI and Google (Gemini 2.5 Flash) using N-shot prompting.

Result: OpenAI models and Gemini 2.5 Flash perform well at counting clusters and outliers (90%+ accuracy when prompted with examples). Localization-related tasks perform poorly, with precision/recall near or below 50% (Flash achieves 65.01% for outlier identification). Design choices have a secondary impact; avoid scatterplots with very wide aspect ratios (16:9, 21:9) or random coloring.

Conclusion: The dataset and benchmark provide a baseline for scatterplot analysis by AI models, highlighting strengths in counting tasks and limitations in localization. Supplementary materials are available at the provided GitHub repository and indicate directions for improving model capability in localization and design-aware processing.

Abstract: AI models are increasingly used for data analysis and visualization, yet
benchmarks rarely address scatterplot-specific tasks, limiting insight into
performance. To address this gap for one of the most common chart types, we
introduce a synthetic, annotated dataset of over 18,000 scatterplots from six
data generators and 17 chart designs, and a benchmark based on it. We evaluate
proprietary models from OpenAI and Google using N-shot prompting on five
distinct tasks derived from annotations of cluster bounding boxes, their center
coordinates, and outlier coordinates. OpenAI models and Gemini 2.5 Flash,
especially when prompted with examples, are viable options for counting
clusters and, in Flash's case, outliers (90%+ Accuracy). However, the results
for localization-related tasks are unsatisfactory: Precision and Recall are
near or below 50%, except for Flash in outlier identification (65.01%).
Furthermore, the impact of chart design on performance appears to be a
secondary factor, but it is advisable to avoid scatterplots with wide aspect
ratios (16:9 and 21:9) or those colored randomly. Supplementary materials are
available at https://github.com/feedzai/biy-paper.

*Lulu Gong,Shreya Saxena*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tensor-EM: a hybrid tensor-based initialization with Kalman-EM refinement for MoLDS, providing identifiability guarantees and improved robustness; validated on synthetic data and neural recordings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To model time-series with diverse temporal dynamics across trajectories (MoLDS), while addressing identifiability and optimization issues: pure tensor methods can struggle with noise; EM methods are flexible but prone to local minima; a guaranteed-identifiable initialization followed by EM can combine strengths.

Method: Construct moment tensors from input-output data to obtain globally consistent estimates of mixture weights and system parameters for MoLDS. Then refine these estimates using a Kalman-EM algorithm with closed-form updates for LDS parameters, combining tensor identifiability with EM flexibility.

Result: On synthetic data, Tensor-EM achieves more reliable recovery and robustness than either pure tensor methods or randomly initialized EM. In neural data from primate somatosensory cortex during reaching in different directions, the method models and clusters different conditions as separate subsystems, aligning with supervised single-LDS fits. A second neural dataset with sequential reaching tasks shows similar effectiveness. Overall, Tensor-EM improves MoLDS learning for complex neural data.

Conclusion: Tensor-EM provides identifiability guarantees for MoLDS learning and leverages EM refinements to capitalize on flexibility, delivering robust performance on synthetic and real neural data and enabling decomposition of neural dynamics into interpretable subsystems.

Abstract: Mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MoLDS) provide a path to model
time-series data that exhibit diverse temporal dynamics across trajectories.
However, its application remains challenging in complex and noisy settings,
limiting its effectiveness for neural data analysis. Tensor-based moment
methods can provide global identifiability guarantees for MoLDS, but their
performance degrades under noise and complexity. Commonly used
expectation-maximization (EM) methods offer flexibility in fitting latent
models but are highly sensitive to initialization and prone to poor local
minima. Here, we propose a tensor-based method that provides identifiability
guarantees for learning MoLDS, which is followed by EM updates to combine the
strengths of both approaches. The novelty in our approach lies in the
construction of moment tensors using the input-output data to recover globally
consistent estimates of mixture weights and system parameters. These estimates
can then be refined through a Kalman EM algorithm, with closed-form updates for
all LDS parameters. We validate our framework on synthetic benchmarks and
real-world datasets. On synthetic data, the proposed Tensor-EM method achieves
more reliable recovery and improved robustness compared to either pure tensor
or randomly initialized EM methods. We then analyze neural recordings from the
primate somatosensory cortex while a non-human primate performs reaches in
different directions. Our method successfully models and clusters different
conditions as separate subsystems, consistent with supervised single-LDS fits
for each condition. Finally, we apply this approach to another neural dataset
where monkeys perform a sequential reaching task. These results demonstrate
that MoLDS provides an effective framework for modeling complex neural data,
and that Tensor-EM is a reliable approach to MoLDS learning for these
applications.

*Nyal Patel,Matthieu Bou,Arjun Jagota,Satyapriya Krishna,Sonali Parbhoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Failure-aware IRL targets misclassified or difficult RLHF preference examples to better recover latent rewards, improving alignment and re-RLHF.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing IRL on RLHF treats all preference pairs equally, ignoring informative failures; there is a need for interpretable, safety-relevant signals and a way to audit the reward signals learned during RLHF.

Method: Identify failures (examples where the reward model misclassifies or assigns near-equal scores) and train a reward model primarily from these signals to recover latent rewards; applied to LLM detoxification; does not rely on external classifiers or supervision; evaluated against baseline IRL methods.

Result: Outperforms existing IRL baselines on multiple metrics; yields rewards that better reflect the true incentives learned during RLHF; enables more effective re-RLHF training; scalable and robust for auditing model alignment and reducing ambiguity in IRL.

Conclusion: Failure-aware IRL provides a robust, scalable approach to auditing model alignment and extracting latent reward signals more accurately by focusing on failures.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet the underlying reward signals they
internalize remain hidden, posing a critical challenge for interpretability and
safety. Existing approaches attempt to extract these latent incentives using
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), but treat all preference pairs equally,
often overlooking the most informative signals: those examples the extracted
reward model misclassifies or assigns nearly equal scores, which we term
\emph{failures}. We introduce a novel \emph{failure-aware} IRL algorithm that
focuses on misclassified or difficult examples to recover the latent rewards
defining model behaviors. By learning from these failures, our failure-aware
IRL extracts reward functions that better reflect the true objectives behind
RLHF. We demonstrate that failure-aware IRL outperforms existing IRL baselines
across multiple metrics when applied to LLM detoxification, without requiring
external classifiers or supervision. Crucially, failure-aware IRL yields
rewards that better capture the true incentives learned during RLHF, enabling
more effective re-RLHF training than standard IRL. This establishes
failure-aware IRL as a robust, scalable method for auditing model alignment and
reducing ambiguity in the IRL process.

*Matthieu Bou,Nyal Patel,Arjun Jagota,Satyapriya Krishna,Sonali Parbhoo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Bayesian IRL auditing framework to uncover and quantify non-identifiability in LLM reward inference, enable uncertainty-aware diagnostics, and validate RLHF outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs optimize opaque objectives; existing IRL approaches yield single, overconfident estimates and ignore the fundamental non-identifiability of reward inference. There is a need for robust auditing to ensure trust, safety, and accountability in AI systems.

Method: Uses Bayesian Inverse Reinforcement Learning to infer a distribution over objectives rather than a single estimate. Introduces three audit capabilities: (i) posterior contraction over sequential evidence to quantify and reduce non-identifiability; (ii) uncertainty-aware diagnostics to expose spurious shortcuts and detect out-of-distribution prompts where the inferred objective is unreliable; (iii) validating policy-level utility by incorporating the refined, low-uncertainty reward into RLHF to achieve training dynamics and toxicity reductions comparable to ground-truth alignment.

Result: Empirically audits a detoxified LLM, obtaining a well-calibrated, interpretable objective. The framework yields toxicity reductions and alignment guarantees, with policy performance similar to those obtained via the ground-truth alignment process.

Conclusion: Provides a practical toolkit for auditors, safety teams, and regulators to verify what LLMs are really optimizing, advancing trustworthy and accountable AI.

Abstract: The objectives that Large Language Models (LLMs) implicitly optimize remain
dangerously opaque, making trustworthy alignment and auditing a grand
challenge. While Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can infer reward
functions from behaviour, existing approaches either produce a single,
overconfident reward estimate or fail to address the fundamental ambiguity of
the task (non-identifiability). This paper introduces a principled auditing
framework that re-frames reward inference from a simple estimation task to a
comprehensive process for verification. Our framework leverages Bayesian IRL to
not only recover a distribution over objectives but to enable three critical
audit capabilities: (i) Quantifying and systematically reducing
non-identifiability by demonstrating posterior contraction over sequential
rounds of evidence; (ii) Providing actionable, uncertainty-aware diagnostics
that expose spurious shortcuts and identify out-of-distribution prompts where
the inferred objective cannot be trusted; and (iii) Validating policy-level
utility by showing that the refined, low-uncertainty reward can be used
directly in RLHF to achieve training dynamics and toxicity reductions
comparable to the ground-truth alignment process. Empirically, our framework
successfully audits a detoxified LLM, yielding a well-calibrated and
interpretable objective that strengthens alignment guarantees. Overall, this
work provides a practical toolkit for auditors, safety teams, and regulators to
verify what LLMs are truly trying to achieve, moving us toward more trustworthy
and accountable AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain why deep nets can learn in high dimensions despite the curse of dimensionality; identify latent structure that makes learning tractable and governs generalization.

Method: Study the roles of locality and compositionality in data, tasks, and deep learning representations.

Result: Not specified in the provided abstract.

Conclusion: Localization and compositional structure are proposed as central factors in understanding learnability and generalization in deep networks.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success, yet our understanding
of how they learn remains limited. These models can learn high-dimensional
tasks, which is generally statistically intractable due to the curse of
dimensionality. This apparent paradox suggests that learnable data must have an
underlying latent structure. What is the nature of this structure? How do
neural networks encode and exploit it, and how does it quantitatively impact
performance - for instance, how does generalization improve with the number of
training examples? This thesis addresses these questions by studying the roles
of locality and compositionality in data, tasks, and deep learning
representations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Influence-based pruning defines data quality for chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning using influence functions that measure the causal effect of each CoT example on downstream accuracy, and shows it outperforms perplexity and embedding-based baselines for math reasoning within a model family.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quality of reasoning data is ill-defined and difficult to optimize using indirect heuristics. Existing strategies rely on problem difficulty or trace length, and automated selection methods for reasoning data are underexplored. A principled, causal criterion is needed to select high-quality CoT data.

Method: Compute influence functions to estimate the causal impact of individual CoT examples on downstream accuracy; use these estimates to perform influence-based pruning (data selection). Compare its performance against perplexity- and embedding-based baselines within a model family, focusing on math reasoning tasks.

Result: Influence-based pruning consistently outperforms perplexity and embedding-based baselines on math reasoning within the same model family.

Conclusion: A principled, causal criterion for CoT data quality is proposed, enabling more effective data curation for reasoning tasks and potentially reducing the data needed to achieve strong performance.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on chain-of-thought (CoT) data shows
that a small amount of high-quality data can outperform massive datasets. Yet,
what constitutes "quality" remains ill-defined. Existing reasoning methods rely
on indirect heuristics such as problem difficulty or trace length, while
instruction-tuning has explored a broader range of automated selection
strategies, but rarely in the context of reasoning. We propose to define
reasoning data quality using influence functions, which measure the causal
effect of individual CoT examples on downstream accuracy, and introduce
influence-based pruning, which consistently outperforms perplexity and
embedding-based baselines on math reasoning within a model family.

### [262] [PolyGraph Discrepancy: a classifier-based metric for graph generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06122)
*Markus Krimmel,Philip Hartout,Karsten Borgwardt,Dexiong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PolyGraph Discrepancy (PGD) provides an absolute, descriptor-comparable evaluation for graph generative models by bounding the JS distance via classifier-based tests on descriptor features; metrics are in [0,1] and a combined bound is derived, offering robustness and interpretability over MMD; code is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing MMD-based evaluations for graph generative models rank models but do not offer an absolute performance measure and are highly sensitive to kernel and descriptor choices, limiting cross-descriptor comparability.

Method: Fit binary classifiers to distinguish real vs. generated graphs using graph descriptors as features; the data log-likelihood of these classifiers serves as a variational lower bound on the Jensen-Shannon distance between real and generated graph distributions; metrics are constrained to [0,1] and a theoretically grounded summary metric combines individual descriptor metrics to yield the tightest possible lower bound for the given descriptors.

Result: Thorough experiments show PGD yields a more robust and insightful evaluation than MMD metrics; the PolyGraph benchmarking framework is publicly available.

Conclusion: PGD provides a robust, comparable framework for benchmarking graph generative models, enabling cross-descriptor comparisons and offering a practical benchmarking tool through open-source release.

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating graph generative models primarily rely on
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metrics based on graph descriptors. While these
metrics can rank generative models, they do not provide an absolute measure of
performance. Their values are also highly sensitive to extrinsic parameters,
namely kernel and descriptor parametrization, making them incomparable across
different graph descriptors. We introduce PolyGraph Discrepancy (PGD), a new
evaluation framework that addresses these limitations. It approximates the
Jensen-Shannon distance of graph distributions by fitting binary classifiers to
distinguish between real and generated graphs, featurized by these descriptors.
The data log-likelihood of these classifiers approximates a variational lower
bound on the JS distance between the two distributions. Resulting metrics are
constrained to the unit interval [0,1] and are comparable across different
graph descriptors. We further derive a theoretically grounded summary metric
that combines these individual metrics to provide a maximally tight lower bound
on the distance for the given descriptors. Thorough experiments demonstrate
that PGD provides a more robust and insightful evaluation compared to MMD
metrics. The PolyGraph framework for benchmarking graph generative models is

### [263] [Downsized and Compromised?: Assessing the Faithfulness of Model Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06125)
*Moumita Kamal,Douglas A. Talbert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces faithfulness-focused metrics for compressed models, using model agreement and chi-squared tests to detect shifts in behavior beyond accuracy, demonstrated on ANNs with quantization/pruning across three datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compression improves efficiency but is often evaluated only on size-accuracy trade-offs, neglecting faithfulness to the original model—critical in high-stakes domains like healthcare, finance, and justice.

Method: Proposes faithfulness metrics that measure predictive consistency between original and compressed models via model agreement; uses chi-squared tests to detect significant changes in predictive patterns across the full data and demographic subgroups; applies quantization and pruning to ANNs on three datasets to illustrate the approach.

Result: High accuracy does not guarantee faithfulness; statistical tests reveal subtle shifts missed by standard metrics like accuracy and Equalized Odds.

Conclusion: The proposed metrics offer a practical approach to ensure efficiency gains from compression do not undermine the faithfulness or fairness of AI systems.

Abstract: In real-world applications, computational constraints often require
transforming large models into smaller, more efficient versions through model
compression. While these techniques aim to reduce size and computational cost
without sacrificing performance, their evaluations have traditionally focused
on the trade-off between size and accuracy, overlooking the aspect of model
faithfulness. This limited view is insufficient for high-stakes domains like
healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, where compressed models must remain
faithful to the behavior of their original counterparts. This paper presents a
novel approach to evaluating faithfulness in compressed models, moving beyond
standard metrics. We introduce and demonstrate a set of faithfulness metrics
that capture how model behavior changes post-compression. Our contributions
include introducing techniques to assess predictive consistency between the
original and compressed models using model agreement, and applying chi-squared
tests to detect statistically significant changes in predictive patterns across
both the overall dataset and demographic subgroups, thereby exposing shifts
that aggregate fairness metrics may obscure. We demonstrate our approaches by
applying quantization and pruning to artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained
on three diverse and socially meaningful datasets. Our findings show that high
accuracy does not guarantee faithfulness, and our statistical tests detect
subtle yet significant shifts that are missed by standard metrics, such as
Accuracy and Equalized Odds. The proposed metrics provide a practical and more
direct method for ensuring that efficiency gains through compression do not
compromise the fairness or faithfulness essential for trustworthy AI.

*Haoxin Wang,Xiaolong Tu,Hongyu Ke,Huirong Chai,Dawei Chen,Kyungtae Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: lm-Meter is a lightweight, online latency profiler designed for on-device LLM inference, providing real-time, fine-grained latency measurements (phase and kernel levels) with minimal overhead on mobile/edge hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address privacy, reliability, and reduced communication costs by enabling on-device LLMs, while tackling high memory/compute demands and the lack of visibility into performance-efficiency trade-offs on constrained hardware.

Method: lm-Meter measures real-time latency across phases (embedding, prefill, decode, softmax, sampling) and kernel-level operations without extra devices, runs on commercial mobile platforms, and provides high profiling accuracy with minimal overhead.

Result: Shows small overhead (e.g., 2.58% throughput loss in prefill, 0.99% in decode under Powersave governor) and enables comprehensive empirical studies of bottlenecks, accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, and optimization opportunities; implements a first-of-its-kind profiling tool for on-device LLMs.

Conclusion: lm-Meter offers unprecedented runtime visibility into on-device LLMs, enabling informed optimization and democratizing on-device AI; code and tutorials are publicly available.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into everyday
applications, but their prevalent cloud-based deployment raises growing
concerns around data privacy and long-term sustainability. Running LLMs locally
on mobile and edge devices (on-device LLMs) offers the promise of enhanced
privacy, reliability, and reduced communication costs. However, realizing this
vision remains challenging due to substantial memory and compute demands, as
well as limited visibility into performance-efficiency trade-offs on
resource-constrained hardware. We propose lm-Meter, the first lightweight,
online latency profiler tailored for on-device LLM inference. lm-Meter captures
fine-grained, real-time latency at both phase (e.g., embedding, prefill,
decode, softmax, sampling) and kernel levels without auxiliary devices. We
implement lm-Meter on commercial mobile platforms and demonstrate its high
profiling accuracy with minimal system overhead, e.g., only 2.58% throughput
reduction in prefill and 0.99% in decode under the most constrained Powersave
governor. Leveraging lm-Meter, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies
revealing phase- and kernel-level bottlenecks in on-device LLM inference,
quantifying accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, and identifying systematic
optimization opportunities. lm-Meter provides unprecedented visibility into the
runtime behavior of LLMs on constrained platforms, laying the foundation for
informed optimization and accelerating the democratization of on-device LLM
systems. Code and tutorials are available at

### [265] [Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning with Language-Encoded Gated Policy Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06138)
*Rushiv Arora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEXPOL is a language-conditioned mixture-of-policies for multi-task RL that uses a text encoder and a learned gate to select/blend sub-policies based on natural-language task descriptions. It achieves strong performance on MetaWorld with end-to-end training and without task-specific retraining. The gate can compose fixed expert policies to handle novel tasks, showing natural language can index and recombine reusable skills in a single policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage natural-language task metadata to guide behavior across diverse objectives, enabling a single policy to adapt to multiple tasks without per-task retraining and to improve sample efficiency.

Method: LEXPOL encodes task metadata via a text encoder; a gating module learns to select or blend among multiple sub-policies (mixture-of-policies); trained end-to-end across tasks on MetaWorld; additional analysis with fixed experts to study gate composition.

Result: On MetaWorld benchmarks, LEXPOL matches or outperforms strong multi-task baselines in success rate and sample efficiency; no task-specific retraining. Gate can compose independently provided expert policies to produce behaviors aligned with novel task descriptions and unseen combinations.

Conclusion: Natural-language metadata can effectively index and recombine reusable skills within a single policy; language-conditioned gates enable flexible, end-to-end multi-task RL; results support potential for scalable, language-guided RL.

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning often relies on task metadata -- such as
brief natural-language descriptions -- to guide behavior across diverse
objectives. We present Lexical Policy Networks (LEXPOL), a language-conditioned
mixture-of-policies architecture for multi-task RL. LEXPOL encodes task
metadata with a text encoder and uses a learned gating module to select or
blend among multiple sub-policies, enabling end-to-end training across tasks.
On MetaWorld benchmarks, LEXPOL matches or exceeds strong multi-task baselines
in success rate and sample efficiency, without task-specific retraining. To
analyze the mechanism, we further study settings with fixed expert policies
obtained independently of the gate and show that the learned language gate
composes these experts to produce behaviors appropriate to novel task
descriptions and unseen task combinations. These results indicate that
natural-language metadata can effectively index and recombine reusable skills
within a single policy.

### [266] [Improved High-probability Convergence Guarantees of Decentralized SGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06141)
*Aleksandar Armacki,Ali H. Sayed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DSGD converges in high-probability (HP) for decentralized networks under light-tailed noise under the same conditions as MSE, removing the need for uniformly bounded gradients and other strong assumptions, while achieving order-optimal rates for non-convex and strongly convex costs and linear speed-up with the number of users.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HP guarantees in decentralized settings are less understood and often rely on strong assumptions that separate HP from MSE analyses. This work aims to align HP convergence with MSE conditions, enabling robust, scalable performance in decentralized SGD.

Method: MGF-based analysis of key quantities (gradient norm or optimality gap) and the consensus gap between agents. It derives HP convergence under light-tailed noise without requiring uniformly bounded gradients, and provides variance-reduction insights specific to decentralized methods, along with refined MGF bounds for strongly convex costs to obtain linear speed-up.

Result: DSGD is shown to converge in HP under the same function-conditions as MSE, removing restrictive gradient-boundedness assumptions, achieving order-optimal rates for non-convex and strongly convex cases, and exhibiting linear speed-up in the number of users. The analysis yields new MGFs for the quantities of interest and for consensus errors, along with a variance-reduction effect unique to decentralized HP settings.

Conclusion: This work closes much of the gap between HP and MSE analyses in decentralized SGD, demonstrating that HP guarantees can match MSE guarantees under the same problem conditions. The introduced MGF-based techniques and variance-reduction insights may spur further HP analyses in networked optimization and offer practical benefits for scalable, reliable distributed learning.

Abstract: Convergence in high-probability (HP) has been receiving increasing interest,
due to its attractive properties, such as exponentially decaying tail bounds
and strong guarantees for each individual run of an algorithm. While HP
guarantees are extensively studied in centralized settings, much less is
understood in the decentralized, networked setup. Existing HP studies in
decentralized settings impose strong assumptions, like uniformly bounded
gradients, or asymptotically vanishing noise, resulting in a significant gap
between assumptions used to establish convergence in the HP and the
mean-squared error (MSE) sense, even for vanilla Decentralized Stochastic
Gradient Descent ($\mathtt{DSGD}$) algorithm. This is contrary to centralized
settings, where it is known that $\mathtt{SGD}$ converges in HP under the same
conditions on the cost function as needed to guarantee MSE convergence.
Motivated by this observation, we revisit HP guarantees for $\mathtt{DSGD}$ in
the presence of light-tailed noise. We show that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ converges in
HP under the same conditions on the cost as in the MSE sense, removing
uniformly bounded gradients and other restrictive assumptions, while
simultaneously achieving order-optimal rates for both non-convex and strongly
convex costs. Moreover, our improved analysis yields linear speed-up in the
number of users, demonstrating that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ maintains strong
performance in the HP sense and matches existing MSE guarantees. Our improved
results stem from a careful analysis of the MGF of quantities of interest
(norm-squared of gradient or optimality gap) and the MGF of the consensus gap
between users' models. To achieve linear speed-up, we provide a novel result on
the variance-reduction effect of decentralized methods in the HP sense and more
fine-grained bounds on the MGF for strongly convex costs, which are both of
independent interest.

### [267] [LLMs as Policy-Agnostic Teammates: A Case Study in Human Proxy Design for Heterogeneous Agent Teams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06151)
*Aju Ani Justus,Chris Baber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can act as policy-agnostic human proxies to generate synthetic data for heterogeneous-agent teams, showing alignment with experts, human-like risk variability, and human-like trajectories, offering scalable data for simulating human teammates though not fully capturing full adaptability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome reliance on costly/hard-to-obtain human data for training collaborators with inaccessible or non-stationary teammates; leverage LLMs to emulate human decision-making and provide scalable, policy-agnostic data.

Method: Three experiments in a grid-world capture game inspired by Stag Hunt. Experiment 1 compares decisions from 30 humans and 2 expert judges with outputs from LLaMA 3.1 and Mixtral 8x22B. Experiment 2 prompts LLMs to induce risk-sensitive strategies. Experiment 3 tests LLMs generating movement actions in a dynamic grid-world. Models used: LLaMA 3.1 and Mixtral 8x22B, with prompts based on game-state observations and reward structures.

Result: LLMs align more closely with experts than with lay participants, indicating consistent application of underlying decision criteria. They exhibit human-like variability when prompted to be risk-averse or risk-seeking, and generate trajectories in dynamic settings resembling human paths. While not fully reproducing human adaptability, prompt-guided diversity provides a scalable basis for simulating policy-agnostic teammates.

Conclusion: LLMs offer a scalable foundation for simulating human-like teammates in heterogeneous-agent settings by generating diverse, policy-agnostic data, but further work is needed to improve fidelity to human adaptability and cover broader decision contexts.

Abstract: A critical challenge in modelling Heterogeneous-Agent Teams is training
agents to collaborate with teammates whose policies are inaccessible or
non-stationary, such as humans. Traditional approaches rely on expensive
human-in-the-loop data, which limits scalability. We propose using Large
Language Models (LLMs) as policy-agnostic human proxies to generate synthetic
data that mimics human decision-making. To evaluate this, we conduct three
experiments in a grid-world capture game inspired by Stag Hunt, a game theory
paradigm that balances risk and reward. In Experiment 1, we compare decisions
from 30 human participants and 2 expert judges with outputs from LLaMA 3.1 and
Mixtral 8x22B models. LLMs, prompted with game-state observations and reward
structures, align more closely with experts than participants, demonstrating
consistency in applying underlying decision criteria. Experiment 2 modifies
prompts to induce risk-sensitive strategies (e.g. "be risk averse"). LLM
outputs mirror human participants' variability, shifting between risk-averse
and risk-seeking behaviours. Finally, Experiment 3 tests LLMs in a dynamic
grid-world where the LLM agents generate movement actions. LLMs produce
trajectories resembling human participants' paths. While LLMs cannot yet fully
replicate human adaptability, their prompt-guided diversity offers a scalable
foundation for simulating policy-agnostic teammates.

### [268] [TabPFN-Wide: Continued Pre-Training for Extreme Feature Counts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06162)
*Christopher Kolberg,Katharina Eggensperger,Nico Pfeifer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A strategy to extend prior-data fitted networks to high-dimensional, noisy biomedical data by continued pre-training on synthetic data from a customized prior, yielding TabPFN-Wide that scales to >50,000 features, improves robustness to noise, and preserves interpretability for feature importance analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biomedical datasets often have few samples but thousands of noisy features, making conventional ML challenging. While prior-data fitted networks are strong for tabular data, they struggle with very high feature counts and lack interpretability for feature importance. There is a need for scalable, interpretable models that support high-dimensional analysis and biological discovery.

Method: Continue pre-training of a base prior-data fitted network on synthetic data sampled from a tailored prior to create TabPFN-Wide, enabling scaling beyond 50k features. The approach preserves interpretability and is evaluated on real-world biomedical datasets, focusing on robustness to noise and feature-importance insights.

Result: TabPFN-Wide matches or exceeds the base model's performance, shows improved robustness to noise, scales beyond 50,000 features regardless of noise level, and maintains interpretability. On real biomedical datasets, top features overlap with known biology, with additional plausible novel associations proposed.

Conclusion: Prior-informed adaptation effectively extends foundation models to high-dimensional biomedical data, enabling robust, interpretable analysis and discovery; the approach supports scalable feature analysis and aligns with existing biological findings while offering new hypotheses.

Abstract: Revealing novel insights from the relationship between molecular measurements
and pathology remains a very impactful application of machine learning in
biomedicine. Data in this domain typically contain only a few observations but
thousands of potentially noisy features, posing challenges for conventional
machine learning approaches. While prior-data fitted networks emerge as
foundation models for tabular data, they are currently not suited to handle
large feature counts (>500). Although feature reduction enables their
application, it hinders feature importance analysis. We propose a strategy that
extends existing models through continued pre-training on synthetic data
sampled from a customized prior. The resulting model, TabPFN-Wide, matches or
exceeds its base model's performance while exhibiting improved robustness to
noise. It seamlessly scales beyond 50,000 features, regardless of noise levels,
while maintaining inherent interpretability, which is critical for biomedical
applications. Our results show that prior-informed adaptation is suitable to
enhance the capability of foundation models for high-dimensional data. On
real-world biomedical datasets many of the most relevant features identified by
the model overlap with previous biological findings, while others propose
potential starting points for future studies.

*Kurt Butler,Guanchao Feng,Petar Djuric*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A general theory of higher-order feature attribution built on Integrated Gradients to capture interactions between input features, with theoretical results and toy validations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature interactions (multiplicative or joint effects) complicate standard attribution methods that assume feature independence. This work proposes a principled extension of Integrated Gradients to quantify higher-order contributions, addressing a gap in explainable AI and linking to statistics and topological signal processing.

Method: Develop higher-order attribution by extending Integrated Gradients via higher-order path integrals of gradients across input paths, producing zeroth, first-order, and higher-order terms that decompose the output into individual and interaction contributions. Prove key properties (completeness, linearity, etc.) and establish connections to statistical interaction measures and topological signal processing within the framework. Validate with theoretical results and toy/examples.

Result: The theory is formalized with proofs and demonstrated on several synthetic examples; higher-order IG terms reveal interaction effects that are not captured by first-order attributions and align with ground-truth joint contributions. The work also establishes connections to statistics and topological signal processing.

Conclusion: The work offers a principled extension of feature attribution to higher-order interactions, providing a unified IG-based framework for explainable AI. It lays groundwork for broader empirical validation and applications in complex models.

Abstract: Feature attributions are post-training analysis methods that assess how
various input features of a machine learning model contribute to an output
prediction. Their interpretation is straightforward when features act
independently, but becomes less direct when the predictive model involves
interactions such as multiplicative relationships or joint feature
contributions. In this work, we propose a general theory of higher-order
feature attribution, which we develop on the foundation of Integrated Gradients
(IG). This work extends existing frameworks in the literature on explainable
AI. When using IG as the method of feature attribution, we discover natural
connections to statistics and topological signal processing. We provide several
theoretical results that establish the theory, and we validate our theory on a
few examples.

*Nathan X. Kodama,Michael Hinczewski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theoretical-empirical study linking score-based diffusion models to non-equilibrium thermodynamics via an entropy-rate-based lower bound on negative log-likelihood, with numerical validation on synthetic data and exploration of Maxwell's demon analogies and thermodynamic computing implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge generative modeling with fundamental physical principles; understand performance limits of diffusion models through stochastic thermodynamics and entropy rates; explore potential thermodynamic costs and hardware implications.

Method: Derives a lower bound on the negative log-likelihood of data in terms of entropy rates of diffusion processes (system, intrinsic, exchange). Establishes theoretical connections between score-based diffusion models and non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Validates the bound numerically on a synthetic dataset and analyzes its tightness; discusses analogies to Maxwell's demon and potential thermodynamic computing hardware implications.

Result: A formal lower bound linking model performance to entropy-rate quantities is established. Numerical experiments indicate the bound is informative and its tightness can be assessed on synthetic data. The work provides interpretative insights via an entropy-rate framework and frames the operation of diffusion models in thermodynamic terms.

Conclusion: The framework unites generative modeling performance with fundamental thermodynamic principles, offering a new lens (stochastic thermodynamics) to study score-based diffusion models and suggesting avenues for computation hardware informed by thermodynamics.

Abstract: We establish a fundamental connection between score-based diffusion models
and non-equilibrium thermodynamics by deriving performance limits based on
entropy rates. Our main theoretical contribution is a lower bound on the
negative log-likelihood of the data that relates model performance to entropy
rates of diffusion processes. We numerically validate this bound on a synthetic
dataset and investigate its tightness. By building a bridge to entropy rates -
system, intrinsic, and exchange entropy - we provide new insights into the
thermodynamic operation of these models, drawing parallels to Maxwell's demon
and implications for thermodynamic computing hardware. Our framework connects
generative modeling performance to fundamental physical principles through
stochastic thermodynamics.

*Jinwen Xu,Qin Lu,Georgios B. Giannakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable, graph-aware Gaussian-process uncertainty quantification (UQ) framework that uses random-feature kernel approximations and online conformal prediction to deliver calibrated, data-adaptive prediction sets for graph-structured data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification on graphs is crucial for safety-critical network applications. Classical GP approaches are hampered by high computational cost and restrictive modeling assumptions, which can lead to poor calibration when data arrive sequentially.

Method: Introduce a graph-aware parametric GP built on random-feature kernel approximations for scalable, recursive Bayesian updates. Use an ensemble of such graph-aware GPs with per-model weights that adapt as data streams in. Post-process predictions with online conformal prediction to obtain valid, adaptive prediction sets under model mis-specification.

Result: The approach achieves improved predictive coverage and more efficient prediction sets compared to baselines by adaptively ensembling GP models and tuning conformal thresholds in an online fashion.

Conclusion: Combining RF-based scalable graph GPs with online conformal prediction yields robust, scalable UQ for graphs with incremental data, offering calibrated uncertainty sets and improved efficiency.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) over graphs arises in a number of
safety-critical applications in network science. The Gaussian process (GP), as
a classical Bayesian framework for UQ, has been developed to handle
graph-structured data by devising topology-aware kernel functions. However,
such GP-based approaches are limited not only by the prohibitive computational
complexity, but also the strict modeling assumptions that might yield poor
coverage, especially with labels arriving on the fly. To effect scalability, we
devise a novel graph-aware parametric GP model by leveraging the random feature
(RF)-based kernel approximation, which is amenable to efficient recursive
Bayesian model updates. To further allow for adaptivity, an ensemble of
graph-aware RF-based scalable GPs have been leveraged, with per-GP weight
adapted to data arriving incrementally. To ensure valid coverage with
robustness to model mis-specification, we wed the GP-based set predictors with
the online conformal prediction framework, which post-processes the prediction
sets using adaptive thresholds. Experimental results the proposed method yields
improved coverage and efficient prediction sets over existing baselines by
adaptively ensembling the GP models and setting the key threshold parameters in
CP.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Abstract formalizes generation processes beyond fixed architectures (auto-regressive and masked diffusion) and argues that allowing rewriting and length-variable edits yields theoretical and empirical gains, with implications for frontier LLMs across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To compare generation processes independent of model architectures by introducing computable criteria (computational hardness, learnability) and to explore whether capabilities like rewriting and non-fixed-length edits can improve performance on hard, cross-domain tasks.

Method: Formalizes generation as abstract processes beyond specific architectures, defines measurable criteria, and analyzes benefits of extending beyond autoregression and current masked diffusion to include rewrite and length-variable edits; supports claims with theoretical and empirical observations.

Result: Demonstrates that enabling rewrite and length-variable edits can produce significant theoretical and empirical advantages for generation, suggesting improvements for frontier LLMs tackling hard problems across domains.

Conclusion: Expanding generation capabilities beyond autoregression and fixed-mask schemes—specifically, enabling rewrite and length-variable edits—offers notable advantages for universal, cross-domain LLMs and paves the way for handling increasingly hard problems.

Abstract: This paper formally studies generation processes, including auto-regressive
next-token prediction and masked diffusion, that abstract beyond architectural
specifics. At this level of abstraction, we quantify their benefits and
limitations through measurable criteria such as computational hardness and
learnability. In particular, we demonstrate that allowing generation to proceed
beyond autoregression and current masked diffusion, with capabilities to
rewrite and length-variable edit, can bring significant theoretical and
empirical advantages, with important implications for frontier LLMs that aspire
to tackle increasingly hard problems and work universally across domains beyond
natural language, such as coding and science.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RGSD grounds unsupervised skill discovery in a semantically meaningful latent space by reference-guided grounding and contrastive pretraining, enabling imitation and diverse semantically related skills in high-DoF agents; it shows improved downstream control over imitation baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling unsupervised skill discovery to high-DoF agents is hard because exploration space grows exponentially while meaningful skill manifolds remain limited; semantic grounding is needed to guide exploration.

Method: Reference-Grounded Skill Discovery (RGSD) uses contrastive pretraining to embed motions on a unit hypersphere and clusters reference trajectories into distinct directions, grounding skill discovery to imitate reference behaviors while uncovering semantically related diverse behaviors.

Result: On a simulated SMPL humanoid with 359-D observations and 69-D actions, RGSD learns structured skills (walking, running, punching, side stepping) and related novel behaviors; in downstream tasks, RGSD outperforms imitation-based skill baselines.

Conclusion: Lightweight reference-guided grounding provides a practical pathway to discover semantically rich and structured skills in high-DoF systems.

Abstract: Scaling unsupervised skill discovery algorithms to high-DoF agents remains
challenging. As dimensionality increases, the exploration space grows
exponentially, while the manifold of meaningful skills remains limited.
Therefore, semantic meaningfulness becomes essential to effectively guide
exploration in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we present
Reference-Grounded Skill Discovery (RGSD), a novel algorithm that grounds skill
discovery in a semantically meaningful latent space using reference data. RGSD
first performs contrastive pretraining to embed motions on a unit hypersphere,
clustering each reference trajectory into a distinct direction. This grounding
enables skill discovery to simultaneously involve both imitation of reference
behaviors and the discovery of semantically related diverse behaviors. On a
simulated SMPL humanoid with 359-D observations and 69-D actions, RGSD learns
structured skills including walking, running, punching, and side stepping, and
also discovers related novel behaviors. In downstream control tasks, RGSD
outperforms imitation-based skill acquisition baselines. Our results suggest
that lightweight reference-guided grounding offers a practical path to
discovering semantically rich and structured skills in high-DoF systems.

### [274] [Training Dynamics Impact Post-Training Quantization Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06213)
*Albert Catalan-Tatjer,Niccolò Ajroldi,Jonas Geiping*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quantization robustness in post-training quantization for large LLMs depends on training dynamics; learning-rate decay triggers divergence between validation loss and quantization error; dataset scale alone does not determine quantization quality; targeted hyperparameter interventions can improve quantization at scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover the mechanisms behind quantization robustness during large-scale LLM training and understand how training dynamics influence post-training quantization performance.

Method: Empirical analysis of open-source LLM training trajectories up to 32B parameters and 15T tokens; evaluation of quantization error patterns; controlled experiments training models up to 100B tokens to test interventions; examination of the role of learning rate and other hyperparameters.

Result: Quantization errors arise from a complex interplay between learning rate and other hyperparameters; once LR decays, validation loss and quantization error diverge largely independent of data scale; strategic hyperparameter interventions can improve quantization quality at scale, challenging the notion that data scale inherently harms quantization.

Conclusion: Quantization robustness in large-scale training is governable via training dynamics; adjusting hyperparameters can enhance post-training quantization performance without relying on dataset size as a negative factor.

Abstract: While post-training quantization is widely adopted for efficient deployment
of large language models, the mechanisms underlying quantization robustness
remain unclear. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of quantization degradation
across open-source language model training trajectories up to 32B parameters
and 15T training tokens to accurately assess the relationship between training
dynamics and quantization performance. Our key finding is that quantization
errors in large-scale training runs are driven by a complex interplay between
learning rate and other training hyperparameters. Specifically, once learning
rates decay, validation loss and quantization error diverge, largely
independent of training data scale. To investigate interventions on the
training dynamics and identify specific configurations that can modulate
quantization robustness favorably, we train our own models in controlled
experiments up to 100B tokens. Our results challenge the assumption that
increasing dataset scale inherently compromises quantization effectiveness,
demonstrating instead that strategic training hyperparameter interventions can
improve quantization quality at scale.

### [275] [Stratified GRPO: Handling Structural Heterogeneity in Reinforcement Learning of LLM Search Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06214)
*Mingkang Zhu,Xi Chen,Bei Yu,Hengshuang Zhao,Jiaya Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stratified GRPO addresses cross-stratum bias in RL for LLM-based search agents by partitioning trajectories into homogeneous strata and computing advantages locally within each stratum, then blending with a global estimator for stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard policy gradient methods use a single global baseline for heterogeneous trajectories in multi-step LLM search tasks, causing cross-stratum bias that distorts credit assignment and hampers exploration of complex search strategies.

Method: Introduce Stratified GRPO with Stratified Advantage Normalization (SAN) that (1) partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on structural properties, (2) computes advantages locally within each stratum, (3) linearly blends SAN with the global estimator for stability, and (4) provides theoretical guarantees that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias and yields unbiased unit-variance estimates within strata while preserving global unbiasedness.

Result: Empirical evaluations on single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks show Stratified GRPO outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3 points in training rewards, with improved training stability and more effective search policies.

Conclusion: Stratification offers a principled solution to structural heterogeneity in reinforcement learning for LLM search agents, enabling more reliable credit assignment and exploration.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex, multi-step problems, and reinforcement
learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training them. However, the
trajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations
in the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally
different answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient
methods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and
formalize as cross-stratum bias-an "apples-to-oranges" comparison of
heterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment
and hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address
this, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage
Normalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on
their structural properties and computes advantages locally within each
stratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true
peers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields
conditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains
the global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard
normalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To
improve practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly
blend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse
single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that
Stratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3
points, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more
