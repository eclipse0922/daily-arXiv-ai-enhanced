As a result,\nthe produced drawings often lack geometric uniformity. Moreover, orthogonal\ncrossings are known to have a limited impact on readability, suggesting that\ncrossing minimization may not always be the optimal goal. In this paper, we\nintroduce a methodology that 'subverts' the traditional TSM pipeline by\nfocusing on minimizing bends. Given a graph $G$, we ideally seek to construct a\nrectilinear drawing of $G$, that is, an orthogonal drawing with no bends. When\nnot possible, we incrementally subdivide the edges of $G$ by introducing dummy\nvertices that will (possibly) correspond to bends in the final drawing. This\nprocess continues until a rectilinear drawing of a subdivision of the graph is\nfound, after which the final coordinates are computed. We tackle the\n(NP-complete) rectilinear drawability problem by encoding it as a SAT formula\nand solving it with state-of-the-art SAT solvers.

However, the generated images often\ncontain structural or semantic defects due to training imperfections.

However, most DNN-based methods suffer from catastrophic\nforgetting and fail to maintain their performance in previously learned\nscenarios after adapting to new data. Recent continual learning (CL) studies\naim to mitigate this phenomenon by enhancing memory stability of DNN, i.e., the\nability to retain learned knowledge. Yet, excessive emphasis on the memory\nstability often impairs learning plasticity, i.e., the capacity of DNN to\nacquire new information effectively. To address such stability-plasticity\ndilemma, this study proposes a novel CL method, synergetic memory rehearsal\n(SyReM), for DNN-based motion forecasting. SyReM maintains a compact memory\nbuffer to represent learned knowledge. To ensure memory stability, it employs\nan inequality constraint that limits increments in the average loss over the\nmemory buffer. Synergistically, a selective memory rehearsal mechanism is\ndesigned to enhance learning plasticity by selecting samples from the memory\nbuffer that are most similar to recently observed data. This selection is based\non an online-measured cosine similarity of loss gradients, ensuring targeted\nmemory rehearsal.
