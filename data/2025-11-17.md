### [1] [A Mathematical Framework for AI Singularity: Conditions, Bounds, and Control of Recursive Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10668)
*Akbar Anbar Jafari,Cagri Ozcinar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a measurable, simulation-free framework to assess whether AI capability could experience runaway growth in finite time, and to certify or rule it out using observable metrics and deployable safety controls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transform concern about AI 'singularity' from speculation into falsifiable analysis by leveraging engineering metrics and an endogenous growth model.

Method: Develop an analytic, resource-coupled growth model linking capital, compute, data, and energy; define a service envelope from power, bandwidth, and memory; derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, spending) into certificates for runaway vs. nonsingular behavior; provide analytical case studies (capped-power, saturating-data, investment-amplified) and safety controls; simulation-free and grounded in measurements; discuss limitations and future work.

Result: Defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes; provides falsifiable tests based on the speed of improvement relative to current level; offers directly implementable safety controls (power caps, throughput throttling, evaluation gates); demonstrations via analytical case studies show when the envelope binds or not; results are grounded in measurable metrics and tested without simulations.

Conclusion: Delivers a practical framework to certify or preclude AI singularity with testable conditions and deployable safeguards, while acknowledging metric dependence and regularity diagnostics and outlining directions for future work (stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, abrupt architectural shifts).

Abstract: AI systems improve by drawing on more compute, data, energy, and better training methods. This paper asks a precise, testable version of the "runaway growth" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts. Overall, the results replace speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable data attribution method for text-to-image models that converts a slow, unlearning-based attribution process into a fast, searchable embedding space, enabling rapid identification of highly influential training images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing data attribution methods are computationally intensive per query, hindering practical use on large models; there is a need for scalable, real-time attribution for assets like Stable Diffusion and LAION-trained models.

Conclusion: Represents a significant step toward practical large-scale data attribution for real-world diffusion models, enabling rapid identification of influential training data at scale.

Abstract: Data attribution for text-to-image models aims to identify the training images that most significantly influenced a generated output. Existing attribution methods involve considerable computational resources for each query, making them impractical for real-world applications. We propose a novel approach for scalable and efficient data attribution. Our key idea is to distill a slow, unlearning-based attribution method to a feature embedding space for efficient retrieval of highly influential training images. During deployment, combined with efficient indexing and search methods, our method successfully finds highly influential images without running expensive attribution algorithms. We show extensive results on both medium-scale models trained on MSCOCO and large-scale Stable Diffusion models trained on LAION, demonstrating that our method can achieve better or competitive performance in a few seconds, faster than existing methods by 2,500x - 400,000x.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A consensus-driven, validated video-based analysis tool (ColoWorkflow) for MIS colorectal surgery workflows, with multi-centre applicability and moderate inter-rater reliability, enabling benchmarking and AI-driven workflow recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery shows procedural variability, a steep learning curve, and complications. There is a need for standardized, reproducible workflow analysis tools to reduce variability and improve training and outcomes.

Method: A Delphi process defined generalizable workflow descriptors; development of ColoWorkflow; multicentre video dataset; independent raters applied the tool; effectiveness evaluated via applicability and inter-rater reliability (Cohen's K).

Result: Consensus on 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps; applied to 54 videos from five centres; broad applicability (all but one label used); inter-rater reliability: Cohen's K 0.71 for phases, 0.66 for steps; discrepancies mainly at phase transitions and step boundaries.

Conclusion: ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive MIS colorectal workflow analysis, enabling benchmarking across institutions and supporting AI-driven recognition; has potential to standardize training, accelerate competency, and inform surgical quality improvement.

Abstract: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery is characterized by procedural variability, a difficult learning curve, and complications that impact quality and outcomes. Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions. ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive CRS. It establishes a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking across institutions and supporting the development of artificial intelligence-driven workflow recognition. Its adoption may standardize training, accelerate competency acquisition, and advance data-informed surgical quality improvement.

### [5] [Frequency-Aware Vision-Language Multimodality Generalization Network for Remote Sensing Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10774)
*Junjie Zhang,Feng Zhao,Hanqiang Liu,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FVMGN, a frequency-aware multimodal generalization network for RS image classification, integrating diffusion-based augmentation, frequency-domain disentanglement, and cross-modal alignment to improve cross-scene generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data heterogeneity in RS multimodal data and the lack of domain-specific linguistic priors in standard vision-language models, aiming for robust cross-scene generalization.

Method: 1) Diffusion-based training-test-time augmentation (DTAug) to reconstruct multimodal land-cover distributions. 2) Multimodal Wavelet Disentanglement (MWDis) to learn cross-domain invariant features by resampling low/high frequency components. 3) Shared and proprietary class texts fed to a transformer-based text encoder to extract diverse text features. 4) Spatial-frequency-aware image encoder (SFIE) for local-global feature reconstruction. 5) Multiscale spatial-frequency feature alignment (MSFFA) to align text and vision features across spatial and frequency domains.

Result: Experiments show that FVMGN achieves superior multimodality generalization compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on RS tasks.

Conclusion: FVMGN effectively handles RS multimodality generalization by combining diffusion augmentation, frequency-aware feature disentanglement, and cross-modal alignment, yielding improved cross-scene performance.

Abstract: The booming remote sensing (RS) technology is giving rise to a novel multimodality generalization task, which requires the model to overcome data heterogeneity while possessing powerful cross-scene generalization ability. Moreover, most vision-language models (VLMs) usually describe surface materials in RS images using universal texts, lacking proprietary linguistic prior knowledge specific to different RS vision modalities. In this work, we formalize RS multimodality generalization (RSMG) as a learning paradigm, and propose a frequency-aware vision-language multimodality generalization network (FVMGN) for RS image classification. Specifically, a diffusion-based training-test-time augmentation (DTAug) strategy is designed to reconstruct multimodal land-cover distributions, enriching input information for FVMGN. Following that, to overcome multimodal heterogeneity, a multimodal wavelet disentanglement (MWDis) module is developed to learn cross-domain invariant features by resampling low and high frequency components in the frequency domain. Considering the characteristics of RS vision modalities, shared and proprietary class texts is designed as linguistic inputs for the transformer-based text encoder to extract diverse text features. For multimodal vision inputs, a spatial-frequency-aware image encoder (SFIE) is constructed to realize local-global feature reconstruction and representation. Finally, a multiscale spatial-frequency feature alignment (MSFFA) module is suggested to construct a unified semantic space, ensuring refined multiscale alignment of different text and vision features in spatial and frequency domains. Extensive experiments show that FVMGN has the excellent multimodality generalization ability compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

### [6] [GFT: Graph Feature Tuning for Efficient Point Cloud Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10799)
*Manish Dhakal,Venkat R. Dasari,Raj Sunderraman,Yi Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Graph Features Tuning (GFT), a point-cloud-specific PEFT that builds a dynamic graph from tokenized inputs with a lightweight GCN and propagates graph features via skip connections and efficient cross-attention, achieving similar performance with fewer trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PEFT reduces costs in large models, but generic methods may underperform for 3D point-cloud data; a domain-specific PEFT can further cut trainable parameters while preserving accuracy for tasks like classification and segmentation.

Method: Proposes Graph Features Tuning (GFT): construct a dynamic graph from initial transformer token embeddings, use a lightweight graph convolutional network to learn graph features, and feed these features to deeper layers using skip connections and efficient cross-attention modules to maintain performance with fewer trainable parameters.

Result: Experiments on object classification and segmentation show that GFT matches or rivals existing PEFT methods while reducing trainable parameters; code is available at GitHub.

Conclusion: Point-cloud-specific PEFT via dynamic graph features is effective for efficient fine-tuning, enabling strong performance with significantly fewer trainable parameters.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) significantly reduces computational and memory costs by updating only a small subset of the model's parameters, enabling faster adaptation to new tasks with minimal loss in performance. Previous studies have introduced PEFTs tailored for point cloud data, as general approaches are suboptimal. To further reduce the number of trainable parameters, we propose a point-cloud-specific PEFT, termed Graph Features Tuning (GFT), which learns a dynamic graph from initial tokenized inputs of the transformer using a lightweight graph convolution network and passes these graph features to deeper layers via skip connections and efficient cross-attention modules. Extensive experiments on object classification and segmentation tasks show that GFT operates in the same domain, rivalling existing methods, while reducing the trainable parameters. Code is at https://github.com/manishdhakal/GFT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable effective CNN model compression in resource-constrained environments by using limited data and avoiding fine-tuning, while maintaining performance.

Method: Develop an LRP-guided pruning approach that operates on small data samples and does not require fine-tuning, yielding higher pruning rates with less accuracy loss than prior methods.

Result: The proposed method preserves accuracy better than existing LRP-based pruning methods at higher pruning rates when data is scarce; demonstrates practicality for limited-data scenarios.

Conclusion: LRP-based pruning with minimal data is a viable strategy for efficient model compression, offering better trade-offs between pruning rate and accuracy without fine-tuning; potential for broader applicability and further optimization.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in image recognition and have succeeded in various domains. CNN models have become larger-scale to improve accuracy and generalization performance. Research has been conducted on compressing pre-trained models for specific target applications in environments with limited computing resources. Among model compression techniques, methods using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), an explainable AI technique, have shown promise by achieving high pruning rates while preserving accuracy, even without fine-tuning. Because these methods do not require fine-tuning, they are suited to scenarios with limited data. However, existing LRP-based pruning approaches still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, limiting their practical usability. This study proposes a pruning method that achieves a higher pruning rate while preserving better model accuracy. Our approach to pruning with a small amount of data has achieved pruning that preserves accuracy better than existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address three core challenges in multimodal emotion recognition: (1) unbalanced category distribution, (2) complex temporal modeling of dynamic facial action units, and (3) fusion across heterogeneous modalities. The rise of multimodal data in social media necessitates an efficient cross-modal fusion framework.

Method: MCN-CL uses a triple query mechanism and hard negative mining to reduce feature redundancy while preserving emotional cues. It employs cross-attention for cross-modal fusion and contrastive learning to align modalities and mitigate heterogeneity. The approach targets robust, balanced representation learning for emotion recognition.

Result: On IEMOCAP and MELD, MCN-CL outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving Weighted F1 increases of 3.42% and 5.73%, respectively.

Conclusion: MCN-CL effectively handles modal heterogeneity and category imbalance, delivering improved multimodal emotion recognition performance with potential applicability to large-scale social media data. Further work could explore scalability and robustness across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition plays a key role in many domains, including mental health monitoring, educational interaction, and human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often face three major challenges: unbalanced category distribution, the complexity of dynamic facial action unit time modeling, and the difficulty of feature fusion due to modal heterogeneity. With the explosive growth of multimodal data in social media scenarios, the need for building an efficient cross-modal fusion framework for emotion recognition is becoming increasingly urgent. To this end, this paper proposes Multimodal Cross-Attention Network and Contrastive Learning (MCN-CL) for multimodal emotion recognition. It uses a triple query mechanism and hard negative mining strategy to remove feature redundancy while preserving important emotional cues, effectively addressing the issues of modal heterogeneity and category imbalance. Experiment results on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, with Weighted F1 scores improving by 3.42% and 5.73%, respectively.

Abstract: Object detection using images or videos captured by drones is a promising technology with significant potential across various industries. However, a major challenge is that drone images are typically taken from high altitudes, making object identification difficult. This paper proposes an effective solution to address this issue. The base model used in the experiments is YOLOv11, the latest object detection model, with a specific implementation based on YOLOv11n. The experimental data were sourced from the widely used and reliable VisDrone dataset, a standard benchmark in drone-based object detection. This paper introduces an enhancement to the Head network of the YOLOv11 algorithm, called the GhostHead Network. The model incorporating this improvement is named YOLO-Drone. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLO-Drone achieves significant improvements in key detection accuracy metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and mAP (0.5), compared to the original YOLOv11. Specifically, the proposed model recorded a 0.4% increase in Precision, a 0.6% increase in Recall, a 0.5% increase in F1-Score, and a 0.5% increase in mAP (0.5). Additionally, the Inference Speed metric, which measures image processing speed, also showed a notable improvement. These results indicate that YOLO-Drone is a high-performance model with enhanced accuracy and speed compared to YOLOv11. To further validate its reliability, comparative experiments were conducted against other high-performance object detection models, including YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLOv10.

*Zihan Gu,Ruoyu Chen,Junchi Zhang,Yue Hu,Hua Zhang,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhaseWin introduces a phase-window search for faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity, achieving ~95% of greedy faithfulness with 20% of the budget and outperforming baselines on object detection and visual grounding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current submodular greedy attribution methods are faithful but computationally expensive, limiting real-world deployment for object-level foundation models. A scalable, high-faithfulness attribution method is needed.

Method: PhaseWin replaces quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search that uses adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision to closely emulate greedy behavior while reducing evaluations. The method retains near-greedy guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions.

Result: Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget and consistently surpasses other attribution baselines on object detection and visual grounding tasks, across Grounding DINO and Florence-2.

Conclusion: PhaseWin establishes a new state of the art in scalable, high-faithfulness attribution for object-level multimodal models.

Abstract: Attribution is essential for interpreting object-level foundation models. Recent methods based on submodular subset selection have achieved high faithfulness, but their efficiency limitations hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PhaseWin, a novel phase-window search algorithm that enables faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity. PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to closely approximate greedy behavior while dramatically reducing model evaluations. Theoretically, PhaseWin retains near-greedy approximation guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions. Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2. PhaseWin establishes a new state of the art in scalable, high-faithfulness attribution for object-level multimodal models.

*Zhixia He,Chen Zhao,Minglai Shao,Xintao Wu,Xujiang Zhao,Dong Li,Qin Tian,Linlin Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A positive/negative prompt supervision framework for OOD detection using vision–language models, with prompts initialized by LLMs, optimized to emphasize intra-class and boundary features, and a graph-based module that transfers semantic cues to the visual branch, improving energy-based OOD performance across CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K with multiple LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing negative prompts for OOD detection can be too broad, capturing non-ID features that overlap with ID regions and hurt performance. There is a need to better capture inter-class boundaries and transfer semantic information to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection.

Method: Initialize class-specific positive and negative prompts with large language models. Optimize positive prompts to focus on intra-class features and negative prompts on features near class boundaries. Use a graph-based architecture to aggregate semantic supervision from optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, improving the energy-based OOD detector.

Result: Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, evaluating eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Positive–negative prompt supervision with graph-based semantic transfer to the visual encoder yields improved OOD detection performance and is robust across multiple datasets and LLMs.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is committed to delineating the classification boundaries between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

*Umma Aymon,Nur Shazwani Kamarudin,Ahmad Fakhri Ab. Nasir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lightweight nano-YOLO models (YOLOv11n/YOLOv12n) are evaluated for facial expression recognition in a unified detection-classification setup on FER2013 and KDEF. YOLOv12n excels on clean data (KDEF) with mAP0.5=95.6; YOLOv11n shows higher precision on FER2013 (65.2), while YOLOv12n achieves higher overall mAP on FER2013 (63.8). Trade-off between sensitivity and precision; suitable for real-time, resource-constrained FER.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FER under unconstrained real-world conditions demands efficient, accurate models that can operate in real-time on limited hardware. Lightweight nano-YOLO variants offer potential speed/size advantages while maintaining performance.

Method: Convert FER datasets to object detection format and evaluate two nano-YOLO models (v11n and v12n) using mAP0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices under a unified detection+classification framework.

Result: YOLOv12n achieves best mAP0.5 95.6 on KDEF; YOLOv12n achieves mAP0.5 63.8 on FER2013; YOLOv11n attains precision 65.2 on FER2013; both models show more confusion among similar expressions on FER2013; KDEF shows clearer separation; overall, a trade-off between sensitivity and precision; models balance performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: Lightweight YOLO models can effectively balance detection/classification performance with efficiency, showing adaptability across controlled and real-world conditions, making them strong candidates for real-time, resource-constrained emotion-aware AI.

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition remains a challenging task, especially in unconstrained, real-world environments. This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset. These findings underscore the trade-off between sensitivity and precision, illustrating how lightweight YOLO models can effectively balance performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate adaptability across both controlled and real-world conditions, establishing these models as strong candidates for real-time, resource-constrained emotion-aware AI applications.

### [15] [Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10942)
*Liuchi Xu,Hao Zheng,Lu Wang,Lisheng Xu,Jun Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HCD introduces a heterogeneous knowledge distillation framework for cross-architecture KD (ViT → ResNet18) with complementary feature use and logit decomposition, plus an orthogonality constraint via SDD, achieving state-of-the-art results on CIFAR-100, CUB200, and ImageNet-1K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous KD faces misaligned spatial representations across architectures and is often hampered by logit-only strategies or heavy computation; there is a need to leverage complementary intermediate features efficiently.

Method: HCD uses a convolutional projector and adaptive pooling on the student side, concatenates with the teacher's penultimate-layer feature, and passes through a Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) to produce shared logits. SDD partitions these shared logits into n sub-logits fused with teacher logits to rectify classification, plus Orthogonality Loss to encourage sub-logit diversity.

Result: Empirical evaluation on CIFAR-100, CUB200 (fine-grained) and ImageNet-1K shows HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods, with improved robustness and generalization of the student.

Conclusion: HCD provides a simple yet effective heterogeneous KD framework that exploits complementary teacher–student features and sub-logit decoupling to enhance transfer efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD)transfers the dark knowledge from a complex teacher to a compact student. However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.

*Xingyue Zhao,Wenke Huang,Xingguang Wang,Haoyu Zhao,Linghao Zhuang,Anwen Jiang,Guancheng Wan,Mang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedBCS uses frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration and dual-level domain-invariant prototype alignment to address feature heterogeneity in federated medical image segmentation, achieving robust cross-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Feature heterogeneity from different scanners/protocols in federated learning degrades segmentation performance. Prior works focusing on final-layer features neglect multi-level cues and ignore intermediate-layer style biases, leading to brittle models.

Method: Introduce FedBCS with (1) frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration for robust prototype construction that decouples content and style and learns adaptive style parameters; (2) context-aware dual-level prototype alignment that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from multiple encoder/decoder layers and fuses them with contextual information for fine-grained alignment across domains.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public datasets show remarkable performance improvements, indicating stronger robustness to domain shifts and better segmentation accuracy under feature heterogeneity.

Conclusion: FedBCS bridges feature representation gaps by aligning domain-invariant prototypes across multiple layers, enhancing robustness of federated medical image segmentation under heterogeneous data sources.

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple medical institutions to train a global model without sharing data, yet feature heterogeneity from diverse scanners or protocols remains a major challenge. Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration into prototype construction that not only decouples content-style representations but also learns optimal style parameters, enabling more robust domain-invariant prototypes. Furthermore, we design a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different layers of both encoder and decoder and fuses them with contextual information for finer-grained representation alignment. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits remarkable performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SandboxVLM introduces a 3D sandbox abstraction to bridge the 2D training gap for vision-language models, improving zero-shot 3D reasoning and spatial intelligence without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language models trained predominantly on 2D data struggle with 3D tasks (spatial cognition, physical understanding). This modality gap hinders 3D perception and embodied reasoning necessary for robotics and embodied agents.

Method: A four-stage 3D Sandbox pipeline: (1) generating multi-view priors with abstract control, (2) proxy elevation, (3) multi-view voting and clustering, (4) 3D-aware reasoning, using abstract bounding boxes to encode geometric structure and kinematics.

Result: In zero-shot evaluations across multiple benchmarks and VLM backbones, SandboxVLM yields consistent gains in spatial intelligence, including an 8.3% improvement on SAT Real over baselines for instance.

Conclusion: Introducing 3D abstractions into VLMs substantially enhances 3D reasoning and general-purpose embodied intelligence without additional training.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) struggle with 3D-related tasks such as spatial cognition and physical understanding, which are crucial for real-world applications like robotics and embodied agents. We attribute this to a modality gap between the 3D tasks and the 2D training of VLM, which led to inefficient retrieval of 3D information from 2D input. To bridge this gap, we introduce SandboxVLM, a simple yet effective framework that leverages abstract bounding boxes to encode geometric structure and physical kinematics for VLM. Specifically, we design a 3D Sandbox reconstruction and perception pipeline comprising four stages: generating multi-view priors with abstract control, proxy elevation, multi-view voting and clustering, and 3D-aware reasoning. Evaluated in zero-shot settings across multiple benchmarks and VLM backbones, our approach consistently improves spatial intelligence, achieving an 8.3\% gain on SAT Real compared with baseline methods for instance. These results demonstrate that equipping VLMs with a 3D abstraction substantially enhances their 3D reasoning ability without additional training, suggesting new possibilities for general-purpose embodied intelligence.

### [18] [DEFT-LLM: Disentangled Expert Feature Tuning for Micro-Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10948)
*Ren Zhang,Huilai Li,Chao qi,Guoliang Xu,Tianyu Zhou,Wei wei,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEFT-LLM leverages a motion-aligned Uni-MER dataset and a three-expert disentangled architecture to align text with facial motion, achieving state-of-the-art and interpretable micro-expression recognition (MER) with multimodal LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MER suffers from (1) entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion that hides subtle facial cues, and (2) a semantic gap where textual labels do not map cleanly to underlying facial muscle movements. The work proposes motion semantics alignment via multi-expert disentanglement and a motion-driven instruction dataset to address these gaps.

Method: Construct Uni-MER by leveraging optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to enforce spatio-temporal consistency and meaningful motion correspondence. Develop a three-expert architecture that decouples facial dynamics into structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics. Inject instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM to embed physical priors and exploit the cross-modal reasoning capabilities of large language models.

Result: On multiple challenging MER benchmarks, the approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and offers clear advantages in interpretable modeling of local facial motion.

Conclusion: Motion semantic alignment through multi-expert disentanglement and Uni-MER-guided instruction enhances MER performance and interpretability by fusing physical priors with multimodal LLM reasoning, enabling precise detection of subtle micro-expressions.

Abstract: Micro expression recognition (MER) is crucial for inferring genuine emotion. Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues. Experiments on multiple challenging MER benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, as well as a particular advantage in interpretable modeling of local facial motion.

*Wenrui Li,Wei Han,Hengyu Man,Wangmeng Zuo,Xiaopeng Fan,Yonghong Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A language-guided graph-based framework (LGRLN) for video summarization that builds forward/backward/undirected video graphs, uses dual-threshold GCN for intra-graph reasoning, and language-guided cross-modal embedding with a Bernoulli-EM summary model, achieving state-of-the-art results with large efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Capture global dependencies in videos and enable multimodal, user-guided customization, addressing the mismatch between temporal proximity and semantic proximity in video frames while aiming for faster, lighter models.

Method: 1) Video graph generator converts frames into a structured graph to preserve temporal order using forward, backward, and undirected graphs. 2) Intra-graph relational reasoning with a dual-threshold graph convolution mechanism to separate semantically relevant frames from irrelevant ones. 3) Language-guided cross-modal embedding module to generate summaries described by text. 4) Treat summary generation output as a mixture of Bernoulli distributions and solve with EM. 

Result: Outperforms existing methods on multiple benchmarks. Achieves substantial efficiency gains, reducing inference time by 87.8% and model parameters by 91.7%.

Conclusion: LGRLN effectively models global dependencies and supports multimodal, text-guided summaries while being significantly more efficient, with code and pretrained models available at the authors’ repository.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video content on social media, video summarization has become a crucial task in multimedia processing. However, existing methods face challenges in capturing global dependencies in video content and accommodating multimodal user customization. Moreover, temporal proximity between video frames does not always correspond to semantic proximity. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Language-guided Graph Representation Learning Network (LGRLN) for video summarization. Specifically, we introduce a video graph generator that converts video frames into a structured graph to preserve temporal order and contextual dependencies. By constructing forward, backward and undirected graphs, the video graph generator effectively preserves the sequentiality and contextual relationships of video content. We designed an intra-graph relational reasoning module with a dual-threshold graph convolution mechanism, which distinguishes semantically relevant frames from irrelevant ones between nodes. Additionally, our proposed language-guided cross-modal embedding module generates video summaries with specific textual descriptions. We model the summary generation output as a mixture of Bernoulli distribution and solve it with the EM algorithm. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple benchmarks. Moreover, we proposed LGRLN reduces inference time and model parameters by 87.8% and 91.7%, respectively. Our codes and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/liwrui/LGRLN.

*Gunho Jung,Heejo Kong,Seong-Whan Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A text-guided weakly supervised MIL framework (TG-DFER) enhances dynamic facial expression recognition by combining a vision-language pre-trained model, visual prompts, and a multi-grained temporal network to address many-to-one labeling and expression diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic facial expression recognition faces many-to-one labeling and complex temporal dynamics; MIL-based approaches struggle with visual diversity and temporal reasoning under weak supervision, necessitating semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling.

Method: Incorporate a vision-language pre-trained (VLP) model to provide semantic guidance via fine-grained textual descriptions of emotional context. Introduce visual prompts to align enriched textual emotion labels with visual instance features for fine-grained reasoning and frame-level relevance estimation. Develop a multi-grained temporal network to jointly capture short-term facial dynamics and long-range emotional flow for coherent affective understanding over time.

Result: Extensive results show TG-DFER achieves improved generalization, interpretability, and temporal sensitivity under weak supervision.

Conclusion: Text-guided, weakly supervised MIL with visual prompts and multi-grained temporal modeling is effective for dynamic facial expression recognition and enhances generalization and interpretability under weak supervision.

Abstract: Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) aims to identify emotional states by modeling the temporal changes in facial movements across video sequences. A key challenge in DFER is the many-to-one labeling problem, where a video composed of numerous frames is assigned a single emotion label. A common strategy to mitigate this issue is to formulate DFER as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) problem. However, MIL-based approaches inherently suffer from the visual diversity of emotional expressions and the complexity of temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose TG-DFER, a text-guided weakly supervised framework that enhances MIL-based DFER by incorporating semantic guidance and coherent temporal modeling. We incorporate a vision-language pre-trained (VLP) model is integrated to provide semantic guidance through fine-grained textual descriptions of emotional context. Furthermore, we introduce visual prompts, which align enriched textual emotion labels with visual instance features, enabling fine-grained reasoning and frame-level relevance estimation. In addition, a multi-grained temporal network is designed to jointly capture short-term facial dynamics and long-range emotional flow, ensuring coherent affective understanding across time. Extensive results demonstrate that TG-DFER achieves improved generalization, interpretability, and temporal sensitivity under weak supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERMoE reframes MoE routing by encoding each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and using an Eigenbasis Score for content-aware routing, removing explicit load-balancing losses and yielding stable, interpretable sparsity with strong performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address misalignment between router logits and expert internals, and load imbalances causing instability and underutilization; conventional balancing losses reduce specialization.

Method: Reparameterize experts via learned eigenbasis; replace gating logits with Eigenbasis Score (cosine similarity between input features and expert basis); skip balancing losses; enable sparse routing.

Result: State-of-the-art on ImageNet classification and cross-modal retrieval (COCO, Flickr30K); MRI variant ERMoE-ba improves brain age prediction by >7% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations; naturally flatter load distributions.

Conclusion: ERMoE offers a new architectural principle for sparse experts, stabilizing routing and enabling scalable, interpretable specialization without balancing losses, with broad performance gains.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures expand model capacity by sparsely activating experts but face two core challenges: misalignment between router logits and each expert's internal structure leads to unstable routing and expert underutilization, and load imbalances create straggler bottlenecks. Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an "Eigenbasis Score", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations. ERMoE thus introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization.

### [22] [Preserving Cross-Modal Consistency for CLIP-based Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10974)
*Haoran Chen,Houze Xu,Micah Goldblum,Daoguo Dong,Zuxuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-stage, decoupled CLIP-based continual learning (DMC) with an OT-calibrated extension (DMC-OT) to counter cross-modal bias and encoder drift, achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP-based CIL struggles with task-specific soft prompts that overfit to recent classes when past data is unavailable, and with distribution drift as the vision encoder evolves. There is a need for stable cross-modal alignment and memory-statistic consistency in continual settings.

Method: DMC employs a two-stage training regime where one modality (vision encoder or textual prompts) is frozen while the other is adapted, providing a stable semantic anchor for cross-modal alignment. DMC-OT adds an optimal-transport guided calibration to align memory statistics across evolving encoders and introduces task-specific prompting to enhance inter-task separability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101; DMC-OT offers additional gains, averaging a 1.80% improvement in accuracy over DMC.

Conclusion: Decoupling adaptation across modalities combined with calibration of memory statistics yields more robust CLIP-based continual learning, with DMC-OT providing further gains through alignment and improved inter-task separability.

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to continuously learn new categories from sequential tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.

*Bowen Sun,Yujun Cai,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Hang Wu,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS) stabilizes Video LLM attention by multi-head phase averaging to smooth the RoPE time kernel, yielding robust temporal encoding with negligible overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video LLMs exhibit temporal inconsistency: small shifts in frame timing can flip attention and suppress relevant frames due to how Rotary Position Embeddings are extended to video via multimodal RoPE, which induces frame-scale ripples in the time kernel.

Method: A training-free mechanism that applies small opposite phase offsets across attention heads and then aggregates their outputs. This preserves per-head spectrum magnitudes while smoothing the temporal kernel to reduce phase sensitivity. The approach links RoPE-rotated logits to a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; multi-phase averaging attenuates high-frequency ripples under Nyquist-valid sampling.

Result: Empirical improvements on multiple video understanding benchmarks with matched token budgets, achieved with negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: PAS acts as a plug-and-play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs without altering the underlying positional encoding structure.

Abstract: Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency: small shifts in frame timing can flip attention and suppress relevant frames. We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. PAS provides a plug and play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs.

*Jeffrey Liu,Rongbin Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free, two-step verification workflow for zero-shot vision with off-the-shelf VLMs: first quantize open-ended queries into small MCQs, then binarize via True/False checks for each candidate and deterministically resolve; yields consistent gains across tasks (REC, Spatial-Map/Grid/Maze, BLINK-Jigsaw) vs direct open-ended answering, supported by a theory of quantization and boolean resolution; offers a practical drop-in path to stronger zero-shot vision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To close the gap in zero-shot vision performance without additional training by turning open-ended inquiries into a sequence of verifiable subproblems that VLMs can handle reliably, aiming for a general, task-agnostic inference-time design.

Method: 1) Quantization: convert an open-ended query into a small, explicit MCQ with unambiguous candidates. 2) Binarization: for each candidate, pose a True/False question and resolve deterministically: if exactly one is True, select it; otherwise, perform another MCQ over the remaining plausible candidates.

Result: Quantization to MCQ yields large gains over directly answering open-ended queries; True/False binarization provides additional consistent improvement; the same workflow improves performance across multiple tasks, suggesting generality. A formal theory explains how open-ended queries can be quantized to MCQs and binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder and explaining why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy.

Conclusion: Inference-time design changes—quantization to MCQs and subsequent boolean verification—offer a simple, unified, drop-in approach to strengthening zero-shot vision with current VLMs without task-specific training.

Abstract: We propose a training-free, binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision with off-the-shelf VLMs. It comprises two steps: (i) quantization, which turns the open-ended query into a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with a small, explicit list of unambiguous candidates; and (ii) binarization, which asks one True/False question per candidate and resolves deterministically: if exactly one is True, select it; otherwise, revert to an MCQ over the remaining plausible candidates. We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training. It offers a practical, drop-in path to stronger zero-shot vision with today's VLMs.

*Daxin Li,Yuanchao Bai,Kai Wang,Wenbo Zhao,Junjun Jiang,Xianming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight, hierarchical autoregressive model (HPAC) with caching and content-aware gating achieves state-of-the-art learned lossless image compression while remaining practical, using progressive adaptation (SARP-FT) per-image via low-rank adapters; strong results across natural, satellite, and medical images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive models set the theoretical benchmark for lossless image compression but are deemed impractical due to computational cost; this work rethinks practicality by combining hierarchical parallelism with progressive adaptation.

Method: HPAC: a hierarchical factorized ConvNet with content-aware gating; Cache-then-Select Inference (CSI) to remove redundant computations; Adaptive Focus Coding (AFC) to handle high bit-depth images; Spatially-Aware Rate-Guided Progressive Fine-tuning (SARP-FT) for instance-level adaptation using low-rank adapters on progressively larger, spatial regions chosen by estimated information density.

Result: Experiments on natural, satellite, and medical datasets show new state-of-the-art performance for learned lossless compression, with small parameter counts and competitive coding speeds.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that a carefully designed autoregressive framework can achieve top performance while remaining practical, reinstating autoregressive models as a viable, efficient solution for lossless image compression.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models, the theoretical performance benchmark for learned lossless image compression, are often dismissed as impractical due to prohibitive computational cost. This work re-thinks this paradigm, introducing a framework built on hierarchical parallelism and progressive adaptation that re-establishes pure autoregression as a top-performing and practical solution. Our approach is embodied in the Hierarchical Parallel Autoregressive ConvNet (HPAC), an ultra-lightweight pre-trained model using a hierarchical factorized structure and content-aware convolutional gating to efficiently capture spatial dependencies. We introduce two key optimizations for practicality: Cache-then-Select Inference (CSI), which accelerates coding by eliminating redundant computations, and Adaptive Focus Coding (AFC), which efficiently extends the framework to high bit-depth images. Building on this efficient foundation, our progressive adaptation strategy is realized by Spatially-Aware Rate-Guided Progressive Fine-tuning (SARP-FT). This instance-level strategy fine-tunes the model for each test image by optimizing low-rank adapters on progressively larger, spatially-continuous regions selected via estimated information density. Experiments on diverse datasets (natural, satellite, medical) validate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art compression. Notably, our approach sets a new benchmark in learned lossless compression, showing a carefully designed AR framework can offer significant gains over existing methods with a small parameter count and competitive coding speeds.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Phys-Liquid is a physics-informed synthetic dataset for transparent liquid perception, featuring 97,200 simulation images and 3D meshes across varied scenes, enabling a four-stage reconstruction pipeline that improves liquid geometry and volume estimation, aiding robust robotic liquid tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating geometry and volume of transparent, deformable liquids is difficult due to optical effects and dynamic surface changes caused by container motion. Robots performing dispensing, aspiration, and mixing need realistic data to learn robust perception, and existing datasets lack physics-informed simulations of liquid behavior under diverse dynamics.

Method: Construct Phys-Liquid with multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations.

The dataset comprises 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes. Validation includes comparing reconstruction accuracy against benchmarks across geometry and volume estimation.

Result: The pipeline achieves improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, and the Phys-Liquid dataset outperforms existing benchmarks on relevant metrics. The dataset and validation approach enable more realistic and reliable transparent-liquid perception for future robotics tasks.

Conclusion: Phys-Liquid provides a realistic, physics-informed resource for transparent liquid perception, with open-source dataset and code, fostering advances in robotic liquid manipulation and perception research.

Abstract: Estimating the geometric and volumetric properties of transparent deformable liquids is challenging due to optical complexities and dynamic surface deformations induced by container movements. Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment. Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data representing realistic liquid behaviors under diverse dynamic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Phys-Liquid, a physics-informed dataset comprising 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes, capturing liquid dynamics across multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations. To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks. The dataset and associated validation methods facilitate future advancements in transparent liquid perception tasks.

### [27] [CLUE: Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings for Diversity Management in Text-to-Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10993)
*Keunwoo Park,Jihye Chae,Joong Ho Ahn,Jihoon Kweon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A CLUE-based framework enables diverse, stable text-to-image generation from limited medical data without extra data, improving image realism (lower FID) and downstream classification metrics, and serving as effective data augmentation for domain-specific tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical domains suffer from scarce and heterogeneous datasets; existing data-augmentation approaches often rely on additional modalities or larger data pools. The work aims to achieve diversity and stability with fixed prompts and no extra data.

Method: Built on Stable Diffusion with a Style Encoder feeding a new second attention layer in the U-Net. Uses KL-divergence to carve a continuous latent space within Gaussian regions, allowing prompt-independent image features. Operates with fixed-format prompts and evaluates on an otitis media dataset.

Result: Quantitatively, FID dropped from 46.81 to 9.30; recall rose from 49.60% to 70.29%. Synthetic data at 1000% scale yielded F1 of 83.21% (vs 73.83%), and combined synthetic+real reached 94.76% (vs real-only). On an external dataset, synthetic-only F1 reached 76.77% (vs 60.61%), and combined reached 85.78%.

Conclusion: CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and acts as effective data augmentation for domain-specific medical applications.

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis models require the ability to generate diverse images while maintaining stability. To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset. These results demonstrate that CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications.

*Saptarshi Neil Sinha,Julius Kühn,Mika Silvan Goschke,Michael Weinmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A synthetic data-driven 6D pose estimation framework for strawberries using YOLOX-6D-Pose and a Blender-based procedural data pipeline, achieving comparable accuracy on high-end GPUs and edge devices, with strong performance on ripe strawberries and opportunities to improve unripe detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automated fruit harvesting is hindered by high labor costs and shortages. 6D pose estimation trained on synthetic data addresses data scarcity and can enable robust, scalable robotic harvesting across diverse fruits.

Method: Generate photorealistic synthetic strawberry data from multiple 3D models via a procedural Blender pipeline; train/test using the YOLOX-6D-Pose single-shot approach (backbone from YOLOX) with edge inference capability; evaluate on NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano using ADD-S metrics; qualitative analysis on ripe and partially ripe fruits.

Result: The models achieve comparable ADD-S accuracy on RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano, with RTX 3090 providing higher processing speed; Jetson Orin Nano is well-suited for resource-constrained deployment; qualitative results show accurate pose estimation for ripe and partially ripe strawberries, with reduced performance on unripe berries.

Conclusion: A robust synthetic-data pipeline can train effective 6D pose estimators for strawberries and potentially other fruits, enabling scalable agricultural robotics. Future work can focus on improving unripe fruit detection (e.g., via color variation) and extending the approach to more fruit types.

Abstract: Automated and selective harvesting of fruits has become an important area of research, particularly due to challenges such as high costs and a shortage of seasonal labor in advanced economies. This paper focuses on 6D pose estimation of strawberries using purely synthetic data generated through a procedural pipeline for photorealistic rendering. We employ the YOLOX-6D-Pose algorithm, a single-shot approach that leverages the YOLOX backbone, known for its balance between speed and accuracy, and its support for edge inference. To address the lacking availability of training data, we introduce a robust and flexible pipeline for generating synthetic strawberry data from various 3D models via a procedural Blender pipeline, where we focus on enhancing the realism of the synthesized data in comparison to previous work to make it a valuable resource for training pose estimation algorithms. Quantitative evaluations indicate that our models achieve comparable accuracy on both the NVIDIA RTX 3090 and Jetson Orin Nano across several ADD-S metrics, with the RTX 3090 demonstrating superior processing speed. However, the Jetson Orin Nano is particularly suited for resource-constrained environments, making it an excellent choice for deployment in agricultural robotics. Qualitative assessments further confirm the model's performance, demonstrating its capability to accurately infer the poses of ripe and partially ripe strawberries, while facing challenges in detecting unripe specimens. This suggests opportunities for future improvements, especially in enhancing detection capabilities for unripe strawberries (if desired) by exploring variations in color. Furthermore, the methodology presented could be adapted easily for other fruits such as apples, peaches, and plums, thereby expanding its applicability and impact in the field of agricultural automation.

### [29] [PROMISE: Prompt-Attentive Hierarchical Contrastive Learning for Robust Cross-Modal Representation with Missing Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10997)
*Jiajun Chen,Sai Cheng,Yutao Yuan,Yirui Zhang,Haitao Yuan,Peng Peng,Yi Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PROMISE is a prompt-based, attentive hierarchical contrastive learning framework that preserves cross-modal representations when some modalities are missing, outperforming state-of-the-art multimodal methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal models suffer severe performance drops in real-world settings where one or more modalities are unavailable, due to inconsistent representations between full multimodal data and incomplete-modality data. Existing methods rely on simplistic data generation that fails to preserve cross-modal consistency.

Method: PROMISE combines multimodal prompt learning with a hierarchical contrastive learning framework and a prompt-attention mechanism. The prompts dynamically generate robust and consistent representations for missing modalities, bridging the representation gap between complete and incomplete data across multiple levels of abstraction.

Result: Experimental results on benchmark datasets, together with ablations, demonstrate that PROMISE achieves superior performance compared with current state-of-the-art multimodal methods, and that contributions from prompts, attention, and hierarchy contribute to robustness.

Conclusion: PROMISE effectively enables robust cross-modal representations under missing modalities, enhancing real-world applicability of multimodal systems; further work could extend to more modalities and tasks and explore scalability and efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal models integrating natural language and visual information have substantially improved generalization of representation models. However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.

### [30] [EmoVid: A Multimodal Emotion Video Dataset for Emotion-Centric Video Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11002)
*Zongyang Qiu,Bingyuan Wang,Xingbei Chen,Yingqing He,Zeyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EmoVid presents the first emotion-annotated multimodal video dataset for creative media and demonstrates emotion-conditioned video generation by fine-tuning Wan2.1, achieving improvements in quality and metrics; it sets a new affective video computing benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap between affective vision understanding and generative video tasks, especially for stylized, non-realistic content. Existing video generation emphasizes low-level visual metrics and lacks emotion-aware resources for artistic contexts.

Method: Create EmoVid, a multimodal dataset with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and captions across cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers; perform analysis to link spatial/temporal visual features to emotions; fine-tune Wan2.1 for emotion-conditioned text-to-video and image-to-video generation.

Result: Significant improvements in quantitative metrics and visual quality of generated videos on T2V and I2V tasks; EmoVid provides a new benchmark for affective video computing and offers practical methods to enhance emotional expression in video generation.

Conclusion: EmoVid enables better visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos and supplies tools and benchmarks to advance affective video generation and evaluation.

Abstract: Emotion plays a pivotal role in video-based expression, but existing video generation systems predominantly focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions. Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing. Our work not only offers valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos, but also provides practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.

### [31] [MeCaMIL: Causality-Aware Multiple Instance Learning for Fair and Interpretable Whole Slide Image Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11004)
*Yiran Song,Yikai Zhang,Shuang Zhou,Guojun Xiong,Xiaofeng Yang,Nian Wang,Fenglong Ma,Rui Zhang,Mingquan Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A causality-aware MIL framework (MeCaMIL) for WSI analysis that disentangles disease signals from demographic confounders using causal graphs, improving accuracy and fairness and extending to survival prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MIL-based WSI analysis relies on attention mechanisms that are not causally interpretable and typically ignores demographic information, leading to potential bias and fairness concerns across diverse patient populations. There is a need to disentangle disease signals from demographic confounders to enable fair, clinically actionable AI.

Method: Construct structured causal graphs that encode demographic confounders and their relation to disease signals. Use do-calculus and collider reasoning to separate disease-relevant information from spurious demographic correlations within the MIL framework, treating demographics as integral to the causal model rather than mere auxiliary features. Evaluate on CAMELYON16, TCGA-Lung, and TCGA-Multi; conduct ablation studies to validate the graph structure.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CAMELYON16 (ACC/AUC/F1: 0.939/0.983/0.946), TCGA-Lung (0.935/0.979/0.931), and TCGA-Multi (0.977/0.993/0.970 across five cancer types). Demographic disparity variance drops by >65% on average across attributes, improving fairness, with notable gains for underserved groups. Survival prediction mean C-index: 0.653 ( +0.017 over best baseline across five cancer types ). Ablations show the causal graph is essential: alternative designs yield 0.048 lower accuracy and 4.2x worse fairness.

Conclusion: MeCaMIL provides a principled, fair, and interpretable framework for AI in digital pathology, suitable for clinical translation, with code to be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as the dominant paradigm for whole slide image (WSI) analysis in computational pathology, achieving strong diagnostic performance through patch-level feature aggregation. However, existing MIL methods face critical limitations: (1) they rely on attention mechanisms that lack causal interpretability, and (2) they fail to integrate patient demographics (age, gender, race), leading to fairness concerns across diverse populations. These shortcomings hinder clinical translation, where algorithmic bias can exacerbate health disparities. We introduce \textbf{MeCaMIL}, a causality-aware MIL framework that explicitly models demographic confounders through structured causal graphs. Unlike prior approaches treating demographics as auxiliary features, MeCaMIL employs principled causal inference -- leveraging do-calculus and collider structures -- to disentangle disease-relevant signals from spurious demographic correlations. Extensive evaluation on three benchmarks demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across CAMELYON16 (ACC/AUC/F1: 0.939/0.983/0.946), TCGA-Lung (0.935/0.979/0.931), and TCGA-Multi (0.977/0.993/0.970, five cancer types). Critically, MeCaMIL achieves superior fairness -- demographic disparity variance drops by over 65% relative reduction on average across attributes, with notable improvements for underserved populations. The framework generalizes to survival prediction (mean C-index: 0.653, +0.017 over best baseline across five cancer types). Ablation studies confirm causal graph structure is essential -- alternative designs yield 0.048 lower accuracy and 4.2x times worse fairness. These results establish MeCaMIL as a principled framework for fair, interpretable, and clinically actionable AI in digital pathology. Code will be released upon acceptance.

### [32] [Draft and Refine with Visual Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11005)
*Sungheon Jeong,Ryozo Masukawa,Jihong Park,Sanggeon Yun,Wenjun Huang,Hanning Chen,Mahdi Imani,Mohsen Imani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Draft and Refine (DnR), a metric-guided agent that quantifies and improves visual utilization in LVLMs via query-conditioned relevance maps and external visual feedback, achieving better grounding without retraining and reducing hallucinations in VQA/captioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs can reason multimodally but often rely on linguistic priors, leading to ungrounded or hallucinatory outputs. There is a need for a quantitative measure of how much visual information is actually used during reasoning to improve grounding.

Method: Compute a query-conditioned relevance map to localize question-specific cues, then estimate dependence via relevance-guided probabilistic masking. Use this metric to guide a DnR agent that refines its draft with feedback from external visual experts (e.g., boxes/masks). Render each expert output as visual cues on the image and re-query the model to pick the response that best improves visual utilization, without retraining or architectural changes.

Result: Across VQA and captioning benchmarks, the approach yields consistent accuracy gains and reduced hallucination, indicating that measuring visual utilization can lead to more interpretable and evidence-driven multimodal agents.

Conclusion: Measuring visual utilization provides a principled path toward more grounded, interpretable multimodal agents without the need for retraining.

Abstract: While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal reasoning abilities, they often produce ungrounded or hallucinated responses because they rely too heavily on linguistic priors instead of visual evidence. This limitation highlights the absence of a quantitative measure of how much these models actually use visual information during reasoning. We propose Draft and Refine (DnR), an agent framework driven by a question-conditioned utilization metric. The metric quantifies the model's reliance on visual evidence by first constructing a query-conditioned relevance map to localize question-specific cues and then measuring dependence through relevance-guided probabilistic masking. Guided by this metric, the DnR agent refines its initial draft using targeted feedback from external visual experts. Each expert's output (such as boxes or masks) is rendered as visual cues on the image, and the model is re-queried to select the response that yields the largest improvement in utilization. This process strengthens visual grounding without retraining or architectural changes. Experiments across VQA and captioning benchmarks show consistent accuracy gains and reduced hallucination, demonstrating that measuring visual utilization provides a principled path toward more interpretable and evidence-driven multimodal agent systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisMem introduces dynamic latent vision memories with short-term perceptual and long-term semantic modules to mitigate the visual processing bottleneck in Vision-Language Models, enabling memory-enabled inference and improving performance on diverse tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the visual grounding loss and lack of contextualized visual experience in VLMs during prolonged generation, inspired by human short-term/long-term memory distinctions.

Method: Integrates two memory submodules into VLMs: a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are dynamically invoked during inference to maintain perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency.

Result: Across tasks in understanding, reasoning, and generation, VisMem yields an average performance boost of 11.8% over a vanilla model and outperforms all baselines.

Conclusion: VisMem demonstrates a new paradigm of latent-space memory enhancement for VLMs, combining perceptual and semantic memories to sustain grounding and coherence; code will be released.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their performance on a range of complex visual tasks is often hindered by a "visual processing bottleneck": a propensity to lose grounding in visual evidence and exhibit a deficit in contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement. The code will be available: https://github.com/YU-deep/VisMem.git.

*Sumin Yu,Taesup Moon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SP-Guard introduces selective guidance for diffusion-based text-to-image models, estimating prompt harmfulness and masking unsafe regions to guide only those areas, yielding safer images with minimal collateral changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based T2I models can produce harmful content; existing inference-time safeguards lack adaptivity to prompts and fail to target only unsafe regions, risking degraded benign content or incomplete safety.

Method: Compute a harmfulness score of the prompt, create a binary/soft mask over image regions corresponding to potential harm, and apply guidance selectively to masked unsafe regions during diffusion sampling.

Result: Produces safer outputs than prior guidance methods while preserving most benign content, reducing unintended alterations and maintaining image quality where safe content is concerned.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the value of transparency and controllability in safe image generation and suggests that adaptive, selective safety mechanisms are a promising direction for responsible diffusion-based generation.

Abstract: While diffusion-based T2I models have achieved remarkable image generation quality, they also enable easy creation of harmful content, raising social concerns and highlighting the need for safer generation. Existing inference-time guiding methods lack both adaptivity--adjusting guidance strength based on the prompt--and selectivity--targeting only unsafe regions of the image. Our method, SP-Guard, addresses these limitations by estimating prompt harmfulness and applying a selective guidance mask to guide only unsafe areas. Experiments show that SP-Guard generates safer images than existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration. Beyond improving safety, our findings highlight the importance of transparency and controllability in image generation.

*Siheon Joo,Hongjo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-and-play SUPER decoder block leverages wavelet-based perfect reconstruction to preserve high-frequency details and selectively suppress redundant features in U-Net variants, improving reconstruction fidelity with modest overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Skip-connected U-Nets often lose high-frequency information; there is a need for reconstruction-aware decoders that maintain detail without rigid framelet constraints.

Method: Introduce Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER) as a decoder block that exploits wavelet PR to prevent information degradation while suppressing redundant features; it is plug-and-play across U-Net variants, maintaining similar compute but increasing parameterization; tested on CrackVision12K and SIDD.

Result: SUPER enhances thin-crack segmentation (especially cracks <4 px) on CrackVision12K and yields moderate PSNR gains in SIDD denoising; it broadens representational diversity and provides high-frequency fidelity across diverse models within a unified framework.

Conclusion: SUPER provides a versatile, reconstruction-aware decoder block that preserves high-frequency information in U-Nets with modest overhead, improving performance across low- and high-frequency regimes.

Abstract: Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures (U-Net variants) are widely adopted for inverse problems but still suffer from information loss, limiting recovery of fine high-frequency details. We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes. These results validate its plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within a unified, reconstruction-aware framework.

*Jirong Zha,Yuxuan Fan,Tianyu Zhang,Geng Chen,Yingfeng Chen,Chen Gao,Xinlei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AirCopBench is the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating multimodal LLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under degraded perception, revealing a sizable gap to human performance and demonstrating sim-to-real transfer feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a shortage of benchmarks for multi-agent collaborative perception in aerial settings, especially under real-world degraded perception; motivating evaluation of MLLMs beyond single-agent perception.

Method: Introduce AirCopBench with 14.6k+ questions from simulator and real-world data across four task dimensions (Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, Collaborative Decision) and 14 task types. Generate questions via model-, rule-, and human-based methods with stringent quality control. Evaluate 40 MLLMs and conduct fine-tuning experiments to assess sim-to-real transfer.

Result: 40 MLLMs show significant gaps in collaborative perception; the best model trails humans by 24.38% on average and findings are inconsistent across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments confirm sim-to-real transfer feasibility in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.

Conclusion: AirCopBench provides a rigorous benchmark for aerial collaborative perception, revealing substantial room for improvement for MLLMs and supporting the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer, thus guiding future research in multi-agent perception and decision-making.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in single-agent vision tasks, yet benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent collaborative perception remain scarce. This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.

*Yong Sun,Zhengjie Zhang,Junyu Shi,Zhiyuan Zhang,Lijiang Liu,Qiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based two-stage EmbryoDiff framework improves fine-grained embryo stage classification by leveraging multi-focal 3D-aware representations and a hybrid semantic–boundary conditioning, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with minimal denoising steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current discriminative models underutilize the distributional priors of embryonic development and rely on single-focal information, leading to incomplete representations and vulnerability to occlusion. There is a need to integrate multi-focal features and distributional priors within a robust generative framework.

Method: 1) Train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. 2) Apply a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion across focal planes to build a 3D-aware morphological representation. 3) Derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and introduce a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process. 4) Formulate the task as a conditional sequence denoising in a two-stage diffusion framework. 5) Achieve strong performance with a single denoising step.

Result: State-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets, with accuracy of 82.8% and 81.3% on the two datasets respectively using only one denoising step.

Conclusion: EmbryoDiff effectively leverages distribution priors and multi-focal, 3D-aware representations within a diffusion framework to improve fine-grained embryo stage classification, mitigating occlusion-induced ambiguities and offering robust embryo viability assessment.

Abstract: Identification of fine-grained embryo developmental stages during In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is crucial for assessing embryo viability. Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, with only a single denoising step, our model obtains the best average test performance, reaching 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: Deep vision models can infer health insurance type from chest X-rays, revealing socioeconomic fingerprints in medical images and prompting a rethink of fairness in AI for healthcare.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To investigate whether medical images encode social/environmental signals linked to socioeconomic status, challenging the assumption that imaging data are purely biological and to inform fairness considerations.

Method: Train DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, and MedMamba on chest X-ray datasets (MIMIC-CXR-JPG, CheXpert) to predict health insurance type; control for age, race, sex; test cross-race; use patch occlusion to map signal localization.

Result: AUC around 0.67–0.68; signal persists after demographic controls and across single-race training; diffuse signal in upper/mid-thorax; likely reflects care pathways or equipment differences; model may learn socioeconomic segregation.

Conclusion: Images are not neutral; fairness goals should include disentangling social fingerprints in data, addressing how clinical environments embed socioeconomic signals, beyond dataset balancing or threshold adjustments.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is revealing what medicine never intended to encode. Deep vision models, trained on chest X-rays, can now detect not only disease but also invisible traces of social inequality. In this study, we show that state-of-the-art architectures (DenseNet121, SwinV2-B, MedMamba) can predict a patient's health insurance type, a strong proxy for socioeconomic status, from normal chest X-rays with significant accuracy (AUC around 0.67 on MIMIC-CXR-JPG, 0.68 on CheXpert). The signal persists even when age, race, and sex are controlled for, and remains detectable when the model is trained exclusively on a single racial group. Patch-based occlusion reveals that the signal is diffuse rather than localized, embedded in the upper and mid-thoracic regions. This suggests that deep networks may be internalizing subtle traces of clinical environments, equipment differences, or care pathways; learning socioeconomic segregation itself. These findings challenge the assumption that medical images are neutral biological data. By uncovering how models perceive and exploit these hidden social signatures, this work reframes fairness in medical AI: the goal is no longer only to balance datasets or adjust thresholds, but to interrogate and disentangle the social fingerprints embedded in clinical data itself.

### [39] [Accelerating Controllable Generation via Hybrid-grained Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11031)
*Lin Liu,Huixia Ben,Shuo Wang,Jinda Lu,Junxiang Qiu,Shengeng Tang,Yanbin Hao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) for controllable generative models combines coarse block-level and fine-grained prompt-level caches to reduce computation while preserving quality; achieves substantial MACs reduction with minimal fidelity loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controllable generative models incur high computational costs due to control conditions and content generation; there is a need to improve generation efficiency without sacrificing quality.

Method: Introduce two caches: (1) coarse-grained block-level cache for feature reuse across encoder-decoder blocks between reasoning steps; (2) fine-grained prompt-level cache reusing cross-attention maps within a module across consecutive steps and extending to adjacent steps; integrate across all computational links.

Result: Validated on four benchmarks; significant MAC reduction (e.g., 63% on COCO-Stuff: 18.22T → 6.70T) with semantic fidelity loss limited to ~1.5%.

Conclusion: HGC effectively balances generation efficiency and visual quality, enabling faster controllable generation in practice.

Abstract: Controllable generative models have been widely used to improve the realism of synthetic visual content. However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.

### [40] [MPCGNet: A Multiscale Feature Extraction and Progressive Feature Aggregation Network Using Coupling Gates for Polyp Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11032)
*Wei Wang,Feng Jiang,Xin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MPCGNet is a CNN-based polyp segmentation framework that uses coupling gates to filter noise and perform feature importance selection, with three modules (CGMFE, WCAD decoder, DFA) to enhance small-polyp segmentation; it achieves higher mDice scores than recent networks on ETIS-LaribPolypDB and CVC-ColonDB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address three key challenges in polyp segmentation: missing small polyps, ambiguous polyp boundaries, and noisy colonoscopy images due to lighting and artifacts.

Method: Introduce coupling gates as components in specific modules. The CGMFE module extracts local features while suppressing noise; the WCAD decoder restores details after locating polyps via window-based cross-attention; the DFA module progressively aggregates features and performs feature importance selection to reduce small-polyp loss.

Result: MPCGNet outperforms recent networks with mDice improvements of 2.20 percentage points on ETIS-LaribPolypDB and 0.68 percentage points on CVC-ColonDB.

Conclusion: Coupling gates incorporated in an MPCGNet framework provide effective noise filtering and feature refinement, yielding improved segmentation performance, particularly for small polyps, across two standard datasets.

Abstract: Automatic segmentation methods of polyps is crucial for assisting doctors in colorectal polyp screening and cancer diagnosis. Despite the progress made by existing methods, polyp segmentation faces several challenges: (1) small-sized polyps are prone to being missed during identification, (2) the boundaries between polyps and the surrounding environment are often ambiguous, (3) noise in colonoscopy images, caused by uneven lighting and other factors, affects segmentation results. To address these challenges, this paper introduces coupling gates as components in specific modules to filter noise and perform feature importance selection. Three modules are proposed: the coupling gates multiscale feature extraction (CGMFE) module, which effectively extracts local features and suppresses noise; the windows cross attention (WCAD) decoder module, which restores details after capturing the precise location of polyps; and the decoder feature aggregation (DFA) module, which progressively aggregates features, further extracts them, and performs feature importance selection to reduce the loss of small-sized polyps. Experimental results demonstrate that MPCGNet outperforms recent networks, with mDice scores 2.20% and 0.68% higher than the second-best network on the ETIS-LaribPolypDB and CVC-ColonDB datasets, respectively.

### [41] [CrossMed: A Multimodal Cross-Task Benchmark for Compositional Generalization in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11034)
*Pooja Singh,Siddhant Ujjain,Tapan Kumar Gandhi,Sandeep Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrossMed benchmarks compositional generalization in medical multimodal LLMs by recasting four datasets into a MAT-based VQA format; multimodal LLMs show strong generalization on related data but struggle with unrelated/zero-shot splits, with cross-task transfer improving segmentation; traditional models show modest gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the lack of systematic evaluation of compositional generalization across modality, anatomy, and task in medical vision-language models and to establish a unified MAT (Modality-Anatomy-Task) framework for cross-domain evaluation.

Method: Reformulate four public datasets (CheXpert, SIIM-ACR, BraTS 2020, MosMedData) into a unified visual question answering format, creating 20,200 MCQA instances. Evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs (LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B) on Related, Unrelated, and zero-overlap MAT splits, and compare with ResNet-50 and U-Net baselines. Assess classification accuracy and segmentation cIoU, and test cross-task transfer by training on classification data and evaluating segmentation.

Result: Related splits yield 83.2% classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU. Performance drops under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, highlighting the benchmark’s difficulty. Cross-task transfer improves segmentation by ~7 percentage points cIoU even when trained solely on classification data. Traditional models show modest gains; multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization.

Conclusion: CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models and demonstrates that multimodal LLMs can achieve notable compositional generalization, albeit with challenges in unrelated and zero-overlap settings.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models have enabled unified processing of visual and textual inputs, offering promising applications in general-purpose medical AI. However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.

*Jiaming Huang,Yi Gao,Fuchang Pan,Renjie Li,Wei Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SemanticNN enables semantic-level robust offloading on weak IoT devices, dramatically reducing transmitted features with BER-aware decoding and soft-quantization encoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT/edge AI on extremely weak embedded devices faces tight compute, memory, and unreliable networks. Bit-level error correction is often inefficient under dynamic channels; semantic-level correctness offers more robust and efficient collaboration between device and edge.

Method: SemanticNN introduces a semantic codec with a BER-aware decoder and Soft Quantization (SQ) encoder to learn compact representations. It includes Feature-augmentation Learning to improve offloading efficiency and XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to handle encoder-decoder capability mismatches due to asymmetric resources. The approach is validated via extensive experiments on STM32 across three models and six datasets for image classification and object detection.

Result: Under varying transmission error rates, SemanticNN reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy.

Conclusion: Semantic-level collaboration with BER-aware decoding, SQ encoding, and symmetry-aware training can substantially improve robustness and efficiency of edge AI offloading on resource-constrained IoT devices.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating artificial intelligence (AI) on extremely weak embedded devices has garnered significant attention, enabling improved real-time performance and enhanced data privacy. However, the resource limitations of such devices and unreliable network conditions necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems. Traditional approaches focus on bit-level transmission correctness, which can be inefficient under dynamic channel conditions. In contrast, we propose SemanticNN, a semantic codec that tolerates bit-level errors in pursuit of semantic-level correctness, enabling compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints. It incorporates a Bit Error Rate (BER)-aware decoder that adapts to dynamic channel conditions and a Soft Quantization (SQ)-based encoder to learn compact representations. Building on this architecture, we introduce Feature-augmentation Learning, a novel training strategy that enhances offloading efficiency. To address encoder-decoder capability mismatches from asymmetric resources, we propose XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance decoding semantic fidelity. We conduct extensive experiments on STM32 using three models and six datasets across image classification and object detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, under varying transmission error rates, SemanticNN significantly reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy.

### [43] [Hyperbolic Hierarchical Alignment Reasoning Network for Text-3D Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11045)
*Wenrui Li,Yidan Lu,Yeyu Chai,Rui Zhao,Hengyu Man,Xiaopeng Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Hyperbolic Hierarchical Alignment Reasoning Network (H2ARN) for text-3D retrieval, addressing Hierarchy Representation Collapse (HRC) and Redundancy-Induced Saliency Dilution (RISD) by embedding text and 3D data in Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, using hierarchical ordering and instance-level contrastive losses, plus a contribution-aware hyperbolic aggregation module. Expands and releases the T3DR-HIT v2 benchmark and provides code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Euclidean embeddings compress hierarchical relations and dilute salient features, hindering the ability to model abstract-to-specific and whole-to-part hierarchies and to distinguish hard negatives in text-3D retrieval. A hyperbolic geometry can naturally preserve hierarchy; additional modules are needed to mitigate redundancy without extra supervision and to improve discrimination among challenging samples.

Method: Embed text and 3D data in a Lorentz-model hyperbolic space. Use a hierarchical ordering loss to create shrinking entailment cones around each text vector so matched 3D instances lie inside the cone; employ an instance-level contrastive loss to separate matches from non-matches. Introduce a contribution-aware hyperbolic aggregation module that uses Lorentzian distance to weigh local features and perform contribution-weighted aggregation guided by hyperbolic geometry to reduce redundancy and emphasize discriminative regions without extra supervision. Release expanded T3DR-HIT v2 with 8,935 text-to-3D pairs.

Result: The paper proposes a complete framework (H2ARN) addressing HRC and RISD in text-3D retrieval and demonstrates its effectiveness on the expanded T3DR-HIT v2 benchmark; code is released for reproducibility.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic geometry coupled with hierarchical and contribution-aware mechanisms provides a principled solution to hierarchy preservation and redundancy suppression in text-3D retrieval, with a substantial benchmark expansion facilitating future research.

Abstract: With the daily influx of 3D data on the internet, text-3D retrieval has gained increasing attention. However, current methods face two major challenges: Hierarchy Representation Collapse (HRC) and Redundancy-Induced Saliency Dilution (RISD). HRC compresses abstract-to-specific and whole-to-part hierarchies in Euclidean embeddings, while RISD averages noisy fragments, obscuring critical semantic cues and diminishing the model's ability to distinguish hard negatives. To address these challenges, we introduce the Hyperbolic Hierarchical Alignment Reasoning Network (H$^{2}$ARN) for text-3D retrieval. H$^{2}$ARN embeds both text and 3D data in a Lorentz-model hyperbolic space, where exponential volume growth inherently preserves hierarchical distances. A hierarchical ordering loss constructs a shrinking entailment cone around each text vector, ensuring that the matched 3D instance falls within the cone, while an instance-level contrastive loss jointly enforces separation from non-matching samples. To tackle RISD, we propose a contribution-aware hyperbolic aggregation module that leverages Lorentzian distance to assess the relevance of each local feature and applies contribution-weighted aggregation guided by hyperbolic geometry, enhancing discriminative regions while suppressing redundancy without additional supervision. We also release the expanded T3DR-HIT v2 benchmark, which contains 8,935 text-to-3D pairs, 2.6 times the original size, covering both fine-grained cultural artefacts and complex indoor scenes. Our codes are available at https://github.com/liwrui/H2ARN.

### [44] [PINGS-X: Physics-Informed Normalized Gaussian Splatting with Axes Alignment for Efficient Super-Resolution of 4D Flow MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11048)
*Sun Jo,Seok Young Hong,JinHyun Kim,Seungmin Kang,Ahjin Choi,Don-Gwan An,Simon Song,Je Hyeong Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fast, convergent Gaussian splatting for high-res 4D flow MRI velocities (PINGS-X) enabling quicker training and higher super-resolution accuracy than PINN-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need high spatiotemporal resolution in 4D flow MRI for early detection of vascular conditions, but high-res acquisition/processing is slow. PINNs are per-patient slow to train; require a general, fast, accurate super-resolution method.

Method: PINGS-X models high-resolution velocity fields with axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussians, uses normalized splatting with convergence guarantees, merges Gaussians to avoid degeneracy, inspired by 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS). Provides training simplifications and high-dimensional data handling with convergence guarantees.

Result: On CFD and real 4D flow MRI data, PINGS-X achieves superior super-resolution accuracy while substantially reducing training time compared with baselines.

Conclusion: PINGS-X offers a practical, efficient approach for fast, high-quality 4D flow velocity super-resolution; code and datasets are openly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/SpatialAILab/PINGS-X.

### [45] [NP-LoRA: Null Space Projection Unifies Subject and Style in LoRA Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11051)
*Chuheng Chen,Xiaofei Zhou,Geyuan Zhang,Yong Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NP-LoRA is a projection-based fusion method that enforces subspace separation to avoid interference between LoRAs by projecting one into the null space of principal directions; it enables soft control and improves fusion quality without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA fusion suffers from structural interference, where separately trained LoRAs occupy overlapping subspaces, causing degradation in fidelity when merged; need a way to separate principal directions and prevent interference.

Method: Analyze LoRA subspaces with SVD to identify principal style directions, then project the subject LoRA into the orthogonal null space of these directions; introduce a soft projection mechanism to balance subject fidelity and style consistency; implements a projection-based fusion that requires no retraining and generalizes across backbones and LoRA pairs.

Result: Experiments show NP-LoRA consistently improves fusion quality over strong baselines using DINO/CLIP-based metrics and human/LLM preferences; method is applicable across various backbones and LoRA pairs without retraining.

Conclusion: A projection-based fusion with null-space separation effectively mitigates structural interference in LoRA fusion, enabling controllable, high-fidelity fusion of subject and style representations without retraining and with broad applicability.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fusion has emerged as a key technique for reusing and composing learned subject and style representations for controllable generation without costly retraining. However, existing methods rely on weight-based merging, where one LoRA often dominates the other, leading to interference and degraded fidelity. This interference is structural: separately trained LoRAs occupy low-rank high-dimensional subspaces, leading to non-orthogonal and overlapping representations. In this work, we analyze the internal structure of LoRAs and find their generative behavior is dominated by a few principal directions in the low-rank subspace, which should remain free from interference during fusion. To achieve this, we propose Null Space Projection LoRA (NP-LoRA), a projection-based framework for LoRA fusion that enforces subspace separation to prevent structural interference among principal directions. Specifically, we first extract principal style directions via singular value decomposition (SVD) and then project the subject LoRA into its orthogonal null space. Furthermore, we introduce a soft projection mechanism that enables smooth control over the trade-off between subject fidelity and style consistency. Experiments show NP-LoRA consistently improves fusion quality over strong baselines (e.g., DINO and CLIP-based metrics, with human and LLM preference scores), and applies broadly across backbones and LoRA pairs without retraining.

*Jiaxuan Chen,Bo Zhang,Qingdong He,Jinlong Peng,Li Niu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-reference generative image composition model is proposed to better preserve details and adjust foreground pose/view by calibrating global and local features of multiple foreground references; validated on MVImgNet and MureCom, showing notable gains from calibrated features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current generative composition methods struggle to simultaneously preserve foreground details and adjust pose/view; leveraging multiple foreground references and aligning their features with the background could improve coherence and control.

Method: Extend the composition model to accept an arbitrary number of foreground reference images (multi-reference). Calibrate foreground reference features at global and local levels to ensure compatibility with background information. Use calibrated features to supplement original references to provide appropriate pose/view information.

Result: Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom indicate that incorporating calibrated reference features significantly benefits the generative composition performance.

Conclusion: A multi-reference framework with calibrated foreground features improves image composition quality by better aligning foreground with background and preserving details, enabling better pose/view control.

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert foreground object into background. Despite the huge progress in generative image composition, the existing methods are still struggling with simultaneous detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment. To address this issue, we extend the existing generative composition model to multi-reference version, which allows using arbitrary number of foreground reference images. Furthermore, we propose to calibrate the global and local features of foreground reference images to make them compatible with the background information. The calibrated reference features can supplement the original reference features with useful global and local information of proper pose/view. Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom demonstrate that the generative model can greatly benefit from the calibrated reference features.

*Dor Shmilovich,Tony Wu,Aviad Dahan,Yuval Domb*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteAttention leverages temporal coherence in diffusion attention to skip redundant computations across denoising steps, blending dynamic adaptability with static efficiency to accelerate video diffusion models without quality loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion transformers incur quadratic attention cost; existing acceleration methods either dynamically estimate sparse patterns (high overhead and error) or rely on fixed static sparsity (often suboptimal across steps). A property of diffusion attention—its sparsity patterns are temporally coherent—offers a target for efficient, adaptive skipping.

Method: Identify that non-essential attention tiles at step t tend to remain non-essential at step t+δ. Mark non-essential tiles early and propagate skip decisions forward across the denoising sequence (evolutionary computation skips). Implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on FlashAttention to realize these skips with minimal overhead, avoiding repeated profiling.

Result: Substantial speedups achieved on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in generation quality.

Conclusion: Exploiting the temporal coherence of diffusion attention enables a practical, adaptive-then-efficient acceleration method. LiteAttention delivers large speedups by skipping redundant attention while maintaining accuracy, implemented as an optimized kernel atop FlashAttention; code will be released.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers, particularly for video generation, achieve remarkable quality but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, leading to prohibitive latency. Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+δ$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality. The code and implementation details will be publicly released.

Motivation: Diabetic retinopathy screening has rapidly adopted deep learning, but translation into clinical practice is hindered by issues such as class imbalance, label scarcity, domain shift, reproducibility, and trust. A comprehensive synthesis is needed to map progress, benchmark performance, and identify gaps to guide future work.

Method: Systematic literature survey of DR AI from 2016–2025, aggregating 50+ studies and 20+ datasets. Critical appraisal of techniques (self-/semi-supervised learning, domain generalization, federated learning, hybrid neuro-symbolic models), evaluation protocols, reporting standards, and reproducibility. Provision of benchmark tables and a structured synthesis to highlight open gaps and actionable roadmap.

Result: Consolidates progress in advanced training strategies and evaluation practices; highlights persistent gaps in multi-center validation and clinical trust; emphasizes reproducibility and privacy-preserving approaches; offers a practical agenda for deployable DR AI and notes broader applicability to medical imaging.

Conclusion: Despite meaningful advances in DR AI, clinical deployment remains contingent on robust multi-center validation, trust, and privacy-preserving pipelines. The survey charts a clear roadmap for reproducible, generalizable, and clinically acceptable DR AI, with broader implications for medical imaging at scale.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, with early detection critical for reducing vision loss worldwide. Over the past decade, deep learning has transformed DR screening, progressing from early convolutional neural networks trained on private datasets to advanced pipelines addressing class imbalance, label scarcity, domain shift, and interpretability. This survey provides the first systematic synthesis of DR research spanning 2016-2025, consolidating results from 50+ studies and over 20 datasets. We critically examine methodological advances, including self- and semi-supervised learning, domain generalization, federated training, and hybrid neuro-symbolic models, alongside evaluation protocols, reporting standards, and reproducibility challenges. Benchmark tables contextualize performance across datasets, while discussion highlights open gaps in multi-center validation and clinical trust. By linking technical progress with translational barriers, this work outlines a practical agenda for reproducible, privacy-preserving, and clinically deployable DR AI. Beyond DR, many of the surveyed innovations extend broadly to medical imaging at scale.

*Jiechao Gao,Chang Liu,Yuangang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: S2D-Align introduces a coarse-to-deep, anatomically-grounded SFT for radiology report generation, using multi-granularity auxiliary signals and a memory-based adapter; it achieves state-of-the-art results on MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray, with ablations validating the approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard supervision via instance-level image-text alignment in cross-modal models lacks anatomically grounded alignment due to templated radiology reports; this limits generation quality.

Method: A shallow-to-deep SFT paradigm: (1) start with coarse radiograph-report pairing, (2) incorporate reference reports for instance-level guidance, (3) use key phrases to ground anatomical details. A memory-based adapter enables feature sharing across stages to bridge coarse and fine-grained guidance.

Result: S2D-Align achieves state-of-the-art performance on MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray benchmarks; ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the multi-stage auxiliary-guided approach.

Conclusion: Multi-stage, auxiliary-guided alignment with a memory-based adapter is effective for anatomically-grounded radiology report generation and suggests a promising direction for grounded multi-modal generation tasks.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports from radiology images. To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach, highlighting a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks.

TL;DR: Diffusion models with continuous latents outperform autoregressive transformers and discriminative baselines for 3D shape generation and completion, achieving state-of-the-art results on noisy depth-image driven multi-modal completion; autoregressive models on the same discrete latent space can match or surpass diffusion performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess which generative paradigm—diffusion or autoregressive— is best for 3D shape modeling and completion and how conditional information affects outcomes.

Method: Adapt DDPMs (continuous latents) and autoregressive causal transformers to 3D shape modeling and completion; include a baseline discriminative model and extensive ablations; evaluate on multi-modal completion from a single noisy depth image under realistic conditions.

Result: Diffusion with continuous latents outperforms baselines and autoregressive models, delivering state-of-the-art results on the specified task. On the same discrete latent space, autoregressive models can match or exceed diffusion performance.

Conclusion: For 3D shape completion from partial/noisy data, diffusion models with continuous latents are generally superior; autoregressive models on the same latent space provide competitive performance, indicating a trade-off between latent representation and model class.

Abstract: While generative models have seen significant adoption across a wide range of data modalities, including 3D data, a consensus on which model is best suited for which task has yet to be reached. Further, conditional information such as text and images to steer the generation process are frequently employed, whereas others, like partial 3D data, have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we compare two of the most promising generative models--Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers--which we adapt for the tasks of generative shape modeling and completion. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of both tasks, including a baseline discriminative model and an extensive ablation study. Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficiently computes tomographic projections for a 3D spline-based volume using a ray-tracing approach with a neural network to speed basis-function contributions; yields higher reconstruction quality than voxel methods in well-posed cases without regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve accuracy and efficiency of projection for spline-represented volumes and support arbitrary projection geometries, addressing limitations of voxel-based tomography.

Method: Ray-tracing algorithm for 3D line integrals with arbitrary projection geometries; neural network accelerates computation of shifted B-spline basis contributions; volume expressed as a linear combination of shifted B-splines.

Result: Demonstrates higher reconstruction quality than traditional voxel-based methods in well-posed data; no regularization required for sufficient data.

Conclusion: Supports efficient, accurate tomography for spline-based volumes and suggests potential extension to ill-posed settings or more complex geometries with regularization or further neural acceleration.

Abstract: We propose a method to efficiently compute tomographic projections of a 3D volume represented by a linear combination of shifted B-splines. To do so, we propose a ray-tracing algorithm that computes 3D line integrals with arbitrary projection geometries. One of the components of our algorithm is a neural network that computes the contribution of the basis functions efficiently. In our experiments, we consider well-posed cases where the data are sufficient for accurate reconstruction without the need for regularization. We achieve higher reconstruction quality than traditional voxel-based methods.

*Levi Harris,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SaTformer uses a space-time video transformer to forecast extreme precipitation from satellite radiances; it redefines precipitation regression as a classification task with class-weighted loss to tackle long-tail data, achieving top results in the Weather4Cast 2025 NeurIPS Cumulative Rainfall challenge; code is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional PDE-based NWP methods are computationally intensive and underperform for nowcasting (0-4 h). There is a need for data-driven, AI-powered rainfall forecasting, especially leveraging video architectures and satellite observations, to improve nowcasting of extreme rainfall.

Method: A full space-time attention video transformer (SaTformer) that forecasts precipitation from satellite radiances; addresses data imbalance by reframing regression into a calibrated classification problem with class-weighted loss.

Result: First place in the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge; code and model weights made publicly available.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that space-time video transformers, combined with loss-function tailoring to long-tailed precipitation data, can effectively predict extreme rainfall from satellite data, presenting a promising AI-driven direction for nowcasting.

Abstract: Meteorological agencies around the world rely on real-time flood guidance to issue live-saving advisories and warnings. For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances. Our model scored first place on the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge. Code and model weights are available: https://github.com/leharris3/satformer

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRR-generated radiographs from CT can train CAC detectors; lightweight CNNs; super-resolution + contrast enhancement; curriculum learning; best AUC 0.754; DRRs offer scalable, label-rich training domain and enable transfer to real CXRs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT-based CAC scoring (Agatston) is gold standard but expensive; chest X-rays lack ground-truth labels; digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) offer scalable, label-rich training data bridging CT and CXRs.

Method: Generate synthetic DRRs from 667 COCA CT scans; train various models (lightweight CNNs from scratch vs large pretrained networks); evaluate preprocessing, super-resolution, contrast enhancement, and curriculum learning; assess model capacity and training strategies; report AUC.

Result: Lightweight CNNs trained from scratch outperform large pretrained networks; pairing super-resolution with contrast enhancement yields significant gains; curriculum learning stabilizes training under weak supervision; best configuration achieves mean AUC of 0.754, comparable to or exceeding prior CXR-based studies.

Conclusion: DRRs provide a scalable, label-rich foundation for CAC detection and enable future transfer learning and domain adaptation to real CXRs; results support broader adoption of DRRs as training data for CAC detection.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a strong predictor of cardiovascular events, with CT-based Agatston scoring widely regarded as the clinical gold standard. However, CT is costly and impractical for large-scale screening, while chest X-rays (CXRs) are inexpensive but lack reliable ground truth labels, constraining deep learning development. Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) offer a scalable alternative by projecting CT volumes into CXR-like images while inheriting precise labels. In this work, we provide the first systematic evaluation of DRRs as a surrogate training domain for CAC detection. Using 667 CT scans from the COCA dataset, we generate synthetic DRRs and assess model capacity, super-resolution fidelity enhancement, preprocessing, and training strategies. Lightweight CNNs trained from scratch outperform large pretrained networks; pairing super-resolution with contrast enhancement yields significant gains; and curriculum learning stabilises training under weak supervision. Our best configuration achieves a mean AUC of 0.754, comparable to or exceeding prior CXR-based studies. These results establish DRRs as a scalable, label-rich foundation for CAC detection, while laying the foundation for future transfer learning and domain adaptation to real CXRs.

*Mattia Ferrari,Giancarlo Papitto,Giorgio Deligios,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A few-shot contrastive-learning framework on PRISMA hyperspectral data uses a 1D CNN encoder to extract features and class-specific SVR regressors to estimate per-pixel proportions of healthy, beetle-attacked, and dead trees, outperforming band-based and Sentinel-2 baselines in Dolomites.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bark beetle outbreaks threaten conifer forests; hyperspectral data can improve detection, but labeled data is scarce. A robust feature learning approach tailored to hyperspectral sequences can enable accurate, pixel-level forest health estimates with limited labels.

Method: Pre-train a one-dimensional CNN encoder via contrastive learning on PRISMA hyperspectral data; extract robust spectral features; feed features into separate support-vector regression estimators (one per class) trained with few labeled samples to estimate per-pixel class proportions (healthy, attacked, dead).

Result: On Dolomites data, the proposed approach outperforms using original PRISMA bands and Sentinel-2 data, illustrating the value of PRISMA hyperspectral data plus few-shot learning for forest health monitoring.

Conclusion: PRISMA hyperspectral data combined with few-shot contrastive-learning demonstrates strong potential for accurate, scalable forest health monitoring and could extend to other hyperspectral sensing tasks with limited labels.

Abstract: Bark beetle infestations represent a serious challenge for maintaining the health of coniferous forests. This paper proposes a few-shot learning approach leveraging contrastive learning to detect bark beetle infestations using satellite PRISMA hyperspectral data. The methodology is based on a contrastive learning framework to pre-train a one-dimensional CNN encoder, enabling the extraction of robust feature representations from hyperspectral data. These extracted features are subsequently utilized as input to support vector regression estimators, one for each class, trained on few labeled samples to estimate the proportions of healthy, attacked by bark beetle, and dead trees for each pixel. Experiments on the area of study in the Dolomites show that our method outperforms the use of original PRISMA spectral bands and of Sentinel-2 data. The results indicate that PRISMA hyperspectral data combined with few-shot learning offers significant advantages for forest health monitoring.

*Yifan Jiang,Yueying Wang,Rui Zhao,Toufiq Parag,Zhimin Chen,Zhenyu Liao,Jayakrishnan Unnikrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoP2R introduces a process-aware framework for video reasoning with a staged SFT-CoT dataset and a new RL objective, PA-GRPO, achieving state-of-the-art results on most video reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extending reinforcement fine-tuning to large video-language models is challenging due to the intertwined perception and reasoning processes. A decoupled, process-aware approach with a tailored CoT dataset and RL objective is proposed to improve video reasoning.

Method: SFT uses a three-step pipeline to generate VideoP2R-CoT-162K, a high-quality, process-aware chain-of-thought dataset distinguishing perception and reasoning. RL employs PA-GRPO, a policy optimization method that provides separate rewards for perception and reasoning.

Result: VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art performance on six of seven video reasoning/understanding benchmarks. Ablations confirm the value of process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO, and show that perception outputs are information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.

Conclusion: Process-aware modeling combined with PA-GRPO improves LVLM video reasoning, with a valuable CoT dataset and RL objective that decouples perception and reasoning; results suggest broad applicability to complex multi-step tasks involving perception.

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), a two-stage framework consisting of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promising results on improving reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs). Yet extending RFT to large video language models (LVLMs) remains challenging. We propose VideoP2R, a novel process-aware video RFT framework that enhances video reasoning by modeling perception and reasoning as distinct processes. In the SFT stage, we develop a three-step pipeline to generate VideoP2R-CoT-162K, a high-quality, process-aware chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for perception and reasoning. In the RL stage, we introduce a novel process-aware group relative policy optimization (PA-GRPO) algorithm that supplies separate rewards for perception and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on six out of seven video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO and demonstrate that model's perception output is information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.

*Redwan Hussain,Mizanur Rahman,Prithwiraj Bhattacharjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A literature review of AI-generated media detection across 24 studies finds generalization gaps and multimodal challenges; advocates multimodal deep learning for more robust detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rising ease of producing realistic synthetic media (GANs, diffusion models) threatens misinformation, privacy, and fraud; current detectors struggle to generalize across unseen data and varied content.

Method: Systematic review of 24 recent works; analyze contributions and weaknesses of each; synthesize common limitations and propose future directions.

Result: Identified persistent limitations: poor generalization to unseen data, cross-model content, multimodal data, and highly modified content; calls for a multimodal DL research direction to improve robustness.

Conclusion: Proposes a clear starting point for future work: develop robust, generalized detectors via multimodal deep learning to defend against harmful synthetic media.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in media has advanced rapidly over the last decade. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection. It offers future researchers a clear starting point for building stronger defenses against harmful synthetic media.

*Xinyue Zhang,Haolong Li,Jiawei Ma,Chen Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVGM is a novel model that generates vectorized Chinese glyphs by predicting the next stroke. It encodes strokes as discrete latent stroke embeddings and fine-tunes a DeepSeek LLM to predict the next embedding. With limited strokes, it can produce complete characters, words, and unseen verses in vector form. A large stroke-based SVG dataset (907,267 samples) is released. Results show data-scale–dependent performance and expert-validated vector glyphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable, flexible vectorized glyph generation for Chinese characters by leveraging token-sequence prediction capabilities of LLMs, modeling glyphs as sequences of strokes and using discrete stroke embeddings.

Method: Encode strokes into discrete latent variables called stroke embeddings. Fine-tune the DeepSeek LLM to predict the next stroke embedding, enabling vectorized glyph generation from partial stroke input. Train on a large stroke-based Chinese SVG dataset of 907,267 samples to demonstrate dynamic vectorized glyph generation.

Result: The model exhibits scaling behavior with data size. Generated vectorized glyphs are validated by experts and relevant individuals, capable of producing complete characters, semantically meaningful words, and unseen verses from limited stroke input.

Conclusion: LVGM demonstrates effective stroke-based vectorized glyph generation and scales with data; release of a large stroke-based SVG dataset supports dynamic vectorized glyph generation and further research in vectorized typography with LLMs.

Abstract: Vectorized glyphs are widely used in poster design, network animation, art display, and various other fields due to their scalability and flexibility. In typography, they are often seen as special sequences composed of ordered strokes. This concept extends to the token sequence prediction abilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling vectorized character generation through stroke modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel Large Vectorized Glyph Model (LVGM) designed to generate vectorized Chinese glyphs by predicting the next stroke. Initially, we encode strokes into discrete latent variables called stroke embeddings. Subsequently, we train our LVGM via fine-tuning DeepSeek LLM by predicting the next stroke embedding. With limited strokes given, it can generate complete characters, semantically elegant words, and even unseen verses in vectorized form. Moreover, we release a new large-scale Chinese SVG dataset containing 907,267 samples based on strokes for dynamically vectorized glyph generation. Experimental results show that our model has scaling behaviors on data scales. Our generated vectorized glyphs have been validated by experts and relevant individuals.

### [58] [Hindsight Distillation Reasoning with Knowledge Encouragement Preference for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11132)
*Yu Zhao,Ying Zhang,Xuhui Sui,Baohang Zhou,Li Shen,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HinD with KEPO elicits explicit, multi-step reasoning from a 7B MLLM for KBVQA via Hindsight-Zero data and self-distillation into CoT/Knowledge generators, improving OK-VQA and A-OKVQA without external APIs or knowledge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KBVQA requires external knowledge and interpretable reasoning. Existing methods rely on implicit reasoning in multimodal LLMs and retrieval-based approaches, but lack explicit, traceable multi-step reasoning trajectories. There is misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence in these systems.

Method: 1) Generate Hindsight-Zero training data by prompting a frozen 7B MLLM to produce reasoning between the question and the ground-truth answer. 2) Self-distill this data into a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and a Knowledge Generator to produce sequential reasoning steps and discrete facts. 3) Optimize the Knowledge Generator with Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO) to favor under-confident but helpful knowledge over over-confident unhelpful content. 4) Use the generated CoT and sampled knowledge for answer prediction in KBVQA.

Result: Empirical evaluation on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA shows HinD achieves superior performance using a 7B-size MLLM without external APIs or outside knowledge, demonstrating effective elicited reasoning and improved knowledge use.

Conclusion: HinD successfully elicits and harnesses explicit reasoning in MLLMs for KBVQA through Hindsight-Zero data and KEPO, enabling reliable, stepwise reasoning and better knowledge alignment, with strong results on standard benchmarks using modest-size models.

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA) necessitates external knowledge incorporation beyond cross-modal understanding. Existing KBVQA methods either utilize implicit knowledge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval augmented generation. However, their reasoning processes remain implicit, without explicit multi-step trajectories from MLLMs. To address this gap, we provide a Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD) framework with Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO), designed to elicit and harness internal knowledge reasoning ability in MLLMs. First, to tackle the reasoning supervision problem, we propose to emphasize the hindsight wisdom of MLLM by prompting a frozen 7B-size MLLM to complete the reasoning process between the question and its ground truth answer, constructing Hindsight-Zero training data. Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts. Secondly, to tackle the misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence, we optimize the Knowledge Generator with KEPO, preferring under-confident but helpful knowledge over the over-confident but unhelpful one. The generated CoT and sampled knowledge are then exploited for answer prediction. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA validate the effectiveness of HinD, showing that HinD with elicited reasoning from 7B-size MLLM achieves superior performance without commercial model APIs or outside knowledge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OT-ALD uses optimal-transport to map the source latent distribution to the target distribution in diffusion-based I2I translation, addressing latent distribution mismatch and speeding up sampling while preserving DDIB's cycle-consistent translation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome low translation efficiency and latent distribution mismatches in DDIB-style image-to-image translation, while maintaining cycle consistency and leveraging independently trained diffusion models.

Method: Compute an OT map from the source latent distribution to the target latent distribution and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion in the target domain, preserving DDIB’s framework and providing error analysis that shows elimination of latent distribution mismatch.

Result: Achieves 20.29% faster sampling and a 2.6-point average improvement in FID across four translation tasks on three high-resolution datasets compared to leading baselines.

Conclusion: OT-ALD offers a principled, efficient, and higher-quality DDIB-based I2I translation by aligning latent distributions with OT, balancing speed and image fidelity while retaining cycle-consistency and the advantages of dual diffusion setups.

Abstract: The Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridge (DDIB) is an emerging image-to-image (I2I) translation method that preserves cycle consistency while achieving strong flexibility. It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.

*Conghao Wong,Ziqian Zou,Beihao Xia,Xinge You*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Rev, a reverberation-transform-based trajectory predictor that models agent-specific latencies via two learnable kernels, achieving competitive accuracy and interpretable latency dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agents exhibit different latency preferences in noticing, processing and reacting to trajectory-changing events; ignoring latencies harms causal continuity and yields implausible trajectories.

Method: Novel reverberation transform with two explicit, learnable kernels to simulate and forecast per-agent latencies; integration into a trajectory prediction model; experiments on pedestrians and vehicles; qualitative analysis.

Result: Competitive accuracy across datasets; reveals interpretable latency dynamics; qualitative analyses validate properties; potential as a general latency modeling tool.

Conclusion: Reverberation transform provides a flexible, interpretable approach to incorporate latency effects in forecasting; applicable beyond the studied domains.

Abstract: Bridging the past to the future, connecting agents both spatially and temporally, lies at the core of the trajectory prediction task. Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, the temporal delays with which agents respond to different trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to any specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of the forecasting system and also lead to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by the reverberation curves in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which simulates and predicts different latency preferences of each agent as well as their stochasticity by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, allowing for the controllable trajectory prediction based on these forecasted latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios. Qualitative analyses further verify the properties of the proposed reverberation transform, highlighting its potential as a general latency modeling approach.

### [61] [Explainable Deep Convolutional Multi-Type Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11165)
*Alex George,Lyudmila Mihaylova,Sean Anderson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight, single-model framework (MultiTypeFCDD) enabling explainable multi-type anomaly detection by learning per-type heatmaps with image-level labels, across multiple object categories, achieving competitive accuracy with far fewer parameters and faster inference on Real-IAD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current explainable anomaly detection methods either identify anomalies without specifying type or rely on training and maintaining separate models per object category, which is costly. Large Vision-Language Models can address type differentiation but are computationally heavy, unsuitable for real-time or embedded systems. There is a gap for a lightweight, multi-type, cross-category solution.

Method: MultiTypeFCDD is a simple convolutional framework that learns multi-channel heatmaps, with each channel corresponding to a specific anomaly type. It uses only image-level labels and operates as a single unified model across multiple object categories, eliminating the need for separate models per category.

Result: On Real-IAD, the method yields results competitive with state-of-the-art complex models while drastically reducing parameter count and inference times, demonstrating practicality for resource-constrained real-world deployments.

Conclusion: Proposes a practical, lightweight, explainable multi-type anomaly detection approach that differentiates anomaly types across object categories within a single model, suitable for real-time/embedded applications and low-resource environments.

Abstract: Most explainable anomaly detection methods often identify anomalies but lack the capability to differentiate the type of anomaly. Furthermore, they often require the costly training and maintenance of separate models for each object category. The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., "Crack" vs. "Scratch") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category. We evaluated our proposed method on the Real-IAD dataset and it delivers results competitive with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times. This makes it a highly practical and viable solution for real-world applications where computational resources are tightly constrained.

Motivation: To overcome the lack of real-world data in adverse traffic scenarios for cooperative V2V perception, enabling robust development and benchmarking.

Method: Collect real-world data from two synchronized vehicles across 10 weather/lighting conditions and 10 locations, yielding 60k LiDAR frames (10 Hz), 1.26M multi-view camera images (30 Hz), and 750k RTK/GNSS/IMU records; provide time-consistent 3D bounding boxes and static scenes for 4D BEV; introduce a target-based temporal alignment method to align objects across sensor modalities.

Result: A large-scale, high-quality dataset designed for V2V cooperative perception in adverse conditions, enabling time-consistent fusion and serving as a benchmark resource for research in this area.

Conclusion: CATS-V2V is positioned to benefit the autonomous driving community by providing challenging, real-world data to advance robust cooperative perception under adverse traffic scenarios.

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception has great potential to enhance autonomous driving performance by overcoming perception limitations in complex adverse traffic scenarios (CATS). Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records. Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities. We hope that CATS-V2V, the largest-scale, most supportive, and highest-quality dataset of its kind to date, will benefit the autonomous driving community in related tasks.

Motivation: Calibration of AI confidences is crucial for high-stakes VQA applications, as state-of-the-art VLMs often produce overconfident answers under visual uncertainty, undermining reliability in autonomous decision-making.

Method: A two-stage, debate-based framework where diverse specialized VLMs (with different prompts) propose answers, followed by generalist agents critiquing, refining, and aggregating proposals. Introduces aligncal, a differentiable calibration-aware loss, to train agents to minimize an upper bound on calibration error.

Result: Empirical results on multiple VQA benchmarks show substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies and improved fidelity of individual confidence estimates, with more calibrated specialized agents delivering better-aligned confidences.

Conclusion: Debate-based collaboration among specialized VLMs, coupled with a calibration-aware training objective, improves the reliability of VQA confidence estimates, suggesting a viable path toward more trustworthy autonomous visual reasoning.

Abstract: In the context of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Agentic AI, calibration refers to how closely an AI system's confidence in its answers reflects their actual correctness. This aspect becomes especially important when such systems operate autonomously and must make decisions under visual uncertainty. While modern VQA systems, powered by advanced vision-language models (VLMs), are increasingly used in high-stakes domains like medical diagnostics and autonomous navigation due to their improved accuracy, the reliability of their confidence estimates remains under-examined. Particularly, these systems often produce overconfident responses. To address this, we introduce AlignVQA, a debate-based multi-agent framework, in which diverse specialized VLM -- each following distinct prompting strategies -- generate candidate answers and then engage in two-stage interaction: generalist agents critique, refine and aggregate these proposals. This debate process yields confidence estimates that more accurately reflect the model's true predictive performance. We find that more calibrated specialized agents produce better aligned confidences. Furthermore, we introduce a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss function called aligncal designed to fine-tune the specialized agents by minimizing an upper bound on the calibration error. This objective explicitly improves the fidelity of each agent's confidence estimates. Empirical results across multiple benchmark VQA datasets substantiate the efficacy of our approach, demonstrating substantial reductions in calibration discrepancies. Furthermore, we propose a novel differentiable calibration-aware loss to fine-tune the specialized agents and improve the quality of their individual confidence estimates based on minimising upper bound calibration error.

### [64] [Dynamic Gaussian Scene Reconstruction from Unsynchronized Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11175)
*Zhixin Xu,Hengyu Zhou,Yuan Liu,Wenhan Xue,Hao Pan,Wenping Wang,Bin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A coarse-to-fine temporal alignment module for 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) that handles unsynchronized multi-view videos, improving reconstruction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multi-view inputs are often temporally unsynchronized due to camera delays or independent recording setups, which degrades 4DGS reconstructions; robust alignment is needed.

Method: Introduce a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates per-camera time shifts: a coarse frame-level offset followed by sub-frame refinement, designed as an integrable component for existing 4DGS pipelines.

Result: The approach effectively handles temporally misaligned videos and significantly improves baseline 4DGS methods in reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: Temporal misalignment robustness can be achieved for 4DGS by the proposed per-camera time-shift alignment module, which is readily integrable into current frameworks.

Abstract: Multi-view video reconstruction plays a vital role in computer vision, enabling applications in film production, virtual reality, and motion analysis. While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data. Experiments show that our approach effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline methods.

*Quoc-Huy Trinh,Mustapha Abdullahi,Do Duy Hung Trinh,Bo Zhao,Debesh Jha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Viper-F1 uses a hybrid state-space vision-language model replacing cross-attention with Liquid State-Space Dynamics and a Token-Grid Correlation Module (FiLM-conditioned) to achieve accurate, fine-grained V-L understanding with linear-time inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based cross-attention in multimodal LLMs is computationally expensive and scales quadratically; small V-L models often lack precise fine-grained visual grounding needed for real-world tasks, motivating an efficient, better-grounded approach.

Method: Introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. Augment with a Token-Grid Correlation Module that computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning to emphasize regions relevant to the prompt, maintaining linear-time inference.

Result: Experimental results across multiple benchmarks show accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Viper-F1 demonstrates that a state-space, attention-free approach with token-grid grounding can deliver accurate, fine-grained vision-language understanding in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled impressive progress in vision-language understanding, yet their high computational cost limits deployment in resource-constrained scenarios such as robotic manipulation, personal assistants, and smart cameras. Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiT-Gaze: a diffusion-transformer-based framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection with weak supervision and an orthogonality constraint, achieving state-of-the-art perceptual quality and accuracy and reducing gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees; code will be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity gaze redirection is crucial for generating augmented data to improve gaze estimator generalization. Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting methods (e.g., GazeGaussian) struggle with subtle, continuous gaze shifts and disentangling gaze from head pose and expression.

Method: Combine Diffusion Transformer (DiT) for high-fidelity synthesis with weak supervision from synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles to create a smooth gaze-direction manifold, and impose an orthogonality constraint loss to disentangle internal representations of gaze, head pose, and expression.

Result: Sets a new state-of-the-art in perceptual quality and redirection accuracy; reduces the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees; demonstrates effectiveness for generating high-quality synthetic training data. Code and models will be released for benchmarking.

Conclusion: DiT-Gaze offers a superior approach for synthetic gaze data generation, improving generalization of gaze estimators; supports community benchmarking through released code/models.

Abstract: High-fidelity gaze redirection is critical for generating augmented data to improve the generalization of gaze estimators. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models like GazeGaussian represent the state-of-the-art but can struggle with rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts. In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data. Our code and models will be made available for the research community to benchmark against.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A transfer-learning ConvGRU framework using a single infrared channel to predict rainfall up to four hours ahead with a two-stage training strategy and an empirical rooftop (nonlinear) mapping to rainfall rates; achieved 2nd place in the cumulative rainfall task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of short-term rainfall prediction with limited input data (one SEVIRI IR channel) by leveraging spatiotemporal modeling (ConvGRU) and transfer learning to capture relevant brightness-temperature patterns and convert them into rainfall estimates.

Method: Two-stage training: (1) train ConvGRU to forecast SEVIRI brightness temperatures over four hourly observations to learn spatiotemporal patterns; (2) apply an empirically derived nonlinear transformation to map predicted brightness temperatures to OPERA-compatible rainfall rates. For event prediction, apply 3D event detection followed by spatiotemporal feature extraction on the transformed rainfall forecasts.

Result: Achieved 2nd place in the cumulative rainfall task. Using the same model out-of-the-box for event prediction yielded similar scores to a baseline model.

Conclusion: The ConvGRU-based transfer-learning framework can effectively predict short-term rainfall from a single infrared channel when coupled with a two-stage training pipeline and an empirical transformation, delivering competitive performance on both rainfall accumulation and event-based tasks.

Abstract: This study presents a transfer-learning framework based on Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (ConvGRU) for short-term rainfall prediction in the Weather4Cast 2025 competition. A single SEVIRI infrared channel (10.8 μm wavelength) is used as input, which consists of four observations over a one-hour period. A two-stage training strategy is applied to generate rainfall estimates up to four hours ahead. In the first stage, ConvGRU is trained to forecast the brightness temperatures from SEVIRI, enabling the model to capture relevant spatiotemporal patterns. In the second stage, an empirically derived nonlinear transformation maps the predicted fields to OPERA-compatible rainfall rates.
  For the event-prediction task, the transformed rainfall forecasts are processed using 3D event detection followed by spatiotemporal feature extraction to identify and characterize precipitation events. Our submission achieved 2nd place in the cumulative rainfall task. Further, the same model was used out-of-the-box for the event prediction task, and resulted in similar scores as the baseline model to the competition.

Method: A VQA framework that combines chain-of-thought reasoning with Direct Preference Optimization, generating intermediate rationales to guide steps in tasks like detection, classification, spatial relations, and comparative analysis; evaluates improvements in interpretability, robustness, and accuracy on multispectralEarth observation data.

Result: CoT supervision improves accuracy by 34.9% over direct baselines; DPO provides additional gains in accuracy and reasoning quality; the system advances VQA for multispectral Earth observation for climate use cases.

Conclusion: This approach advances VQA for remote sensing by enabling richer geospatial reasoning and more effective climate-related decision support.

Abstract: Geospatial chain of thought (CoT) reasoning is essential for advancing Visual Question Answering (VQA) on satellite imagery, particularly in climate related applications such as disaster monitoring, infrastructure risk assessment, urban resilience planning, and policy support. Existing VQA models enable scalable interpretation of remote sensing data but often lack the structured reasoning required for complex geospatial queries. We propose a VQA framework that integrates CoT reasoning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve interpretability, robustness, and accuracy. By generating intermediate rationales, the model better handles tasks involving detection, classification, spatial relations, and comparative analysis, which are critical for reliable decision support in high stakes climate domains. Experiments show that CoT supervision improves accuracy by 34.9\% over direct baselines, while DPO yields additional gains in accuracy and reasoning quality. The resulting system advances VQA for multispectral Earth observation by enabling richer geospatial reasoning and more effective climate use cases.

### [70] [Questioning the Stability of Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11206)
*Amir Rosenfeld,Neta Glazer,Ethan Fetaya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs are fragile to benign, semantics-preserving perturbations; stability correlates with correctness and can predict larger models' performance; robustness evaluations should emphasize invariances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify how reliable Visual Language Models are when faced with small, meaning-preserving changes to either text or image inputs, beyond traditional adversarial settings.

Method: Conduct a large-scale empirical study across diverse models and datasets. Apply benign perturbations such as pixel-level shifts, light geometric transforms, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that preserve semantics. Measure how often the VLMs change their answers, analyze by perturbation type, question category, and model, and examine the relationship between sample stability and correctness. Use open-source, small models to predict the correctness of larger closed-models.

Result: A substantial fraction of samples change answers under minor perturbations; even top models (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) fail under shifts of a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. Stable samples are much more likely to be answered correctly. Stability patterns in small open-source models can predict the correctness of larger closed models with high precision.

Conclusion: There is a fundamental fragility in current VLMs; robustness evaluations should expand beyond adversarial perturbations and focus on invariances that models should reliably uphold. Leveraging stability signals from small models offers a practical way to anticipate large-model behavior.

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their reliability under small, meaning-preserving input changes remains poorly understood. We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision. Our findings expose a fundamental fragility in current VLMs and highlight the need for robustness evaluations that go beyond adversarial perturbations, focusing instead on invariances that models should reliably uphold.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces the Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset and a Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that leverages social context to detect a child's gaze target in real-world scenes, addressing class imbalance and achieving state-of-the-art results, especially for face-directed gaze.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaze target detection in autistic children is vital for automating assessment of joint attention, a core ASD challenge, and there is a need for real-world datasets and methods that handle underrepresented face-directed gaze.

Method: Proposes SACF, a two-pathway architecture with experts for social and non-social gaze guided by a context-awareness gate. It explicitly uses scene social context to mitigate class imbalance and predicts gaze targets from activity images. Introduces the AGT dataset for real-world autism gaze targets.

Result: The framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance on gaze target detection in autistic children, with significant improvements on the minority class of face-directed gaze compared with existing methods.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates the feasibility of automated gaze-target detection in autism using socially aware architectures and provides a valuable dataset (AGT) to advance research in joint attention measurement and autism assessment.

Abstract: The automatic detection of gaze targets in autistic children through artificial intelligence can be impactful, especially for those who lack access to a sufficient number of professionals to improve their quality of life. This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses a gap in 3D backdoor research, shifting from one-to-one backdoors to multi-target threats in 3D point clouds, a critical risk for safety-sensitive applications like autonomous driving and robotics.

Method: Proposes a configurable spherical trigger whose spatial parameters encode multiple targets; develops a theoretical foundation proving that distinct trigger configurations can induce different target labels; validates the approach across multiple datasets and model architectures with a focus on attack success rate and clean-data accuracy.

Result: Demonstrates high attack success rates (up to 100%) while preserving model accuracy on clean data; provides systematic empirical validation across datasets and architectures, confirming the feasibility of one-to-N backdoors in 3D vision.

Conclusion: Establishes a new benchmark for multi-target backdoor threats in 3D vision, highlighting the need for defenses against configurable spherical triggers and laying groundwork for securing future 3D-driven systems.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a critical threat to deep learning systems, particularly in safety-sensitive 3D domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing backdoor attacks for 3D point clouds have been limited to a rigid one-to-one paradigm. To address this, we present the first one-to-N backdoor framework for 3D vision, based on a novel, configurable spherical trigger. Our key insight is to leverage the spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space, allowing a single trigger design to encode multiple target classes. We establish a theoretical foundation for one-to-N backdoor attacks in 3D, demonstrating that poisoned models can map distinct trigger configurations to different target labels. Experimental results systematically validate this conclusion across multiple datasets and model architectures, achieving high attack success rates (up to 100\%) while maintaining accuracy on clean data. This work establishes a crucial benchmark for multi-target threats in 3D vision and provides the foundational understanding needed to secure future 3D-driven intelligent systems.

*Ruoqi Wang,Haitao Wang,Shaojie Guo,Qiong Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D-GAP is a gradient-guided, dataset-agnostic augmentation method operating in both frequency (amplitude) and pixel spaces to improve OOD robustness, by shaping frequency sensitivity via task-gradients and blending pixel details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD robustness is hard due to background/style/instrument shifts; generic augmentations are inconsistent, dataset-specific approaches require expertise; networks bias toward domain-specific frequency components; naive frequency perturbation can hurt pixel-level details.

Method: Compute frequency-space sensitivity maps from task gradients, use these maps to adaptively interpolate amplitude between source and target samples; apply a complementary pixel-space blending to recover spatial details; dataset-agnostic and designed to beat both generic and dataset-specific augmentations across multiple datasets.

Result: Empirical evaluation on four real-world datasets and three domain-adaptation benchmarks shows consistent gains, with average OOD improvement of +5.3% on real-world datasets and +1.8% on benchmark datasets, outperforming both generic and dataset-specific augmentations.

Conclusion: D-GAP effectively reduces learning bias in frequency space while preserving spatial details, offering a robust, dataset-agnostic augmentation strategy that enhances OOD robustness across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Out-of-domain (OOD) robustness is challenging to achieve in real-world computer vision applications, where shifts in image background, style, and acquisition instruments always degrade model performance. Generic augmentations show inconsistent gains under such shifts, whereas dataset-specific augmentations require expert knowledge and prior analysis. Moreover, prior studies show that neural networks adapt poorly to domain shifts because they exhibit a learning bias to domain-specific frequency components. Perturbing frequency values can mitigate such bias but overlooks pixel-level details, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these problems, we propose D-GAP (Dataset-agnostic and Gradient-guided augmentation in Amplitude and Pixel spaces), improving OOD robustness by introducing targeted augmentation in both the amplitude space (frequency space) and pixel space. Unlike conventional handcrafted augmentations, D-GAP computes sensitivity maps in the frequency space from task gradients, which reflect how strongly the model responds to different frequency components, and uses the maps to adaptively interpolate amplitudes between source and target samples. This way, D-GAP reduces the learning bias in frequency space, while a complementary pixel-space blending procedure restores fine spatial details. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and three domain-adaptation benchmarks show that D-GAP consistently outperforms both generic and dataset-specific augmentations, improving average OOD performance by +5.3% on real-world datasets and +1.8% on benchmark datasets.

*Mohammad Areeb Qazi,Munachiso S Nwadike,Ibrahim Almakky,Mohammad Yaqub,Numan Saeed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A modular, multitask and multimodal adaptation framework (MAFM^3) enables a single medical foundation model to expand to new tasks (prognosis, segmentation) and modalities (CT, PET) via lightweight, task-specific modules, improving performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging data is scarce, making domain-, modality-, and task-specific pre-training impractical. A unified, modular adaptation strategy can reuse a foundation model for diverse objectives without training separate models.

Method: Introduce MAFM^3, a modular adaptation framework that attaches lightweight skill modules to a chest CT foundation model. Modules activate based on input type or clinical objective. Extended by incorporating PET data to assess multitask and multimodal capabilities. Demonstrate prognosis and segmentation improvements (Dice score) over baselines.

Result: Prognosis and segmentation modules built atop a CT classifier improve performance on both tasks. Incorporating PET scans yields a 5% Dice score improvement versus baselines.

Conclusion: Modular components enable foundation models to evolve beyond their initial training scope, supporting multitask and multimodality medical imaging with efficient adaptation and potential clinical impact.

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

*Ruocheng Wu,Haolan He,Yufei Wang,Zhihao Li,Bihan Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to inject multi-view priors from pretrained video diffusion models into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), using depth warp and semantic guidance to align score updates with correct geometry and camera poses, improving performance on sparse-view datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting can overfit when training views are sparse due to lack of intermediate-view supervision; the authors seek to leverage rich priors from Video Diffusion Models to provide multi-view consistency.

Method: Introduce GSD, extending Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) to supervise rendered neighboring views with VDM priors. Address generative direction issues (motion and random camera trajectories) by a unified guidance that combines (1) depth warp guidance using real depth maps and (2) semantic-feature guidance to steer VDM score updates toward correct camera pose and geometry.

Result: Empirical results show the method outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: GSD successfully leverages VDM priors to improve sparse-view 3DGS by stabilizing guidance with depth and semantic information, delivering better multi-view consistency and rendering quality.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained great attention in the 3D scene representation for its high-quality real-time rendering capabilities. However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AUVIC is a perturbation-based visual concept unlearning method for multimodal LLMs, achieving targeted forgetting with minimal collateral damage, evaluated on VCUBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing datasets for multimodal LLMs raise privacy and copyright concerns; regulatory pressures like the right to be forgotten drive the need for unlearning. Visual concept unlearning in MLLMs is underexplored and difficult, as removing a target concept risks harming related entities.

Method: AUVIC employs adversarial perturbations to induce precise forgetting of a target visual concept, isolating it from the model's learned representations while preserving performance on non-target concepts.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates with minimal degradation to non-target concepts, as demonstrated on the VCUBench benchmark.

Conclusion: AUVIC advances visual concept unlearning in multimodal LLMs and introduces VCUBench for evaluation, showing that targeted forgetting can be achieved with limited collateral impact.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve impressive performance once optimized on massive datasets. Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. To evaluate our method, we construct VCUBench. It is the first benchmark designed to assess visual concept unlearning in group contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates while incurs minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.

### [77] [Positional Bias in Multimodal Embedding Models: Do They Favor the Beginning, the Middle, or the End?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11216)
*Kebin Wu,Fatima Albreiki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Positional bias is prevalent in multimodal representation models, with modality-specific patterns (text biased to the start; image biased to both ends) driven by positional encodings, loss, context importance, and multimodal training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the study of positional bias from text generation to multimodal representation models, and to understand its prevalence, modalities, and drivers in image-text retrieval.

Method: Empirical analysis across multiple multimodal models and datasets. Distinguish context importance from positional bias, compare text and image encoders, and examine how positional encoding, loss function, context importance, and usage of image-text pairs contribute to observed biases.

Result: Bias is prevalent in multimodal models. Text encoders tend to bias toward the beginning of input, while image encoders show bias at both the start and end. The bias likely stems from a combination of positional encoding schemes, training losses, context importance, and the multimodal pairing setup during training.

Conclusion: Positional bias in multimodal representations matters and varies by modality; understanding its sources can guide debiasing and model design to improve retrieval performance.

Abstract: Positional bias - where models overemphasize certain positions regardless of content - has been shown to negatively impact model performance across various tasks. While recent research has extensively examined positional bias in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models remain underexplored. Even less is known about such biases in multimodal models. In this work, we investigate positional bias in multimodal representation models, specifically in the context of image-text retrieval. We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end. Furthermore, we find that this bias arises from, or is amplified by, a combination of factors, including the positional encoding scheme, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.

### [78] [The Persistence of Cultural Memory: Investigating Multimodal Iconicity in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11435)
*Maria-Teresa De Rosa Palmini,Eva Cetinic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces and evaluates a framework to separate recognition (identifying cultural references) from realization (depicting/reinterpreting them) in text-to-image diffusion, using multimodal iconicity across 767 Wikidata-derived references to show how models memorize, transform, and contextualize culture beyond simple image-text similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in diffusion models by distinguishing whether models recognize references and how they visually realize them, thereby advancing evaluation beyond replication to contextual transformation.

Method: Proposes an evaluation framework that splits recognition and realization into separate metrics. Evaluates five diffusion models on 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery. Performs linguistic sensitivity tests via prompt perturbations (synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions). Analyzes correlations with training data frequency, textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date.

Result: The framework more effectively distinguishes replication from transformation than existing similarity-based methods. Models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Cultural alignment correlates with data frequency, textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date.

Conclusion: Diffusion models are valuable not only for reproducing content but for how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge. The work pushes evaluation toward richer contextual understanding beyond simple text-image matching.

Abstract: Our work addresses the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on a specific case we term multimodal iconicity. This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.

### [79] [DoReMi: A Domain-Representation Mixture Framework for Generalizable 3D Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11232)
*Mingwei Xing,Xinliang Wang,Yifeng Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes DoReMi, a Domain-Representation Mixture of Experts for 3D point clouds that combines domain-aware experts with a unified representation, achieving strong cross-domain generalization and competitive results on ScanNet and S3DIS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalization across heterogeneous multi-source 3D data is limited by dataset scale and sensor-induced discrepancies, causing negative transfer when fusing domains.

Method: Mixture-of-Experts with Domain-Guided Spatial Routing to activate domain-aware experts; Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation for stable expert usage; a frozen, pretrained unified representation branch from self-supervised multi-attribute learning.

Result: Achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% on S3DIS, competitive or superior vs. existing methods.

Conclusion: DoReMi provides a promising foundation for cross-domain 3D understanding by leveraging synergy between domain-specific and general representations, with a reusable framework and upcoming open-source code.

Abstract: The generalization of 3D deep learning across multiple domains remains limited by the limited scale of existing datasets and the high heterogeneity of multi-source point clouds. Point clouds collected from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR scans and mesh-derived point clouds) exhibit substantial discrepancies in density and noise distribution, resulting in negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency. We evaluate DoReMi across multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. Notably, DoReMi achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches, and showing strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research. The code will be released soon.

*Cong Cao,Yujie Xu,Xiaodong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A few-shot style editing framework using a parameter-efficient MoE LoRA with style-specific and style-shared routing for multi-style adaptation, automatic rank selection, and optimal LoRA insertion in DiT diffusion models, guided by adversarial learning and flow matching; achieves SOTA with far fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General image editing models struggle to adapt to new styles with limited paired data and require efficient, multi-style fine-tuning.

Method: 1) Build a five-style benchmark. 2) Propose parameter-efficient multi-style MoE LoRA with style-specific and style-shared routing to jointly fine-tune multiple styles. 3) Introduce metric-guided automatic rank determination to estimate the importance of single-rank components and set layer-specific ranks. 4) Investigate optimal LoRA insertion location in the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model. 5) Integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide diffusion training.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while using significantly fewer LoRA parameters.

Conclusion: A multi-style, few-shot editing framework with MoE LoRA routing and automatic rank control efficiently adapts diffusion-based editors to multiple styles, reducing parameter overhead and interference between styles.

Abstract: In recent years, image editing has garnered growing attention. However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.

### [81] [Benchmarking Visual LLMs Resilience to Unanswerable Questions on Visually Rich Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11468)
*Davide Napolitano,Luca Cagliero,Fabrizio Battiloro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new benchmark, VRD-UQA, tests Visual LLMs on their ability to detect plausible but unanswerable questions in multi-page Visual Rich Documents by corrupting questions and validating unanswerability, evaluated across 12 models and multiple corruption/knowledge-injection settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLLMs excel at VQA on VRDs but may be brittle when questions are plausible yet unanswerable. There is a need to systematically evaluate and improve their ability to detect unanswerable queries in VRDs across varied corruption types and knowledge sources.

Method: Automatically corrupt questions by substituting NLP entities with same-type alternatives from different document elements/pages. Use a VLLM-as-a-judge to verify unanswerability. Evaluate 12 VLLMs on page- and document-level unanswerability detection. Analyze the impact of corruption types (NLP entity, document element, layout) and compare knowledge-injection strategies via in-context learning (OCR, multi-page selection, or explicit unanswerability).

Result: Demonstrates VLLMs' current limitations in reliably detecting unanswerable questions in VRDs and highlights how different corruption types and knowledge-injection strategies influence performance. VRD-UQA is proposed as a practical evaluation framework to drive the development of more resilient document VQA systems.

Conclusion: VRD-UQA provides a rigorous, multi-dimensional benchmark to stress-test VLLMs on unanswerable questions in Visually Rich Documents, guiding future research toward robust VQA systems that can recognize and handle unanswerable queries.

Abstract: The evolution of Visual Large Language Models (VLLMs) has revolutionized the automatic understanding of Visually Rich Documents (VRDs), which contain both textual and visual elements. Although VLLMs excel in Visual Question Answering (VQA) on multi-page VRDs, their ability to detect unanswerable questions is still an open research question. Our research delves into the robustness of the VLLMs to plausible yet unanswerable questions, i.e., questions that appear valid but cannot be answered due to subtle corruptions caused by swaps between related concepts or plausible question formulations. Corruptions are generated by replacing the original natural language entities with other ones of the same type, belonging to different document elements, and in different layout positions or pages of the related document. To this end, we present VRD-UQA (VISUALLY RICH DOCUMENT UNANSWERABLE QUESTION ANSWERING), a benchmark for evaluating VLLMs' resilience to plausible yet unanswerable questions across multiple dimensions. It automatically alters the questions of existing VQA datasets consisting of multi-page VRDs, verifies their unanswerability using a VLLM-as-a-judge approach, and then thoroughly evaluates VLLMs' performance. Experiments, run on 12 models, analyze: (1) The VLLMs' accuracy in detecting unanswerable questions at both page and document levels; (2) The effect of different types of corruption (NLP entity, document element, layout); (3) The effectiveness of different knowledge injection strategies based on in-context learning (OCR, multi-page selection, or the possibility of unanswerability). Our findings reveal VLLMs' limitations and demonstrate that VRD-UQA can serve as an evaluation framework for developing resilient document VQA systems.

### [82] [Beyond Flatlands: Unlocking Spatial Intelligence by Decoupling 3D Reasoning from Numerical Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11239)
*Zhongbin Guo,Jiahe Liu,Yushan Li,Wenyu Gao,Zhen Yang,Chenzhi Li,Xinyue Zhang,Ping Jian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GEODE decouples 3D reasoning from numeric generation via DRM and DRH, enabling a small 1.5B VLM to achieve state-of-the-art spatial reasoning rivaling much larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Models anchored in 2D perception struggle with real-world 3D spatial tasks due to input bottlenecks (expensive geometric encoders vs 2D features) and output bottlenecks (inadequate continuous value outputs). There is a need to integrate explicit 3D reasoning with precise numeric outputs without bloating model size.

Method: Introduce GEODE with two plug-and-play modules: 1) Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) as a spatial co-processor that aligns explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distills spatial Chain-of-Thought into injectable Rationale Tokens; 2) Direct Regression Head (DRH), an Embedding-as-Value approach that routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP to perform precise regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes. The two modules decouple 3D reasoning from numerical generation while remaining integrated with the base VLM.

Result: The 1.5B parameter GEODE model achieves state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance, rivaling models with 7B+ parameters.

Conclusion: Decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical output and adding modular DRM/DRH components yields efficient, high-precision 3D spatial understanding in compact VLMs, enabling high-level semantic dispatch across tasks.

Abstract: Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) architecturally rooted in "flatland" perception, fundamentally struggle to comprehend real-world 3D spatial intelligence. This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an "Embedding-as-Value" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes. The synergy of these modules allows our 1.5B parameter model to function as a high-level semantic dispatcher, achieving state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance that rivals 7B+ models.

*Kaishen Wang,Ruibo Chen,Tong Zheng,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImAgent: a training-free, unified multimodal agent for text-to-image generation that combines reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation under a policy-guided controller to improve fidelity and semantic alignment at test time without extra modules or external models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models still suffer from randomness and misalignment with vague prompts, and existing remedies (prompt rewriting, best-of-N, self-refinement) add overhead and require separate components, hindering efficient test-time scaling.

Method: Introduce ImAgent, a training-free unified multimodal agent that integrates reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation. A policy controller guides multiple generation actions that interact and self-organize to improve image fidelity and semantic alignment, without relying on external models.

Result: Extensive experiments on image generation and editing tasks show ImAgent consistently improves over the backbone and can surpass strong baselines where the backbone fails, demonstrating adaptive, efficient test-time scaling for image generation.

Conclusion: Unified multimodal agents offer a promising direction for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling. ImAgent demonstrates the potential of a training-free, self-organizing agent to enhance fidelity and semantic alignment without additional modules.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating visually realistic and semantically coherent images. However, they still suffer from randomness and inconsistency with the given prompts, particularly when textual descriptions are vague or underspecified. Existing approaches, such as prompt rewriting, best-of-N sampling, and self-refinement, can mitigate these issues but usually require additional modules and operate independently, hindering test-time scaling efficiency and increasing computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce ImAgent, a training-free unified multimodal agent that integrates reasoning, generation, and self-evaluation within a single framework for efficient test-time scaling. Guided by a policy controller, multiple generation actions dynamically interact and self-organize to enhance image fidelity and semantic alignment without relying on external models. Extensive experiments on image generation and editing tasks demonstrate that ImAgent consistently improves over the backbone and even surpasses other strong baselines where the backbone model fails, highlighting the potential of unified multimodal agents for adaptive and efficient image generation under test-time scaling.

### [84] [Arcee: Differentiable Recurrent State Chain for Generative Vision Modeling with Mamba SSMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11243)
*Jitesh Chavan,Rohit Lal,Anand Kamat,Mengjia Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Arcee introduces a cross-block recurrent state chain for Mamba-style state-space models to preserve cross-block memory across blocks. It uses a differentiable boundary handoff (Jacobian) to enable end-to-end gradient flow, is compatible with prior vision-Mamba variants, and claims large, cost-free gains (FID drop) on CelebA-HQ with Flow Matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional selective-scan in Mamba reinitializes block states to zero, discarding terminal block information and hindering cross-block memory. A cross-block mechanism could improve long-context modeling for vision tasks without increasing compute per step.

Method: Propose Arcee, a cross-block recurrent state chain that reuses each block's terminal state-space representation as the initial condition for the next block. Introduce a differentiable boundary map (handoff) with a Jacobian to carry gradients across block boundaries. Maintain compatibility with prior vision-Mamba variants, claim parameter-free, constant cost. Conceptualize terminal SSR as a directional prior from a causal pass, not a direct estimator. Provide or plan to provide CUDA kernels and training code.

Result: Empirically, Arcee reduces FID on unconditional CelebA-HQ (256x256) with Flow Matching from 82.81 to 15.33 (5.4x improvement) compared to a single-scan Zigzag Mamba baseline.

Conclusion: Arcee offers a practical, cross-block memory mechanism that preserves end-to-end gradient flow with negligible cost and broad compatibility, suggesting a promising direction for improving long-context vision models. The reported FID gains indicate substantial practical impact, though broader validation would bolster confidence.

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), Mamba in particular, are increasingly adopted for long-context sequence modeling, providing linear-time aggregation via an input-dependent, causal selective-scan operation. Along this line, recent "Mamba-for-vision" variants largely explore multiple scan orders to relax strict causality for non-sequential signals (e.g., images). Rather than preserving cross-block memory, the conventional formulation of the selective-scan operation in Mamba reinitializes each block's state-space dynamics from zero, discarding the terminal state-space representation (SSR) from the previous block. Arcee, a cross-block recurrent state chain, reuses each block's terminal state-space representation as the initial condition for the next block. Handoff across blocks is constructed as a differentiable boundary map whose Jacobian enables end-to-end gradient flow across terminal boundaries. Key to practicality, Arcee is compatible with all prior "vision-mamba" variants, parameter-free, and incurs constant, negligible cost. As a modeling perspective, we view terminal SSR as a mild directional prior induced by a causal pass over the input, rather than an estimator of the non-sequential signal itself. To quantify the impact, for unconditional generation on CelebA-HQ (256$\times$256) with Flow Matching, Arcee reduces FID$\downarrow$ from $82.81$ to $15.33$ ($5.4\times$ lower) on a single scan-order Zigzag Mamba baseline. Efficient CUDA kernels and training code will be released to support rigorous and reproducible research.

### [85] [PAS : Prelim Attention Score for Detecting Object Hallucinations in Large Vision--Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11502)
*Nhat Hoang-Xuan,Minh Vu,My T. Thai,Manish Bhattarai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prelim Attention Score (PAS) detects object hallucination in LVLMs by measuring attention to prelim tokens; it's training-free and real-time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object hallucination in LVLMs often stems from the model relying on previously generated prelim tokens rather than the image; there is a need for a lightweight, inference-only signal to detect and mitigate this behavior.

Method: Introduce PAS by analyzing attention weights over prelim tokens to produce a score during inference without extra forward passes. Complement this with a mutual information analysis showing that weak image dependence (given prelim) predicts hallucination. No additional training or data required.

Result: PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple LVLMs and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention during inference.

Conclusion: PAS provides a practical, training-free signal for detecting and potentially mitigating object hallucinations in LVLMs, with low overhead and broad applicability across models and data.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are powerful, yet they remain unreliable due to object hallucinations. In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens. PAS requires no additional forward passes and can be computed on the fly during inference. Exploiting this previously overlooked signal, PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.

### [86] [CountSteer: Steering Attention for Object Counting in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11253)
*Hyemin Boo,Hyoryung Kim,Myungjin Lee,Seunghyeon Lee,Jiyoung Lee,Jang-Hwan Choi,Hyunsoo Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free method, CountSteer, steers cross-attention in text-to-image diffusion to better follow specified object counts, improving accuracy by ~4% without hurting image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image models often fail to adhere to numerical constraints in text. Despite this, they show implicit sensitivity to counting accuracy, indicating a latent notion of numerical correctness. Harnessing this could make generation more controllable and semantically reliable.

Method: During inference, CountSteer steers the model's cross-attention hidden states to align outputs with the target object count. This training-free, lightweight adjustment guides the generation process toward the specified counts without retraining the model.

Result: Object-count accuracy improved by about 4% with CountSteer, while preserving visual quality (no noticeable degradation in image quality).

Conclusion: CountSteer demonstrates a simple, effective approach to improve numerical controllability in diffusion-based text-to-image generation, enabling more reliable adherence to numerical instructions without additional training.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate realistic and coherent images but often fail to follow numerical instructions in text, revealing a gap between language and visual representation. Interestingly, we found that these models are not entirely blind to numbers-they are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy, as their internal signals shift in consistent ways depending on whether the output meets the specified count. This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference. In our experiments, CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality, demonstrating a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation.

### [87] [Discovering Meaningful Units with Visually Grounded Semantics from Image Captions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11262)
*Melika Behjati,James Henderson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Group caption tokens to form fine-grained, object-level language representations that align with object-level image encodings, yielding better vision-language grounding and token groups that resemble groundable phrases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VL models mostly align image patches to language tokens; patches are meaningless on their own, and single tokens may lack grounded information. Grouping tokens aims to capture meaningful, object-level semantics and improve grounding.

Method: Introduce a token-grouping mechanism within the VL model; train to align groups with outputs of an image encoder trained to discover objects; end-to-end objective with grouping module; evaluate whether learned groups align with groundable phrases, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Result: Token groups discovered by the model align closely with groundable phrases; improved fine-grained understanding of vision and language; qualitative and quantitative evidence of grounding.

Conclusion: Grouping caption tokens to form language representations yields finer-grained, object-level grounding in VL models and produces token groups that reflect groundable phrases, supporting more interpretable and grounded V-L understanding.

Abstract: Fine-grained knowledge is crucial for vision-language models to obtain a better understanding of the real world. While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language. In addition, the token groups that our model discovers are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

*Fabian Schmidt,Markus Enzweiler,Abhinav Valada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Conditioning language-based driving models on scene graphs improves relational reasoning and driving performance; a model-agnostic, prompt-based method shows gains on LangAuto.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language driving models lack explicit supervision for relational dependencies among agents and traffic entities; explicit relational structure is needed to better infer how entities influence one another from sensor data.

Method: Introduce a model-agnostic approach that conditions language-based driving models on structured traffic scene graphs, serialized at multiple abstraction levels/formats, integrated via structured prompt templates to study when relational supervision helps; evaluate on LangAuto; release code, fine-tuned models, and a scene graph dataset.

Result: Scene graph conditioning yields large, persistent improvements on LangAuto: up to 15.6% driving score gain for LMDrive and 17.5% for BEVDriver; benefits persist even without scene graph input at test time; demonstrates better grounding of relational priors.

Conclusion: Relational supervision via scene graph conditioning is effective and model-agnostic, enabling existing driving-LMs to better reason about interactions; supports broad utility and warrants further exploration and release of resources.

Abstract: Vision-language models have recently emerged as promising planners for autonomous driving, where success hinges on topology-aware reasoning over spatial structure and dynamic interactions from multimodal input. However, existing models are typically trained without supervision that explicitly encodes these relational dependencies, limiting their ability to infer how agents and other traffic entities influence one another from raw sensor data. In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs. We serialize scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporate them into the models via structured prompt templates, enabling a systematic analysis of when and how relational supervision is most beneficial. Extensive evaluations on the public LangAuto benchmark show that scene graph conditioning of state-of-the-art approaches yields large and persistent improvement in driving performance. Notably, we observe up to a 15.6\% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5\% for BEVDriver, indicating that models can better internalize and ground relational priors through scene graph-conditioned training, even without requiring scene graph input at test-time. Code, fine-tuned models, and our scene graph dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/iis-esslingen/GraphPilot.

### [89] [Φeat: Physically-Grounded Feature Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11270)
*Giuseppe Vecchio,Adrien Kaiser,Rouffet Romain,Rosalie Martin,Elena Garces,Tamy Boubekeur*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised, physically-grounded visual backbone Φeat learns material-aware representations by contrasting spatial crops with physical augmentations across shape and lighting, enabling physics-aware perception without labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current self-supervised features entangle high-level semantics with low-level physical factors (geometry, illumination), hindering explicit physical reasoning; a representation sensitive to material identity and reflectance/mesostructure is desirable for physics-aware vision.

Method: Pretraining strategy that contrasts spatial crops and physical augmentations of the same material under varying shapes and lighting conditions, all in a self-supervised setting without explicit labels.

Result: Φeat captures physically-grounded structure beyond semantic grouping; representations show robustness to external physical factors and improve material-related tasks (e.g., material identity, reflectance cues) as evidenced by feature similarity analysis and material selection.

Conclusion: Unsupervised physical feature learning is a promising foundation for physics-aware perception in vision and graphics and can support tasks requiring material and light-informed reasoning without labeled data.

Abstract: Foundation models have emerged as effective backbones for many vision tasks. However, current self-supervised features entangle high-level semantics with low-level physical factors, such as geometry and illumination, hindering their use in tasks requiring explicit physical reasoning. In this paper, we introduce $Φ$eat, a novel physically-grounded visual backbone that encourages a representation sensitive to material identity, including reflectance cues and geometric mesostructure. Our key idea is to employ a pretraining strategy that contrasts spatial crops and physical augmentations of the same material under varying shapes and lighting conditions. While similar data have been used in high-end supervised tasks such as intrinsic decomposition or material estimation, we demonstrate that a pure self-supervised training strategy, without explicit labels, already provides a strong prior for tasks requiring robust features invariant to external physical factors. We evaluate the learned representations through feature similarity analysis and material selection, showing that $Φ$eat captures physically-grounded structure beyond semantic grouping. These findings highlight the promise of unsupervised physical feature learning as a foundation for physics-aware perception in vision and graphics.

### [90] [Coordinative Learning with Ordinal and Relational Priors for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11276)
*Haoyi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CORAL introduces coordinative learning for volumetric segmentation by combining contrastive ranking over slice similarities with an ordinal objective for global anatomical progression, enabling better representations under limited annotations and improving segmentation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional methods rely on hard positive/negative thresholds, discarding continuous anatomical similarity, and ignore global directional anatomy, leading to distorted feature spaces; there is a need to leverage continuous inter-slice similarity and cross-patient anatomical progression for robust representations under limited labels.

Method: Propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL). Use a contrastive ranking objective to reflect continuous anatomical similarity between slices, ensuring feature distances scale with anatomical position differences. Add an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency with canonical anatomical progression across patients. Learn inter-slice relational representations to support downstream segmentation.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings; learns anatomically informed representations with meaningful structure; code released at provided URL.

Conclusion: CORAL successfully captures both local and global anatomical structure in volumetric images, yielding improved segmentation with limited annotations and producing a coherent anatomical manifold across patients.

Abstract: Volumetric medical image segmentation presents unique challenges due to the inherent anatomical structure and limited availability of annotations. While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients. Learning these inter-slice relationships produces anatomically informed representations that benefit the downstream segmentation task. Through this coordinative learning framework, CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure.

*Yichao Tang,Mingyang Li,Di Miao,Sheng Li,Zhenxing Qian,Xinpeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A noise-simulation-free watermarking framework, SimuFreeMark, embeds watermarks in low-frequency deep features via a pre-trained VAE to achieve robust performance against both conventional and semantic attacks without training-time noise augmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deep-learning watermarking often relies on handcrafted noise-simulation layers, which restricts generalization to unforeseen distortions. In the AI-generated content era, robust watermarking against both conventional and semantic edits is crucial. The paper leverages the observed stability of low-frequency components to enable robust watermarking without noise simulation.

Method: Systematically show that low-frequency components are robust to a wide range of attacks. Embed the watermark directly into the deep feature space of low-frequency components using a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE) to bind the watermark to structurally stable image representations, thus removing the need for noise-simulation during training.

Result: SimuFreeMark outperforms state-of-the-art methods across conventional and semantic attacks while maintaining superior visual quality.

Conclusion: The approach eliminates the need for noise simulation in training and achieves enhanced robustness by exploiting low-frequency stability and VAE-based binding in the deep feature space.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) has created a pressing need for robust image watermarking that can withstand both conventional signal processing and novel semantic editing attacks. Current deep learning-based methods rely on training with hand-crafted noise simulation layers, which inherently limit their generalization to unforeseen distortions. In this work, we propose $\textbf{SimuFreeMark}$, a noise-$\underline{\text{simu}}$lation-$\underline{\text{free}}$ water$\underline{\text{mark}}$ing framework that circumvents this limitation by exploiting the inherent stability of image low-frequency components. We first systematically establish that low-frequency components exhibit significant robustness against a wide range of attacks. Building on this foundation, SimuFreeMark embeds watermarks directly into the deep feature space of the low-frequency components, leveraging a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE) to bind the watermark with structurally stable image representations. This design completely eliminates the need for noise simulation during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimuFreeMark outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of conventional and semantic attacks, while maintaining superior visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLMs perform well but require large memory and compute, limiting deployment on resource-constrained devices for long documents.

Method: Introduce Hierarchical Multimodal Compressor to encode per-page visual/textual/layout information into fixed-length sequences; implement Streaming Abstention to process document segments sequentially and filter low-confidence responses with an entropy-based calibrator.

Result: On long multimodal document benchmarks, DocSLM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art while reducing visual tokens by 82%, parameters by 75%, and latency by 71%.

Conclusion: DocSLM enables reliable multimodal document understanding on lightweight edge devices; code is available in supplementary material.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities on long and complex documents. However, their high memory footprint makes them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We present DocSLM, an efficient Small Vision-Language Model designed for long-document understanding under constrained memory resources. DocSLM incorporates a Hierarchical Multimodal Compressor that jointly encodes visual, textual, and layout information from each page into a fixed-length sequence, greatly reducing memory consumption while preserving both local and global semantics. To enable scalable processing over arbitrarily long inputs, we introduce a Streaming Abstention mechanism that operates on document segments sequentially and filters low-confidence responses using an entropy-based uncertainty calibrator. Across multiple long multimodal document benchmarks, DocSLM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while using 82\% fewer visual tokens, 75\% fewer parameters, and 71\% lower latency, delivering reliable multimodal document understanding on lightweight edge devices.

### [94] [BOFA: Bridge-Layer Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion for CLIP-Based Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11421)
*Lan Li,Tao Hu,Da-Wei Zhou,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BOFA enables parameter-efficient continual learning for CLIP by adapting only the cross-modal bridge-layer with Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, avoiding forgetting without extra parameters or replay, and using cross-modal prototypes for improved classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle two challenges in CLIP-based CIL: (1) avoid adding new learnable modules or inference cost during adaptation; (2) fully leverage visual-textual modalities to enhance performance.

Method: Constrain all adaptation to CLIP's cross-modal bridge-layer, apply Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion to update a low-rank subspace orthogonal to past-task features to prevent forgetting without data replay, and use a cross-modal hybrid prototype combining stable textual prototypes with visual prototypes derived from the adapted bridge-layer.

Result: Experimental results on standard CIL benchmarks show BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared with existing methods.

Conclusion: BOFA provides a parameter-efficient, forgetting-resistant CIL approach by safe, orthogonal fusion in the bridge-layer and effective cross-modal prototypes, achieving strong performance with no extra parameters or inference cost.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continually learn new categories without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new synthetic SD-resolution event-camera dataset (YCB-Ev SD) for 6DoF pose estimation, plus analysis showing linear-decay time-surfaces with dual-channel polarity best perform; dataset released for benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of large-scale event-based datasets for 6D pose estimation and provide a resource comparable to frame-based datasets.

Method: Generate 50,000 event sequences of 34 ms from PBR scenes of YCB-Video objects following the BOP methodology; simulate linear camera motion to ensure full coverage; evaluate CNN-based pose estimation across event representations, comparing time-surface decay (linear vs exponential) and polarity (single vs dual-channel); provide raw events and precomputed optimal representations.

Result: Time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation; polarity contributes most to gains; linear temporal encoding preserves motion information better than exponential decay; dataset is structured with raw streams and precomputed representations for immediate use and reproducible benchmarking.

Conclusion: Provides a comprehensive synthetic SD-resolution event-camera dataset for 6DoF pose estimation and a systematic analysis of event representations; enables immediate use and reproducible benchmarking; dataset publicly available.

Abstract: We introduce YCB-Ev SD, a synthetic dataset of event-camera data at standard definition (SD) resolution for 6DoF object pose estimation. While synthetic data has become fundamental in frame-based computer vision, event-based vision lacks comparable comprehensive resources. Addressing this gap, we present 50,000 event sequences of 34 ms duration each, synthesized from Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose (BOP) methodology. Our generation framework employs simulated linear camera motion to ensure complete scene coverage, including background activity.
  Through systematic evaluation of event representations for CNN-based inference, we demonstrate that time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives by significant margins. Our analysis reveals that polarity information contributes most substantially to performance gains, while linear temporal encoding preserves critical motion information more effectively than exponential decay. The dataset is provided in a structured format with both raw event streams and precomputed optimal representations to facilitate immediate research use and reproducible benchmarking.

*Sheng Liu,Yuanzhi Liang,Sidan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3D motion generation method (Free3D) learns 3D-consistent latent representations from 2D motion data without 3D annotations, using a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE and 3D-free regularizers to achieve competitive results with supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D motion models overfit to precise 3D supervision, hindering generalization. Relying on 3D labels can bias models toward fixed coordinate patterns and lose essential semantic cues for robust 3D reasoning.

Method: Propose Free3D with a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences to 3D-consistent latent spaces, plus 3D-free regularization losses enforcing view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility. The model is trained solely on 2D motion data.

Result: Free3D produces diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, with performance comparable to or surpassing fully 3D-supervised methods.

Conclusion: Relaxing explicit 3D supervision enables stronger structural reasoning and generalization, offering a scalable, data-efficient approach for 3D motion generation.

Abstract: Recent 3D human motion generation models demonstrate remarkable reconstruction accuracy yet struggle to generalize beyond training distributions. This limitation arises partly from the use of precise 3D supervision, which encourages models to fit fixed coordinate patterns instead of learning the essential 3D structure and motion semantic cues required for robust generalization.To overcome this limitation, we propose Free3D, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D motions without any 3D motion annotations. Free3D introduces a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences into 3D-consistent latent spaces, and a suite of 3D-free regularization objectives enforcing view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility. Trained entirely on 2D motion data, Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts. These results suggest that relaxing explicit 3D supervision encourages stronger structural reasoning and generalization, offering a scalable and data-efficient paradigm for 3D motion generation.

TL;DR: Unsupervised segmentation via HMRF-UNet that combines Hidden Markov Random Field theory with CNNs to achieve accurate, fast segmentation without labeled data, plus a pre-training strategy to reduce labeling needs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for accurate material image segmentation without large labeled datasets. Supervised CNNs perform well but require labels; unsupervised methods can be slow or less accurate. Integrating HMRF with CNN aims to leverage neighborhood/statistical class information for fast, unsupervised segmentation.

Method: Integrate HMRF theory into a CNN (UNet) segmentation framework to create HMRF-UNet. Investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components in the unsupervised HMRF loss. Demonstrate high segmentation accuracy without ground-truth on μCT images of polyurethane (PU) foam. Propose a pre-training strategy to further reduce the amount of ground-truth data required for training a segmentation model.

Result: HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a μCT PU foam dataset. A pre-training strategy significantly reduces the required amount of labeled data.

Conclusion: Combining HMRF-based unsupervised loss with CNN segmentation yields fast, accurate material segmentation without labels. The study shows the importance of neighborhood terms and the effectiveness of pre-training to reduce labeling needs; applicable to other material imaging tasks.

Abstract: Extracting digital material representations from images is a necessary prerequisite for a quantitative analysis of material properties. Different segmentation approaches have been extensively studied in the past to achieve this task, but were often lacking accuracy or speed. With the advent of machine learning, supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for different segmentation tasks. However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss. We demonstrate that the HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a Micro-Computed Tomography ($μ$CT) image dataset of Polyurethane (PU) foam structures. Finally, we propose and demonstrate a pre-training strategy that considerably reduces the required amount of ground-truth data when training a segmentation model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between analog chess play and digital analysis by enabling accurate, on-device or app-based recognition of physical boards, addressing lack of tooling for physical-game analysis.

Method: A multi-step image processing and recognition pipeline: preprocess with Hough Line Transform for edge detection, apply a projective transform to obtain a top-down board view, segment into 64 squares, classify each square with a residual CNN into 13 classes (6 white pieces, 6 black pieces, empty), then encode the results as an FEN string. The model is trained and evaluated on ChessReD, a dataset of 10,800 annotated smartphone images captured under varied lighting and angles.

Result: The paper reports improved accuracy and training stability attributed to the use of residual connections, with evaluation on ChessReD showing reliable transcription of board states under diverse conditions and seamless conversion to FEN for engine analysis.

Conclusion: CVChess enables a practical bridge between physical and digital chess by reliably converting board states from images into FEN strings that can be fed to online engines for optimal moves.

Abstract: Chess has experienced a large increase in viewership since the pandemic, driven largely by the accessibility of online learning platforms. However, no equivalent assistance exists for physical chess games, creating a divide between analog and digital chess experiences. This paper presents CVChess, a deep learning framework for converting chessboard images to Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN), which is later input into online chess engines to provide you with the best next move. Our approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual layers to perform piece recognition from smartphone camera images. The system processes RGB images of a physical chess board through a multistep process: image preprocessing using the Hough Line Transform for edge detection, projective transform to achieve a top-down board alignment, segmentation into 64 individual squares, and piece classification into 13 classes (6 unique white pieces, 6 unique black pieces and an empty square) using the residual CNN. Residual connections help retain low-level visual features while enabling deeper feature extraction, improving accuracy and stability during training. We train and evaluate our model using the Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD), containing 10,800 annotated smartphone images captured under diverse lighting conditions and angles. The resulting classifications are encoded as an FEN string, which can be fed into a chess engine to generate the most optimal move

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces LSEF, a hierarchical low-rank sparse framework for video-based affective computing with SEM, DDM, CIM and RAO to disentangle long-term emotional bases from transient fluctuations, improving robustness and dynamic discrimination.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAC models suffer from instability and representational degradation due to complex emotional dynamics; there is a need for a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle long-term emotional bases from short-term fluctuations.

Method: LSEF uses three plug-and-play modules—Stability Encoding Module (SEM) for low-rank emotional bases, Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) for sparse transient signals, and Consistency Integration Module (CIM) for reconstructing multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence—along with a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy; the framework frames affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process.

Result: Extensive experiments across multiple datasets show significant improvements in robustness and dynamic discrimination, supporting the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for affective dynamics.

Conclusion: The proposed LSEF framework effectively captures hierarchical low-rank sparse structure in affective dynamics, offering robust and generalizable improvements for video-based emotion understanding.

Abstract: Video-based Affective Computing (VAC), vital for emotion analysis and human-computer interaction, suffers from model instability and representational degradation due to complex emotional dynamics. Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination, which further validates the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics.

Motivation: Scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data for scientific reasoning in microscopy limits the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

Method: Stage 1: bootstrap supervision from expert-validated figure-caption pairs from peer-reviewed articles. Stage 2: HiCQA-Graph—a heterogeneous graph over images, captions, and QAs that fuses NLI-based textual entailment, CLIP-based vision-language alignment, and agent signals to identify and filter inconsistent samples. Stage 3: an MLLM agent generates multiple-choice questions (MCQ) and human screening refines them. The dataset derives from the BIOMEDICA archive, with a large training split and a human-checked test split, designed to exceed the MicroVQA hard-sample distribution.

Result: A quality-controlled microscopy VQA dataset, the first graph (HiCQA-Graph) modeling image/caption/QA for cross-modal consistency filtering, and evidence that careful data construction enables 4B-scale MLLMs to reach competitive microscopy reasoning performance (approaching GPT-5) and state-of-the-art among open-source MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models are increasingly applied to biomedical imaging, yet scientific reasoning for microscopy remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. We introduce MicroVQA++, a three-stage, large-scale and high-quality microscopy VQA corpus derived from the BIOMEDICA archive. Stage one bootstraps supervision from expert-validated figure-caption pairs sourced from peer-reviewed articles. Stage two applies HiCQA-Graph, a novel heterogeneous graph over images, captions, and QAs that fuses NLI-based textual entailment, CLIP-based vision-language alignment, and agent signals to identify and filter inconsistent samples.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded their capabilities beyond high-level vision tasks. Nevertheless, their potential for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Q-Doc, a three-tiered evaluation framework for systematically probing DIQA capabilities of MLLMs at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels. a) At the coarse level, we instruct MLLMs to assign quality scores to document images and analyze their correlation with Quality Annotations. b) At the middle level, we design distortion-type identification tasks, including single-choice and multi-choice tests for multi-distortion scenarios. c) At the fine level, we introduce distortion-severity assessment where MLLMs classify distortion intensity against human-annotated references. Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels. Our work provides a benchmark for DIQA capabilities in MLLMs, revealing pronounced deficiencies in their quality perception and promising pathways for enhancement. The benchmark and code are publicly available at:

### [103] [Shrinking the Teacher: An Adaptive Teaching Paradigm for Asymmetric EEG-Vision Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11422)
*Lukun Wu,Jie Li,Ziqi Ren,Kaifan Zhang,Xinbo Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes adaptive teaching to address asymmetry between vision (high-fidelity, rich semantics) and EEG (noisy, shallow semantics) by having the teacher (vision) shrink its knowledge via ShrinkAdapter to match the EEG, achieving 60.2% top-1 in zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval, outperforming SOTA by 9.8%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The cross-modal alignment problem is fundamentally asymmetric. Fidelity gap (EEG vs vision) and semantic gap (shallow EEG representations vs rich vision semantics) hinder generalization. Traditional symmetric alignment forces equal partnership and degrades performance; need a paradigm where the teacher adapts to the student.

Method: Introduce the adaptive teaching paradigm. Use ShrinkAdapter, a residual-free, bottleneck module, to shrink and tailor vision features to EEG capacity. Train in a teacher-student setting for zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval.

Result: Top-1 accuracy 60.2% on zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval, surpassing previous state-of-the-art by 9.8%.

Conclusion: An asymmetric alignment framework where the teacher shrinks and adapts to the student bridges the vision–brain gap and offers a new direction for cross-modal alignment.

Abstract: Decoding visual features from EEG signals is a central challenge in neuroscience, with cross-modal alignment as the dominant approach. We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\%. Our work introduces a new perspective for asymmetric alignment: the teacher must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap.

### [104] [Comprehension of Multilingual Expressions Referring to Target Objects in Visual Inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11427)
*Francisco Nogueira,Alexandre Bernardino,Bruno Martins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A large-scale multilingual Referring Expression Comprehension dataset and an attention-anchored model using multilingual SigLIP2 encoders are proposed, achieving competitive multilingual grounding performance and demonstrating cross-language feasibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: REC research is English-centric while real-world deployments require multilingual visual grounding; there is a need for large-scale multilingual benchmarks and models.

Method: Data construction: expand 12 English REC benchmarks to 10 languages via machine translation and context-aware translation enhancements, yielding ~8M multilingual referring expressions over 177,620 images with 336,882 objects. Model: an attention-anchored neural architecture with multilingual SigLIP2 encoders; generates coarse spatial anchors from attention distributions and refines them with learned residuals.

Result: On RefCOCO aggregate multilingual evaluation, the model achieves 86.9% IoU@50, compared to 91.3% for English. The dataset contains ~8M expressions, 177k images, and 336k annotated objects, with consistent multilingual capabilities across languages, demonstrating practical feasibility of multilingual visual grounding.

Conclusion: The work shows that multilingual visual grounding is feasible at scale, providing a valuable dataset and a competitive model; future work could further close the gap with English and improve translation quality, cross-lingual transfer, and language coverage.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) requires models to localize objects in images based on natural language descriptions. Research on the area remains predominantly English-centric, despite increasing global deployment demands. This work addresses multilingual REC through two main contributions. First, we construct a unified multilingual dataset spanning 10 languages, by systematically expanding 12 existing English REC benchmarks through machine translation and context-based translation enhancement. The resulting dataset comprises approximately 8 million multilingual referring expressions across 177,620 images, with 336,882 annotated objects. Second, we introduce an attention-anchored neural architecture that uses multilingual SigLIP2 encoders. Our attention-based approach generates coarse spatial anchors from attention distributions, which are subsequently refined through learned residuals. Experimental evaluation demonstrates competitive performance on standard benchmarks, e.g. achieving 86.9% accuracy at IoU@50 on RefCOCO aggregate multilingual evaluation, compared to an English-only result of 91.3%. Multilingual evaluation shows consistent capabilities across languages, establishing the practical feasibility of multilingual visual grounding systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WEAVE introduces WEAVE-100k and WEAVEBench, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation, enabling multi-turn visual reasoning, editing, and memory, while also revealing current challenges in such tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the gap where existing datasets focus on single-turn interactions and fail to capture real-world, multi-turn image editing and generation that depend on historical context and cross-modal memory.

Method: WEAVE-100k: a large-scale dataset with 100K interleaved samples, ~370K dialogue turns, and ~500K images covering comprehension, editing, and generation requiring historical context. WEAVEBench: a 100-task, 480-image, human-annotated benchmark with a hybrid vision-language model judger using both the reference image and an edited image to assess multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning.

Result: Training on WEAVE-100k enhances vision comprehension, image editing, and the collaboration between comprehension and generation. The suite supports emergent visual-memory capabilities but WEAVEBench highlights persistent limitations in multi-turn, context-aware image generation/editing with current models.

Conclusion: WEAVE provides a foundational platform for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation in multimodal systems, offering valuable resources for advancing memory-enabled, context-aware multimodal AI while outlining areas needing further research.

Abstract: Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMMs) have enabled impressive progress in visual comprehension and generation. However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing. To address this gap, we present WEAVE, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation. Our suite consists of two complementary parts. WEAVE-100k is a large-scale dataset of 100K interleaved samples spanning over 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks that require reasoning over historical context. WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing. We believe WEAVE provides a view and foundation for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation for multi-modal community.

### [106] [Hi-DREAM: Brain Inspired Hierarchical Diffusion for fMRI Reconstruction via ROI Encoder and visuAl Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11437)
*Guowei Zhang,Yun Zhao,Moein Khajehnejad,Adeel Razi,Levin Kuhlmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi-DREAM: a cortical-hierarchy conditioned diffusion decoder that uses ROI-based early/mid/late fMRI streams to build a multi-scale brain-aligned pyramid with a ControlNet, achieving strong semantic image reconstruction from NSD data while preserving low-level details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limitations of diffusion-based decoders that condition directly on raw fMRI features without respecting the brain's hierarchical visual organization, which can hamper interpretability and efficiency.

Method: Introduce an ROI adapter that groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and maps them onto a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with U-Net depth. Use a depth-matched ControlNet to inject scale-specific hints during denoising, enabling a brain-inspired, interpretable conditioning scheme.

Result: Hi-DREAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics on NSD, with competitive low-level fidelity, and offers insights into how different visual areas contribute to reconstruction.

Conclusion: Structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings, enabling interpretable decoding and a brain-like understanding of visual processing.

Abstract: Mapping human brain activity to natural images offers a new window into vision and cognition, yet current diffusion-based decoders face a core difficulty: most condition directly on fMRI features without analyzing how visual information is organized across the cortex. This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity. These findings suggest that structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful lens for studying the visual cortex.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VP-Bench is a two-stage benchmark to assess multimodal LLMs' ability to perceive and use visual prompts (VPs) in images, covering 30k prompts across eight shapes and 355 attribute combos, evaluating 28 models, and revealing factors that affect VP understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses a gap: there was no benchmark to evaluate how well multimodal LLMs interpret and utilize visual prompts (e.g., bounding boxes) for grounded referring tasks, hindering understanding of whether this intuitive prompting method works in practice.

Method: Stage 1: Perception in natural scenes using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2: Assess the impact of VPs on downstream tasks. Evaluates 28 MLLMs (proprietary and open-source). Analyzes factors affecting VP understanding (VP attributes, question arrangement, model scale).

Result: VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions. It provides comprehensive analysis of factors affecting VP understanding and offers a benchmark to compare model performance on VP perception and utilization.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the viability of visual prompts as a prompting modality for MLLMs and provides a systematic tool (VP-Bench) to study VP perception and usage, enabling researchers to gauge current capabilities and guide future improvements in grounded VP understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled a wide range of advanced vision-language applications, including fine-grained object recognition and contextual understanding. When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use "visual prompts" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2 investigates the impact of VPs on downstream tasks, measuring their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving scenarios. Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale. VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions.

*Massimo Rizzoli,Simone Alghisi,Seyed Mahed Mousavi,Giuseppe Riccardi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Balanced synthetic data for fine-tuning Vision-Language Models reduces biases and improves real-world transfer, outperforming models fine-tuned on matched real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning VLMs on real-world data introduces biases, errors, and distribution imbalances leading to overfitting; existing synthetic data methods lack control over distribution and annotation quality; thus need a controlled synthetic data generation approach.

Method: Automatically generate a dataset by sampling object attributes (color, shape, size, position) to create unbiased, balanced scenes; annotate accurately; fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs on this synthetic data; evaluate transfer to real-world data on absolute position task; perform exhaustive evaluations on synthetic and real benchmarks.

Result: 1) Fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and reduces biases; 2) Fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.

Conclusion: Controlled synthetic data generation for fine-tuning VLMs enhances generalization and bias mitigation, with better transfer to real-world tasks; balancing data and annotation quality are key advantages over traditional real-data fine-tuning.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is a common strategy to improve performance following an ad-hoc data collection and annotation of real-world scenes. However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.

*Qinghao Gao,Jianhai Qu,Yunsong Li,Weiqiang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaMOL introduces a lightweight dual-routing mixture-of-experts framework to handle missing modalities in multimodal remote sensing, reframing missing data as a multi-task learning problem; it delivers robust generalization with low overhead and transfers to natural images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote sensing multimodal classification often suffers from missing modalities due to environmental interference, sensor failures, or atmospheric effects. Existing two-stage adaptation is costly and assumes complete data during training, limiting real-world generalization.

Method: MaMOL reformulates missing modalities as a multi-task problem using a dual-routing mechanism: (1) a task-oriented dynamic router that activates experts for specific missing patterns, and (2) a modality-specific-shared static router that preserves cross-modal knowledge sharing. It avoids training separate networks per missing configuration by enabling parameter-efficient adaptation through lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse.

Result: Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks show superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates with minimal computational overhead. Transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate scalability and cross-domain applicability, demonstrating MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.

Conclusion: MaMOL provides a general, efficient approach for incomplete multimodal learning, achieving robust performance with low computational overhead and promising cross-domain transfer.

Abstract: Multimodal classification in remote sensing often suffers from missing modalities caused by environmental interference, sensor failures, or atmospheric effects, which severely degrade classification performance. Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability, highlighting MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.

*Yijie Kang,Xinliang Wang,Zhenyu Wu,Yifeng Shi,Hailong Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sat2RealCity introduces a building-centric 3D urban generation framework from satellite imagery, leveraging OSM-based priors, appearance-controlled modeling, and MLLM-guided semantic guidance to improve realism while reducing the need for large-scale 3D city assets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address (1) the reliance on large-scale 3D city assets for supervision and (2) the dependence on semantic/height maps that limit realism and real-world appearance. The approach shifts from city-scale supervision to building-centric generation, incorporating rich priors, geometry-aware generation, and semantic-geometry bridging via multimodal language models.

Method: 1) OSM-based spatial priors to convert spatial topology into building instances for interpretable geometric generation; 2) appearance-guided controllable modeling for fine-grained realism and style control; 3) an MLLM-powered semantic-guided generation pipeline bridging semantic interpretation and geometric reconstruction.

Result: Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments show Sat2RealCity significantly surpasses existing baselines in structural consistency and appearance realism, demonstrating strong potential for real-world aligned 3D urban content creation. The authors note that code will be released soon.

Conclusion: Sat2RealCity reduces dependence on large-scale 3D city assets by leveraging building-level priors and richer semantic/appearance guidance, providing a solid foundation for real-world aligned 3D urban content generation with applications in digital twins, virtual cities, and large-scale simulations.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have substantially enhanced 3D urban generation, enabling applications in digital twins, virtual cities, and large-scale simulations. However, existing methods face two key challenges: (1) the need for large-scale 3D city assets for supervised training, which are difficult and costly to obtain, and (2) reliance on semantic or height maps, which are used exclusively for generating buildings in virtual worlds and lack connection to real-world appearance, limiting the realism and generalizability of generated cities. To address these limitations, we propose Sat2RealCity, a geometry-aware and appearance-controllable framework for 3D urban generation from real-world satellite imagery. Unlike previous city-level generation methods, Sat2RealCity builds generation upon individual building entities, enabling the use of rich priors and pretrained knowledge from 3D object generation while substantially reducing dependence on large-scale 3D city assets. Specifically, (1) we introduce the OSM-based spatial priors strategy to achieve interpretable geometric generation from spatial topology to building instances; (2) we design an appearance-guided controllable modeling mechanism for fine-grained appearance realism and style control; and (3) we construct an MLLM-powered semantic-guided generation pipeline, bridging semantic interpretation and geometric reconstruction. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that Sat2RealCity significantly surpasses existing baselines in structural consistency and appearance realism, establishing a strong foundation for real-world aligned 3D urban content creation. The code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bayesian nnUNet-B infers PD-L1 expression from H&E images with Multimodal Posterior Sampling, achieving Dice 0.805 and IoU 0.709 on LSCC, with pixel-wise uncertainty maps; uncertainty correlates with segmentation error but calibration is imperfect; supports scalable, interpretable PD-L1 biomarker assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PD-L1 status guides immunotherapy; traditional IHC is resource-intensive; propose uncertainty-aware, imaging-based biomarker assessment from standard H&E to enable scalable clinical workflows.

Method: Extend nnUNet-v2 to nnUNet-B, use cyclic training with diverse model checkpoints to approximate the posterior (Multimodal Posterior Sampling), estimate epistemic uncertainty via entropy and standard deviation, evaluate on lung squamous cell carcinoma dataset.

Result: Mean Dice 0.805 and mean IoU 0.709; competitive with baselines; provides pixel-wise uncertainty maps; uncertainty estimates correlate with segmentation error; calibration remains imperfect.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction is a promising step toward scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows, with potential for practical deployment pending improved calibration.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of PD-L1 expression is critical for guiding immunotherapy, yet current immunohistochemistry (IHC) based methods are resource-intensive. We present nnUNet-B: a Bayesian segmentation framework that infers PD-L1 expression directly from H&E-stained histology images using Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS). Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation. Evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma, our approach achieves competitive performance against established baselines with mean Dice Score and mean IoU of 0.805 and 0.709, respectively, while providing pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Uncertainty estimates show strong correlation with segmentation error, though calibration remains imperfect. These results suggest that uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction is a promising step toward scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenUS is a reproducible open-source ultrasound foundation model trained on a large, diverse public dataset, using a vision Mamba backbone with a self-adaptive masking framework that blends contrastive learning and masked image modeling, plus a dynamic pre-training schedule to enable label-efficient downstream fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ultrasound interpretation is highly operator-dependent with significant variation across anatomy, protocols, and devices, compounded by speckle, low contrast, and limited standardized annotations. There is a need for generalizable, data-efficient models and a reproducible foundation model trained on diverse ultrasound data.

Method: Pre-train OpenUS with a vision Mamba backbone using a self-adaptive masking framework that integrates teacher attention with student reconstruction loss to refine clinically-relevant masking. Combine contrastive learning with masked image modeling. Employ a dynamic learning schedule to progressively increase pre-training difficulty. Build the largest public ultrasound dataset to date, ~308K images from 42 datasets, covering diverse regions, devices, and disease types. The model serves as a backbone for label-efficient downstream fine-tuning; code is public.

Result: The paper reports a large-scale pre-trained ultrasound foundation model (OpenUS) that can be adapted efficiently for downstream tasks via fine-tuning with limited labels. It emphasizes reproducibility and openness, supported by a substantial public dataset and code availability. Specific quantitative results are not provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: OpenUS provides a reproducible, open-source foundation model for ultrasound that aims to improve generalizability and data efficiency across diverse ultrasound tasks, facilitating label-efficient fine-tuning and broader accessibility in the field.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) is one of the most widely used medical imaging modalities, thanks to its low cost, portability, real-time feedback, and absence of ionizing radiation. However, US image interpretation remains highly operator-dependent and varies significantly across anatomical regions, acquisition protocols, and device types. These variations, along with unique challenges such as speckle, low contrast, and limited standardized annotations, hinder the development of generalizable, label-efficient ultrasound AI models. In this paper, we propose OpenUS, the first reproducible, open-source ultrasound foundation model built on a large collection of public data. OpenUS employs a vision Mamba backbone, capturing both local and global long-range dependencies across the image. To extract rich features during pre-training, we introduce a novel self-adaptive masking framework that combines contrastive learning with masked image modeling. This strategy integrates the teacher's attention map with student reconstruction loss, adaptively refining clinically-relevant masking to enhance pre-training effectiveness. OpenUS also applies a dynamic learning schedule to progressively adjust the difficulty of the pre-training process. To develop the foundation model, we compile the largest to-date public ultrasound dataset comprising over 308K images from 42 publicly available datasets, covering diverse anatomical regions, institutions, imaging devices, and disease types. Our pre-trained OpenUS model can be easily adapted to specific downstream tasks by serving as a backbone for label-efficient fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/XZheng0427/OpenUS.

*Benjamin Fein-Ashley,Jacob Fein-Ashley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BRIDGE introduces a lightweight cross-modal fusion module using few cross-attention layers to align vision and text hidden states, improving multimodal tasks while keeping bi-encoder efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Directly leveraging the rich structure in both modalities by aligning hidden states rather than fusing tokens early or embeddings late, to improve accuracy without sacrificing efficiency or generative coupling.

Method: Add cross-only, bidirectional attention layers near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects modalities into a shared space, performs cross-attention, and applies gated residual updates with stabilizers. Encoders remain non-causal; optional decoder for generation; training remains contrastive bi-encoder.

Result: BRIDGE achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results on retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, outperforming comparable VLMs while preserving bi-encoder efficiency; code released.

Conclusion: A simple, efficient fusion mechanism that aligns modality-specific hidden states yields improved multimodal understanding without reintroducing heavy joint encoders or decoders; supports strong retrieval and reasoning capabilities with decoupled generation.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are a new family of models that align image content with natural language. Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities "think". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Comprehending long visual documents, where information is distributed across extensive pages of text and visual elements, is a critical but challenging task for modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Existing approaches falter on a fundamental challenge: evidence localization. They struggle to retrieve relevant pages and overlook fine-grained details within visual elements, leading to limited performance and model hallucination. To address this, we propose DocLens, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that effectively ``zooms in'' on evidence like a lens. It first navigates from the full document to specific visual elements on relevant pages, then employs a sampling-adjudication mechanism to generate a single, reliable answer. Paired with Gemini-2.5-Pro, DocLens achieves state-of-the-art performance on MMLongBench-Doc and FinRAGBench-V, surpassing even human experts. The framework's superiority is particularly evident on vision-centric and unanswerable queries, demonstrating the power of its enhanced localization capabilities.

TL;DR: LARM is a unified feedforward framework for reconstructing 3D articulated objects from sparse-view images, jointly estimating detailed geometry, textures, and joints, extending LVSM with a transformer-based approach for fast, high-fidelity 3D reconstruction without dense supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimization-based methods demand dense multi-view inputs and costly per-instance optimization, while current fast methods often yield coarse geometry and lack textures; a scalable, high-fidelity, sparse-view solution for articulated objects is needed.

Method: LARM extends LVSM to articulated objects by jointly reasoning about camera pose and articulation variation with a transformer-based architecture. It outputs depth maps and part masks to support explicit mesh extraction and joint estimation, enabling single-stage, dense reconstruction without dense supervision.

Result: Experiments show LARM outperforms state-of-the-art in novel view synthesis, state synthesis, and 3D articulated reconstruction, producing high-quality meshes that align with input images.

Conclusion: LARM provides a scalable, unified, single-pass solution for reconstructing 3D articulated objects from sparse views, unifying geometry, textures, and joints, with auxiliary outputs to aid mesh extraction and is applicable across diverse object categories.

Abstract: Modeling 3D articulated objects with realistic geometry, textures, and kinematics is essential for a wide range of applications. However, existing optimization-based reconstruction methods often require dense multi-view inputs and expensive per-instance optimization, limiting their scalability. Recent feedforward approaches offer faster alternatives but frequently produce coarse geometry, lack texture reconstruction, and rely on brittle, complex multi-stage pipelines. We introduce LARM, a unified feedforward framework that reconstructs 3D articulated objects from sparse-view images by jointly recovering detailed geometry, realistic textures, and accurate joint structures. LARM extends LVSM a recent novel view synthesis (NVS) approach for static 3D objects into the articulated setting by jointly reasoning over camera pose and articulation variation using a transformer-based architecture, enabling scalable and accurate novel view synthesis. In addition, LARM generates auxiliary outputs such as depth maps and part masks to facilitate explicit 3D mesh extraction and joint estimation. Our pipeline eliminates the need for dense supervision and supports high-fidelity reconstruction across diverse object categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LARM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both novel view and state synthesis as well as 3D articulated object reconstruction, generating high-quality meshes that closely adhere to the input images. project page: https://sylviayuan-sy.github.io/larm-site/

### [116] [Attentive Feature Aggregation or: How Policies Learn to Stop Worrying about Robustness and Attend to Task-Relevant Visual Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10762)
*Nikolaos Tsagkas,Andreas Sochopoulos,Duolikun Danier,Sethu Vijayakumar,Alexandros Kouris,Oisin Mac Aodha,Chris Xiaoxuan Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Attentive Feature Aggregation (AFA) improves robustness of visuomotor policies to visual perturbations by learning to attend to task-relevant cues in pre-trained visual representations, outperforming standard pooling without extra data augmentation or PVR fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-trained visual representations encode broad scene information including distractors, which can harm robustness to out-of-domain perturbations. There is a need for a pooling mechanism that selectively emphasizes task-relevant features.

Method: Introduce Attentive Feature Aggregation (AFA), a lightweight trainable pooling module that learns to attend to task-relevant cues while suppressing distractors, integrated into visuomotor policy training without requiring PVR fine-tuning or extensive data augmentation.

Result: Policies trained with AFA significantly outperform standard pooling under visual perturbations in both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating improved robustness without expensive augmentation or PVR fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Focusing on and filtering extraneous visual information via AFA is key to deploying robust and generalisable visuomotor policies, making AFA a practical solution for robust visuomotor learning.

Abstract: The adoption of pre-trained visual representations (PVRs), leveraging features from large-scale vision models, has become a popular paradigm for training visuomotor policies. However, these powerful representations can encode a broad range of task-irrelevant scene information, making the resulting trained policies vulnerable to out-of-domain visual changes and distractors. In this work we address visuomotor policy feature pooling as a solution to the observed lack of robustness in perturbed scenes. We achieve this via Attentive Feature Aggregation (AFA), a lightweight, trainable pooling mechanism that learns to naturally attend to task-relevant visual cues, ignoring even semantically rich scene distractors. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world, we demonstrate that policies trained with AFA significantly outperform standard pooling approaches in the presence of visual perturbations, without requiring expensive dataset augmentation or fine-tuning of the PVR. Our findings show that ignoring extraneous visual information is a crucial step towards deploying robust and generalisable visuomotor policies. Project Page: tsagkas.github.io/afa

*Eric Mugford,Jonathan D. Gammell*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A^SAR is an ε-optimal SAR planning algorithm that uses a heuristic to bound the search space and graph-search to guarantee ε-approximate optimality; it outperforms stochastic methods in simulations and is validated in a real field trial locating a drifting manikin in 150 seconds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR planning under uncertainty is computationally hard and time-critical. Stochastic optimization methods offer scalable search but provide no finite-time guarantees on solution quality; there is a need for provable performance bounds and faster, more reliable planning.

Method: Develop a SAR planning algorithm, A^SAR, that computes a heuristic bound on the search space and uses graph-search techniques to obtain solutions within a user-specified ε of the optimal. Evaluate via operational simulations and a real-world field trial on Lake Ontario locating a drifting manikin.

Result: A^SAR finds better solutions faster than existing optimization approaches in simulations and successfully located the drifting manikin in 150 seconds during a Lake Ontario field trial.

Conclusion: A^SAR provides formal ε-optimal guarantees for SAR planning and demonstrates practical effectiveness, offering a faster, provable alternative to stochastic methods with real-world applicability.

Abstract: Searches are conducted to find missing persons and/or objects given uncertain information, imperfect observers and large search areas in Search and Rescue (SAR). In many scenarios, such as Maritime SAR, expected survival times are short and optimal search could increase the likelihood of success. This optimization problem is complex for nontrivial problems given its probabilistic nature.
  Stochastic optimization methods search large problems by nondeterministically sampling the space to reduce the effective size of the problem. This has been used in SAR planning to search otherwise intractably large problems but the stochastic nature provides no formal guarantees on the quality of solutions found in finite time.
  This paper instead presents $\rm{A}^{\rm{SAR}}$, an $\varepsilon$-optimal search algorithm for SAR planning. It calculates a heuristic to bound the search space and uses graph-search methods to find solutions that are formally guaranteed to be within a user-specified factor, $\varepsilon$, of the optimal solution. It finds better solutions faster than existing optimization approaches in operational simulations. It is also demonstrated with a real-world field trial on Lake Ontario, Canada, where it was used to locate a drifting manikin in only 150s.

*William Harris,Lucas Yager,Syler Sylvester,Elizabeth Peiros,Micheal C. Yip*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A dynamically extensible and retractable five-bar linkage morphing leg enables SAR robots to switch between high-speed terrain traversal and high-force rescue tasks by adjusting geometry, improving stride, force output, and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in SAR platforms that can both traverse uneven terrain quickly and apply high force for extraction, complicating variable high-force outputs in legged designs; a morphing leg provides both terrain adaptability and high-force output.

Method: Design and test a dynamically extensible and retractable five-bar linkage; study geometric transformation between height-advantaged and force-advantaged configurations; evaluate leg performance across linkages geometries and operating modes; empirical and analytical analyses on stride length, force output, stability.

Result: Demonstrates that morphing leg can switch configurations to balance speed and force, with improved stride length, force output, and stability; promising path toward SAR robots with dual capabilities.

Conclusion: The morphing leg offers a promising approach to integrate terrain navigation and high-force rescue operations in SAR robots, enabling adaptable performance through geometric morphing of a five-bar linkage.

Abstract: Search and rescue (SAR) robots are required to quickly traverse terrain and perform high-force rescue tasks, necessitating both terrain adaptability and controlled high-force output. Few platforms exist today for SAR, and fewer still have the ability to cover both tasks of terrain adaptability and high-force output when performing extraction. While legged robots offer significant ability to traverse uneven terrain, they typically are unable to incorporate mechanisms that provide variable high-force outputs, unlike traditional wheel-based drive trains. This work introduces a novel concept for a dynamically extensible and retractable robot leg. Leveraging a dynamically extensible and retractable five-bar linkage design, it allows for mechanically switching between height-advantaged and force-advantaged configurations via a geometric transformation. A testbed evaluated leg performance across linkage geometries and operating modes, with empirical and analytical analyses conducted on stride length, force output, and stability. The results demonstrate that the morphing leg offers a promising path toward SAR robots that can both navigate terrain quickly and perform rescue tasks effectively.

TL;DR: MIGHTY is a Hermite-spline-based spatiotemporal planner that jointly optimizes trajectory in a continuous spline space, achieving faster computation and shorter travel times with robust hardware performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard-constraint planners rely on commercial solvers and heavy computation; soft-constraint methods either decouple spatial and temporal optimization or limit search space. There's a need for true continuous spatiotemporal optimization.

Method: A Hermite spline-based planner (MIGHTY) that performs joint spatiotemporal optimization directly within the continuous search space of a spline.

Result: In simulation: 9.3% faster computation and 13.1% shorter travel time versus baselines, with 100% success rate. In hardware: supports multiple high-speed flights up to 6.7 m/s in cluttered static environments and long-duration flights with dynamically added obstacles.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that fully continuous spatiotemporal optimization with Hermite splines yields faster, more efficient planning and robust real-world performance, including dynamic obstacle handling.

Abstract: Hard-constraint trajectory planners often rely on commercial solvers and demand substantial computational resources. Existing soft-constraint methods achieve faster computation, but either (1) decouple spatial and temporal optimization or (2) restrict the search space. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MIGHTY, a Hermite spline-based planner that performs spatiotemporal optimization while fully leveraging the continuous search space of a spline. In simulation, MIGHTY achieves a 9.3% reduction in computation time and a 13.1% reduction in travel time over state-of-the-art baselines, with a 100% success rate. In hardware, MIGHTY completes multiple high-speed flights up to 6.7 m/s in a cluttered static environment and long-duration flights with dynamically added obstacles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve emergent behavior in multi-agent systems under minimal information sharing and sensing capabilities, addressing limitations of quaternion-based methods and reliance on velocity data.

Method: Embed agent dynamics in a Lie group geometric framework (SO(3)) around simple orbits; design a phase controller promoting uniform spacing; derive decentralized control requiring only position inputs; provide formal stability proof; compare to quaternion-based limits.

Result: Generates a wide class of stable, periodic trajectories; achieves more diverse curves than quaternion-based approaches; robust to low-level dynamics and disturbances; validated via simulations and real experiments.

Conclusion: Shows the effectiveness and adaptability of SO(3)-based geometry in decentralized emergent behaviors; reduces information/measurement requirements; offers provable stability and scalable potential.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel decentralized approach for achieving emergent behavior in multi-agent systems with minimal information sharing. Based on prior work in simple orbits, our method produces a broad class of stable, periodic trajectories by stabilizing the system around a Lie group-based geometric embedding. Employing the Lie group SO(3), we generate a wider range of periodic curves than existing quaternion-based methods. Furthermore, we exploit SO(3) properties to eliminate the need for velocity inputs, allowing agents to receive only position inputs. We also propose a novel phase controller that ensures uniform agent separation, along with a formal stability proof. Validation through simulations and experiments showcases the method's adaptability to complex low-level dynamics and disturbances.

*Jose Vasquez,Xuping Zhang*

TL;DR: An autonomous tracked robot, WetExplorer, automates GHG sampling in wetlands, achieving centimeter-level localization and precise pose estimation, enabling high-frequency, multi-site measurements without human intervention.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantifying greenhouse gases in wetlands is crucial for climate modeling and restoration assessment, but manual sampling is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Automation can enable higher-frequency measurements, broader spatial coverage, and richer long-duration datasets in saturated wetlands.

Method: WetExplorer integrates low-ground-pressure locomotion, centimeter-accurate lift placement, dual-RTK sensor fusion, obstacle avoidance planning, and deep-learning perception in a containerized ROS2 stack. Outdoor trials show a mean localization error of 1.71 cm; the vision module yields 7 mm translational and 3° rotational pose accuracy; indoor trials show the full motion-planning pipeline positions the sampling chamber within a global tolerance of 70 mm while avoiding obstacles, all without human intervention.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility of fully autonomous GHG sampling in wetlands, enabling high-frequency, multi-site measurements and dense, long-duration datasets in saturated wetlands.

Conclusion: WetExplorer has the potential to transform GHG data collection in wetlands by removing manual bottlenecks, enabling scalable, high-resolution spatiotemporal datasets that can improve climate models and restoration assessments.

Abstract: Quantifying greenhouse-gases (GHG) in wetlands is critical for climate modeling and restoration assessment, yet manual sampling is labor-intensive, and time demanding. We present WetExplorer, an autonomous tracked robot that automates the full GHG-sampling workflow. The robot system integrates low-ground-pressure locomotion, centimeter-accurate lift placement, dual-RTK sensor fusion, obstacle avoidance planning, and deep-learning perception in a containerized ROS2 stack. Outdoor trials verified that the sensor-fusion stack maintains a mean localization error of 1.71 cm, the vision module estimates object pose with 7 mm translational and 3° rotational accuracy, while indoor trials demonstrated that the full motion-planning pipeline positions the sampling chamber within a global tolerance of 70 mm while avoiding obstacles, all without human intervention. By eliminating the manual bottleneck, WetExplorer enables high-frequency, multi-site GHG measurements and opens the door for dense, long-duration datasets in saturated wetland terrain.

*Yorai Shaoul,Zhe Chen,Mohamed Naveed Gul Mohamed,Federico Pecora,Maxim Likhachev,Jiaoyang Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified generative-co-design approach for coordinating multi-robot, multi-object non-prehensile manipulation, integrating flow-matching co-generation with anonymous multi-robot motion planning to unify robot- and object-level reasoning and scale to complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prior methods are either end-to-end learned policies or rely on privileged information and hand-designed planners; they struggle with diverse objects and long-horizon manipulation in cluttered environments. A framework that couples object-level coordination with scalable robot motion planning is needed.

Method: The framework couples flow-matching co-generation with anonymous multi-robot motion planning. A generative model co-generates contact formations and manipulation trajectories from visual observations, while a scalable motion planner coordinates at scale. The planner also operates at the object level by assigning manipulated objects to larger target structures, unifying robot- and object-level reasoning in a single algorithmic framework.

Result: Experiments in challenging simulated environments show the proposed approach outperforms baselines in both motion planning and manipulation tasks, demonstrating the benefits of generative co-design and integrated planning for scalable collaborative manipulation of multiple agents and objects.

Conclusion: The unified framework enables scalable, coordinated multi-robot, multi-object non-prehensile manipulation by integrating generative co-design with a scalable motion planner that reasons about both robot- and object-level goals; code and demonstrations are available at the project site.

Abstract: Coordinating a team of robots to reposition multiple objects in cluttered environments requires reasoning jointly about where robots should establish contact, how to manipulate objects once contact is made, and how to navigate safely and efficiently at scale. Prior approaches typically fall into two extremes -- either learning the entire task or relying on privileged information and hand-designed planners -- both of which struggle to handle diverse objects in long-horizon tasks. To address these challenges, we present a unified framework for collaborative multi-robot, multi-object non-prehensile manipulation that integrates flow-matching co-generation with anonymous multi-robot motion planning. Within this framework, a generative model co-generates contact formations and manipulation trajectories from visual observations, while a novel motion planner conveys robots at scale. Crucially, the same planner also supports coordination at the object level, assigning manipulated objects to larger target structures and thereby unifying robot- and object-level reasoning within a single algorithmic framework. Experiments in challenging simulated environments demonstrate that our approach outperforms baselines in both motion planning and manipulation tasks, highlighting the benefits of generative co-design and integrated planning for scaling collaborative manipulation to complex multi-agent, multi-object settings.

*Deniz Kerimoglu,Nicholas D. Naclerio,Sean Chu,Andrew Krohn,Vineet Kupunaram,Alexander Schepelmann,Daniel I. Goldman,Elliot W. Hawkes*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Tip-extending, root-inspired anchors dramatically reduce insertion forces and boost extraction-to-insertion strength, enabling lightweight deployment in hard-to-access or extraterrestrial soils. A set of design rules—penetrate beyond a depth threshold, add hair-like protrusions, extend near-vertically, and use multiple small anchors—guided a soft robotic anchor that can deploy sensors 45 cm deep in Martian regolith simulant while sustaining ~120 N of anchoring force for a 300 g device (40:1 weight ratio).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the granular mechanics behind tip-extending anchors and to bridge the gap between biological root insertion and robotic anchoring, with an aim to enable lightweight, deployable anchors for hard-to-access or extraterrestrial environments.

Method: Modeling and experimental study of terradynamics comparing tip-extending anchors to traditional piling-like intruders; derive design insights, then implement a soft robotic, root-inspired anchor; test deployment depth, insertion and extraction forces in loose Martian regolith simulant and quantify anchoring performance.

Result: Identified design guidelines that increase extraction vs insertion ratio: (i) extend beyond a critical depth; (ii) include hair-like protrusions; (iii) extend near-vertically; (iv) use multiple smaller anchors. Realized a 300 g device that inserts with force less than its weight, deployed sensors 45 cm deep, and anchored with ~120 N, achieving a 40:1 anchoring-to-weight ratio.

Conclusion: Tip-extending, root-inspired anchoring can achieve high anchoring performance with low insertion effort. The combined insights point to a scalable strategy using multiple small anchors and vertical extension to maximize extraction force, with clear applicability to lightweight robotic anchoring in terrestrial and extraterrestrial soils.

Abstract: Most engineered pilings require substantially more force to be driven into the ground than they can resist during extraction. This requires relatively heavy equipment for insertion, which is problematic for anchoring in hard-to-access sites, including in extraterrestrial locations. In contrast, for tree roots, the external reaction force required to extract is much greater than required to insert--little more than the weight of the seed initiates insertion. This is partly due to the mechanism by which roots insert into the ground: tip extension. Proof-of-concept robotic prototypes have shown the benefits of using this mechanism, but a rigorous understanding of the underlying granular mechanics and how they inform the design of a robotic anchor is lacking. Here, we study the terradynamics of tip-extending anchors compared to traditional piling-like intruders, develop a set of design insights, and apply these to create a deployable robotic anchor. Specifically, we identify that to increase an anchor's ratio of extraction force to insertion force, it should: (i) extend beyond a critical depth; (ii) include hair-like protrusions; (iii) extend near-vertically, and (iv) incorporate multiple smaller anchors rather than a single large anchor. Synthesizing these insights, we developed a lightweight, soft robotic, root-inspired anchoring device that inserts into the ground with a reaction force less than its weight. We demonstrate that the 300 g device can deploy a series of temperature sensors 45 cm deep into loose Martian regolith simulant while anchoring with an average of 120 N, resulting in an anchoring-to-weight ratio of 40:1.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hand-agnostic system converts human hand manipulation demonstrations from videos into dexterous manipulation trajectories, using a progressive transfer framework to bridge kinematic and dynamic gaps across dexterous hands; achieves 73% transfer success and data-efficient generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity and high cost of collecting dexterous manipulation data with multi-fingered robot hands hinder data-driven policy learning; a scalable, hand-agnostic transfer from human demonstrations is needed.

Method: Progressive transfer framework: (1) establish primary dexterous-hand control signals via kinematic matching; (2) train residual policies with action-space rescaling and thumb-guided initialization to optimize contact interactions under unified rewards; (3) compute wrist trajectories to preserve operational semantics; automatic system parameter configuration from human videos to suit tasks, hands, and object categories.

Result: Average transfer success rate of 73%; the system generates smooth, semantically correct dexterous manipulation trajectories that reproduce human intent, with high efficiency and generalizability.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable, data-efficient pipeline to convert human manipulation demonstrations into usable dexterous manipulation data across different hands, objects, and tasks.

Abstract: The inherent difficulty and limited scalability of collecting manipulation data using multi-fingered robot hand hardware platforms have resulted in severe data scarcity, impeding research on data-driven dexterous manipulation policy learning. To address this challenge, we present a hand-agnostic manipulation transfer system. It efficiently converts human hand manipulation sequences from demonstration videos into high-quality dexterous manipulation trajectories without requirements of massive training data. To tackle the multi-dimensional disparities between human hands and dexterous hands, as well as the challenges posed by high-degree-of-freedom coordinated control of dexterous hands, we design a progressive transfer framework: first, we establish primary control signals for dexterous hands based on kinematic matching; subsequently, we train residual policies with action space rescaling and thumb-guided initialization to dynamically optimize contact interactions under unified rewards; finally, we compute wrist control trajectories with the objective of preserving operational semantics. Using only human hand manipulation videos, our system automatically configures system parameters for different tasks, balancing kinematic matching and dynamic optimization across dexterous hands, object categories, and tasks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework can automatically generate smooth and semantically correct dexterous hand manipulation that faithfully reproduces human intentions, achieving high efficiency and strong generalizability with an average transfer success rate of 73%, providing an easily implementable and scalable method for collecting robot dexterous manipulation data.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes an algorithm to coordinate robotic swarms, enabling seamless transitions between configurations using geometric formulations mapped to the physical domain through control, localization, and mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coordinating many robots is computationally hard due to combinatorial path planning and real-world uncertainties (measurement error, dynamics). The abstract argues the need for robust, scalable methods to determine optimal paths, reconfiguration, and motion.

Method: An algorithmic framework that uses geometric formulations of swarm configurations and maps them to the physical domain via control, localization, and mapping techniques to enable seamless transitions between configurations and distributed coordination.

Result: The abstract claims to provide an algorithm for coordinating swarms and enabling seamless transitions between configurations, leveraging geometric formulations mapped to the physical domain; it discusses handling measurement error and control dynamics and aims to enable more sophisticated distributed swarm behaviors. No empirical results are reported in the abstract.

Conclusion: The work lays groundwork for novel swarm applications by enabling sophisticated distributed behaviors through geometric configuration formulations and their realization in the physical domain via control/localization/mapping techniques.

Abstract: Coordination of movement and configuration in robotic swarms is a challenging endeavor. Deciding when and where each individual robot must move is a computationally complex problem. The challenge is further exacerbated by difficulties inherent to physical systems, such as measurement error and control dynamics. Thus, how to best determine the optimal path for each robot, when moving from one configuration to another, and how to best perform such determination and effect corresponding motion remains an open problem. In this paper, we show an algorithm for such coordination of robotic swarms. Our methods allow seamless transition from one configuration to another, leveraging geometric formulations that are mapped to the physical domain through appropriate control, localization, and mapping techniques. This paves the way for novel applications of robotic swarms by enabling more sophisticated distributed behaviors.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LS-NWM is a lightweight latent-space navigation world model trained and run entirely in latent space, achieving major speedups and improved navigation metrics by predicting future latent states instead of pixels, with autoregressive multi-frame training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional navigation relies on accurate localization and mapping; world models are computationally expensive to train and run; pixel-perfect predictions are often unnecessary for navigation, motivating a lighter latent-space approach.

Method: Train and operate entirely in latent space; predict future latent states from current observational features and action inputs; perform planning and decision-making within this latent representation; use an autoregressive multi-frame prediction strategy to capture long-term spatiotemporal dependencies.

Result: Training time reduced by ~3.2x; planning time reduced by ~447x; SR improved by ~35%; SPL improved by ~11%; achieves state-of-the-art navigation performance with substantial efficiency gains over existing approaches.

Conclusion: Latent-space navigation models can achieve state-of-the-art navigation performance with significantly lower computational cost; pixel-level environmental prediction may be unnecessary for navigation; autoregressive latent predictions enhance performance in complex scenarios.

Abstract: Traditional navigation methods rely heavily on accurate localization and mapping. In contrast, world models that capture environmental dynamics in latent space have opened up new perspectives for navigation tasks, enabling systems to move beyond traditional multi-module pipelines. However, world model often suffers from high computational costs in both training and inference. To address this, we propose LS-NWM - a lightweight latent space navigation world model that is trained and operates entirely in latent space, compared to the state-of-the-art baseline, our method reduces training time by approximately 3.2x and planning time by about 447x,while further improving navigation performance with a 35% higher SR and an 11% higher SPL. The key idea is that accurate pixel-wise environmental prediction is unnecessary for navigation. Instead, the model predicts future latent states based on current observational features and action inputs, then performs path planning and decision-making within this compact representation, significantly improving computational efficiency. By incorporating an autoregressive multi-frame prediction strategy during training, the model effectively captures long-term spatiotemporal dependencies, thereby enhancing navigation performance in complex scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art navigation performance while maintaining a substantial efficiency advantage over existing approaches.

Method: Design and implement a 1:15-scale miniature testbed (CIVAT) consisting of a scaled urban map, autonomous vehicles with onboard sensors, and smart infrastructure; integrate V2V and V2I communications using a publish-subscribe pattern over Wi‑Fi and ROS2 to enable information exchange for cooperative driving.

Abstract: Cooperative autonomous driving, which extends vehicle autonomy by enabling real-time collaboration between vehicles and smart roadside infrastructure, remains a challenging yet essential problem. However, none of the existing testbeds employ smart infrastructure equipped with sensing, edge computing, and communication capabilities. To address this gap, we design and implement a 1:15-scale miniature testbed, CIVAT, for validating cooperative autonomous driving, consisting of a scaled urban map, autonomous vehicles with onboard sensors, and smart infrastructure. The proposed testbed integrates V2V and V2I communication with the publish-subscribe pattern through a shared Wi-Fi and ROS2 framework, enabling information exchange between vehicles and infrastructure to realize cooperative driving functionality. As a case study, we validate the system through infrastructure-based perception and intersection management experiments.

*Jinxuan Zhu,Chenrui Tie,Xinyi Cao,Yuran Wang,Jingxiang Guo,Zixuan Chen,Haonan Chen,Junting Chen,Yangyu Xiao,Ruihai Wu,Lin Shao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ApaptPNP is a vision-language model (VLM)-driven task and motion planning framework that unifies prehensile and non-prehensile manipulation by generating high-level plans, using a digital-twin intermediate layer for object pose rehearsal, and a control module for low-level execution with online replanning; validated in sim and real world.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generalizing manipulation across tasks, objects, and environments requires a unified framework that decides when to use non-prehensile skills, selects appropriate primitives, and composes P and NP actions into robust, multi-step plans, bridging perception, planning, and execution while enabling online adaptation.

Method: Leverage a vision-language model to interpret scene observations and textual task descriptions to generate a high-level plan skeleton (sequence and coordination of P and NP actions). Use a digital-twin based object-centric intermediate layer to predict desired object poses for mental rehearsal of manipulation sequences. A control module translates plans into low-level robot commands, with execution feedback enabling online plan refinement and adaptive replanning through the VLM.

Result: Evaluation across representative P&NP hybrid manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments shows that ApaptPNP can effectively select and combine P and NP actions, with online replanning capabilities enhancing robustness and adaptability.

Conclusion: Hybrid P&NP manipulation represents a crucial step toward general-purpose robotic manipulation, and ApaptPNP demonstrates the viability of a vision-language guided framework to orchestrate prehensile and non-prehensile skills for complex tasks.

Abstract: Non-prehensile (NP) manipulation, in which robots alter object states without forming stable grasps (for example, pushing, poking, or sliding), significantly broadens robotic manipulation capabilities when grasping is infeasible or insufficient. However, enabling a unified framework that generalizes across different tasks, objects, and environments while seamlessly integrating non-prehensile and prehensile (P) actions remains challenging: robots must determine when to invoke NP skills, select the appropriate primitive for each context, and compose P and NP strategies into robust, multi-step plans. We introduce ApaptPNP, a vision-language model (VLM)-empowered task and motion planning framework that systematically selects and combines P and NP skills to accomplish diverse manipulation objectives. Our approach leverages a VLM to interpret visual scene observations and textual task descriptions, generating a high-level plan skeleton that prescribes the sequence and coordination of P and NP actions. A digital-twin based object-centric intermediate layer predicts desired object poses, enabling proactive mental rehearsal of manipulation sequences. Finally, a control module synthesizes low-level robot commands, with continuous execution feedback enabling online task plan refinement and adaptive replanning through the VLM. We evaluate ApaptPNP across representative P&NP hybrid manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments. These results underscore the potential of hybrid P&NP manipulation as a crucial step toward general-purpose, human-level robotic manipulation capabilities.

*Chenhao Liu,Leyun Jiang,Yibo Wang,Kairan Yao,Jinchen Fu,Xiaoyu Ren*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A reinforcement-learning-based three-stage training pipeline yields a unified whole-body controller for humanoid badminton, enabling coordinated lower-body footwork and upper-body striking, with an optional EKF-based trajectory predictor; validated in simulation and real robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world humanoid manipulation requires dynamic interaction under changing conditions; deterministic/planned policies struggle with environment dynamics; aim to enable dynamic, fast, precise badminton-like tasks without motion priors or expert demos.

Method: Train with a three-stage curriculum: 1) footwork acquisition, 2) precision-guided racket swing generation, 3) task-focused refinement; produce a unified whole-body controller for footwork and striking. Deployment uses an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate/predict shuttlecock trajectories; also provide a prediction-free variant that omits EKF.

Result: Simulation: two robots sustain a 21-hit rally; prediction-free variant achieves comparable performance to a target-known policy. Real-world: high accuracy in both predicted and controller modules; on-court hits reach 10 m/s shuttle speed with mean return landing distance of 3.5 m.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that humanoid robots can achieve highly dynamic yet precise goal-striking in badminton via RL-based three-stage training; framework is adaptable to other dynamic domains; reveals trade-offs between trajectory prediction (EKF) and a prediction-free approach.

Abstract: Humanoid robots have demonstrated strong capability for interacting with deterministic scenes across locomotion, manipulation, and more challenging loco-manipulation tasks. Yet the real world is dynamic, quasi-static interactions are insufficient to cope with the various environmental conditions. As a step toward more dynamic interaction scenario, we present a reinforcement-learning-based training pipeline that produces a unified whole-body controller for humanoid badminton, enabling coordinated lower-body footwork and upper-body striking without any motion priors or expert demonstrations. Training follows a three-stage curriculum: first footwork acquisition, then precision-guided racket swing generation, and finally task-focused refinement, yielding motions in which both legs and arms serve the hitting objective. For deployment, we incorporate an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to estimate and predict shuttlecock trajectories for target striking. We also introduce a prediction-free variant that dispenses with EKF and explicit trajectory prediction. To validate the framework, we conduct five sets of experiment in both simulation and the real world. In simulation, two robots sustain a rally of 21 consecutive hits. Moreover, the prediction-free variant achieves successful hits with comparable performance relative to the target-known policy. In real-world tests, both the prediction and controller module exhibit high accuracy, and on-court hitting achieves an outgoing shuttle speed up to 10 m/s with a mean return landing distance of 3.5 m. These experiment results show that our humanoid robot can deliver highly dynamic while precise goal striking in badminton, and can be adapted to more dynamism critical domains.

Conclusion: Advances in autonomous multi-robot manipulation of deformable, volumetric objects; the work may inspire and enable broader applications and future generalization to other deformable manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Advanced robotic manipulation of deformable, volumetric objects remains one of the greatest challenges due to their pliancy, frailness, variability, and uncertainties during interaction. Motivated by these challenges, this article introduces Sashimi-Bot, an autonomous multi-robotic system for advanced manipulation and cutting, specifically the preparation of sashimi. The objects that we manipulate, salmon loins, are natural in origin and vary in size and shape, they are limp and deformable with poorly characterized elastoplastic parameters, while also being slippery and hard to hold. The three robots straighten the loin; grasp and hold the knife; cut with the knife in a slicing motion while cooperatively stabilizing the loin during cutting; and pick up the thin slices from the cutting board or knife blade. Our system combines deep reinforcement learning with in-hand tool shape manipulation, in-hand tool cutting, and feedback of visual and tactile information to achieve robustness to the variabilities inherent in this task. This work represents a milestone in robotic manipulation of deformable, volumetric objects that may inspire and enable a wide range of other real-world applications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Benchmark study of four Vision-Language-Action models for robotic manipulation under a standardized evaluation framework, revealing trade-offs between generalization and in-distribution stability, with π0 excelling in out-of-distribution adaptability and ACT excelling in in-distribution stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic real-world evaluation and cross-model comparison of VLAs in robotics is scarce, hindering deployment decisions; there is a need to quantify accuracy, efficiency, adaptability, and instruction-following across tasks and settings.

Method: Evaluate ACT, OpenVLA-OFT, RDT-1B, π0 on four manipulation tasks in simulation and on the ALOHA Mobile platform using a standardized framework that measures accuracy/efficiency, adaptability (in-distribution, spatial out-of-distribution, instance-plus-spatial out-of-distribution), and language instruction-following accuracy.

Result: π0 shows superior adaptability in out-of-distribution scenarios; ACT is most stable in-distribution; differences in compute demands, data scaling, and recurring failure modes (near-miss grasps, premature releases, long-horizon state drift).

Conclusion: These results reveal practical trade-offs among VLA architectures for precision, generalization, and deployment cost, yielding actionable guidance for selecting and deploying VLAs in real-world robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Foundation models applied in robotics, particularly \textbf{Vision--Language--Action (VLA)} models, hold great promise for achieving general-purpose manipulation. Yet, systematic real-world evaluations and cross-model comparisons remain scarce. This paper reports our \textbf{empirical experiences} from benchmarking four representative VLAs -- \textbf{ACT}, \textbf{OpenVLA--OFT}, \textbf{RDT-1B}, and \boldmath{$π_0$} -- across four manipulation tasks conducted in both simulation and on the \textbf{ALOHA Mobile} platform. We establish a \textbf{standardized evaluation framework} that measures performance along three key dimensions: (1) \textit{accuracy and efficiency} (success rate and time-to-success), (2) \textit{adaptability} across in-distribution, spatial out-of-distribution, and instance-plus-spatial out-of-distribution settings, and (3) \textit{language instruction-following accuracy}. Through this process, we observe that \boldmath{$π_0$} demonstrates superior adaptability in out-of-distribution scenarios, while \textbf{ACT} provides the highest stability in-distribution. Further analysis highlights differences in computational demands, data-scaling behavior, and recurring failure modes such as near-miss grasps, premature releases, and long-horizon state drift. These findings reveal practical trade-offs among VLA model architectures in balancing precision, generalization, and deployment cost, offering actionable insights for selecting and deploying VLAs in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

*Xuyang Zhang,Jiaqi Jiang,Zhuo Chen,Yongqiang Zhao,Tianqi Yang,Daniel Fernandes Gomes,Jianan Wang,Shan Luo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SimTac is a physics-based framework for designing and validating biomorphic tactile sensors. It combines particle-based deformation modeling, light-field rendering for photorealistic tactile image generation, and a neural network to predict mechanical responses, enabling rapid design and validation across diverse morphologies and materials, with demonstrated Sim2Real tasks like object classification, slip detection, and contact safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biological tactile sensing is tightly linked to morphology (e.g., fingers, trunks), while robotics tactile sensing has largely used planar geometries. There is a gap between bio-inspired morphologies and practical, validated sensors. A physics-based, morphologically expressive simulation that can guide design and bridge to real prototypes would expand the tactile sensing design space and enable robust unstructured-environment interaction.

Method: A three-part pipeline: (1) particle-based deformation modeling to simulate sensor mechanics across morphologies and materials; (2) light-field rendering to generate photorealistic tactile images from deformations; (3) a neural network to predict mechanical responses from geometry/materials, enabling fast, accurate predictions. The framework supports designing physical sensor prototypes inspired by biological tactile structures and validating them via simulated-to- real tasks.

Result: Demonstrates versatility across multiple Sim2Real tactile tasks (object classification, slip detection, contact safety assessment) and validates physical sensor prototypes, showing accurate mechanical predictions and photorealistic tactile image generation across diverse geometries and materials.

Conclusion: SimTac bridges bio-inspired design and practical realization, expanding the tactile sensor design space by integrating morphology and sensing, enabling robust interaction in unstructured environments.

Abstract: Tactile sensing in biological organisms is deeply intertwined with morphological form, such as human fingers, cat paws, and elephant trunks, which enables rich and adaptive interactions through a variety of geometrically complex structures. In contrast, vision-based tactile sensors in robotics have been limited to simple planar geometries, with biomorphic designs remaining underexplored. To address this gap, we present SimTac, a physics-based simulation framework for the design and validation of biomorphic tactile sensors. SimTac consists of particle-based deformation modeling, light-field rendering for photorealistic tactile image generation, and a neural network for predicting mechanical responses, enabling accurate and efficient simulation across a wide range of geometries and materials. We demonstrate the versatility of SimTac by designing and validating physical sensor prototypes inspired by biological tactile structures and further demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple Sim2Real tactile tasks, including object classification, slip detection, and contact safety assessment. Our framework bridges the gap between bio-inspired design and practical realisation, expanding the design space of tactile sensors and paving the way for tactile sensing systems that integrate morphology and sensing to enable robust interaction in unstructured environments.

TL;DR: A non-Markovian object-centric manipulation benchmark (LIBERO-Mem) reveals challenges for memory-less policies, while Embodied-SlotSSM offers a scalable slot-based VLA framework that preserves object-level identities to enable temporally grounded actions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle partial observability and history-dependent decision-making in object-centric robotic manipulation. Without persistent object memory, visuomotor policies struggle to track interactions, leading to repeated or missed actions, especially with visually similar objects.

Method: Introduce LIBERO-Mem, a task suite combining short- and long-horizon object tracking with temporally sequenced subgoals. Propose Embodied-SlotSSM, a slot-centric VLA model that (1) maintains consistent slot identities over time and (2) uses slot-state-space modeling to reconstruct short-term history and a relational encoder to align tokens with action decoding for temporally grounded decisions.

Result: Experimental results show Embodied-SlotSSM provides baseline performance on LIBERO-Mem and general tasks, demonstrating scalable non-Markovian reasoning capabilities in object-centric robotic policies.

Conclusion: A slot-based, temporally aware VLA framework can scale to non-Markovian decision-making in embodied robotics, enabling context-aware action prediction through persistent object slots and structured memory.

Abstract: As embodied agents operate in increasingly complex environments, the ability to perceive, track, and reason about individual object instances over time becomes essential, especially in tasks requiring sequenced interactions with visually similar objects. In these non-Markovian settings, key decision cues are often hidden in object-specific histories rather than the current scene. Without persistent memory of prior interactions (what has been interacted with, where it has been, or how it has changed) visuomotor policies may fail, repeat past actions, or overlook completed ones. To surface this challenge, we introduce LIBERO-Mem, a non-Markovian task suite for stress-testing robotic manipulation under object-level partial observability. It combines short- and long-horizon object tracking with temporally sequenced subgoals, requiring reasoning beyond the current frame. However, vision-language-action (VLA) models often struggle in such settings, with token scaling quickly becoming intractable even for tasks spanning just a few hundred frames. We propose Embodied-SlotSSM, a slot-centric VLA framework built for temporal scalability. It maintains spatio-temporally consistent slot identities and leverages them through two mechanisms: (1) slot-state-space modeling for reconstructing short-term history, and (2) a relational encoder to align the input tokens with action decoding. Together, these components enable temporally grounded, context-aware action prediction. Experiments show Embodied-SlotSSM's baseline performance on LIBERO-Mem and general tasks, offering a scalable solution for non-Markovian reasoning in object-centric robotic policies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unclear how safety requirements for self-driving cars will be verified and certified; a clear framework and pipeline is needed to certify autonomous vehicle safety.

Method: Comparative evaluation of prominent certification methods; development of a certification pipeline for autonomous vehicles; identification of stages, actors, and areas where methods can be applied.

Result: Yields a proposed certification pipeline and a mapping of each method to specific stages, actors, and application areas within the certification process.

Conclusion: A systematic certification pipeline is necessary, and the effective use of the methods depends on mapping them to defined stages and stakeholders in the certification process.

Abstract: The "Vision Zero" policy, introduced by the Swedish Parliament in 1997, aims to eliminate fatalities and serious injuries resulting from traffic accidents. To achieve this goal, the use of self-driving vehicles in traffic is envisioned and a roadmap for the certification of self-driving vehicles is aimed to be determined. However, it is still unclear how the basic safety requirements that autonomous vehicles must meet will be verified and certified, and which methods will be used. This paper focuses on the comparative evaluation of the prominent methods planned to be used in the certification process of autonomous vehicles. It examines the prominent methods used in the certification process, develops a pipeline for the certification process of autonomous vehicles, and determines the stages, actors, and areas where the addressed methods can be applied.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of standardization across tactile sensors causing redundant features and poor cross-sensor generalization; existing methods underutilize tri-modal interactions. A fair evaluation protocol is needed.

Method: Proposes Sensor-Aware Modulator to unify tactile features across sensors; tactile-irrelevant decoupled learning to disentangle irrelevant tactile features; Unified Bridging Adapter to enhance tri-modal interaction within a shared representation space; based on CLIP framework for cross-modal alignment.

Result: Demonstrates significant improvement in sensor-agnostic representation learning and cross-modal alignment; validates TLV-CoRe as a new direction for multimodal tactile representation; introduces RSS framework focusing on Robustness, Synergy, Stability.

Conclusion: TLV-CoRe enables better cross-sensor generalization and tri-modal integration for tactile representation; RSS provides fair evaluation for tactile models; potential to advance multimodal tactile understanding.

Abstract: Tactile sensing offers rich and complementary information to vision and language, enabling robots to perceive fine-grained object properties. However, existing tactile sensors lack standardization, leading to redundant features that hinder cross-sensor generalization. Moreover, existing methods fail to fully integrate the intermediate communication among tactile, language, and vision modalities. To address this, we propose TLV-CoRe, a CLIP-based Tactile-Language-Vision Collaborative Representation learning method. TLV-CoRe introduces a Sensor-Aware Modulator to unify tactile features across different sensors and employs tactile-irrelevant decoupled learning to disentangle irrelevant tactile features. Additionally, a Unified Bridging Adapter is introduced to enhance tri-modal interaction within the shared representation space. To fairly evaluate the effectiveness of tactile models, we further propose the RSS evaluation framework, focusing on Robustness, Synergy, and Stability across different methods. Experimental results demonstrate that TLV-CoRe significantly improves sensor-agnostic representation learning and cross-modal alignment, offering a new direction for multimodal tactile representation.

TL;DR: Reframes coverage motion planning as a flow-matching inference problem, unifying divergence measures with LQR, enabling GPU-accelerated, scalable trajectory generation versus waypoint-tracking methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coverage planning requires managing the spatial distribution of entire trajectories; traditional motion planning is computationally inefficient and poorly parallelizable. A scalable, parallelizable formulation is needed.

Method: Formulate coverage motion planning as a flow-matching statistical inference problem, unifying Kullback-Leibler and Sinkhorn divergences with a standard linear quadratic regulator (LQR) framework, while decoupling the gradient generation for coverage from nonlinear control synthesis to enable GPU parallelization.

Result: Demonstrates significant acceleration through parallelization and improved scalability, with computational benefits over conventional waypoint-tracking methods.

Conclusion: The proposed flow-matching formulation provides a scalable, GPU-friendly approach to coverage motion planning, outperforming traditional waypoint-tracking-based methods in computational efficiency.

Abstract: Coverage motion planning is essential to a wide range of robotic tasks. Unlike conventional motion planning problems, which reason over temporal sequences of states, coverage motion planning requires reasoning over the spatial distribution of entire trajectories, making standard motion planning methods limited in computational efficiency and less amenable to modern parallelization frameworks. In this work, we formulate the coverage motion planning problem as a statistical inference problem from the perspective of flow matching, a generative modeling technique that has gained significant attention in recent years. The proposed formulation unifies commonly used statistical discrepancy measures, such as Kullback-Leibler divergence and Sinkhorn divergence, with a standard linear quadratic regulator problem. More importantly, it decouples the generation of trajectory gradients for coverage from the synthesis of control under nonlinear system dynamics, enabling significant acceleration through parallelization on modern computational architectures, particularly Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). This paper focuses on the advantages of this formulation in terms of scalability through parallelization, highlighting its computational benefits compared to conventional methods based on waypoint tracking.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Action-conditioned video generation models can serve as scalable world models to evaluate robotic manipulation policies without direct real-world testing, leveraging pre-trained video models and internet-scale data to enable policy ranking and prediction-value correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world evaluation of generalist manipulation policies is expensive, time-consuming, and risky due to the need for frequent environment resets and safety concerns. Building large simulated environments is costly and often suffers from sim-to-real gaps. A scalable evaluation method using video-conditioned models can leverage broad internet-scale data and reduce the burden of collecting paired video-action datasets.

Method: Incorporate action conditioning into existing pre-trained video generation architectures. Fine-tune or train to model dynamics conditioned on actions, enabling the model to predict outcomes of policies given their action sequences. Use these models to evaluate policies by ranking and estimating their expected performance without real-world interactions. Systematically study dataset diversity, pre-trained weights, and common failure modes across the evaluation pipeline.

Result: The experiments show that action-conditioned video generation models can provide a meaningful evaluation signal, achieving reasonable policy rankings and a correlation between actual and predicted policy values, suggesting they can serve as a scalable surrogate for real-world policy evaluation.

Conclusion: Action-conditioned video generation-based world models are a promising, scalable approach for evaluating robotic manipulation policies, potentially reducing real-world testing costs and safety risks. Further work is needed to explore dataset diversity, initialization strategies, and failure modes to strengthen reliability.

Abstract: Training generalist policies for robotic manipulation has shown great promise, as they enable language-conditioned, multi-task behaviors across diverse scenarios. However, evaluating these policies remains difficult because real-world testing is expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. It also requires frequent environment resets and carries safety risks when deploying unproven policies on physical robots. Manually creating and populating simulation environments with assets for robotic manipulation has not addressed these issues, primarily due to the significant engineering effort required and the often substantial sim-to-real gap, both in terms of physics and rendering. In this paper, we explore the use of action-conditional video generation models as a scalable way to learn world models for policy evaluation. We demonstrate how to incorporate action conditioning into existing pre-trained video generation models. This allows leveraging internet-scale in-the-wild online videos during the pre-training stage, and alleviates the need for a large dataset of paired video-action data, which is expensive to collect for robotic manipulation. Our paper examines the effect of dataset diversity, pre-trained weight and common failure cases for the proposed evaluation pipeline.Our experiments demonstrate that, across various metrics, including policy ranking and the correlation between actual policy values and predicted policy values, these models offer a promising approach for evaluating policies without requiring real-world interactions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPACER offers scaled preference conditioned all-terrain costmap generation that generalizes to unseen terrains via synthetic training data while enabling rapid test-time adjustment of relative costs through a user-specified preference context; it outperforms baselines on multiple environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need terrain costmaps that both generalize to diverse terrains and allow fast, mission-specific cost tuning at test time; existing methods typically optimize for one objective at the expense of the other.

Method: Introduce SPACER, a costmap generation framework that uses synthetic data during training to improve generalization to new terrains and conditions, and conditions the costmap generation on a scaled preference context at test time to rapidly adapt relative costs. Evaluation on large-scale aerial maps across multiple environments for global path planning.

Result: SPACER achieves the lowest measured regret across varied preferences in five of seven environments, outperforming competing approaches in global path planning tasks.

Conclusion: SPACER demonstrates that combining synthetic-data training and preference-conditioned test-time adaptation yields costmaps capable of broad generalization and fast, user-driven cost modification for off-road navigation.

Abstract: Successful autonomous robot navigation in off-road domains requires the ability to generate high-quality terrain costmaps that are able to both generalize well over a wide variety of terrains and rapidly adapt relative costs at test time to meet mission-specific needs. Existing approaches for costmap generation allow for either rapid test-time adaptation of relative costs (e.g., semantic segmentation methods) or generalization to new terrain types (e.g., representation learning methods), but not both. In this work, we present scaled preference conditioned all-terrain costmap generation (SPACER), a novel approach for generating terrain costmaps that leverages synthetic data during training in order to generalize well to new terrains, and allows for rapid test-time adaptation of relative costs by conditioning on a user-specified scaled preference context. Using large-scale aerial maps, we provide empirical evidence that SPACER outperforms other approaches at generating costmaps for terrain navigation, with the lowest measured regret across varied preferences in five of seven environments for global path planning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Volumetric ergodic control that accounts for robot size; preserves guarantees, real-time performance; improves coverage >2x with 100% task completion; validated on search/manipulation and robotic erasing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots interact with the environment through volume, so point-mass ergodic control misrepresents reality; a volumetric formulation could improve efficiency and realism.

Method: Introduce a volumetric state representation and adopt sample-based volumetric models into the ergodic control objective; maintain asymptotic coverage guarantees with minimal computational overhead; compatible with diverse dynamics and end-effector geometries.

Result: Empirical results show more than 2x improvement in coverage efficiency and 100% task completion across experiments, outperforming standard ergodic control; demonstrated on a robot arm performing mechanical erasing tasks.

Conclusion: Volumetric ergodic control delivers enhanced coverage performance while preserving guarantees and real-time applicability; widely applicable to search and manipulation tasks with various robots and sensors.

Abstract: Ergodic control synthesizes optimal coverage behaviors over spatial distributions for nonlinear systems. However, existing formulations model the robot as a non-volumetric point, but in practice a robot interacts with the environment through its body and sensors with physical volume. In this work, we introduce a new ergodic control formulation that optimizes spatial coverage using a volumetric state representation. Our method preserves the asymptotic coverage guarantees of ergodic control, adds minimal computational overhead for real-time control, and supports arbitrary sample-based volumetric models. We evaluate our method across search and manipulation tasks -- with multiple robot dynamics and end-effector geometries or sensor models -- and show that it improves coverage efficiency by more than a factor of two while maintaining a 100% task completion rate across all experiments, outperforming the standard ergodic control method. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a robot arm performing mechanical erasing tasks.

Abstract: Real-time energy forecasting on edge devices represents a major challenge for smart grid optimization and intelligent buildings. We present LAD-BNet (Lag-Aware Dual-Branch Network), an innovative neural architecture optimized for edge inference with Google Coral TPU. Our hybrid approach combines a branch dedicated to explicit exploitation of temporal lags with a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) featuring dilated convolutions, enabling simultaneous capture of short and long-term dependencies. Tested on real energy consumption data with 10-minute temporal resolution, LAD-BNet achieves 14.49% MAPE at 1-hour horizon with only 18ms inference time on Edge TPU, representing an 8-12 x acceleration compared to CPU.

Our model demonstrates a 2.39% improvement over LSTM baselines and 3.04% over pure TCN architectures, while maintaining a 180MB memory footprint suitable for embedded device constraints. These results pave the way for industrial applications in real-time energy optimization, demand management, and operational planning.

### [143] [LT-Soups: Bridging Head and Tail Classes via Subsampled Model Soups](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10683)
*Masih Aminbeidokhti,Subhankar Roy,Eric Granger,Elisa Ricci,Marco Pedersoli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LT-Soups is a two-stage model soup approach that outperforms PEFT and standard model soups in long-tailed regimes by balancing head-tail accuracy across diverse distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data are long-tailed, with head classes dominating. PEFT methods can preserve tail performance but at the cost of head accuracy, and the head-tail ratio (η) is a crucial but underexplored factor controlling this trade-off. A method that generalizes across LT regimes is needed.

Method: The authors perform controlled CIFAR100 experiments by varying the imbalance ratio (ρ) and head-tail ratio (η). They introduce LT-Soups, a two-stage model soups framework: stage 1 averages models fine-tuned on balanced subsets to reduce head bias; stage 2 fine-tunes only the classifier on the full dataset to restore head accuracy. They compare LT-Soups to PEFT methods and traditional model soups across six benchmark datasets.

Result: LT-Soups achieves superior head-tail trade-offs across a wide range of imbalance regimes, outperforming both PEFT approaches and traditional model soups on six benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: LT-Soups provides robust generalization across LT regimes by decoupling bias reduction (stage 1) from head-accuracy restoration (stage 2). The head-tail ratio is a key factor in understanding and optimizing long-tailed performance, and LT-Soups offers a practical framework for real-world long-tailed learning.

Abstract: Real-world datasets typically exhibit long-tailed (LT) distributions, where a few head classes dominate and many tail classes are severely underrepresented. While recent work shows that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and AdaptFormer preserve tail-class performance on foundation models such as CLIP, we find that they do so at the cost of head-class accuracy. We identify the head-tail ratio, the proportion of head to tail classes, as a crucial but overlooked factor influencing this trade-off. Through controlled experiments on CIFAR100 with varying imbalance ratio ($ρ$) and head-tail ratio ($η$), we show that PEFT excels in tail-heavy scenarios but degrades in more balanced and head-heavy distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LT-Soups, a two-stage model soups framework designed to generalize across diverse LT regimes. In the first stage, LT-Soups averages models fine-tuned on balanced subsets to reduce head-class bias; in the second, it fine-tunes only the classifier on the full dataset to restore head-class accuracy. Experiments across six benchmark datasets show that LT-Soups achieves superior trade-offs compared to both PEFT and traditional model soups across a wide range of imbalance regimes.

### [144] [Differentiable Sparse Identification of Lagrangian Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10706)
*Zitong Zhang,Hao Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A differentiable sparse identification framework that integrates cubic B-splines into Lagrangian system identification to robustly infer governing equations from noisy data, improving nonlinear representation and noise resilience over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-driven discovery of governing equations is hard, especially with nonlinearities and noise. Sparse regression struggles with rational terms; Lagrangian formulations offer concise dynamics but existing methods are sensitive to noise and data scarcity. This work aims to combine Lagrangian structure with differentiable sparse identification and B-spline-based derivatives to enhance robustness and accuracy.

Method: 1) Integrate cubic B-spline approximation into Lagrangian system identification. 2) Develop a robust equation discovery mechanism that uses measurements while enforcing known physical constraints. 3) Use a recursive derivative computation scheme based on B-spline basis functions to constrain higher-order derivatives and reduce noise for second-order systems.

Result: Empirical results indicate superior performance: improved accuracy and reliability in extracting physical laws from noisy data, particularly for complex mechanical systems, compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The framework enhances robustness to measurement noise and limited data, enabling reliable discovery of governing equations for complex mechanical systems via a Lagrangian-based, B-spline–driven differentiable sparse identification approach.

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of governing equations from data remains a fundamental challenge in nonlinear dynamics. Although sparse regression techniques have advanced system identification, they struggle with rational functions and noise sensitivity in complex mechanical systems. The Lagrangian formalism offers a promising alternative, as it typically avoids rational expressions and provides a more concise representation of system dynamics. However, existing Lagrangian identification methods are significantly affected by measurement noise and limited data availability. This paper presents a novel differentiable sparse identification framework that addresses these limitations through three key contributions: (1) the first integration of cubic B-Spline approximation into Lagrangian system identification, enabling accurate representation of complex nonlinearities, (2) a robust equation discovery mechanism that effectively utilizes measurements while incorporating known physical constraints, (3) a recursive derivative computation scheme based on B-spline basis functions, effectively constraining higher-order derivatives and reducing noise sensitivity on second-order dynamical systems. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance and enables more accurate and reliable extraction of physical laws from noisy data, particularly in complex mechanical systems compared to baseline methods.

### [145] [Bias-Restrained Prefix Representation Finetuning for Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10707)
*Sirui Liang,Pengfei Cao,Jian Zhao,Cong Huang,Jun Zhao,Kang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BREP ReFT fixes ReFT's math-reasoning weakness by optimizing initial reasoning prefixes (data truncation), preventing early-inference error accumulation, and constraining intervention magnitude to preserve numerical encoding, yielding better math performance, efficiency, and generalization over ReFT and PEFT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReFT is parameter-efficient and often outperforms PEFT, but it struggles with mathematical reasoning due to poor initial reasoning prefixes and disturbance in numeric encoding during CoT. PEFT is less disruptive but less effective on math tasks. The goal is to enhance ReFT's math reasoning while maintaining efficiency and generalization.

Method: Introduce Bias-REstrained Prefix Representation FineTuning (BREP ReFT). Train data is truncated to optimize the generation of initial reasoning prefixes. The early inference stage is intervened to prevent error accumulation. Intervention vectors are constrained in magnitude to avoid distorting numerical encoding during CoT.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures show BREP ReFT achieves superior effectiveness, efficiency, and robust generalization, outperforming both standard ReFT and weight-based PEFT methods on mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: BREP ReFT offers a principled approach to boosting math reasoning in ReFT without sacrificing efficiency. It demonstrates strong generalization across architectures and datasets. Source code is available at the provided GitHub URL.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient finetuning (PEFT) enhances model performance on downstream tasks by updating a minimal subset of parameters. Representation finetuning (ReFT) methods further improve efficiency by freezing model weights and optimizing internal representations with fewer parameters than PEFT, outperforming PEFT on several tasks. However, ReFT exhibits a significant performance decline on mathematical reasoning tasks. To address this problem, the paper demonstrates that ReFT's poor performance on mathematical tasks primarily stems from its struggle to generate effective reasoning prefixes during the early inference phase. Moreover, ReFT disturbs the numerical encoding and the error accumulats during the CoT stage. Based on these observations, this paper proposes Bias-REstrained Prefix Representation FineTuning (BREP ReFT), which enhances ReFT's mathematical reasoning capability by truncating training data to optimize the generation of initial reasoning prefixes, intervening on the early inference stage to prevent error accumulation, and constraining the intervention vectors' magnitude to avoid disturbing numerical encoding. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures demonstrate BREP's superior effectiveness, efficiency, and robust generalization capability, outperforming both standard ReFT and weight-based PEFT methods on the task of mathematical reasoning.

### [146] [Towards Uncertainty Quantification in Generative Model Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10710)
*Giorgio Morales,Frederic Jurie,Jalal Fadili*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Formalizes uncertainty quantification in generative model learning and introduces ensemble-based precision–recall curves; preliminary synthetic experiments show aggregated PR curves capture model-approximation uncertainty and enable architecture comparisons by uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of generative models focuses on distribution closeness but ignores the inherent uncertainty in those measurements; there is a need to quantify how confidently a model approximates the target distribution and to compare models along that uncertainty axis.

Method: Formalize the problem of uncertainty quantification in generative learning; propose ensemble-based precision–recall curves as a practical tool; conduct preliminary experiments on synthetic datasets to demonstrate that aggregating PR curves can capture uncertainty and allow systematic model comparisons.

Result: Aggregated precision–recall curves effectively capture uncertainty in model approximation and enable systematic comparisons across architectures based on their uncertainty characteristics; preliminary synthetic results support the approach.

Conclusion: Uncertainty quantification is a viable and valuable direction for evaluating generative models; ensemble-based PR curves provide a practical mechanism to quantify and compare uncertainty, with various future research directions proposed.

Abstract: While generative models have become increasingly prevalent across various domains, fundamental concerns regarding their reliability persist. A crucial yet understudied aspect of these models is the uncertainty quantification surrounding their distribution approximation capabilities. Current evaluation methodologies focus predominantly on measuring the closeness between the learned and the target distributions, neglecting the inherent uncertainty in these measurements. In this position paper, we formalize the problem of uncertainty quantification in generative model learning. We discuss potential research directions, including the use of ensemble-based precision-recall curves. Our preliminary experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of aggregated precision-recall curves in capturing model approximation uncertainty, enabling systematic comparison among different model architectures based on their uncertainty characteristics.

*Jun Masaki,Ariaki Higashi,Naoko Shinagawa,Kazuhiko Hirata,Yuichi Kurita,Akira Furui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Automated FIM motor item scoring using a hybrid deep learning model that combines spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks, BiLSTM, and attention to estimate FIM scores from simple exercises; achieves ~70–79% balanced accuracy on transfer and locomotion items in 277 rehab patients, and identifies predictive movement patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the burden of traditional FIM assessments on patients and clinicians by enabling automated estimation using simple exercises, enabling scalable and objective evaluation of independence in daily living.

Method: A deep neural network architecture integrating a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN), bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and an attention mechanism to estimate FIM motor item scores from video or pose data collected during simple exercises. The model learns long-term temporal dependencies and assigns learned attention weights to identify key body-joint contributions. Evaluation on 277 rehabilitation patients focused on FIM transfer and locomotion items.

Result: The model differentiates completely independent patients from those needing assistance, achieving balanced accuracies in the 70.09–78.79% range across different FIM items. Analysis reveals specific movement patterns that serve as reliable predictors for particular FIM evaluations.

Conclusion: The proposed approach provides an effective, interpretable, and potentially scalable means to estimate FIM motor scores with reduced clinical burden, and it highlights meaningful movement patterns that predict FIM outcomes; further work may address generalizability and real-world deployment.

Abstract: The functional independence measure (FIM) is widely used to evaluate patients' physical independence in activities of daily living. However, traditional FIM assessment imposes a significant burden on both patients and healthcare professionals. To address this challenge, we propose an automated FIM score estimation method that utilizes simple exercises different from the designated FIM assessment actions. Our approach employs a deep neural network architecture integrating a spatial-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN), bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), and an attention mechanism to estimate FIM motor item scores. The model effectively captures long-term temporal dependencies and identifies key body-joint contributions through learned attention weights. We evaluated our method in a study of 277 rehabilitation patients, focusing on FIM transfer and locomotion items. Our approach successfully distinguishes between completely independent patients and those requiring assistance, achieving balanced accuracies of 70.09-78.79 % across different FIM items. Additionally, our analysis reveals specific movement patterns that serve as reliable predictors for particular FIM evaluation items.

### [148] [Fast Neural Tangent Kernel Alignment, Norm and Effective Rank via Trace Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10796)
*James Hazelden*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a matrix-free, trace-estimation framework to analyze the empirical, finite-width Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) using Hutch++ and one-sided estimators, enabling fast computation of trace, Frobenius norm, effective rank, and alignment with significant speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The NTK provides a lens into how models evolve under gradient descent, but computing the full, finite-width NTK is often infeasible for large or recurrent architectures; scalable, accurate analysis requires efficient, matrix-free tools.

Method: Develops randomized, matrix-free estimators for NTK properties. Uses Hutch++ to estimate traces and introduces one-sided estimators that exploit NTK structure so only forward- or reverse-mode AD is needed. Provides numerical recipes with convergence guarantees and discusses when one-sided estimators outperform Hutch++ in low-sample regimes.

Result: The approach yields provably fast convergence and large speedups (orders of magnitude) over dense NTK computations. It enables fast estimation of trace, Frobenius norm, effective rank, and alignment of the empirical NTK, and shows practical benefits of one-sided estimators in regimes with large parameter counts and limited samples.

Conclusion: Matrix-free, randomized trace estimators effectively enable rapid analysis and application of the NTK, making it feasible to assess various spectral properties and alignments without forming the full kernel matrix.

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) characterizes how a model's state evolves over Gradient Descent. Computing the full NTK matrix is often infeasible, especially for recurrent architectures. Here, we introduce a matrix-free perspective, using trace estimation to rapidly analyze the empirical, finite-width NTK. This enables fast computation of the NTK's trace, Frobenius norm, effective rank, and alignment. We provide numerical recipes based on the Hutch++ trace estimator with provably fast convergence guarantees. In addition, we show that, due to the structure of the NTK, one can compute the trace using only forward- or reverse-mode automatic differentiation, not requiring both modes. We show these so-called one-sided estimators can outperform Hutch++ in the low-sample regime, especially when the gap between the model state and parameter count is large. In total, our results demonstrate that matrix-free randomized approaches can yield speedups of many orders of magnitude, leading to faster analysis and applications of the NTK.

### [149] [Near-optimal Linear Predictive Clustering in Non-separable Spaces via Mixed Integer Programming and Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Reductions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10809)
*Jiazhou Liang,Hassan Khurram,Scott Sanner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LPC clustering with global optimization via MIP and QPBO approximations; novel approaches improve efficiency and scalability, yielding near-optimal solutions and lower regression errors than greedy methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LPC seeks clusters based on shared linear relations between features and target; greedy methods lack global optimality and struggle with overlapping clusters; a constrained optimization (MIP) approach guarantees global optimality but scales poorly. The aim is to achieve scalable, globally optimal or near-optimal LPC solutions.

Method: Develop two approaches that exploit separability properties to derive near-optimal approximations reducing MIP complexity; also formulate an alternative QPBO-based approximation of LPC to further improve computation in certain settings.

Result: Empirical analyses show near-optimal solutions with substantially lower regression errors than greedy optimization and improved scalability over existing MIP formulations.

Conclusion: The methods provide scalable, near-optimal LPC with better accuracy than greedy methods, and offer a viable, more scalable alternative to full MIP via QPBO in appropriate scenarios.

Abstract: Linear Predictive Clustering (LPC) partitions samples based on shared linear relationships between feature and target variables, with numerous applications including marketing, medicine, and education. Greedy optimization methods, commonly used for LPC, alternate between clustering and linear regression but lack global optimality. While effective for separable clusters, they struggle in non-separable settings where clusters overlap in feature space. In an alternative constrained optimization paradigm, Bertsimas and Shioda (2007) formulated LPC as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), ensuring global optimality regardless of separability but suffering from poor scalability. This work builds on the constrained optimization paradigm to introduce two novel approaches that improve the efficiency of global optimization for LPC. By leveraging key theoretical properties of separability, we derive near-optimal approximations with provable error bounds, significantly reducing the MIP formulation's complexity and improving scalability. Additionally, we can further approximate LPC as a Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) problem, achieving substantial computational improvements in some settings. Comparative analyses on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently achieve near-optimal solutions with substantially lower regression errors than greedy optimization while exhibiting superior scalability over existing MIP formulations.

### [150] [Transformers know more than they can tell -- Learning the Collatz sequence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10811)
*François Charton,Ashvni Narayanan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers learn the control structure of a complex arithmetic function (long Collatz step) and generalize via classifying inputs by binary residues; accuracy depends on encoding base; most errors stem from misestimating loop lengths rather than arithmetic mistakes; hallucinations are rare; the work offers a framework to study algorithmic learning in LMs using mathematical problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how language models learn and execute nontrivial arithmetic algorithms and to use mathematical problems as probes for the internal algorithms and control structures learned by transformers.

Method: Train transformer models to predict long Collatz steps under varying input/output encodings (bases). Analyze accuracy across bases, identify patterns by residue classes modulo 2^p, and inspect failure modes to infer the learned computation's structure and loop-length control.

Result: Accuracy varies with base: up to 99.7% for bases 24 and 32; as low as 37% and 25% for bases 11 and 3. Across all bases, models converge on a common pattern: they partition inputs into classes sharing the same residue modulo 2^p and achieve near-perfect accuracy on those classes while performing poorly on others (<1%). This mirrors a Collatz property where loop lengths are determined by the binary representation of the input. Failures mostly involve incorrect loop-length estimates rather than arithmetic miscalculations, and hallucinations are rare in this setting (over 90% of failures still compute correctly but misjudge loop length). The study argues that learning the control structure (loop lengths) is the main difficulty and that mathematical problems can illuminate and guide improvements in language models.

Conclusion: The work provides a coherent account of the algorithms learned by transformers on a nontrivial arithmetic task, highlighting the central role of control structure in algorithmic learning. It suggests a general methodology for using mathematical problems to probe, explain, and potentially improve LM capabilities, with implications for broader classes of algorithmic reasoning.

Abstract: We investigate transformer prediction of long Collatz steps, a complex arithmetic function that maps odd integers to their distant successors in the Collatz sequence ( $u_{n+1}=u_n/2$ if $u_n$ is even, $u_{n+1}=(3u_n+1)/2$ if $u_n$ is odd). Model accuracy varies with the base used to encode input and output. It can be as high as $99.7\%$ for bases $24$ and $32$, and as low as $37$ and $25\%$ for bases $11$ and $3$. Yet, all models, no matter the base, follow a common learning pattern. As training proceeds, they learn a sequence of classes of inputs that share the same residual modulo $2^p$. Models achieve near-perfect accuracy on these classes, and less than $1\%$ for all other inputs. This maps to a mathematical property of Collatz sequences: the length of the loops involved in the computation of a long Collatz step can be deduced from the binary representation of its input. The learning pattern reflects the model learning to predict inputs associated with increasing loop lengths. An analysis of failure cases reveals that almost all model errors follow predictable patterns. Hallucination, a common feature of large language models, almost never happens. In over $90\%$ of failures, the model performs the correct calculation, but wrongly estimates loop lengths. Our observations give a full account of the algorithms learned by the models. They suggest that the difficulty of learning such complex arithmetic function lies in figuring the control structure of the computation -- the length of the loops. We believe that the approach outlined here, using mathematical problems as tools for understanding, explaining, and perhaps improving language models, can be applied to a broad range of problems and bear fruitful results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High computational cost of training neural operators and limited generalization motivate exploring transfer learning and cross-problem transfer to reduce training effort and extend applicability.

Method: Evaluate transformer-based neural operators on diverse PDE tasks, including extrapolation to unseen parameters, incorporation of new variables, and transfer from multi-equation datasets, to assess generalization and transfer capabilities.

Result: Advanced neural operator architectures are effective at transferring knowledge across PDE problems, demonstrating promising generalization across parameter regimes, variables, and datasets.

Conclusion: Transformer-based neural operators exhibit generalizable transfer capabilities across PDE problems, supporting their use for broader, data-driven physics simulations with improved efficiency.

Abstract: Although neural operators are widely used in data-driven physical simulations, their training remains computationally expensive. Recent advances address this issue via downstream learning, where a model pretrained on simpler problems is fine-tuned on more complex ones. In this research, we investigate transformer-based neural operators, which have previously been applied only to specific problems, in a more general transfer learning setting. We evaluate their performance across diverse PDE problems, including extrapolation to unseen parameters, incorporation of new variables, and transfer from multi-equation datasets. Our results demonstrate that advanced neural operator architectures can effectively transfer knowledge across PDE problems.

Motivation: To address the gap in verifying practical quantum kernel advantages on diverse, high-dimensional real-world data beyond synthetic benchmarks.

Method: Develop a variational quantum kernel framework using resource-efficient ansätze; introduce a parameter scaling technique to accelerate convergence; benchmark on eight challenging real-world datasets spanning tabular, image, time series, and graph data; simulations performed classically.

Result: The quantum kernel demonstrated a clear performance advantage over standard classical kernels such as the RBF in the simulations.

Conclusion: Properly designed quantum kernels can be versatile, high-performance tools for real-world machine learning; lays a foundation for quantum-enhanced applications. However, further work is needed to assess practical quantum advantage.

Abstract: Quantum kernel methods are a promising branch of quantum machine learning, yet their practical advantage on diverse, high-dimensional, real-world data remains unverified. Current research has largely been limited to low-dimensional or synthetic datasets, preventing a thorough evaluation of their potential. To address this gap, we developed a variational quantum kernel framework utilizing resource-efficient ansätze for complex classification tasks and introduced a parameter scaling technique to accelerate convergence. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark of this framework on eight challenging, real world and high-dimensional datasets covering tabular, image, time series, and graph data. Our classically simulated results show that the proposed quantum kernel demonstrated a clear performance advantage over standard classical kernels, such as the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. This work demonstrates that properly designed quantum kernels can function as versatile, high-performance tools, laying a foundation for quantum-enhanced applications in real-world machine learning. Further research is needed to fully assess the practical quantum advantage.

*Sanchit Kabra,Shobhnik Kriplani,Parshin Shojaee,Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A comprehensive 3D surface-focused benchmark (SurfaceBench) for symbolic surface discovery, leveraging geometry-aware metrics and diverse surface representations to evaluate LLM-based symbolic regression.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing symbolic regression benchmarks emphasize scalar functions, lack domain grounding, and rely on brittle string-matching metrics. SurfaceBench fills this gap by providing 183 tasks across 15 symbolic categories (explicit, implicit, parametric) with ground-truth equations, semantic labeling, and synthetic 3D data, grounded in scientific domains.

Method: Introduce SurfaceBench with 183 tasks covering explicit/implicit/parametric surface representations across 15 complexity categories. Each task includes ground-truth equations, variable semantics, and synthetic 3D data. Evaluation combines algebraic symbolic checks with geometry-aware metrics (Chamfer and Hausdorff distances) to assess both algebraic fidelity and spatial reconstruction. Tests LLM-based symbolic regression on diverse representations.

Result: State-of-the-art SR frameworks show limited generalization across representation types and surface complexities; occasional success on specific families but overall challenging, indicating memorization risks and representation gaps. SurfaceBench acts as a diagnostic, exposing compositional generalization and geometry-aware reasoning limits.

Conclusion: SurfaceBench provides a principled, geometry-aware benchmark that bridges symbolic reasoning with geometric reconstruction, enabling robust benchmarking of progress in compositional generalization, data-driven scientific induction, and geometry-aware LLM reasoning; code released at the given repository.

Abstract: Equation discovery from data is a core challenge in machine learning for science, requiring the recovery of concise symbolic expressions that govern complex physical and geometric phenomena. Recent approaches with large language models (LLMs) show promise in symbolic regression, but their success often hinges on memorized formulas or overly simplified functional forms. Existing benchmarks exacerbate this limitation: they focus on scalar functions, ignore domain grounding, and rely on brittle string-matching based metrics that fail to capture scientific equivalence. We introduce SurfaceBench, first comprehensive benchmark for symbolic surface discovery. SurfaceBench comprises 183 tasks across 15 categories of symbolic complexity, spanning explicit, implicit, and parametric equation representation forms. Each task includes ground-truth equations, variable semantics, and synthetically sampled three dimensional data. Unlike prior SR datasets, our tasks reflect surface-level structure, resist LLM memorization through novel symbolic compositions, and are grounded in scientific domains such as fluid dynamics, robotics, electromagnetics, and geometry. To evaluate equation discovery quality, we pair symbolic checks with geometry-aware metrics such as Chamfer and Hausdorff distances, capturing both algebraic fidelity and spatial reconstruction accuracy. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art frameworks, while occasionally successful on specific families, struggle to generalize across representation types and surface complexities. SurfaceBench thus establishes a challenging and diagnostic testbed that bridges symbolic reasoning with geometric reconstruction, enabling principled benchmarking of progress in compositional generalization, data-driven scientific induction, and geometry-aware reasoning with LLMs. We release the code here: https://github.com/Sanchit-404/surfacebench

### [154] [EarthSight: A Distributed Framework for Low-Latency Satellite Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10834)
*Ansel Kaplan Erol,Seungjun Lee,Divya Mahajan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A distributed satellite image analytics framework (EarthSight) coordinates onboard and ground resources to deliver low-latency imagery by multi-task on-orbit inference, ground scheduling, and dynamic filtering, achieving significant latency and compute reductions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Downlink bandwidth limits and isolated onboard inference create large delays and inefficiencies for time-sensitive satellite imagery; a scalable, resource-aware, orbit-ground collaboration is needed.

Method: Introduce EarthSight with (1) multi-task inference on satellites using shared backbones, (2) ground-station query scheduler aggregating requests and budgeting compute, (3) dynamic filter ordering balancing selectivity, accuracy, and cost; treats constellation as distributed decision system; experiments with satellite simulator.

Result: 1.9x reduction in average compute time per image; 90th percentile end-to-end latency reduced from 51 to 21 minutes compared to state-of-the-art baseline.

Conclusion: EarthSight enables scalable, low-latency satellite image analytics within bandwidth and power budgets by coordinating orbit-ground resources; demonstrates substantial performance gains and practical viability for broader missions.

Abstract: Low-latency delivery of satellite imagery is essential for time-critical applications such as disaster response, intelligence, and infrastructure monitoring. However, traditional pipelines rely on downlinking all captured images before analysis, introducing delays of hours to days due to restricted communication bandwidth. To address these bottlenecks, emerging systems perform onboard machine learning to prioritize which images to transmit. However, these solutions typically treat each satellite as an isolated compute node, limiting scalability and efficiency. Redundant inference across satellites and tasks further strains onboard power and compute costs, constraining mission scope and responsiveness. We present EarthSight, a distributed runtime framework that redefines satellite image intelligence as a distributed decision problem between orbit and ground. EarthSight introduces three core innovations: (1) multi-task inference on satellites using shared backbones to amortize computation across multiple vision tasks; (2) a ground-station query scheduler that aggregates user requests, predicts priorities, and assigns compute budgets to incoming imagery; and (3) dynamic filter ordering, which integrates model selectivity, accuracy, and execution cost to reject low-value images early and conserve resources. EarthSight leverages global context from ground stations and resource-aware adaptive decisions in orbit to enable constellations to perform scalable, low-latency image analysis within strict downlink bandwidth and onboard power budgets.

### [155] [The Map of Misbelief: Tracing Intrinsic and Extrinsic Hallucinations Through Attention Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10837)
*Elyes Hajji,Aymen Bouguerra,Fabio Arnez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a principled evaluation framework that separates extrinsic and intrinsic hallucinations, and shows attention-based aggregation improves intrinsic hallucination detection and interpretability, while sampling-based methods excel at extrinsic hallucinations but fail on intrinsic; emphasizes attention as a signal for uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs exhibit safety-critical hallucinations; existing detection methods rely on sampling and ignore hallucination types, necessitating a framework and alternative signals to better detect and interpret hallucinations.

Method: Introduce a evaluation framework that distinguishes extrinsic vs intrinsic hallucinations across curated benchmarks; leverage an attention-based uncertainty quantification algorithm; develop novel attention aggregation strategies to improve interpretability and detection; compare against sampling-based methods like Semantic Entropy.

Result: Extrinsic hallucinations are well detected by sampling-based methods (Semantic Entropy), while intrinsic hallucinations resist these methods. Attention-aggregated detection improves intrinsic hallucination detection and interpretability, showing attention is a rich uncertainty signal. Overall results suggest matching detection strategies to hallucination type.

Conclusion: Align detection strategies with the nature of hallucination; use attention-based signals for intrinsic cases and sampling methods for extrinsic cases; attention-uncertainty offers a promising direction for safer LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, yet remain susceptible to hallucinations. While prior works have proposed confidence representation methods for hallucination detection, most of these approaches rely on computationally expensive sampling strategies and often disregard the distinction between hallucination types. In this work, we introduce a principled evaluation framework that differentiates between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucination categories and evaluates detection performance across a suite of curated benchmarks. In addition, we leverage a recent attention-based uncertainty quantification algorithm and propose novel attention aggregation strategies that improve both interpretability and hallucination detection performance. Our experimental findings reveal that sampling-based methods like Semantic Entropy are effective for detecting extrinsic hallucinations but generally fail on intrinsic ones. In contrast, our method, which aggregates attention over input tokens, is better suited for intrinsic hallucinations. These insights provide new directions for aligning detection strategies with the nature of hallucination and highlight attention as a rich signal for quantifying model uncertainty.

### [156] [FlowPath: Learning Data-Driven Manifolds with Invertible Flows for Robust Irregularly-sampled Time Series Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10841)
*YongKyung Oh,Dong-Young Lim,Sungil Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowPath learns the geometry of the control path for neural CDEs using an invertible neural flow, creating a data-adaptive continuous manifold for irregular time series. This geometry-aware approach improves classification accuracy over fixed-interpolant baselines and non-invertible path models across numerous datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling continuous-time dynamics from sparse, irregularly-sampled time series is hard. Fixed interpolation schemes impose simplistic geometric assumptions that can misrepresent the true data manifold, especially under high missingness. There is a need to learn the geometry of the control path and preserve information along the path.

Method: FlowPath uses an invertible neural flow to parameterize the control path geometry in neural controlled differential equations. The path is continuous and data-adaptive, with invertibility enforcing information-preserving and well-behaved transformations, differentiating it from unconstrained learnable path models.

Result: Empirical evaluations on 18 benchmark datasets and a real-world case study show FlowPath achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy over baselines using fixed interpolants or non-invertible architectures.

Conclusion: Modeling the geometry of the control path is crucial for robust learning from irregular time series. FlowPath provides a principled, generalizable solution by learning an invertible, data-adaptive control-path manifold.

Abstract: Modeling continuous-time dynamics from sparse and irregularly-sampled time series remains a fundamental challenge. Neural controlled differential equations provide a principled framework for such tasks, yet their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of control path constructed from discrete observations. Existing methods commonly employ fixed interpolation schemes, which impose simplistic geometric assumptions that often misrepresent the underlying data manifold, particularly under high missingness. We propose FlowPath, a novel approach that learns the geometry of the control path via an invertible neural flow. Rather than merely connecting observations, FlowPath constructs a continuous and data-adaptive manifold, guided by invertibility constraints that enforce information-preserving and well-behaved transformations. This inductive bias distinguishes FlowPath from prior unconstrained learnable path models. Empirical evaluations on 18 benchmark datasets and a real-world case study demonstrate that FlowPath consistently achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy over baselines using fixed interpolants or non-invertible architectures. These results highlight the importance of modeling not only the dynamics along the path but also the geometry of the path itself, offering a robust and generalizable solution for learning from irregular time series.

### [157] [Behaviour Policy Optimization: Provably Lower Variance Return Estimates for Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10843)
*Alexander W. Goodall,Edwin Hamel-De le Court,Francesco Belardinelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Off-policy data collection with a carefully designed behaviour policy yields lower-variance return estimates, improving sample efficiency and stability in online policy-gradient RL by interleaving evaluation and improvement; two policy-gradient methods extended to this regime show stronger performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High variance in return estimates hampers sample efficiency and stability in policy-gradient RL; recent off-policy evaluation results indicate that a well-chosen behaviour policy can produce lower-variance estimates even when data is collected off-policy.

Method: Apply off-policy variance-reduction to online RL: use a single behaviour policy to collect data for policy improvement; couple provably lower-variance return estimates with interleaved policy evaluation and improvement; extend two policy-gradient algorithms with this regime.

Result: Empirical experiments show improved sample efficiency and performance across diverse environments for the two extended policy-gradient methods.

Conclusion: Strategic design of the behaviour policy for data collection reduces variance in return estimates and enhances online RL learning efficiency; this approach complements existing off-policy corrections and can be integrated with standard policy-gradient frameworks.

Abstract: Many reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly those that rely on return estimates for policy improvement, can suffer from poor sample efficiency and training instability due to high-variance return estimates. In this paper we leverage new results from off-policy evaluation; it has recently been shown that well-designed behaviour policies can be used to collect off-policy data for provably lower variance return estimates. This result is surprising as it means collecting data on-policy is not variance optimal. We extend this key insight to the online reinforcement learning setting, where both policy evaluation and improvement are interleaved to learn optimal policies. Off-policy RL has been well studied (e.g., IMPALA), with correct and truncated importance weighted samples for de-biasing and managing variance appropriately. Generally these approaches are concerned with reconciling data collected from multiple workers in parallel, while the policy is updated asynchronously, mismatch between the workers and policy is corrected in a mathematically sound way. Here we consider only one worker - the behaviour policy, which is used to collect data for policy improvement, with provably lower variance return estimates. In our experiments we extend two policy-gradient methods with this regime, demonstrating better sample efficiency and performance over a diverse set of environments.

*Brad Shook,Abby Turner,Jieshi Chen,Michał Wiliński,Mononito Goswami,Jonathan Elmer,Artur Dubrawski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STAMP is a lightweight Spatial-Temporal Adapter that leverages a general Time Series Foundation Model to implicitly capture EEG spatial-temporal structure, achieving competitive performance with EEG-specific foundation models across 8 EEG classification benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of comparative analysis between EEG-specific foundation models (EEGFMs) and general time-series foundation models (TSFMs) on EEG tasks. The work aims to bridge across-domain strengths by enabling EEG modeling with TSFMs through a lightweight adapter.

Method: Propose Spatial-Temporal Adapter with Multi-Head Pooling (STAMP). It uses univariate embeddings from a pre-trained general TSFM, implicitly learns the spatial-temporal EEG structure via adapter components and multi-head pooling, features a lightweight trainable parameter footprint, and supports flexible inputs. Evaluated on 8 EEG clinical classification datasets with ablation studies.

Result: STAMP achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art EEGFMs on 8 EEG classification tasks. Ablation studies validate the contributions, and the adapter remains lightweight with flexible inputs.

Conclusion: STAMP provides a flexible, lightweight bridge for applying general TSFMs to EEG tasks, enabling effective EEG modeling without necessity for EEG-specific foundation models and demonstrating strong performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) pretrained on data from multiple domains have shown strong performance on diverse modeling tasks. Various efforts have been made to develop foundation models specific to electroencephalography (EEG) data, which records brain electrical activity as time series. However, no comparative analysis of EEG-specific foundation models (EEGFMs) versus general TSFMs has been performed on EEG-specific tasks. We introduce a novel Spatial-Temporal Adapter with Multi-Head Pooling (STAMP), which leverages univariate embeddings produced by a general TSFM, implicitly models spatial-temporal characteristics of EEG data, and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art EEGFMs. A comprehensive analysis is performed on 8 benchmark datasets of clinical tasks using EEG for classification, along with ablation studies. Our proposed adapter is lightweight in trainable parameters and flexible in the inputs it can accommodate, supporting easy modeling of EEG data using TSFMs.

### [159] [ExPairT-LLM: Exact Learning for LLM Code Selection by Pairwise Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10855)
*Tom Yuviler,Dana Drachsler-Cohen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An exact learning-based code selection method ExPairT-LLM uses pairwise membership and pairwise equivalence queries to an LLM oracle to select the correct program from candidates; it uses a tournament and is robust to LL mistakes, achieving large gains on four datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Code generation by LLMs remains error-prone; existing selection methods that rely on the LLM to determine outputs can misidentify non-equivalent programs or depend on the LLM's ability to determine outputs for every input; thus there is a need for an robust, query-based learning approach that does not overfit to LLM correctness.

Method: Proposes ExPairT-LLM, an exact learner that uses two new query types — pairwise membership and pairwise equivalence — to query an LLM oracle. It runs a tournament among candidate programs, pruning inconsistent ones to identify the correct program. The approach is designed to be robust to some LLM mistakes.

Result: On four code datasets, ExPairT-LLM achieves higher pass@1 than state-of-the-art by an average +13.0% and up to +27.1%. It also yields a +24.0% improvement in pass@1 for LLMs performing complex reasoning.

Conclusion: ExPairT-LLM demonstrates that exact learning with simple pairwise queries can robustly identify the correct code among candidates, outperforming existing code selection methods and enabling more reliable LLM-based code generation.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in LLMs, the task of code generation is still challenging. To cope, code selection algorithms select the best program from multiple programs generated by an LLM. However, existing algorithms can fail to identify the correct program, either because they can misidentify nonequivalent programs or because they rely on an LLM and assume it always correctly determines the output for every input. We present ExPairT-LLM, an exact learning algorithm for code selection that selects a program by posing to an LLM oracle two new types of queries: pairwise membership and pairwise equivalence. These queries are simpler for LLMs and enable ExPairT-LLM to identify the correct program through a tournament, which is robust to some LLM mistakes. We evaluate ExPairT-LLM on four popular code datasets. Its pass@1 (success rate) outperforms the state-of-the-art code selection algorithm on average by +13.0% and up to +27.1%. It also improves the pass@1 of LLMs performing complex reasoning by +24.0%.

### [160] [Private Zeroth-Order Optimization with Public Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10859)
*Xuchen Gong,Tian Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PAZO introduces public-data-assisted zeroth-order optimization for private DP training, achieving better privacy/utility tradeoffs than public-data-enabled first-order baselines with substantial speedups (up to 16x) across vision and text tasks in pre-training and fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DP-SGD and related first-order methods face high computation and memory costs; zeroth-order methods alleviate privatization costs but lag in utility and have limited evaluation domains. Public-data information could guide gradient estimates to improve performance.

Method: Propose PAZO, a suite of public-data-assisted zeroth-order optimizers with minimal overhead. Provide theoretical analysis under an assumption of similarity between public and private data. Empirically evaluate on vision and text tasks in both pre-training and fine-tuning, comparing against best first-order baselines (with public data).

Result: PAZO achieves superior privacy/utility tradeoffs across vision and text tasks in both pre-training and fine-tuning, outperforming the best public-data-enabled first-order baselines, especially in highly private regimes, and offers up to 16× runtime speedup.

Conclusion: Leveraging public data to guide zeroth-order gradient estimation can substantially close the utility gap with DP-SGD, delivering strong performance across domains with significant computational benefits; the approach is theoretically justified under data similarity assumptions and shows broad applicability for private ML tasks.

Abstract: One of the major bottlenecks for deploying popular first-order differentially private (DP) machine learning algorithms (e.g., DP-SGD) lies in their high computation and memory cost, despite the existence of optimized implementations. Zeroth-order methods have promise in mitigating the overhead, as they leverage function evaluations to approximate the gradients, hence significantly easier to privatize. While recent works have explored zeroth-order approaches in both private and non-private settings, they still suffer from relatively low utilities compared with DP-SGD, and have only been evaluated in limited application domains. In this work, we propose to leverage public information to guide and improve gradient approximation of private zeroth-order algorithms. We explore a suite of public-data-assisted zeroth-order optimizers (PAZO) with minimal overhead. We provide theoretical analyses of the PAZO framework under an assumption of the similarity between public and private data. Empirically, we demonstrate that PAZO achieves superior privacy/utility tradeoffs across vision and text tasks in both pre-training and fine-tuning settings, outperforming the best first-order baselines (with public data) especially in highly private regimes, while offering up to $16\times$ runtime speedup.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-tuning Go unit test generation with GO UT Bench improves performance; dataset of 5264 code-test pairs from 10 Go repos; boosts >75% tasks across Mixture-of-Experts and dense decoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data imbalance in code LLMs: underrepresentation of software engineering tasks and low-resource language Go; need benchmarks for unit test generation.

Method: Construct GO UT Bench with 5264 code-test pairs from 10 permissively licensed Go repos across domains; evaluate as fine-tuning data for two LLM families (mixture of experts and dense decoders).

Result: Finetuned models outperform base models on more than 75% of benchmark tasks.

Conclusion: GO UT Bench is effective for improving unit test generation in Go and mitigating data imbalance; demonstrates value of task-aligned datasets and cross-family fine-tuning; potential extension to other languages/tasks.

Abstract: Training data imbalance poses a major challenge for code LLMs. Most available data heavily over represents raw opensource code while underrepresenting broader software engineering tasks, especially in low resource languages like Golang. As a result, models excel at code autocompletion but struggle with real world developer workflows such as unit test generation. To address this gap, we introduce GO UT Bench, a benchmark dataset of 5264 pairs of code and unit tests, drawn from 10 permissively licensed Golang repositories spanning diverse domain. We evaluate its effectiveness as a fine tuning dataset across two LLM families i.e. mixture of experts and dense decoders. Our results show that finetuned models outperform their base counterparts on more than 75% of benchmark tasks.

*Shuyuan Zhang,Zihan Wang,Xiao-Wen Chang,Doina Precup*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: G4RL introduces a graph encoder-decoder to enhance goal-conditioned hierarchical RL by evaluating unseen states from exploration graphs, improving subgoal representation and sample efficiency with minimal overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current GCHRL methods rely on domain-specific graphs or struggle to leverage dynamically built graphs, leading to poor subgoal representations and sample inefficiency. A general, graph-based mechanism to evaluate unseen states could improve performance across tasks.

Method: Train a graph encoder-decoder on the state graph generated during exploration and integrate it as a plug-in into existing GCHRL methods, assuming environments with predominantly symmetric and reversible transitions. The encoder-decoder provides intrinsic rewards at high and low levels to guide learning.

Result: Empirical results show that leveraging intrinsic rewards from the graph encoder-decoder significantly improves performance of state-of-the-art GCHRL approaches with only small computational overhead in both dense and sparse reward settings.

Conclusion: G4RL offers a general, plug-in enhancement for GCHRL in environments with symmetric/reversible transitions by using a graph-based encoder-decoder to better evaluate unseen states and guide subgoal generation.

Abstract: The integration of graphs with Goal-conditioned Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (GCHRL) has recently gained attention, as intermediate goals (subgoals) can be effectively sampled from graphs that naturally represent the overall task structure in most RL tasks. However, existing approaches typically rely on domain-specific knowledge to construct these graphs, limiting their applicability to new tasks. Other graph-based approaches create graphs dynamically during exploration but struggle to fully utilize them, because they have problems passing the information in the graphs to newly visited states. Additionally, current GCHRL methods face challenges such as sample inefficiency and poor subgoal representation. This paper proposes a solution to these issues by developing a graph encoder-decoder to evaluate unseen states. Our proposed method, Graph-Guided sub-Goal representation Generation RL (G4RL), can be incorporated into any existing GCHRL method when operating in environments with primarily symmetric and reversible transitions to enhance performance across this class of problems. We show that the graph encoder-decoder can be effectively implemented using a network trained on the state graph generated during exploration. Empirical results indicate that leveraging high and low-level intrinsic rewards from the graph encoder-decoder significantly enhances the performance of state-of-the-art GCHRL approaches with an extra small computational cost in dense and sparse reward environments.

Motivation: Address the need for time-efficient estimation of muscle activations/forces across multi-joint systems and the lack of high-quality labeled datasets for multi-joint applications, which makes conventional supervised approaches expensive and data-hungry.

Method: Proposes PI-MJCA-BiGRU: a physics-informed framework that uses a Multi-Joint Cross-Attention (MJCA) module with Bidirectional GRUs to capture inter-joint coordination. Loss function embeds multi-joint dynamics, inter-joint coupling, and external force interactions to enforce physiologically consistent predictions without ground-truth labels.

Result: Experimental validation on two datasets shows performance comparable to conventional supervised methods without ground-truth labels. The MJCA module enhances inter-joint coordination modeling compared to baseline architectures.

Conclusion: PI-MJCA-BiGRU enables time-efficient, physiologically consistent estimation of muscle activations and forces without labeled data, with the MJCA module providing superior inter-joint coordination modeling over baselines, promising for clinical assessment and assistive device control.

Abstract: Time-efficient estimation of muscle activations and forces across multi-joint systems is critical for clinical assessment and assistive device control. However, conventional approaches are computationally expensive and lack a high-quality labeled dataset for multi-joint applications. To address these challenges, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework that estimates muscle activations and forces directly from kinematics. The framework employs a novel Multi-Joint Cross-Attention (MJCA) module with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) layers to capture inter-joint coordination, enabling each joint to adaptively integrate motion information from others. By embedding multi-joint dynamics, inter-joint coupling, and external force interactions into the loss function, our Physics-Informed MJCA-BiGRU (PI-MJCA-BiGRU) delivers physiologically consistent predictions without labeled data while enabling time-efficient inference. Experimental validation on two datasets demonstrates that PI-MJCA-BiGRU achieves performance comparable to conventional supervised methods without requiring ground-truth labels, while the MJCA module significantly enhances inter-joint coordination modeling compared to other baseline architectures.

*Chenghao Duan,Chuanyi Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Graph Attention Network (GAT) based semi-supervised approach predicts duration of severe weather–induced power outages using geospatial/weather data, achieving >93% accuracy on 501 counties across eight Southeastern U.S. states and outperforming XGBoost, Random Forest, GCN, and a simple GAT by 2–15%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of power outage recovery is critical for electric grid resilience given the societal and economic impacts of outages from hurricanes and other natural disasters. The main challenges in real-world settings are spatial dependency of the data, spatial heterogeneity of impact, and limited (moderate) event data, which hinder traditional models.

Method: The authors employ Graph Attention Networks (GAT) with a simple structure initialized via unsupervised pre-training, followed by semi-supervised learning. The approach leverages geospatial and weather data from field observations of four major hurricanes affecting 501 counties in eight Southeastern states.

Result: The model achieves excellent performance with accuracy over 93% and outperforms baseline methods (XGBoost, Random Forest, GCN, and a simple GAT) by about 2%–15% in both overall performance and class-wise accuracy.

Conclusion: The GAT-based framework effectively addresses spatial dependency, spatial heterogeneity, and data sparsity in predicting outage duration, offering a robust tool for resilience planning and suggesting potential applicability to other disaster contexts with similar data characteristics.

Abstract: Natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and winter storms have induced large-scale power outages in the U.S., resulting in tremendous economic and societal impacts. Accurately predicting power outage recovery and impact is key to resilience of power grid. Recent advances in machine learning offer viable frameworks for estimating power outage duration from geospatial and weather data. However, three major challenges are inherent to the task in a real world setting: spatial dependency of the data, spatial heterogeneity of the impact, and moderate event data. We propose a novel approach to estimate the duration of severe weather-induced power outages through Graph Attention Networks (GAT). Our network uses a simple structure from unsupervised pre-training, followed by semi-supervised learning. We use field data from four major hurricanes affecting $501$ counties in eight Southeastern U.S. states. The model exhibits an excellent performance ($>93\%$ accuracy) and outperforms the existing methods XGBoost, Random Forest, GCN and simple GAT by $2\% - 15\%$ in both the overall performance and class-wise accuracy.

*Guanxiong He,Jie Wang,Liaoyuan Tang,Zheng Wang,Rong Wang,Feiping Nie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPP-FGC uses private local graphs for privacy-preserving federated clustering, enabling a one-shot or iterative collaboration that improves clustering accuracy with privacy guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current federated clustering trades privacy for accuracy or leaks sensitive information when sharing embeddings; there is a need to preserve privacy without sacrificing clustering performance.

Method: Clients build private structural graphs capturing intrinsic data relationships. The server securely aggregates and aligns these graphs to form a global graph from which a unified clustering structure is derived. The framework has two modes: (1) SPP-FGC—one-shot in a single communication round, and (2) SPP-FGC+—an iterative variant for complex data like images that refines feature representations through client-server collaboration.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows state-of-the-art clustering performance, with up to ~10% improvement in Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) over federated baselines, along with provable privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: A graph-based, privacy-preserving exchange of knowledge in federated clustering can overcome the traditional privacy-performance trade-off, offering fast one-shot and iterative modes while achieving superior clustering accuracy.

Abstract: Federated clustering addresses the critical challenge of extracting patterns from decentralized, unlabeled data. However, it is hampered by the flaw that current approaches are forced to accept a compromise between performance and privacy: \textit{transmitting embedding representations risks sensitive data leakage, while sharing only abstract cluster prototypes leads to diminished model accuracy}. To resolve this dilemma, we propose Structural Privacy-Preserving Federated Graph Clustering (SPP-FGC), a novel algorithm that innovatively leverages local structural graphs as the primary medium for privacy-preserving knowledge sharing, thus moving beyond the limitations of conventional techniques. Our framework operates on a clear client-server logic; on the client-side, each participant constructs a private structural graph that captures intrinsic data relationships, which the server then securely aggregates and aligns to form a comprehensive global graph from which a unified clustering structure is derived. The framework offers two distinct modes to suit different needs. SPP-FGC is designed as an efficient one-shot method that completes its task in a single communication round, ideal for rapid analysis. For more complex, unstructured data like images, SPP-FGC+ employs an iterative process where clients and the server collaboratively refine feature representations to achieve superior downstream performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving clustering accuracy by up to 10\% (NMI) over federated baselines while maintaining provable privacy guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphToxin: a novel graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning using curvature matching to recover deleted data and sensitive connections; extends to multi-node removals; defenses largely ineffective; emphasizes worst-case evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify and exploit residual traces in graph unlearning and expose privacy/regulatory vulnerabilities, highlighting unsafe guarantees when data is removed by multiple parties.

Method: Introduce a curvature matching module to guide full recovery of unlearned graphs; extend attack to multiple node removals under white-box and black-box settings; propose a worst-case evaluation framework comparing random vs worst-case removals.

Result: The attack can reconstruct deleted individuals’ data and their connections’ sensitive content; existing defenses are largely ineffective or even amplified; GraphToxin is effective and adaptable across settings.

Conclusion: Graph unlearning requires stronger, more robust defenses and threat models; urgent research is needed to secure unlearning against reconstruction attacks.

Abstract: Graph unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for complying with "the right to be forgotten" regulations by enabling the removal of sensitive information upon request. However, this solution is not foolproof. The involvement of multiple parties creates new attack surfaces, and residual traces of deleted data can still remain in the unlearned graph neural networks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to recover the supposedly erased samples, thereby undermining the inherent functionality of graph unlearning. In this work, we propose GraphToxin, the first graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a novel curvature matching module to provide a fine-grained guidance for full unlearned graph recovery. We demonstrate that GraphToxin can successfully subvert the regulatory guarantees expected from graph unlearning - it can recover not only a deleted individual's information and personal links but also sensitive content from their connections, thereby posing substantially more detrimental threats. Furthermore, we extend GraphToxin to multiple node removals under both white-box and black-box setting. We highlight the necessity of a worst-case analysis and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the attack performance under both random and worst-case node removals. This provides a more robust and realistic measure of the vulnerability of graph unlearning methods to graph reconstruction attacks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of GraphToxin. Notably, we show that existing defense mechanisms are largely ineffective against this attack and, in some cases, can even amplify its performance. Given the severe privacy risks posed by GraphToxin, our work underscores the urgent need for the development of more effective and robust defense strategies against this attack.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive policies (LCB and Thompson Sampling) achieve constant regret in a cascade bandit model for edge inference, while non-adaptive approaches (Explore-then-Commit and Action Elimination) incur suboptimal, fixed-order regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge inference faces uncertainty in model accuracy and error probability; a cascade bandit framework allows comparing decision policies under this uncertainty to minimize cumulative regret.

Method: Theoretical analysis of four policies—Explore-then-Commit, Action Elimination, Lower Confidence Bound (LCB), and Thompson Sampling—providing sharp regret guarantees for each; complemented by simulations to validate adaptivity effects.

Result: LCB and Thompson Sampling attain O(1) regret; Explore-then-Commit and Action Elimination suffer higher regret due to fixed ordering after exploration; simulations corroborate that adaptivity improves edge inference efficiency.

Conclusion: Adaptivity in decision-making is crucial for efficient edge inference under uncertainty; fully Bayesian or confidence-based policies (LCB, Thompson Sampling) outperform non-adaptive strategies in this cascade-bandit setting.

Abstract: Motivated by the challenges of edge inference, we study a variant of the cascade bandit model in which each arm corresponds to an inference model with an associated accuracy and error probability. We analyse four decision-making policies-Explore-then-Commit, Action Elimination, Lower Confidence Bound (LCB), and Thompson Sampling-and provide sharp theoretical regret guarantees for each. Unlike in classical bandit settings, Explore-then-Commit and Action Elimination incur suboptimal regret because they commit to a fixed ordering after the exploration phase, limiting their ability to adapt. In contrast, LCB and Thompson Sampling continuously update their decisions based on observed feedback, achieving constant O(1) regret. Simulations corroborate these theoretical findings, highlighting the crucial role of adaptivity for efficient edge inference under uncertainty.

*Wenkai Liu,Nan Ma,Jianqiao Chen,Xiaoxuan Qi,Yuhang Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An FM-based generative model for MIMO channel estimation to reduce sampling overhead and improve accuracy over diffusion-model-based methods, using a noise-statistics-driven velocity field and ODE-based sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome slow sampling in diffusion-model (DM) based channel estimation to achieve fast, high-precision CSI in MIMO systems.

Method: Formulate channel estimation in the flow matching (FM) framework with a conditional path from noisy to true channel; straight-line constant-speed trajectory; derive velocity field dependent only on noise statistics; use this velocity field as prior during sampling with an ODE Euler solver for fast channel enhancement.

Result: FM-based scheme significantly reduces sampling overhead compared to score-matching (SM)/DM-based schemes and achieves superior estimation accuracy under varying channel conditions.

Conclusion: FM-based channel estimation is a promising approach for fast, accurate CSI acquisition in MIMO, mitigating slow sampling limitations of DM-based approaches.

Abstract: Diffusion model (DM)-based channel estimation, which generates channel samples via a posteriori sampling stepwise with denoising process, has shown potential in high-precision channel state information (CSI) acquisition. However, slow sampling speed is an essential challenge for recent developed DM-based schemes. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel flow matching (FM)-based generative model for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel estimation. We first formulate the channel estimation problem within FM framework, where the conditional probability path is constructed from the noisy channel distribution to the true channel distribution. In this case, the path evolves along the straight-line trajectory at a constant speed. Then, guided by this, we derive the velocity field that depends solely on the noise statistics to guide generative models training. Furthermore, during the sampling phase, we utilize the trained velocity field as prior information for channel estimation, which allows for quick and reliable noise channel enhancement via ordinary differential equation (ODE) Euler solver. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FM-based channel estimation scheme can significantly reduce the sampling overhead compared to other popular DM-based schemes, such as the score matching (SM)-based scheme. Meanwhile, it achieves superior channel estimation accuracy under different channel conditions.

### [170] [From Parameter to Representation: A Closed-Form Approach for Controllable Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10943)
*Jialin Wu,Jian Yang,Handing Wang,Jiajun Wen,Zhiyong Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new method for controllable model merging uses a closed-form optimal linear correction to the model's final representation, enabling on-the-fly, architecture-agnostic Pareto-optimal trade-offs with linear scaling in tasks, significantly reducing offline cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Combining expert models for multitask performance faces parameter interference and requires costly offline multi-objective optimization that grows exponentially with the number of tasks. A more efficient, preference-aware approach is needed.

Method: Replace parameter-space optimization with a direct correction of the model's final representation via an optimal linear transformation. Derive a closed-form solution that is architecture-agnostic, incorporating user preferences to generate a Pareto-optimal model in a single step.

Result: The method yields a superior Pareto front with better alignment to user preferences and drastically reduced computational cost, with complexity that scales linearly with the number of tasks.

Conclusion: Shifting to a representation-level linear correction eliminates the heavy offline optimization, enabling on-the-fly, architecture-agnostic, Pareto-optimal model merging that scales efficiently with task count.

Abstract: Model merging combines expert models for multitask performance but faces challenges from parameter interference. This has sparked recent interest in controllable model merging, giving users the ability to explicitly balance performance trade-offs. Existing approaches employ a compile-then-query paradigm, performing a costly offline multi-objective optimization to enable fast, preference-aware model generation. This offline stage typically involves iterative search or dedicated training, with complexity that grows exponentially with the number of tasks. To overcome these limitations, we shift the perspective from parameter-space optimization to a direct correction of the model's final representation. Our approach models this correction as an optimal linear transformation, yielding a closed-form solution that replaces the entire offline optimization process with a single-step, architecture-agnostic computation. This solution directly incorporates user preferences, allowing a Pareto-optimal model to be generated on-the-fly with complexity that scales linearly with the number of tasks. Experimental results show our method generates a superior Pareto front with more precise preference alignment and drastically reduced computational cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: We study how data quality issues impact credit risk ML models, using controlled corruptions with Pucktrick across 10 models; robustness varies with degradation type and severity; we provide a practical framework and tools for robust data pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data quality is critical in credit risk modeling; missing values, noise, outliers, and label errors can dramatically affect accuracy. There is a need for systematic evaluation and tooling to improve data pipeline robustness in data-centric AI contexts.

Method: Use an open-source credit risk dataset; corrupt data with Pucktrick to simulate missingness, noise, outliers, and label errors; evaluate 10 classifiers (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, etc.); compare robustness under varying degradation scenarios.

Conclusion: Proposes a flexible data-centric AI framework and tooling to assess and improve data pipeline robustness in credit risk ML; enables researchers to experiment with data degradation and robustness across models.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are being increasingly employed for credit risk evaluation, with their effectiveness largely hinging on the quality of the input data. In this paper we investigate the impact of several data quality issues, including missing values, noisy attributes, outliers, and label errors, on the predictive accuracy of the machine learning model used in credit risk assessment. Utilizing an open-source dataset, we introduce controlled data corruption using the Pucktrick library to assess the robustness of 10 frequently used models like Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression and so on. Our experiments show significant differences in model robustness based on the nature and severity of the data degradation. Moreover, the proposed methodology and accompanying tools offer practical support for practitioners seeking to enhance data pipeline robustness, and provide researchers with a flexible framework for further experimentation in data-centric AI contexts.

### [172] [Unsupervised Robust Domain Adaptation: Paradigm, Theory and Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11009)
*Fuxiang Huang,Xiaowei Fu,Shiyu Ye,Lina Ma,Wen Li,Xinbo Gao,David Zhang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a new unsupervised robust domain adaptation (URDA) framework to address adversarial robustness in domain adaptation. Introduces generalization bounds under attack and a simple two-step algorithm (DART) that disentangles robust and transferable features to preserve both robustness and transferability, validated on four benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard UDA lacks robustness to adversarial attacks; VAT helps defensively but does not improve UDA; there is an entanglement between domain shift and adversarial noise that hinders robustness in UDA. The work aims to unify robustness and adaptation under a theoretical framework.

Method: 1) Formulate URDA with a generalization-bound theory under adversarial and domain-shift scenarios. 2) Develop DART, a two-step training: pre-train a UDA model, then apply an instantaneous robustification step via disentangled distillation to separate robust features from transferable ones.

Result: Empirical evaluation on four benchmarks shows DART improves robustness under attacks while maintaining domain transferability; the URDA paradigm and its theory are validated.

Conclusion: First to define URDA and its theoretical underpinnings; DART offers a simple, effective route to robust, transferable UDA; opens avenues for further exploration in disentangled robustness for domain adaptation.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a label-rich source domain to an unlabeled target domain by addressing domain shifts. Most UDA approaches emphasize transfer ability, but often overlook robustness against adversarial attacks. Although vanilla adversarial training (VAT) improves the robustness of deep neural networks, it has little effect on UDA. This paper focuses on answering three key questions: 1) Why does VAT, known for its defensive effectiveness, fail in the UDA paradigm? 2) What is the generalization bound theory under attacks and how does it evolve from classical UDA theory? 3) How can we implement a robustification training procedure without complex modifications? Specifically, we explore and reveal the inherent entanglement challenge in general UDA+VAT paradigm, and propose an unsupervised robust domain adaptation (URDA) paradigm. We further derive the generalization bound theory of the URDA paradigm so that it can resist adversarial noise and domain shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to establish the URDA paradigm and theory. We further introduce a simple, novel yet effective URDA algorithm called Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training (DART), a two-step training procedure that ensures both transferability and robustness. DART first pre-trains an arbitrary UDA model, and then applies an instantaneous robustification post-training step via disentangled distillation.Experiments on four benchmark datasets with/without attacks show that DART effectively enhances robustness while maintaining domain adaptability, and validate the URDA paradigm and theory.

### [173] [Enhancing Graph Representations with Neighborhood-Contextualized Message-Passing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11046)
*Brian Godwin Lim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces neighborhood-contextualized message-passing (NCMP) to incorporate broader neighborhood context in GNNs, instantiated as SINC-GCN; preliminary results suggest improved expressivity and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard MP-based GNNs use pairwise messages from center node to neighbors, missing rich contextual information from the wider local neighborhood; address this to improve graph representation learning.

Method: Formalize neighborhood-contextualization inspired by attention, generalize MP to NCMP, propose Soft-Isomorphic NCMP (SINC-GCN) with a simple, practical parametrization; demonstrate on a synthetic binary node classification task.

Result: Preliminary analysis indicates enhanced expressivity and efficiency of SINC-GCN in the synthetic setting; provides initial validation for NCMP's potential.

Conclusion: NCMP provides a practical foundation to enhance classical GNNs' representational power; SINC-GCN offers an efficient instantiation with potential for broader applicability.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become an indispensable tool for analyzing relational data. In the literature, classical GNNs may be classified into three variants: convolutional, attentional, and message-passing. While the standard message-passing variant is highly expressive, its typical pair-wise messages nevertheless only consider the features of the center node and each neighboring node individually. This design fails to incorporate the rich contextual information contained within the broader local neighborhood, potentially hindering its ability to learn complex relationships within the entire set of neighboring nodes. To address this limitation, this work first formalizes the concept of neighborhood-contextualization, rooted in a key property of the attentional variant. This then serves as the foundation for generalizing the message-passing variant to the proposed neighborhood-contextualized message-passing (NCMP) framework. To demonstrate its utility, a simple, practical, and efficient method to parametrize and operationalize NCMP is presented, leading to the development of the proposed Soft-Isomorphic Neighborhood-Contextualized Graph Convolution Network (SINC-GCN). A preliminary analysis on a synthetic binary node classification problem then underscores both the expressivity and efficiency of the proposed GNN architecture. Overall, the paper lays the foundation for the novel NCMP framework as a practical path toward further enhancing the graph representational power of classical GNNs.

*Jun Hu,Shangheng Chen,Yufei He,Yuan Li,Bryan Hooi,Bingsheng He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Echoless-LP removes training label leakage in label-based pre-computation HGNNs by partition-focused echoless propagation, enabling memory-efficient, high-performance training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome echo (label leakage) in pre-computed HGNNs and to enable efficient training on large-scale heterogeneous graphs while remaining compatible with various message-passing schemes.

Method: PFEP partitions target nodes and performs echoless propagation, collecting label info only from neighbors in other partitions; Includes Asymmetric Partitioning Scheme (APS) and a PostAdjust mechanism to reduce information loss and distributional shifts.

Result: On public datasets, Echoless-LP achieves superior accuracy and maintains memory efficiency compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Echoless-LP provides a leakage-free, memory-efficient pre-computation framework for HGNNs, with partition-focused propagation and corrective mechanisms to preserve information across partitions.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are widely used for deep learning on heterogeneous graphs. Typical end-to-end HGNNs require repetitive message passing during training, limiting efficiency for large-scale real-world graphs. Pre-computation-based HGNNs address this by performing message passing only once during preprocessing, collecting neighbor information into regular-shaped tensors, which enables efficient mini-batch training. Label-based pre-computation methods collect neighbors' label information but suffer from training label leakage, where a node's own label information propagates back to itself during multi-hop message passing - the echo effect. Existing mitigation strategies are memory-inefficient on large graphs or suffer from compatibility issues with advanced message passing methods. We propose Echoless Label-based Pre-computation (Echoless-LP), which eliminates training label leakage with Partition-Focused Echoless Propagation (PFEP). PFEP partitions target nodes and performs echoless propagation, where nodes in each partition collect label information only from neighbors in other partitions, avoiding echo while remaining memory-efficient and compatible with any message passing method. We also introduce an Asymmetric Partitioning Scheme (APS) and a PostAdjust mechanism to address information loss from partitioning and distributional shifts across partitions. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that Echoless-LP achieves superior performance and maintains memory efficiency compared to baselines.

*Bingyu Hui,Lebin Yu,Quanming Yao,Yunpeng Qu,Xudong Zhang,Jian Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaPT provides a scalable population training framework for zero-shot coordination via a parameter-sharing meta-agent and a mutual-information regularizer, achieving superior coordination in Hanabi compared to baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot coordination requires agents to coordinate with unseen collaborators, but existing population-based methods are limited by computational resources and mostly focus on diversity in small populations rather than leveraging larger populations for performance gains.

Method: Introduce a meta-agent that efficiently realizes a population by selectively sharing parameters across agents, and a mutual information regularizer to ensure population diversity.

Result: Empirical validation shows ScaPT is effective and superior to existing representational frameworks in Hanabi.

Conclusion: ScaPT addresses both efficiency and diversity in scalable population training for zero-shot coordination, suggesting strong potential for broader applicability beyond Hanabi.

Abstract: Zero-shot coordination(ZSC) has become a hot topic in reinforcement learning research recently. It focuses on the generalization ability of agents, requiring them to coordinate well with collaborators that are not seen before without any fine-tuning. Population-based training has been proven to provide good zero-shot coordination performance; nevertheless, existing methods are limited by computational resources, mainly focusing on optimizing diversity in small populations while neglecting the potential performance gains from scaling population size. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Scalable Population Training (ScaPT), an efficient training framework comprising two key components: a meta-agent that efficiently realizes a population by selectively sharing parameters across agents, and a mutual information regularizer that guarantees population diversity. To empirically validate the effectiveness of ScaPT, this paper evaluates it along with representational frameworks in Hanabi and confirms its superiority.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Predictive coding (PC) replaces global backpropagation with local optimization over weights and activations. We show that linear PC networks admit a natural formulation as cellular sheaves: the sheaf coboundary maps activations to edge-wise prediction errors, and PC inference is diffusion under the sheaf Laplacian. Sheaf cohomology then characterizes irreducible error patterns that inference cannot remove. We analyze recurrent topologies where feedback loops create internal contradictions, introducing prediction errors unrelated to supervision. Using a Hodge decomposition, we determine when these contradictions cause learning to stall. The sheaf formalism provides both diagnostic tools for identifying problematic network configurations and design principles for effective weight initialization for recurrent PC networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A surrogate model named \ourmodel that fuses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict application runtime from port-level router data in Dragonfly networks, enabling accurate, scalable hybrid simulation and outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity PDES for workload interference in Dragonfly networks is computationally expensive and impractical for large-scale or real-time scenarios; there is a need for scalable, accurate runtime forecasting in the face of dynamic network traffic.

Method: Propose \ourmodel, a data-driven surrogate model that combines GNNs to capture spatial dependencies among ports/routers and an LLM to model temporal dynamics from port-level router data, trained to predict runtime and support hybrid simulation of Dragonfly networks.

Result: The model outperforms existing statistical and machine learning baselines in runtime prediction accuracy, enabling efficient and accurate hybrid simulation of Dragonfly networks.

Conclusion: The proposed surrogate model provides a practical, scalable approach to forecast application runtime, reducing reliance on expensive PDES while maintaining accuracy for hybrid simulations in Dragonfly interconnects.

Abstract: The Dragonfly network, with its high-radix and low-diameter structure, is a leading interconnect in high-performance computing. A major challenge is workload interference on shared network links. Parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) is commonly used to analyze workload interference. However, high-fidelity PDES is computationally expensive, making it impractical for large-scale or real-time scenarios. Hybrid simulation that incorporates data-driven surrogate models offers a promising alternative, especially for forecasting application runtime, a task complicated by the dynamic behavior of network traffic. We present \ourmodel, a surrogate model that combines graph neural networks (GNNs) and large language models (LLMs) to capture both spatial and temporal patterns from port level router data. \ourmodel outperforms existing statistical and machine learning baselines, enabling accurate runtime prediction and supporting efficient hybrid simulation of Dragonfly networks.

### [178] [Improving Continual Learning of Knowledge Graph Embeddings via Informed Initialization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11118)
*Gerard Pons,Besim Bilalli,Anna Queralt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Informed embedding initialization for continual KGEs improves performance, retention, and training speed by using KG schema and existing embeddings to initialize new entities based on their classes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Knowledge graphs are frequently updated, requiring continual learning where new entities are added while old embeddings are updated. Initialization of new embeddings strongly influences final accuracy and training time, especially for small, frequent updates.

Method: Integrate into existing continual learning workflows by using the KG schema and previously learned embeddings to derive initial representations for new entities according to their classes, enabling seamless, class-based initialization across various KGE models.

Result: Experimental analysis shows improved predictive performance, better knowledge retention, and faster convergence (fewer epochs/time) for a range of KGE models and update scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed initialization strategy is effective, generalizable, and reduces training time while mitigating forgetting, making it a practical addition to continual learning pipelines for KGEs.

Abstract: Many Knowledege Graphs (KGs) are frequently updated, forcing their Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) to adapt to these changes. To address this problem, continual learning techniques for KGEs incorporate embeddings for new entities while updating the old ones. One necessary step in these methods is the initialization of the embeddings, as an input to the KGE learning process, which can have an important impact in the accuracy of the final embeddings, as well as in the time required to train them. This is especially relevant for relatively small and frequent updates. We propose a novel informed embedding initialization strategy, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing continual learning methods for KGE, that enhances the acquisition of new knowledge while reducing catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, the KG schema and the previously learned embeddings are utilized to obtain initial representations for the new entities, based on the classes the entities belong to. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that the proposed initialization strategy improves the predictive performance of the resulting KGEs, while also enhancing knowledge retention. Furthermore, our approach accelerates knowledge acquisition, reducing the number of epochs, and therefore time, required to incrementally learn new embeddings. Finally, its benefits across various types of KGE learning models are demonstrated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outliers in bank balances can indicate fraud or operational issues; robust methods reduce sensitivity to contaminated data, but conventional approaches are expensive in high dimensions.

Method: Develops and empirically evaluates several robust approaches aimed at achieving high breakdown points with lower computational time in medium/high dimensions; tested on large-scale anonymized data.

Result: The abstract reports empirical evaluation and application to a large dataset but does not provide quantitative results or comparisons.

Conclusion: Robust, efficient approaches may be feasible for large-scale financial data analysis, offering reliable anomaly detection with reduced computation in higher dimensions.

Abstract: Detecting point anomalies in bank account balances is essential for financial institutions, as it enables the identification of potential fraud, operational issues, or other irregularities. Robust statistics is useful for flagging outliers and for providing estimates of the data distribution parameters that are not affected by contaminated observations. However, such a strategy is often less efficient and computationally expensive under high dimensional setting. In this paper, we propose and evaluate empirically several robust approaches that may be computationally efficient in medium and high dimensional datasets, with high breakdown points and low computational time. Our application deals with around 2.6 million daily records of anonymous users' bank account balances.

TL;DR: An interpretable hybrid CNN-ConvLSTM model for short-term precipitation forecasting across four Indian cities, with city-specific architectures, achieving competitive RMSEs and explainability via multiple xAI techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the black-box nature of deep learning in weather forecasting and provide transparent, actionable short-term precipitation predictions for diverse urban climates.

Method: A hybrid Time-Distributed CNN-ConvLSTM architecture trained on multi-decadal ERA5 reanalysis data, with city-specific filter counts (Bengaluru 32; Mumbai & Delhi 64; Kolkata 128). Interpretability analyzed using permutation importance, Grad-CAM, temporal occlusion, and counterfactual perturbation.

Result: RMSEs: Bengaluru 0.21 mm/day; Mumbai 0.52; Delhi 0.48; Kolkata 1.80. Prediction horizons range from 1 day (Bengaluru) to 5 days (Kolkata). Interpretability methods reveal city-specific variable reliance and transparent patterns in forecasts.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that explainable AI can yield accurate precipitation forecasts while providing transparent insights into city-specific precipitation dynamics across diverse urban environments.

Abstract: Deep learning models for precipitation forecasting often function as black boxes, limiting their adoption in real-world weather prediction. To enhance transparency while maintaining accuracy, we developed an interpretable deep learning framework for short-term precipitation prediction in four major Indian cities: Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata, spanning diverse climate zones. We implemented a hybrid Time-Distributed CNN-ConvLSTM (Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory) architecture, trained on multi-decadal ERA5 reanalysis data. The architecture was optimized for each city with a different number of convolutional filters: Bengaluru (32), Mumbai and Delhi (64), and Kolkata (128). The models achieved root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.21 mm/day (Bengaluru), 0.52 mm/day (Mumbai), 0.48 mm/day (Delhi), and 1.80 mm/day (Kolkata). Through interpretability analysis using permutation importance, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), temporal occlusion, and counterfactual perturbation, we identified distinct patterns in the model's behavior. The model relied on city-specific variables, with prediction horizons ranging from one day for Bengaluru to five days for Kolkata. This study demonstrates how explainable AI (xAI) can provide accurate forecasts and transparent insights into precipitation patterns in diverse urban environments.

*Omri Ben-Dov,Luiz F. O. Chamon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduce a joint training framework to minimize the Jeffreys divergence between data and model distributions using a proxy model; enables combining normalizing flows and energy-based models for density estimation, image generation, and SBI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forward KL is tractable but asymmetric; symmetric divergences like Jeffreys are attractive but hard to compute from samples and brittle with min-max or adversarial setups. A practical method to minimize Jeffreys divergence would enable better symmetric properties without instability.

Method: Propose a proxy model trained alongside the main model within a constrained optimization problem. The objective allows the proxy to help optimize the Jeffreys divergence; the training adapts model priorities during training. The framework can fuse normalizing flows and energy-based models.

Result: Conceptual framework with a practical algorithm; illustrated on density estimation, image generation, and simulation-based inference; the abstract does not report empirical results.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical path to leverage the Jeffreys divergence and the complementary strengths of NF and EBM by joint constrained optimization, potentially improving stability and performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Many tasks in machine learning can be described as or reduced to learning a probability distribution given a finite set of samples. A common approach is to minimize a statistical divergence between the (empirical) data distribution and a parameterized distribution, e.g., a normalizing flow (NF) or an energy-based model (EBM). In this context, the forward KL divergence is a ubiquitous due to its tractability, though its asymmetry may prevent capturing some properties of the target distribution. Symmetric alternatives involve brittle min-max formulations and adversarial training (e.g., generative adversarial networks) or evaluating the reverse KL divergence, as is the case for the symmetric Jeffreys divergence, which is challenging to compute from samples. This work sets out to develop a new approach to minimize the Jeffreys divergence. To do so, it uses a proxy model whose goal is not only to fit the data, but also to assist in optimizing the Jeffreys divergence of the main model. This joint training task is formulated as a constrained optimization problem to obtain a practical algorithm that adapts the models priorities throughout training. We illustrate how this framework can be used to combine the advantages of NFs and EBMs in tasks such as density estimation, image generation, and simulation-based inference.

*Julien Collard,Pierre Gentine,Tian Zheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Power-mean aggregation of ensemble predictions improves heat-wave extreme predictions in a ML weather forecast model, with performance depending on the chosen quantile.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of climate extreme events (heat waves) is important; current ensemble mean approaches may underperform for tail events; nonlinear aggregation could better capture extreme risks.

Method: Formulate as binary classification: predict whether surface air temperature exceeds the q-th local quantile within a specified window. Use a machine-learning weather forecasting model to generate ensemble predictions, then aggregate them with a power mean (nonlinear) instead of the usual arithmetic mean; assess across different quantile thresholds.

Result: Power aggregation improves classifier performance compared to standard mean; leads to higher accuracy for extreme heat-event prediction; the optimal aggregation power varies with the chosen quantile, with stronger gains for higher quantiles.

Conclusion: Power-mean aggregation is a promising, adaptable approach for ensemble ML weather forecasts of climate extremes, with tunable effectiveness via quantile choice.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of improving predictions of climate extreme events, specifically heat waves, using machine learning methods. Our work is framed as a classification problem in which we try to predict whether surface air temperature will exceed its q-th local quantile within a specified timeframe. Our key finding is that aggregating ensemble predictions using a power mean significantly enhances the classifier's performance. By making a machine-learning based weather forecasting model generative and applying this non-linear aggregation method, we achieve better accuracy in predicting extreme heat events than with the typical mean prediction from the same model. Our power aggregation method shows promise and adaptability, as its optimal performance varies with the quantile threshold chosen, demonstrating increased effectiveness for higher extremes prediction.

Conclusion: SKF unifies sparsity-driven discovery with Kalman filtering for real-time learning of nonlinear, time-varying systems; it improves parameter-sparsity estimation strategies and switching-time detection, enabling real-time modeling and adaptive control.

Abstract: Learning governing equations from data is central to understanding the behavior of physical systems across diverse scientific disciplines, including physics, biology, and engineering. The Sindy algorithm has proven effective in leveraging sparsity to identify concise models of nonlinear dynamical systems. In this paper, we extend sparsity-driven approaches to real-time learning by integrating a cornerstone algorithm from control theory -- the Kalman filter (KF). The resulting Sindy Kalman Filter (SKF) unifies both frameworks by treating unknown system parameters as state variables, enabling real-time inference of complex, time-varying nonlinear models unattainable by either method alone. Furthermore, SKF enhances KF parameter identification strategies, particularly via look-ahead error, significantly simplifying the estimation of sparsity levels, variance parameters, and switching instants. We validate SKF on a chaotic Lorenz system with drifting or switching parameters and demonstrate its effectiveness in the real-time identification of a sparse nonlinear aircraft model built from real flight data.

*Zhenghao Zhang,Jun Xie,Xingchen Chen,Tao Yu,Hongzhu Yi,Kaixin Xu,Yuanxiang Wang,Tianyu Zong,Xinming Wang,Jiahuan Chen,Guoqing Chao,Feng Chen,Zhepeng Wang,Jungang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DGIMVCM: a dynamic-graph, masked-reconstruction framework for incomplete multi-view clustering that builds a robust global graph, learns dynamic view-specific graphs, uses contrastive learning and a masked reconstruction loss to reduce gradient noise, and uses pseudo-label self-supervision for clustering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incomplete real-world multi-view data and reliance on KNN for graph construction introduce noise and instability. Direct MSE-based graph reconstruction losses also cause heavy gradient noise during optimization. A robust, dynamic, and noise-aware graph learning framework is needed for IMVC.

Method: 1) Construct a missing-robust global graph from raw data. 2) Use a graph convolutional embedding layer to extract primary features and refine dynamic view-specific graphs, leveraging the global graph to impute missing views. 3) Apply graph structure contrastive learning to identify consistency among view-specific graphs. 4) Introduce a graph self-attention encoder to obtain high-level representations from imputed features and graphs. 5) Optimize with a masked graph reconstruction loss to mitigate gradient noise. 6) Use a clustering module trained via pseudo-label self-supervision.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the proposed method DGIMVCM is effective and superior to baselines for IMVC.

Conclusion: DGIMVCM provides a robust dynamic-graph learning solution for incomplete multi-view clustering, alleviating noise from static KNN graphs and reducing gradient noise with a masked reconstruction loss, while achieving strong clustering performance through a self-supervised pseudo-label framework.

Abstract: The prevalence of real-world multi-view data makes incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) a crucial research. The rapid development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has established them as one of the mainstream approaches for multi-view clustering. Despite significant progress in GNNs-based IMVC, some challenges remain: (1) Most methods rely on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to construct static graphs from raw data, which introduces noise and diminishes the robustness of the graph topology. (2) Existing methods typically utilize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between the reconstructed graph and the sparse adjacency graph directly as the graph reconstruction loss, leading to substantial gradient noise during optimization. To address these issues, we propose a novel \textbf{D}ynamic Deep \textbf{G}raph Learning for \textbf{I}ncomplete \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{C}lustering with \textbf{M}asked Graph Reconstruction Loss (DGIMVCM). Firstly, we construct a missing-robust global graph from the raw data. A graph convolutional embedding layer is then designed to extract primary features and refined dynamic view-specific graph structures, leveraging the global graph for imputation of missing views. This process is complemented by graph structure contrastive learning, which identifies consistency among view-specific graph structures. Secondly, a graph self-attention encoder is introduced to extract high-level representations based on the imputed primary features and view-specific graphs, and is optimized with a masked graph reconstruction loss to mitigate gradient noise during optimization. Finally, a clustering module is constructed and optimized through a pseudo-label self-supervised training mechanism. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness and superiority of DGIMVCM.

### [186] [LoRaCompass: Robust Reinforcement Learning to Efficiently Search for a LoRa Tag](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11190)
*Tianlang He,Zhongming Lin,Tianrui Jiang,S. -H. Gary Chan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRaCompass uses a robust RL framework with RSSI-based spatial representation and an UCB-inspired exploration strategy to efficiently and reliably locate a periodically broadcasting LoRa tag under domain shift and RSSI fluctuations, achieving >90% success within 100m and a 40% improvement over prior methods across 80+ km^2 of ground and drone tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the fragility of existing reinforcement-learning-based search methods under signal variability and domain shift, which can cause cascading decision errors and large localization inaccuracies when tracking LoRa tags worn by at-risk individuals.

Method: Introduce LoRaCompass, a reinforcement learning model that (1) learns a robust spatial representation from RSSI via a spatially-aware feature extractor, (2) uses a policy distillation loss to improve robustness, and (3) incorporates an exploration function inspired by the upper confidence bound to guide moves toward the tag. The approach is validated in both ground-based and drone-assisted experiments over unseen environments covering >80 km^2.

Result: LoRaCompass achieves high localization performance, with a success rate >90% for finding the tag within 100m, representing a ~40% improvement over existing methods, and a search path length that scales linearly with the initial distance (i.e., efficient hop counts).

Conclusion: The proposed LoRaCompass provides a robust and efficient solution for LoRa tag localization under challenging environmental conditions and domain shifts, with strong empirical validation across diverse environments and platforms.

Abstract: The Long-Range (LoRa) protocol, known for its extensive range and low power, has increasingly been adopted in tags worn by mentally incapacitated persons (MIPs) and others at risk of going missing. We study the sequential decision-making process for a mobile sensor to locate a periodically broadcasting LoRa tag with the fewest moves (hops) in general, unknown environments, guided by the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). While existing methods leverage reinforcement learning for search, they remain vulnerable to domain shift and signal fluctuation, resulting in cascading decision errors that culminate in substantial localization inaccuracies. To bridge this gap, we propose LoRaCompass, a reinforcement learning model designed to achieve robust and efficient search for a LoRa tag. For exploitation under domain shift and signal fluctuation, LoRaCompass learns a robust spatial representation from RSSI to maximize the probability of moving closer to a tag, via a spatially-aware feature extractor and a policy distillation loss function. It further introduces an exploration function inspired by the upper confidence bound (UCB) that guides the sensor toward the tag with increasing confidence. We have validated LoRaCompass in ground-based and drone-assisted scenarios within diverse unseen environments covering an area of over 80km^2. It has demonstrated high success rate (>90%) in locating the tag within 100m proximity (a 40% improvement over existing methods) and high efficiency with a search path length (in hops) that scales linearly with the initial distance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A zero-shot synthetic validation framework for Federated Learning uses generative AI to monitor model performance and enable early stopping, reducing training rounds while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated Learning often trains for a fixed number of global rounds, causing wasted computation and training may continue even when performance is already adequate. There is a need for efficient, data-efficient early stopping and hyperparameter tuning in FL.

Method: Introduce a zero-shot synthetic validation framework that leverages generative AI to monitor model performance without extra data. The framework adaptively stops training near the optimal round and allows rapid hyperparameter adjustments, demonstrated on multi-label chest X-ray classification.

Result: Training rounds are reduced by up to 74% with accuracy within 1% of the optimal performance on a chest X-ray multi-label classification task.

Conclusion: The proposed zero-shot synthetic validation approach enables efficient Federated Learning by enabling adaptive early stopping, reducing compute without sacrificing accuracy and facilitating faster hyperparameter tuning.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, FL methods typically run for a predefined number of global rounds, often leading to unnecessary computation when optimal performance is reached earlier. In addition, training may continue even when the model fails to achieve meaningful performance. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a zero-shot synthetic validation framework that leverages generative AI to monitor model performance and determine early stopping points. Our approach adaptively stops training near the optimal round, thereby conserving computational resources and enabling rapid hyperparameter adjustments. Numerical results on multi-label chest X-ray classification demonstrate that our method reduces training rounds by up to 74% while maintaining accuracy within 1% of the optimal.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clarify and simplify the proof of Tsallis-INF’s best-of-both-worlds performance by leveraging contemporary online convex optimization techniques, removing the need for conjugate-function machinery and heavy constant-tuning.

Method: Derivation relies on online convex optimization toolkits; avoids conjugates; provides a streamlined, accessible argument for the best-of-both-worlds bound without tight constant optimization.

Conclusion: The note demonstrates that the best-of-both-worlds guarantee can be established with a simple, modern OCO-based argument without conjugate-function machinery, at the cost of not optimizing constants.

Abstract: In this short note, we present a simple derivation of the best-of-both-world guarantee for the Tsallis-INF multi-armed bandit algorithm from J. Zimmert and Y. Seldin.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparse convolutional networks can learn meaningful event embeddings from TPC data; even untrained models capture structure, and pretraining plus cross-detector transfer improve the representations, suggesting sparse conv nets as a general tool for TPC representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide robust, data-driven representations of complex ionization patterns in time projection chambers (TPCs) to enable analysis across diverse detectors and nuclear-physics experiments.

Method: Represent raw pad-level signals as sparse tensors and train Minkowski Engine ResNet models on GADGET II data; pretrain on a simple physics-motivated binary task to improve embedding quality; evaluate embeddings on both GADGET II and AT-TPC data, testing both trained and untrained encoders for cross-detector transfer.

Result: A sparse ResNet yields useful event embeddings even with random weights; pretraining improves embedding quality; embeddings reveal rich event structure; in cross-detector tests, an untrained sparse ResNet provides useful AT-TPC embeddings, with improvements when trained on GADGET data.

Conclusion: Sparse convolutional techniques show strong potential as a general, transferable representation-learning tool for diverse TPC experiments.

Abstract: Time Projection Chambers (TPCs) are versatile detectors that reconstruct charged-particle tracks in an ionizing medium, enabling sensitive measurements across a wide range of nuclear physics experiments. We explore sparse convolutional networks for representation learning on TPC data, finding that a sparse ResNet architecture, even with randomly set weights, provides useful structured vector embeddings of events. Pre-training this architecture on a simple physics-motivated binary classification task further improves the embedding quality. Using data from the GAseous Detector with GErmanium Tagging (GADGET) II TPC, a detector optimized for measuring low-energy $β$-delayed particle decays, we represent raw pad-level signals as sparse tensors, train Minkowski Engine ResNet models, and probe the resulting event-level embeddings which reveal rich event structure. As a cross-detector test, we embed data from the Active-Target TPC (AT-TPC) -- a detector designed for nuclear reaction studies in inverse kinematics -- using the same encoder. We find that even an untrained sparse ResNet model provides useful embeddings of AT-TPC data, and we observe improvements when the model is trained on GADGET data. Together, these results highlight the potential of sparse convolutional techniques as a general tool for representation learning in diverse TPC experiments.

TL;DR: VWN decouples width from backbone to virtually widen representations, enabling wider embeddings with constant backbone compute. This yields faster optimization (up to 2–3x gains) and a log-linear link between virtual width and loss reduction, suggesting virtual width as a scalable efficiency axis for large models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve large-model efficiency by gaining the benefits of wider representations without the quadratic cost of increasing hidden sizes; target token efficiency and faster convergence at scale.

Method: Introduce Virtual Width Networks (VWN) that expand the embedding space (virtual width) while keeping backbone width constant, enabling an 8x widening in experiments. Evaluate optimization speed for next-token and next-2-token predictions and analyze how loss reduction scales with virtual width.

Result: An 8x virtual width expansion speeds optimization by >2x for next-token and >3x for next-2-token. Benefits grow with training as the loss gap widens and the convergence-speedup ratio increases. Observed a roughly log-linear scaling between virtual width and loss reduction, supporting virtual-width scaling as a new efficiency dimension.

Conclusion: VWN demonstrates a promising direction for token-efficient, scalable large-model training by separating width into a virtual dimension, motivating further exploration of virtual-width scaling as a core axis of model efficiency.

Abstract: We introduce Virtual Width Networks (VWN), a framework that delivers the benefits of wider representations without incurring the quadratic cost of increasing the hidden size. VWN decouples representational width from backbone width, expanding the embedding space while keeping backbone compute nearly constant. In our large-scale experiment, an 8-times expansion accelerates optimization by over 2 times for next-token and 3 times for next-2-token prediction. The advantage amplifies over training as both the loss gap grows and the convergence-speedup ratio increases, showing that VWN is not only token-efficient but also increasingly effective with scale. Moreover, we identify an approximately log-linear scaling relation between virtual width and loss reduction, offering an initial empirical basis and motivation for exploring virtual-width scaling as a new dimension of large-model efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HealSplit offers a unified end-to-end defense for Split Federated Learning by detecting poisoned samples via topology-based graphs, recovering them with a generative substitutes pipeline, and training a robust student through adversarial multi-teacher distillation, outperforming 10 baselines on four datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Split Federated Learning exposes privacy but remains vulnerable to sophisticated data poisoning attacks on local features, labels, smashed data, and model weights. Existing defenses adapted from traditional FL struggle under SFL due to limited access to complete model updates; a tailored, end-to-end defense is needed.

Method: Three components: (1) topology-aware detection that builds graphs over smashed data and uses topological anomaly scoring (TAS) to identify poisoned samples; (2) a generative recovery pipeline that synthesizes semantically consistent substitutes for detected anomalies, validated by a consistency-validation (CV) student; (3) an adversarial multi-teacher distillation framework where the student learns from a Vanilla Teacher (semantic supervision) and an Anomaly-Influence Debiasing (AD) Teacher, guided by alignment between topological and gradient-based interaction matrices.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show HealSplit consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art defenses, delivering robust defense performance across diverse poisoning attack scenarios.

Conclusion: HealSplit provides a unified, end-to-end defense framework for Split Federated Learning that detects, recovers, and mitigates sophisticated poisoning attacks, enhancing robustness where traditional FL defenses fall short.

Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) is an emerging paradigm for privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, it remains vulnerable to sophisticated data poisoning attacks targeting local features, labels, smashed data, and model weights. Existing defenses, primarily adapted from traditional Federated Learning (FL), are less effective under SFL due to limited access to complete model updates. This paper presents HealSplit, the first unified defense framework tailored for SFL, offering end-to-end detection and recovery against five sophisticated types of poisoning attacks. HealSplit comprises three key components: (1) a topology-aware detection module that constructs graphs over smashed data to identify poisoned samples via topological anomaly scoring (TAS); (2) a generative recovery pipeline that synthesizes semantically consistent substitutes for detected anomalies, validated by a consistency validation student; and (3) an adversarial multi-teacher distillation framework trains the student using semantic supervision from a Vanilla Teacher and anomaly-aware signals from an Anomaly-Influence Debiasing (AD) Teacher, guided by the alignment between topological and gradient-based interaction matrices. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HealSplit consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art defenses, achieving superior robustness and defense effectiveness across diverse attack scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes NASK, a graph kernel for attributed graphs that combines exponential Gower-based attribute similarity with star-structured neighborhood info via WL iterations; proves positive definiteness; achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph kernels struggle to jointly handle heterogeneous numerical/categorical attributes and neighborhood information; need a PD kernel that integrates multi-scale neighborhood structure for attributed graphs.

Method: Use exponential of Gower similarity to unify numeric/categorical attributes; incorporate star substructures enhanced by Weisfeiler-Lehman iterations to capture multi-scale neighborhood structure; prove positive definiteness; evaluate with SVMs on multiple benchmarks.

Result: NASK outperforms 16 baselines (9 kernels, 7 GNNs) across eleven attributed and four large-scale graph datasets, showing consistent improvements.

Conclusion: NASK provides a theoretically sound and practically effective kernel for attributed graphs, enabling better similarity estimation and learning; it broadens the toolkit for graph-based learning and may scale to large graphs.

Abstract: Attributed graphs, typically characterized by irregular topologies and a mix of numerical and categorical attributes, are ubiquitous in diverse domains such as social networks, bioinformatics, and cheminformatics. While graph kernels provide a principled framework for measuring graph similarity, existing kernel methods often struggle to simultaneously capture heterogeneous attribute semantics and neighborhood information in attributed graphs. In this work, we propose the Neighborhood-Aware Star Kernel (NASK), a novel graph kernel designed for attributed graph learning. NASK leverages an exponential transformation of the Gower similarity coefficient to jointly model numerical and categorical features efficiently, and employs star substructures enhanced by Weisfeiler-Lehman iterations to integrate multi-scale neighborhood structural information. We theoretically prove that NASK is positive definite, ensuring compatibility with kernel-based learning frameworks such as SVMs. Extensive experiments are conducted on eleven attributed and four large-scale real-world graph benchmarks. The results demonstrate that NASK consistently achieves superior performance over sixteen state-of-the-art baselines, including nine graph kernels and seven Graph Neural Networks.

TL;DR: EHR-based predictive models outperform traditional risk factors in identifying high-risk individuals for multiple cancers; an EHR foundation model trained on patient trajectories shows strong, scalable predictive performance across 26 cancer types using All of Us data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current screening guidelines rely on narrow criteria (age, single risk factors) and may miss high-risk individuals. EHRs offer longitudinal, large-scale data; advances in models suggest potential but evidence comparing against traditional risk factors is limited.

Method: Systematic evaluation using All of Us data (EHR, genomic, survey) for eight cancers; compare EHR-based models (baseline and EHR foundation model) with traditional risk factors (gene mutations, family history); assess enrichment of true cancer cases in high-risk groups and cross-validate across 26 cancer types.

Result: EHR-based models achieved 3–6x higher enrichment of true cancer cases among those labeled high-risk vs traditional risk factors alone (standalone or complementary). The EHR foundation model improved predictive performance across 26 cancer types, highlighting clinical potential for precise, scalable early detection.

Conclusion: EHR-based predictive modeling can substantially improve high-risk stratification for cancer screening compared with traditional risk factors and may support more precise, scalable early detection strategies; further work needed on generalizability and integration into guidelines.

Abstract: Current cancer screening guidelines cover only a few cancer types and rely on narrowly defined criteria such as age or a single risk factor like smoking history, to identify high-risk individuals. Predictive models using electronic health records (EHRs), which capture large-scale longitudinal patient-level health information, may provide a more effective tool for identifying high-risk groups by detecting subtle prediagnostic signals of cancer. Recent advances in large language and foundation models have further expanded this potential, yet evidence remains limited on how useful HER-based models are compared with traditional risk factors currently used in screening guidelines. We systematically evaluated the clinical utility of EHR-based predictive models against traditional risk factors, including gene mutations and family history of cancer, for identifying high-risk individuals across eight major cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, liver, pancreatic, and stomach), using data from the All of Us Research Program, which integrates EHR, genomic, and survey data from over 865,000 participants. Even with a baseline modeling approach, EHR-based models achieved a 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases among individuals identified as high risk compared with traditional risk factors alone, whether used as a standalone or complementary tool. The EHR foundation model, a state-of-the-art approach trained on comprehensive patient trajectories, further improved predictive performance across 26 cancer types, demonstrating the clinical potential of EHR-based predictive modeling to support more precise and scalable early detection strategies.

TL;DR: MTPC is a probabilistic-circuit framework for multi-token prediction to speed up byte-level LLM generation, balancing expressiveness and latency; it retrofits EvaByte and, with speculative decoding, achieves substantial speedups while preserving verifier performance, and analyzes how architecture and parameter sharing affect the trade-off.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MTP methods often assume independence between future tokens, limiting expressiveness; a faster generation approach without sacrificing performance is needed. Probabilistic circuits offer a spectrum of expressiveness, enabling joint-token modeling for byte-level LLMs.

Method: Propose MTPC framework that encodes joint distributions over future tokens using various PC architectures (e.g., hierarchical mixture models, hidden Markov models, tensor networks). Retrofitting existing byte-level LLMs such as EvaByte. Combine MTPC with speculative decoding. Study how PC architectures and partial layer sharing between verifier and draft LLMs affect the expressiveness-latency trade-off.

Result: Experiments show MTPC speeds up generation relative to MTP with independence assumptions when used with speculative decoding, while maintaining the performance of the original verifier LLM. The work also provides a rigorous analysis of the optimal expressiveness-latency trade-off under different MTPC parameterizations and sharing schemes.

Conclusion: MTPC offers a flexible framework to explore the trade-off between expressiveness and latency in multi-token prediction for byte-level LLMs, with practical speedups demonstrated and guidance on architecture and sharing choices to optimize performance.

Abstract: Multi-token prediction (MTP) is a prominent strategy to significantly speed up generation in large language models (LLMs), including byte-level LLMs, which are tokeniser-free but prohibitively slow. However, existing MTP methods often sacrifice expressiveness by assuming independence between future tokens. In this work, we investigate the trade-off between expressiveness and latency in MTP within the framework of probabilistic circuits (PCs). Our framework, named MTPC, allows one to explore different ways to encode the joint distributions over future tokens by selecting different circuit architectures, generalising classical models such as (hierarchical) mixture models, hidden Markov models and tensor networks. We show the efficacy of MTPC by retrofitting existing byte-level LLMs, such as EvaByte. Our experiments show that, when combined with speculative decoding, MTPC significantly speeds up generation compared to MTP with independence assumptions, while guaranteeing to retain the performance of the original verifier LLM. We also rigorously study the optimal trade-off between expressiveness and latency when exploring the possible parameterisations of MTPC, such as PC architectures and partial layer sharing between the verifier and draft LLMs.

Motivation: Address data scarcity and the complex electronic structure of cathode materials that hinder MLFF development for Li-ion battery cathodes.

Method: Train neural-network based ML force fields using a multi-fidelity approach that fuses low-fidelity non-magnetic calculations with high-fidelity magnetic calculations; apply to LMFP cathode system and evaluate data efficiency and accuracy.

Result: The multi-fidelity framework achieves effective high-accuracy MLFF training with a reduced training dataset size; validated on LMFP, indicating improved data efficiency for cathode material simulations.

Conclusion: A multi-fidelity strategy is a viable path to high-accuracy MLFFs for cathode materials with lower data requirements, enabling broader application of MLFFs in computational cathode material studies.

Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs), which employ neural networks to map atomic structures to system energies, effectively combine the high accuracy of first-principles calculation with the computational efficiency of empirical force fields. They are widely used in computational materials simulations. However, the development and application of MLFFs for lithium-ion battery cathode materials remain relatively limited. This is primarily due to the complex electronic structure characteristics of cathode materials and the resulting scarcity of high-quality computational datasets available for force field training. In this work, we develop a multi-fidelity machine learning force field framework to enhance the data efficiency of computational results, which can simultaneously utilize both low-fidelity non-magnetic and high-fidelity magnetic computational datasets of cathode materials for training. Tests conducted on the lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode material system demonstrate the effectiveness of this multi-fidelity approach. This work helps to achieve high-accuracy MLFF training for cathode materials at a lower training dataset cost, and offers new perspectives for applying MLFFs to computational simulations of cathode materials.

Motivation: Edge AI requires adapting models to diverse tasks under tight memory; backpropagation stores activations and optimizer states, limiting deployable model size; a memory-efficient alternative can unlock larger models in-device.

Method: The paper derives theoretical bounds comparing maximum model sizes under BP and MeZO; then conducts numerical experiments to validate the theory and compare accuracy under memory constraints given varying wall-clock time.

Result: MeZO enables training larger models within on-device memory limits and can achieve accuracy advantages when enough wall-clock time is available for fine-tuning, outperforming BP under strict memory constraints.

Conclusion: On-device fine-tuning with MeZO is a viable approach to fit larger models within memory-constrained devices, trading some wall-clock efficiency for significant memory budget relief; theory and experiments corroborate its benefits.

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning is a critical capability for edge AI systems, which must support adaptation to different agentic tasks under stringent memory constraints. Conventional backpropagation (BP)-based training requires storing layer activations and optimizer states, a demand that can be only partially alleviated through checkpointing. In edge deployments in which the model weights must reside entirely in device memory, this overhead severely limits the maximum model size that can be deployed. Memory-efficient zeroth-order optimization (MeZO) alleviates this bottleneck by estimating gradients using forward evaluations alone, eliminating the need for storing intermediate activations or optimizer states. This enables significantly larger models to fit within on-chip memory, albeit at the cost of potentially longer fine-tuning wall-clock time. This paper first provides a theoretical estimate of the relative model sizes that can be accommodated under BP and MeZO training. We then numerically validate the analysis, demonstrating that MeZO exhibits accuracy advantages under on-device memory constraints, provided sufficient wall-clock time is available for fine-tuning.

### [198] [When Genes Speak: A Semantic-Guided Framework for Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics Data Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11380)
*Jiangkai Long,Yanran Zhu,Chang Tang,Kun Sun,Yuanyuan Liu,Xuesong Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SemST introduces semantic-aware embeddings for spatial transcriptomics by using LLMs to extract gene-symbol semantics, fusing these with spatial graph relations via GNNs, and applying a Fine-grained Semantic Modulation (FSM) to adapt the embeddings; this yields state-of-the-art clustering and is plug-and-play for other baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: A major limitation is treating genes as isolated numerical features, ignoring rich biological semantics encoded in gene symbols, which hampers deep biological understanding and accurate clustering in spatial contexts.

Method: Per-spot gene sets are converted into biologically informed embeddings using Large Language Models (LLMs). These semantic embeddings are fused with spatial relationships captured by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). A Fine-grained Semantic Modulation (FSM) module learns spot-specific affine transformations to calibrate spatial features with semantic priors, enabling high-order biological knowledge to influence the spatial representation.

Result: SemST achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance on public spatial transcriptomics datasets. The FSM module is plug-and-play and consistently improves other baseline methods when integrated.

Conclusion: Incorporating semantic priors from gene symbols into spatial models improves clustering and provides a versatile framework (FSM) that can boost other methods, highlighting the value of combining biological semantics with spatial structure.

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables gene expression profiling with spatial context, offering unprecedented insights into the tissue microenvironment. However, most computational models treat genes as isolated numerical features, ignoring the rich biological semantics encoded in their symbols. This prevents a truly deep understanding of critical biological characteristics. To overcome this limitation, we present SemST, a semantic-guided deep learning framework for spatial transcriptomics data clustering. SemST leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable genes to "speak" through their symbolic meanings, transforming gene sets within each tissue spot into biologically informed embeddings. These embeddings are then fused with the spatial neighborhood relationships captured by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), achieving a coherent integration of biological function and spatial structure. We further introduce the Fine-grained Semantic Modulation (FSM) module to optimally exploit these biological priors. The FSM module learns spot-specific affine transformations that empower the semantic embeddings to perform an element-wise calibration of the spatial features, thus dynamically injecting high-order biological knowledge into the spatial context. Extensive experiments on public spatial transcriptomics datasets show that SemST achieves state-of-the-art clustering performance. Crucially, the FSM module exhibits plug-and-play versatility, consistently improving the performance when integrated into other baseline methods.

### [199] [Robust inverse material design with physical guarantees using the Voigt-Reuss Net](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11388)
*Sanath Keshav,Felix Fritzen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spectrally normalized Voigt–Reuss surrogate for forward and inverse mechanical homogenization with hard physical guarantees, enabling accurate, physically admissible predictions and diverse, constraint-consistent inverse design in 3D and 2D settings; robust to large batches and applicable to elliptic/coupled-physics problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for fast, physically admissible surrogates for homogenization that respect Voigt–Reuss bounds and SPD structure, enabling reliable forward predictions and invertible design under invariance constraints and out-of-distribution generalization.

Method: Factor the Voigt–Reuss difference via a Cholesky-like operator to obtain a dimensionless symmetric positive semi-definite representation with eigenvalues in [0,1]. Train a Voigt–Reuss net (fully connected) to map microstructure descriptors to forward tensors and provide an inverse map yielding SPD predictions within Löwner bounds. In 3D elasticity, use >7.5×10^5 FFT-based labels, 236 isotropy-invariant descriptors, and 3 contrast parameters. In 2D plane strain, couple spectral normalization with a differentiable renderer and a CNN. Treat microstructure as design variables and perform batched first-order optimization with a single surrogate.

Result: 3D: isotropic projection recovered with near-perfect fidelity (R^2 ≥ 0.998); tensor-level relative Frobenius errors median ≈ 1.7%, mean ≈ 3.4% across splits; anisotropy-revealing couplings are unidentifiable from SO(3)-invariant inputs. 2D: R^2 > 0.99 on all components; subpercent normalized losses; accurate tracking of percolation-induced eigenvalue jumps; robust generalization to out-of-distribution images. Inverse design yields diverse near-optimal designs. 

Conclusion: The Voigt–Reuss net unifies accurate forward prediction with large-batch, constraint-consistent inverse design and is generic to elliptic operators and coupled-physics settings.

Abstract: We propose a spectrally normalized surrogate for forward and inverse mechanical homogenization with hard physical guarantees. Leveraging the Voigt-Reuss bounds, we factor their difference via a Cholesky-like operator and learn a dimensionless, symmetric positive semi-definite representation with eigenvalues in $[0,1]$; the inverse map returns symmetric positive-definite predictions that lie between the bounds in the Löwner sense. In 3D linear elasticity on an open dataset of stochastic biphasic microstructures, a fully connected Voigt-Reuss net trained on $>\!7.5\times 10^{5}$ FFT-based labels with 236 isotropy-invariant descriptors and three contrast parameters recovers the isotropic projection with near-perfect fidelity (isotropy-related entries: $R^2 \ge 0.998$), while anisotropy-revealing couplings are unidentifiable from $SO(3)$-invariant inputs. Tensor-level relative Frobenius errors have median $\approx 1.7\%$ and mean $\approx 3.4\%$ across splits. For 2D plane strain on thresholded trigonometric microstructures, coupling spectral normalization with a differentiable renderer and a CNN yields $R^2>0.99$ on all components, subpercent normalized losses, accurate tracking of percolation-induced eigenvalue jumps, and robust generalization to out-of-distribution images. Treating the parametric microstructure as design variables, batched first-order optimization with a single surrogate matches target tensors within a few percent and returns diverse near-optimal designs. Overall, the Voigt-Reuss net unifies accurate, physically admissible forward prediction with large-batch, constraint-consistent inverse design, and is generic to elliptic operators and coupled-physics settings.

*Yeyue Cai,Jianhua Mo,Meixia Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: End-to-end deep learning design for phase-time arrays (phase shifters and true-time delays) that jointly optimizes rainbow beams and 2D localization, achieving significant overhead reduction and improved localization accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phase-time arrays provide cost-effective, frequency-dependent beamforming for wideband sensing. A joint design of beamforming and user localization is desirable to maximize localization accuracy while minimizing overhead, which existing methods treat separately.

Method: Treat phase shifter and true-time delay coefficients as trainable variables within a neural network to synthesize task-oriented rainbow beams. Use a lightweight fully connected module to recover the user’s angle-range coordinates from the peak quantized received power and its associated subcarrier index after a single downlink transmission, with end-to-end training aimed at maximizing localization accuracy.

Result: Overhead is reduced by an order of magnitude compared to analytical and learning-based baselines, and the proposed method yields consistently lower two-dimensional positioning error.

Conclusion: An end-to-end DL framework that tunes PS/TTD parameters in phase-time arrays is effective for joint beam design and 2D localization, enabling accurate sensing with significantly reduced overhead.

Abstract: Phase-time arrays, which integrate phase shifters (PSs) and true-time delays (TTDs), have emerged as a cost-effective architecture for generating frequency-dependent rainbow beams in wideband sensing and localization. This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning-based scheme that simultaneously designs the rainbow beams and estimates user positions. Treating the PS and TTD coefficients as trainable variables allows the network to synthesize task-oriented beams that maximize localization accuracy. A lightweight fully connected module then recovers the user's angle-range coordinates from its feedback of the maximum quantized received power and its corresponding subcarrier index after a single downlink transmission. Compared with existing analytical and learning-based schemes, the proposed method reduces overhead by an order of magnitude and delivers consistently lower two-dimensional positioning error.

### [201] [Multi-Phase Spacecraft Trajectory Optimization via Transformer-Based Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11402)
*Amit Jain,Victor Rodriguez-Fernandez,Richard Linares*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A transformer-based reinforcement learning framework using a Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL) backbone atop PPO to unify multi-phase spacecraft trajectory optimization within a single policy, enabling memory across mission phases without explicit phase transitions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous spacecraft tasks span dynamically distinct regimes (launch, ascent, stage separation, orbit insertion). Existing RL often requires separate, phase-specific policies, increasing complexity and challenging safety verification. A unified policy with extended temporal context could generalize across phases, reduce operational overhead, and streamline verification.

Method: Replace recurrent networks with a transformer encoder-decoder (GTrXL) within proximal policy optimization (PPO). The agent maintains long-range memory across seconds-to-minutes of mission time, eliminating manual phase transitions and enabling coherent control across phase boundaries. Validation proceeds from simple benchmarks (double integrator, Van der Pol oscillator) to multiphase waypoint navigation and a complex multiphase rocket ascent (atmospheric flight, stage separation, vacuum operation).

Result: Transformer-based framework achieves near-optimal performance on simple benchmarks, learns coherent, phase-spanning control policies for multiphase tasks, and matches analytical solutions in simple cases while handling complex multiphase ascent; demonstrates scalability and reduced need for phase-specific controllers.

Conclusion: A unified transformer-based RL approach can effectively model and optimize multi-phase trajectories in autonomous space missions, providing scalable, phase-agnostic policies compatible with safety-critical verification and broader mission-planning applications.

Abstract: Autonomous spacecraft control for mission phases such as launch, ascent, stage separation, and orbit insertion remains a critical challenge due to the need for adaptive policies that generalize across dynamically distinct regimes. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in individual astrodynamics tasks, existing approaches often require separate policies for distinct mission phases, limiting adaptability and increasing operational complexity. This work introduces a transformer-based RL framework that unifies multi-phase trajectory optimization through a single policy architecture, leveraging the transformer's inherent capacity to model extended temporal contexts. Building on proximal policy optimization (PPO), our framework replaces conventional recurrent networks with a transformer encoder-decoder structure, enabling the agent to maintain coherent memory across mission phases spanning seconds to minutes during critical operations. By integrating a Gated Transformer-XL (GTrXL) architecture, the framework eliminates manual phase transitions while maintaining stability in control decisions. We validate our approach progressively: first demonstrating near-optimal performance on single-phase benchmarks (double integrator and Van der Pol oscillator), then extending to multiphase waypoint navigation variants, and finally tackling a complex multiphase rocket ascent problem that includes atmospheric flight, stage separation, and vacuum operations. Results demonstrate that the transformer-based framework not only matches analytical solutions in simple cases but also effectively learns coherent control policies across dynamically distinct regimes, establishing a foundation for scalable autonomous mission planning that reduces reliance on phase-specific controllers while maintaining compatibility with safety-critical verification protocols.

*Riccardo Colini Baldeschi,Simone Di Gregorio,Simone Fioravanti,Federico Fusco,Ido Guy,Daniel Haimovich,Stefano Leonardi,Fridolin Linder,Lorenzo Perini,Matteo Russo,Niek Tax*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multicalibrated predictors enable robust, competitive matching under imperfect edge-weight predictions, with theoretical sample complexity guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prediction-based decision making for weighted graph matching can be optimal under Bayes perfection, but real predictors are imperfect. Multicalibration provides a fairness-style regularization to mitigate prediction error across protected context sets, enabling robust decisions.

Method: From an arbitrary predictor gamma of edge-weights, construct a multicalibrated predictor hat_gamma. For a class of matching algorithms C, prove that selecting the best matching using hat_gamma is competitive with the best rule in C applied to gamma, and derive sample complexity bounds.

Result: Using hat_gamma for matching yields performance competitive with the best decision rule in C under gamma. The authors provide theoretical guarantees and finite-sample sample complexity bounds.

Conclusion: Multicalibration offers a principled approach to mitigate predictor error in stochastic weighted matching, yielding robust, fairer decisions with provable performance guarantees.

Abstract: Consider the problem of finding the best matching in a weighted graph where we only have access to predictions of the actual stochastic weights, based on an underlying context. If the predictor is the Bayes optimal one, then computing the best matching based on the predicted weights is optimal. However, in practice, this perfect information scenario is not realistic. Given an imperfect predictor, a suboptimal decision rule may compensate for the induced error and thus outperform the standard optimal rule.
  In this paper, we propose multicalibration as a way to address this problem. This fairness notion requires a predictor to be unbiased on each element of a family of protected sets of contexts. Given a class of matching algorithms $\mathcal C$ and any predictor $γ$ of the edge-weights, we show how to construct a specific multicalibrated predictor $\hat γ$, with the following property. Picking the best matching based on the output of $\hat γ$ is competitive with the best decision rule in $\mathcal C$ applied onto the original predictor $γ$. We complement this result by providing sample complexity bounds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Differentiable acoustic inverse problems: AD-based admittance estimation via JAX-FEM and AD-assisted shape optimization combining JAX-FEM forward sims with PyTorch3D mesh manipulation, yielding precise parameter estimates and substantial energy reductions with far fewer FEM solves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient, gradient-based optimization for physics-based acoustic inverse problems without manual adjoint derivations, leveraging modern differentiable software stacks.

Method: 1) Admittance estimation: use JAX-FEM AD to directly estimate complex boundary admittance from sparse pressure measurements. 2) Shape optimization: apply randomized finite differences for geometry optimization, with forward simulation in JAX-FEM and mesh manipulation via AD in PyTorch3D; separate physics-driven boundary optimization from geometry-driven interior mesh adaptation.

Result: Achieves 3-digit precision in admittance estimation. Demonstrates 48.1% energy reduction at target frequencies with 30× fewer FEM solutions than standard finite difference on the full mesh.

Conclusion: Illustrates how differentiable software stacks enable rapid prototyping of physics-based inverse problem workflows, using AD for parameter estimation and a hybrid finite-differences/AD approach for geometric design.

Abstract: We demonstrate a practical differentiable programming approach for acoustic inverse problems through two applications: admittance estimation and shape optimization for resonance damping. First, we show that JAX-FEM's automatic differentiation (AD) enables direct gradient-based estimation of complex boundary admittance from sparse pressure measurements, achieving 3-digit precision without requiring manual derivation of adjoint equations. Second, we apply randomized finite differences to acoustic shape optimization, combining JAX-FEM for forward simulation with PyTorch3D for mesh manipulation through AD. By separating physics-driven boundary optimization from geometry-driven interior mesh adaptation, we achieve 48.1% energy reduction at target frequencies with 30-fold fewer FEM solutions compared to standard finite difference on the full mesh. This work showcases how modern differentiable software stacks enable rapid prototyping of optimization workflows for physics-based inverse problems, with automatic differentiation for parameter estimation and a combination of finite differences and AD for geometric design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OT-based post-training quantization minimizes the 2-Wasserstein distance between quantized and original weights for Flow Matching (FM) generative models, enabling effective compression to 2-3 bits/parameter while preserving generation quality and latent stability, outperforming uniform, piecewise, and logarithmic schemes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deployability of FM generative models is hampered by high-precision parameter requirements. A principled quantization method is needed to compress weights without sacrificing performance, especially for edge/embedded AI.

Method: Apply OT-based post-training quantization that minimizes the 2-Wasserstein distance between the original and quantized weights. Compare with uniform, piecewise, and logarithmic quantization schemes. Provide theoretical upper bounds on generative degradation and validate empirically on five benchmark datasets of varying complexity.

Result: OT-based quantization preserves both visual generation quality and latent space stability down to 2-3 bits per parameter, whereas alternative quantization schemes fail at these low bit-depths.

Conclusion: OT-based quantization is a principled and effective approach for compressing FM generative models, enabling efficient deployment on edge and embedded AI devices.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) generative models offer efficient simulation-free training and deterministic sampling, but their practical deployment is challenged by high-precision parameter requirements. We adapt optimal transport (OT)-based post-training quantization to FM models, minimizing the 2-Wasserstein distance between quantized and original weights, and systematically compare its effectiveness against uniform, piecewise, and logarithmic quantization schemes. Our theoretical analysis provides upper bounds on generative degradation under quantization, and empirical results across five benchmark datasets of varying complexity show that OT-based quantization preserves both visual generation quality and latent space stability down to 2-3 bits per parameter, where alternative methods fail. This establishes OT-based quantization as a principled, effective approach to compress FM generative models for edge and embedded AI applications.

TL;DR: RETROFIT is a data retrospective-free continual learning method that merges teacher models and employs constrained parameter updates to prevent forgetting, enabling effective knowledge transfer without accessing historical data in security analytics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern security analytics rely on deep learning but suffer performance drops as threats evolve and data representations drift. In data-sensitive environments, traditional continual learning methods that require data replay or full retraining are infeasible, making knowledge transfer challenging for security-critical tasks.

Method: RETROFIT consolidates previously trained and newly fine-tuned models through parameter-level merging to avoid using old data. It uses low-rank and sparse updates to confine parameter changes to independent subspaces, and a knowledge arbitration mechanism dynamically balances teacher contributions guided by model confidence to mitigate interference.

Result: Evaluations on two security-critical tasks show strong forgetting mitigation and adaptability. In malware detection under temporal drift, retention improves from 20.2% to 38.6%, even exceeding the oracle upper bound on new data. In binary summarization across decompilation levels, RETROFIT achieves ~2x BLEU scores compared to transfer learning and surpasses all baselines in cross-representation generalization.

Conclusion: RETROFIT demonstrates consistent forgetting mitigation while maintaining adaptability in data-sensitive security analytics, offering a data-free continual learning approach with bounded forgetting and effective knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Modern security analytics are increasingly powered by deep learning models, but their performance often degrades as threat landscapes evolve and data representations shift. While continual learning (CL) offers a promising paradigm to maintain model effectiveness, many approaches rely on full retraining or data replay, which are infeasible in data-sensitive environments. Moreover, existing methods remain inadequate for security-critical scenarios, facing two coupled challenges in knowledge transfer: preserving prior knowledge without old data and integrating new knowledge with minimal interference.
  We propose RETROFIT, a data retrospective-free continual learning method that achieves bounded forgetting for effective knowledge transfer. Our key idea is to consolidate previously trained and newly fine-tuned models, serving as teachers of old and new knowledge, through parameter-level merging that eliminates the need for historical data. To mitigate interference, we apply low-rank and sparse updates that confine parameter changes to independent subspaces, while a knowledge arbitration dynamically balances the teacher contributions guided by model confidence. Our evaluation on two representative applications demonstrates that RETROFIT consistently mitigates forgetting while maintaining adaptability. In malware detection under temporal drift, it substantially improves the retention score, from 20.2% to 38.6% over CL baselines, and exceeds the oracle upper bound on new data. In binary summarization across decompilation levels, where analyzing stripped binaries is especially challenging, RETROFIT achieves around twice the BLEU score of transfer learning used in prior work and surpasses all baselines in cross-representation generalization.

TL;DR: DiffPro is a post-training framework that optimizes diffusion transformer deployment by co-optimizing timestep count, per-layer precision, and integer kernels to cut latency and memory without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models deliver high-quality images but are expensive to run; need a hardware-faithful, training-free method to reduce inference cost while preserving quality.

Method: Three components: a manifold-aware sensitivity metric for weight-bit allocation; dynamic activation quantization across timesteps; a budgeted timestep selector guided by teacher-student drift; operates with exact integer kernels; post-training and hardware-faithful.

Result: Achieves up to 6.25x model compression, ~50% fewer timesteps, 2.8x faster inference, Delta FID ≤ 10 on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: DiffPro unifies step reduction and precision planning into a deployable plan for real-time, energy-aware diffusion inference, enabling meaningful efficiency gains without model retraining.

Abstract: Diffusion models produce high quality images but inference is costly due to many denoising steps and heavy matrix operations. We present DiffPro, a post-training, hardware-faithful framework that works with the exact integer kernels used in deployment and jointly tunes timesteps and per-layer precision in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to reduce latency and memory without any training. DiffPro combines three parts: a manifold-aware sensitivity metric to allocate weight bits, dynamic activation quantization to stabilize activations across timesteps, and a budgeted timestep selector guided by teacher-student drift. In experiments DiffPro achieves up to 6.25x model compression, fifty percent fewer timesteps, and 2.8x faster inference with Delta FID <= 10 on standard benchmarks, demonstrating practical efficiency gains. DiffPro unifies step reduction and precision planning into a single budgeted deployable plan for real-time energy-aware diffusion inference.

*Xiaoyin Xi,Zhe Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A density-based pre-processing method, FairReweighing, uses a mutual-information separation metric to enforce fairness in regression (and classification) across binary/continuous sensitive attributes, with theoretical guarantees and empirical improvements in separation and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in AI is critical in high-stakes domains. Most fairness research focuses on binary classification; regression fairness and handling of continuous sensitive attributes remain underexplored. A robust, general fairness criterion (separation) and a pre-processing solution are needed to ensure equitable performance across diverse groups.

Method: Introduce a mutual-information-based separation metric applicable to classification and regression with binary and continuous sensitive attributes. Propose FairReweighing, a density-estimation-based pre-processing algorithm that reweights data to satisfy the separation criterion. Provide theoretical guarantees of separation on training data under a data-independence assumption. Empirically evaluate on synthetic and real-world datasets, comparing against state-of-the-art regression fairness methods.

Result: FairReweighing improves separation (reduces violations of the separation criterion) while maintaining high predictive accuracy, outperforming existing regression fairness methods on both synthetic and real-world data.

Conclusion: The proposed FairReweighing approach provides a theoretically grounded, empirically validated solution for achieving separation-based fairness in regression (and classification) tasks across binary and continuous sensitive attributes, with practical applicability and strong performance gains.

Abstract: There has been a prevalence of applying AI software in both high-stakes public-sector and industrial contexts. However, the lack of transparency has raised concerns about whether these data-informed AI software decisions secure fairness against people of all racial, gender, or age groups. Despite extensive research on emerging fairness-aware AI software, up to now most efforts to solve this issue have been dedicated to binary classification tasks. Fairness in regression is relatively underexplored. In this work, we adopted a mutual information-based metric to assess separation violations. The metric is also extended so that it can be directly applied to both classification and regression problems with both binary and continuous sensitive attributes. Inspired by the Reweighing algorithm in fair classification, we proposed a FairReweighing pre-processing algorithm based on density estimation to ensure that the learned model satisfies the separation criterion. Theoretically, we show that the proposed FairReweighing algorithm can guarantee separation in the training data under a data independence assumption. Empirically, on both synthetic and real-world data, we show that FairReweighing outperforms existing state-of-the-art regression fairness solutions in terms of improving separation while maintaining high accuracy.

### [208] [Epistemic Error Decomposition for Multi-step Time Series Forecasting: Rethinking Bias-Variance in Recursive and Direct Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11461)
*Riku Green,Huw Day,Zahraa S. Abdallah,Telmo M. Silva Filho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decompose multi-step forecasting error into irreducible noise, a structural approximation gap, and an estimation-variance term; linear predictors have zero structural gap; recursion’s variance scales with a Jacobian amplification; nonlinear predictors can benefit from repeated composition, affecting bias-variance trade-offs; validated with MLPs on ETTm1; guides strategy choice based on nonlinearity and noise rather than classic intuition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Revisit the standard bias-variance view of recursive vs direct multi-step forecasting and provide a principled decomposition to inform method selection.

Method: Derive an error decomposition across steps; analyze linear vs nonlinear predictors; express recursive variance as one-step variance times a Jacobian-based amplification factor; empirically validate with multilayer perceptrons on ETTm1.

Result: Structural gap vanishes for linear predictors; for nonlinear models the gap depends on model/data; recursive forecasts may exhibit both lower bias and higher variance depending on amplification; experiments with MLPs on ETTm1 corroborate the nuanced trade-offs.

Conclusion: Traditional bias-variance heuristics are insufficient for multi-step forecasting; strategy choice should consider nonlinearity and noise characteristics, using the decomposition to predict when recursion or direct is preferable.

Abstract: Multi-step forecasting is often described through a simple rule of thumb: recursive strategies are said to have high bias and low variance, while direct strategies are said to have low bias and high variance. We revisit this belief by decomposing the expected multi-step forecast error into three parts: irreducible noise, a structural approximation gap, and an estimation-variance term. For linear predictors we show that the structural gap is identically zero for any dataset. For nonlinear predictors, however, the repeated composition used in recursion can increase model expressivity, making the structural gap depend on both the model and the data. We further show that the estimation variance of the recursive strategy at any horizon can be written as the one-step variance multiplied by a Jacobian-based amplification factor that measures how sensitive the composed predictor is to parameter error. This perspective explains when recursive forecasting may simultaneously have lower bias and higher variance than direct forecasting. Experiments with multilayer perceptrons on the ETTm1 dataset confirm these findings. The results offer practical guidance for choosing between recursive and direct strategies based on model nonlinearity and noise characteristics, rather than relying on traditional bias-variance intuition.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer-based MoCap-to-spectrogram synthesis that generates plausible Doppler radar spectrograms from human motion, enabling data augmentation and edge IoT radar with lower compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar data are scarce and expensive to obtain; physics-based synthesis is costly. Leveraging abundant MoCap data to synthesize radar signals could augment datasets, enable edge/IOT radar applications, and reduce computation.

Method: Windowed sequence-to-sequence transformer model that jointly encodes spatial relations among MoCap markers and temporal dynamics across frames; includes ablation to assess contributions of motion parts and spatial relationships.

Result: Real-world experiments yield visually and quantitatively plausible Doppler spectrograms; the model generalizes well; ablations show it learns multi-part motion mapping and inter-marker spatial structure.

Conclusion: Transformers are viable for time-series signal processing; approach is applicable to edge/IOT radars, supports dataset augmentation, and is less computationally demanding than physics-based approaches.

Abstract: We present a pure machine learning process for synthesizing radar spectrograms from Motion-Capture (MoCap) data. We formulate MoCap-to-spectrogram translation as a windowed sequence-to-sequence task using a transformer-based model that jointly captures spatial relations among MoCap markers and temporal dynamics across frames. Real-world experiments show that the proposed approach produces visually and quantitatively plausible doppler radar spectrograms and achieves good generalizability. Ablation experiments show that the learned model includes both the ability to convert multi-part motion into doppler signatures and an understanding of the spatial relations between different parts of the human body.
  The result is an interesting example of using transformers for time-series signal processing. It is especially applicable to edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT) radars. It also suggests the ability to augment scarce radar datasets using more abundant MoCap data for training higher-level applications. Finally, it requires far less computation than physics-based methods for generating radar data.

*Sooyong Jang,Insup Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bin-based evaluation framework for adaptive conformal prediction with a group-conditional algorithm, featuring new balanced metrics and demonstrated gains on ImageNet and a medical task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adaptiveness evaluations are biased by imbalanced binning, leading to unreliable coverage and set-size estimates; balanced, transformation-based binning and group-aware methods are needed.

Method: 1) Sort examples by difficulty via input transformations and apply uniform-mass binning; 2) Introduce two metrics for evaluating adaptiveness under balanced bins; 3) Propose a new adaptive prediction-set algorithm that groups examples by estimated difficulty and applies group-conditional conformal prediction with per-group thresholds.

Result: New metrics show stronger correlation with true adaptiveness; the proposed adaptive prediction-set method outperforms existing approaches according to these metrics on ImageNet and a medical visual acuity task.

Conclusion: Balanced binning and group-conditional conformal prediction improve both the assessment of adaptiveness and the predictive performance, enabling more reliable and tailored prediction sets.

Abstract: Conformal prediction constructs a set of labels instead of a single point prediction, while providing a probabilistic coverage guarantee. Beyond the coverage guarantee, adaptiveness to example difficulty is an important property. It means that the method should produce larger prediction sets for more difficult examples, and smaller ones for easier examples. Existing evaluation methods for adaptiveness typically analyze coverage rate violation or average set size across bins of examples grouped by difficulty. However, these approaches often suffer from imbalanced binning, which can lead to inaccurate estimates of coverage or set size. To address this issue, we propose a binning method that leverages input transformations to sort examples by difficulty, followed by uniform-mass binning. Building on this binning, we introduce two metrics to better evaluate adaptiveness. These metrics provide more reliable estimates of coverage rate violation and average set size due to balanced binning, leading to more accurate adaptivity assessment. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed metric correlates more strongly with the desired adaptiveness property compared to existing ones. Furthermore, motivated by our findings, we propose a new adaptive prediction set algorithm that groups examples by estimated difficulty and applies group-conditional conformal prediction. This allows us to determine appropriate thresholds for each group. Experimental results on both (a) an Image Classification (ImageNet) (b) a medical task (visual acuity prediction) show that our method outperforms existing approaches according to the new metrics.

### [211] [Data-efficient U-Net for Segmentation of Carbide Microstructures in SEM Images of Steel Alloys](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11485)
*Alinda Ezgi Gerçek,Till Korten,Paul Chekhonin,Maleeha Hassan,Peter Steinbach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-efficient segmentation pipeline using a lightweight U-Net (~30.7M parameters) trained on 10 annotated SEM images achieves a Dice score of 0.98 for carbide–matrix segmentation in reactor-pressure-vessel steel, outperforming traditional metallurgical analysis and requiring far fewer annotations; it generalizes to other steel types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Carbide precipitates strengthen the alloy but can initiate cracks; gray-value overlap between carbides and matrix in SEM makes simple thresholding ineffective—therefore need accurate, data-efficient segmentation with limited labeled data.

Method: A lightweight U-Net architecture (30.7M parameters) trained on only 10 annotated SEM images to perform segmentation of carbide precipitates in reactor-pressure-vessel steel.

Result: Dice-Sørensen coefficient of 0.98, significantly higher than classical metallurgy methods (0.85); annotation effort reduced by an order of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art data-efficient segmentation model.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that data-efficient deep learning can enable rapid, automated carbide quantification and generalizes to other steel types, supporting faster alloy design and analysis of RPV steels.

Abstract: Understanding reactor-pressure-vessel steel microstructure is crucial for predicting mechanical properties, as carbide precipitates both strengthen the alloy and can initiate cracks. In scanning electron microscopy images, gray-value overlap between carbides and matrix makes simple thresholding ineffective. We present a data-efficient segmentation pipeline using a lightweight U-Net (30.7~M parameters) trained on just \textbf{10 annotated scanning electron microscopy images}. Despite limited data, our model achieves a \textbf{Dice-Sørensen coefficient of 0.98}, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art in the field of metallurgy (classical image analysis: 0.85), while reducing annotation effort by one order of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art data efficient segmentation model. This approach enables rapid, automated carbide quantification for alloy design and generalizes to other steel types, demonstrating the potential of data-efficient deep learning in reactor-pressure-vessel steel analysis.

### [212] [Intrinsic Dimension Estimation for Radio Galaxy Zoo using Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11490)
*Joan Font-Quer Roset,Devina Mohan,Anna Scaife*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Intrinsic dimension of the Radio Galaxy Zoo dataset is estimated with a score-based diffusion model. Out-of-distribution sources have higher intrinsic dimension, RGZ's iD exceeds that of natural images, and iD varies weakly with SNR; no FR I/II difference. Energy (BNN) scores correlate with iD, suggesting utility for SSL representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the intrinsic complexity of the RGZ data, how iD relates to similarity to a baseline subset (MiraBest) via energy scores, and how iD varies with morphology and SNR. Inform improvements to self-supervised learning representations.

Method: Apply a score-based diffusion model to estimate the intrinsic dimension (iD) of RGZ. Examine iD as a function of Bayesian neural network (BNN) energy scores (similarity to MiraBest). Analyze iD across Fanaroff-Riley (FR) classes and as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Compare RGZ iD to iD values typically reported for natural image datasets.

Result: Out-of-distribution sources exhibit higher iD. The overall RGZ iD exceeds that typically reported for natural image datasets. No significant difference between FR I and FR II classes. A weak trend shows higher SNR associated with lower iD.

Conclusion: The relationship between iD and energy scores could be exploited to quantitatively study and improve representations learned by self-supervised learning algorithms applied to RGZ data; future work should leverage this link to enhance SSL representations.

Abstract: In this work, we estimate the intrinsic dimension (iD) of the Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) dataset using a score-based diffusion model. We examine how the iD estimates vary as a function of Bayesian neural network (BNN) energy scores, which measure how similar the radio sources are to the MiraBest subset of the RGZ dataset. We find that out-of-distribution sources exhibit higher iD values, and that the overall iD for RGZ exceeds those typically reported for natural image datasets. Furthermore, we analyse how iD varies across Fanaroff-Riley (FR) morphological classes and as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While no relationship is found between FR I and FR II classes, a weak trend toward higher SNR at lower iD. Future work using the RGZ dataset could make use of the relationship between iD and energy scores to quantitatively study and improve the representations learned by various self-supervised learning algorithms.

### [213] [Honesty over Accuracy: Trustworthy Language Models through Reinforced Hesitation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11500)
*Mohamad Amin Mohamadi,Tianhao Wang,Zhiyuan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RH introduces a ternary-reward variant of RLVR to train models to abstain, yielding a Pareto frontier over risk tolerance; two inference strategies (cascading and self-cascading) leverage abstention for efficient coordination and outperform majority voting; abstention becomes a trust-building, first-class signal.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trustworthy AI requires knowing when not to answer. Existing prompts fail to induce abstention due to training that rewards giving an answer; frontier models rarely abstain even with penalties. The work seeks calibrated honesty and coordination via abstention.

Method: Modify RLVR with ternary rewards (+1 correct, 0 abstain, -λ error); train multiple models across λ to explore risk regimes; evaluate on logic puzzles; develop two inference strategies: cascading through models with decreasing risk tolerance and self-cascading re-queries to the same model on abstention; compare against majority voting.

Result: Varying λ yields a Pareto frontier of models specialized for different risk regimes; each penalty level yields the optimal model for its regime. The two inference strategies outperform majority voting and require lower computational cost.

Conclusion: Abstention is a first-class training objective that converts 'I don’t know' into a coordination signal, enabling trust through calibrated honesty about limits; the proposed inference strategies demonstrate how abstention can be used to improve accuracy-cost trade-offs.

Abstract: Modern language models fail a fundamental requirement of trustworthy intelligence: knowing when not to answer. Despite achieving impressive accuracy on benchmarks, these models produce confident hallucinations, even when wrong answers carry catastrophic consequences. Our evaluations on GSM8K, MedQA and GPQA show frontier models almost never abstain despite explicit warnings of severe penalties, suggesting that prompts cannot override training that rewards any answer over no answer. As a remedy, we propose Reinforced Hesitation (RH): a modification to Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to use ternary rewards (+1 correct, 0 abstention, -$λ$ error) instead of binary. Controlled experiments on logic puzzles reveal that varying $λ$ produces distinct models along a Pareto frontier, where each training penalty yields the optimal model for its corresponding risk regime: low penalties produce aggressive answerers, high penalties conservative abstainers. We then introduce two inference strategies that exploit trained abstention as a coordination signal: cascading routes queries through models with decreasing risk tolerance, while self-cascading re-queries the same model on abstention. Both outperform majority voting with lower computational cost. These results establish abstention as a first-class training objective that transforms ``I don't know'' from failure into a coordination signal, enabling models to earn trust through calibrated honesty about their limits.

*Yonatan Dukler,Guihong Li,Deval Shah,Vikram Appia,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FarSkip-Collective enables overlapping computation and communication in MoEs by architecturally inserting skip connections, enabling 16B–109B models to maintain close-to-original accuracy while speeding up training and inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Blocking, communication-bound MoEs hinder scalability; need to overlap computation with communication without sacrificing model capability.

Method: Modify model architecture to include skip connections enabling overlap; apply self-distillation; convert multiple models (16B–109B); implement optimized overlap-enabled training/inference pipelines.

Result: Converted models retain accuracy comparable to original open-source releases; e.g., Llama 4 Scout 109B achieves avg accuracy within 1% of instruction-tuned release across downstream tasks; performance gains in training and inference through explicit overlap.

Conclusion: FarSkip-Collective effectively achieves computation-communication overlap in MoEs at scale while preserving accuracy, offering speedups in real frameworks.

Abstract: Blocking communication presents a major hurdle in running MoEs efficiently in distributed settings. To address this, we present FarSkip-Collective which modifies the architecture of modern models to enable overlapping of their computation with communication. Our approach modifies the architecture to skip connections in the model and it is unclear a priori whether the modified model architecture can remain as capable, especially for large state-of-the-art models and while modifying all of the model layers. We answer this question in the affirmative and fully convert a series of state-of-the-art models varying from 16B to 109B parameters to enable overlapping of their communication while achieving accuracy on par with their original open-source releases. For example, we convert Llama 4 Scout (109B) via self-distillation and achieve average accuracy within 1% of its instruction tuned release averaged across a wide range of downstream evaluations. In addition to demonstrating retained accuracy of the large modified models, we realize the benefits of FarSkip-Collective through optimized implementations that explicitly overlap communication with computation, accelerating both training and inference in existing frameworks.

### [215] [Generalizing Fair Clustering to Multiple Groups: Algorithms and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11539)
*Diptarka Chakraborty,Kushagra Chatterjee,Debarati Das,Tien-Long Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Generalizes closest fair clustering to multiple protected groups; proves NP-hard even with equal-sized groups; provides near-linear time approximation algorithms for arbitrary-sized groups; improves fair correlation clustering and provides first approximations for fair consensus clustering with multiple groups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fairness gaps in clustering when data have many protected attributes (beyond two groups), ensuring fair representation across multiple groups and enabling efficient post-processing fairness.

Method: 1) Proves NP-hardness for closest fair clustering with arbitrary number of groups (even when groups are equal-sized). 2) Develops near-linear time approximation algorithms that handle multiple groups of arbitrary sizes. 3) Uses these closest fair clustering algorithms to improve approximation guarantees for fair correlation clustering. 4) Provides the first approximation algorithms for fair consensus clustering with more than two groups.

Result: Shows NP-hardness even for equal-sized groups; introduces near-linear time approximations for multi-group settings; achieves improved approximations for fair correlation clustering; first-known approximations for fair consensus clustering with multiple groups.

Conclusion: Extends closest fair clustering to general multi-group settings, answering open questions in COLT'25 and enabling practical fair clustering algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees across several related clustering problems.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in machine learning and data analysis, but it frequently fails to provide fair representation for various marginalized communities defined by multiple protected attributes -- a shortcoming often caused by biases in the training data. As a result, there is a growing need to enhance the fairness of clustering outcomes, ideally by making minimal modifications, possibly as a post-processing step after conventional clustering. Recently, Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25] initiated the study of \emph{closest fair clustering}, though in a restricted scenario where data points belong to only two groups. In practice, however, data points are typically characterized by many groups, reflecting diverse protected attributes such as age, ethnicity, gender, etc.
  In this work, we generalize the study of the \emph{closest fair clustering} problem to settings with an arbitrary number (more than two) of groups. We begin by showing that the problem is NP-hard even when all groups are of equal size -- a stark contrast with the two-group case, for which an exact algorithm exists. Next, we propose near-linear time approximation algorithms that efficiently handle arbitrary-sized multiple groups, thereby answering an open question posed by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].
  Leveraging our closest fair clustering algorithms, we further achieve improved approximation guarantees for the \emph{fair correlation clustering} problem, advancing the state-of-the-art results established by Ahmadian et al. [AISTATS'20] and Ahmadi et al. [2020]. Additionally, we are the first to provide approximation algorithms for the \emph{fair consensus clustering} problem involving multiple (more than two) groups, thus addressing another open direction highlighted by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].

### [216] [Multistability of Self-Attention Dynamics in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11553)
*Claudio Altafini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-attention in transformers can be framed as a continuous-time multiagent system akin to a multiagent Oja flow; the dynamics tend to eigen-directions of the value matrix, with several classes of equilibria and possible coexistence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the dynamic behavior of self-attention mechanisms, link them to a dynamical system (Oja flow) and eigenstructure, and classify the equilibria to explain how attention aligns with principal components.

Method: Model the single-head self-attention as a continuous-time dynamical system; analyze equilibria; relate the dynamics to a multiagent Oja flow; classify equilibria into four types and study their stability and eigenvector alignment.

Result: Classification of equilibria into four classes: consensus, bipartite consensus, clustering, and polygonal equilibria. Multiple asymptotically stable equilibria from the first three classes coexist. Equilibria from the first two classes are always aligned with eigenvectors of the value matrix, often (but not exclusively) with the principal eigenvector.

Conclusion: Self-attention dynamics tend to align with eigen-directions of the value matrix, revealing a principal-component-like mechanism. The coexistence of multiple stable equilibria indicates rich, multi-solution behavior that may influence learning and initialization in transformer models.

Abstract: In machine learning, a self-attention dynamics is a continuous-time multiagent-like model of the attention mechanisms of transformers. In this paper we show that such dynamics is related to a multiagent version of the Oja flow, a dynamical system that computes the principal eigenvector of a matrix corresponding for transformers to the value matrix. We classify the equilibria of the ``single-head'' self-attention system into four classes: consensus, bipartite consensus, clustering and polygonal equilibria. Multiple asymptotically stable equilibria from the first three classes often coexist in the self-attention dynamics. Interestingly, equilibria from the first two classes are always aligned with the eigenvectors of the value matrix, often but not exclusively with the principal eigenvector.

### [217] [A Unified Convergence Analysis for Semi-Decentralized Learning: Sampled-to-Sampled vs. Sampled-to-All Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11560)
*Angelo Rodio,Giovanni Neglia,Zheng Chen,Erik G. Larsson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work compares sampled-to-sampled (S2S) and sampled-to-all (S2A) aggregation in semi-decentralized federated learning under a unified convergence framework, revealing regime-dependent performance tied to data heterogeneity and system parameters, with actionable guidelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Despite practical importance, there is no rigorous theoretical or empirical comparison for S2S vs S2A. Understanding when each approach is advantageous informs deployment decisions.

Method: Develop a unified convergence analysis that incorporates sampling rate, server aggregation frequency, and network connectivity; supplement with experiments to validate theoretical predictions across varying heterogeneity and connectivity.

Result: Identifies distinct regimes where S2S or S2A outperforms, depending primarily on data heterogeneity; provides quantitative guidelines for choosing strategy and system parameters.

Conclusion: Offers concrete design guidelines for semi-decentralized FL deployments, enabling practitioners to select S2S vs S2A based on heterogeneity and network conditions, and to tune sampling and aggregation.

Abstract: In semi-decentralized federated learning, devices primarily rely on device-to-device communication but occasionally interact with a central server. Periodically, a sampled subset of devices uploads their local models to the server, which computes an aggregate model. The server can then either (i) share this aggregate model only with the sampled clients (sampled-to-sampled, S2S) or (ii) broadcast it to all clients (sampled-to-all, S2A). Despite their practical significance, a rigorous theoretical and empirical comparison of these two strategies remains absent. We address this gap by analyzing S2S and S2A within a unified convergence framework that accounts for key system parameters: sampling rate, server aggregation frequency, and network connectivity. Our results, both analytical and experimental, reveal distinct regimes where one strategy outperforms the other, depending primarily on the degree of data heterogeneity across devices. These insights lead to concrete design guidelines for practical semi-decentralized FL deployments.

### [218] [Optimizing Mixture of Block Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11571)
*Guangxuan Xiao,Junxian Guo,Kasra Mazaheri,Song Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a theoretically-grounded improvement to MoBA by formulating a statistical model that ties routing accuracy to architecture, advocates small block sizes and key-convolution, and delivers a GPU-optimized FlashMoBA kernel that achieves major speedups while matching dense attention performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoBA enables sparse block attention to handle long contexts in LLMs but lacks clear design principles and an efficient GPU implementation, hindering adoption. Understanding the factors that govern MoBA's performance and providing an efficient, practical implementation can unlock its benefits.

Method: Formulate a statistical model of MoBA to link router accuracy with architectural choices via a derived signal-to-noise ratio. Propose two improvements (smaller block sizes and a short convolution on keys to cluster signals). Develop a hardware-aware CUDA kernel (FlashMoBA) to make small-block MoBA practical on GPUs. Validate by training LLMs from scratch and comparing against dense attention baselines and existing FlashAttention-2.

Result: The analysis shows that performance hinges on the router's retrieval accuracy, characterized by a derived SNR linking architecture to accuracy. Small blocks and key-convolution improve routing but pose GPU inefficiency; FlashMoBA mitigates this with a GPU-optimized kernel, achieving up to 14.7x speedup over FlashAttention-2 for small blocks and enabling MoBA models to match dense attention performance.

Conclusion: A theory-guided design plus a hardware-aware implementation makes efficient MoBA practical for long-context LLMs. The approach clarifies design trade-offs and demonstrates substantial practical speedups without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Mixture of Block Attention (MoBA) (Lu et al., 2025) is a promising building block for efficiently processing long contexts in LLMs by enabling queries to sparsely attend to a small subset of key-value blocks, drastically reducing computational cost. However, the design principles governing MoBA's performance are poorly understood, and it lacks an efficient GPU implementation, hindering its practical adoption. In this paper, we first develop a statistical model to analyze MoBA's underlying mechanics. Our model reveals that performance critically depends on the router's ability to accurately distinguish relevant from irrelevant blocks based on query-key affinities. We derive a signal-to-noise ratio that formally connects architectural parameters to this retrieval accuracy. Guided by our analysis, we identify two key pathways for improvement: using smaller block sizes and applying a short convolution on keys to cluster relevant signals, which enhances routing accuracy. While theoretically better, small block sizes are inefficient on GPUs. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlashMoBA, a hardware-aware CUDA kernel that enables efficient MoBA execution even with the small block sizes our theory recommends. We validate our insights by training LLMs from scratch, showing that our improved MoBA models match the performance of dense attention baselines. FlashMoBA achieves up to 14.7x speedup over FlashAttention-2 for small blocks, making our theoretically-grounded improvements practical.

### [219] [The Second Law of Intelligence: Controlling Ethical Entropy in Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10704)
*Samih Fadli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a Second Law-like framework for AI alignment where ethical entropy of goal distribution increases without alignment work; derives a stability boundary for alignment, and validates via simulations with a 7B-parameter model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide a quantitative, thermodynamics-inspired theory of AI alignment that predicts when autonomous systems drift away from intended goals, and how much alignment effort (gamma) is needed to maintain stability.

Method: Define ethical entropy S = -Σ p(g_i; θ) ln p(g_i; θ) over a finite set of goals {g_i}. Prove dS/dt ≥ 0 due to exploration noise and specification gaming. Derive alignment stability boundary gamma_crit = (λ_max/2) ln N, where λ_max is the dominant eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix and N is parameter count. Validate via simulations: a 7e9-parameter model with λ_max = 1.2 drifts in entropy from 0.32 to 1.69 ± 1.08 nats; with alignment regularization gamma = 20.4 (~1.5 gamma_crit) entropy remains at 0.00 ± 0.00 nats (p = 4.19e-17, n = 20 trials).

Result: Entropy of the unconstrained model increases over time unless alignment is applied; a computed critical alignment threshold gamma_crit can stabilize the system; empirical simulations support theory by showing drift without alignment and stability with sufficient alignment effort.

Conclusion: Recasts AI alignment as a continuous thermodynamic control problem and provides a quantitative framework for maintaining stability and safety in advanced autonomous systems.

Abstract: We propose that unconstrained artificial intelligence obeys a Second Law analogous to thermodynamics, where ethical entropy, defined as a measure of divergence from intended goals, increases spontaneously without continuous alignment work. For gradient-based optimizers, we define this entropy over a finite set of goals {g_i} as S = -Σ p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta), and we prove that its time derivative dS/dt >= 0, driven by exploration noise and specification gaming. We derive the critical stability boundary for alignment work as gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N, where lambda_max is the dominant eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix and N is the number of model parameters. Simulations validate this theory. A 7-billion-parameter model (N = 7 x 10^9) with lambda_max = 1.2 drifts from an initial entropy of 0.32 to 1.69 +/- 1.08 nats, while a system regularized with alignment work gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintains stability at 0.00 +/- 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 x 10^-17, n = 20 trials). This framework recasts AI alignment as a problem of continuous thermodynamic control, providing a quantitative foundation for maintaining the stability and safety of advanced autonomous systems.

### [220] [Co-EPG: A Framework for Co-Evolution of Planning and Grounding in Autonomous GUI Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10705)
*Yuan Zhao,Hualei Zhu,Tingyu Jiang,Shen Li,Xiaohang Xu,Hao Henry Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Co-EPG is a self-iterative co-evolution framework for GUI task automation that alternates planning and grounding training via GRPO, achieving state-of-the-art results on Mind2Web and AndroidControl after only three iterations with no external data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome two core GUI agent limitations: (i) insufficient cross-model synergy exploitation and (ii) over-reliance on synthetic data without effective use. The approach integrates planning and grounding in a self-improving loop to leverage mutual benefits.

Method: An iterative positive feedback loop where the planning model uses grounding-based rewards via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to generate diverse data. The grounding model then provides better rewards for subsequent GRPO training of the planning model. This self-play, data-distillation cycle continues for multiple iterations, improving both components without external data.

Result: On the Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, Co-EPG outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after only three iterations, with agent performance improving at each step and no external data required.

Conclusion: Co-EPG introduces a novel co-evolution training paradigm for GUI agents, moving from isolated optimization to integrated, self-driven improvement through planning-grounding collaboration and data distillation.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) task automation constitutes a critical frontier in artificial intelligence research. While effective GUI agents synergistically integrate planning and grounding capabilities, current methodologies exhibit two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient exploitation of cross-model synergies, and (2) over-reliance on synthetic data generation without sufficient utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Co-EPG, a self-iterative training framework for Co-Evolution of Planning and Grounding. Co-EPG establishes an iterative positive feedback loop: through this loop, the planning model explores superior strategies under grounding-based reward guidance via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), generating diverse data to optimize the grounding model. Concurrently, the optimized Grounding model provides more effective rewards for subsequent GRPO training of the planning model, fostering continuous improvement. Co-EPG thus enables iterative enhancement of agent capabilities through self-play optimization and training data distillation. On the Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after just three iterations without requiring external data. The agent consistently improves with each iteration, demonstrating robust self-enhancement capabilities. This work establishes a novel training paradigm for GUI agents, shifting from isolated optimization to an integrated, self-driven co-evolution approach.

*Niclas Boehmer,Maximilian T. Wittmann*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reformulating Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, this work analyzes quality measures axiomatically, reveals unintuitive behaviors, introduces directed coverage, studies complexity boundaries, and shows via experiments that the chosen measure crucially shapes the selected subset, with directed coverage performing well.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce decision-maker cognitive load when selecting a fixed-size representative subset of Pareto-optimal solutions by leveraging insights from voting theory; understand quality measures and computational trade-offs.

Method: Axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures in the Pareto pruning setting treated as multiwinner voting; introduction of a new measure called directed coverage; complexity analysis to identify tractable/intractable regimes based on number/structure of objectives; experimental evaluation across datasets/settings to compare measures.

Result: Identified unintuitive or undesirable behaviors in several existing quality measures; proposed directed coverage as a robust alternative; mapped complexity boundaries; empirical results show measure choice substantially affects selected sets; directed coverage competes well across settings.

Conclusion: Directed coverage is a valuable contribution for Pareto pruning in multiobjective optimization; measure selection matters; future work should further explore axioms, scalability, and real-world validation.

Abstract: Many real-world decision-making problems involve optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously, rendering the selection of the most preferred solution a non-trivial problem: All Pareto optimal solutions are viable candidates, and it is typically up to a decision maker to select one for implementation based on their subjective preferences. To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the choice of quality measure has a decisive impact on the characteristics of the selected set of solutions and that our proposed measure performs competitively or even favorably across a range of settings.

### [222] [Structure-Aware Encodings of Argumentation Properties for Clique-width](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10767)
*Yasir Mahmood,Markus Hecher,Johanna Groven,Johannes K. Fichte*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper studies how to encode argumentation problems into (Q)SAT while preserving clique-width linearly using directed decomposition-guided reductions, showing broad results across all argumentation semantics (including counting) and proving the encoding overhead cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand and quantify how graph-structural parameters (clique-width) influence the encoding of argumentation problems into SAT/QSAT and to assess the limits of compact encodings for structured instances.

Method: Introduce and construct linear-preserving directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT, and apply these reductions to all argumentation semantics (including counting) to analyze overhead and feasibility.

Result: Establish new theoretical results for all argumentation semantics (including counting) using DDG reductions; prove that the overhead induced by these reductions cannot be substantially improved under reasonable assumptions.

Conclusion: DDG reductions provide a robust framework for encoding argumentation into SAT/QSAT under clique-width constraints, demonstrating the feasibility of maintaining low clique-width in encodings and outlining inherent overhead limits.

Abstract: Structural measures of graphs, such as treewidth, are central tools in computational complexity resulting in efficient algorithms when exploiting the parameter. It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting. Notably, the overhead caused by our DDG reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces PoR and PoB as new counterfactual decision metrics to quantify ranking of potential outcomes and the probability of obtaining the best outcome; provides identification theorems, bounds, estimation methods, and empirical demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To better understand decision-making under uncertainty by quantifying how likely each action is to produce particular rankings of outcomes and the chance of yielding the top outcome for an individual.

Method: Define PoR and PoB, derive identification theorems and bounds for these metrics, propose estimation procedures, and validate via numerical simulations and a real-world dataset.

Result: Establishes identification/bounds for PoR/PoB, develops practical estimators, and demonstrates finite-sample performance and applicability to real data.

Conclusion: PoR and PoB offer interpretable, actionable metrics for counterfactual decision-making under uncertainty, with tractable estimation and demonstrated empirical utility.

Abstract: Counterfactual decision-making in the face of uncertainty involves selecting the optimal action from several alternatives using causal reasoning. Decision-makers often rank expected potential outcomes (or their corresponding utility and desirability) to compare the preferences of candidate actions. In this paper, we study new counterfactual decision-making rules by introducing two new metrics: the probabilities of potential outcome ranking (PoR) and the probability of achieving the best potential outcome (PoB). PoR reveals the most probable ranking of potential outcomes for an individual, and PoB indicates the action most likely to yield the top-ranked outcome for an individual. We then establish identification theorems and derive bounds for these metrics, and present estimation methods. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the finite-sample properties of the estimators and demonstrate their application to a real-world dataset.

*Chao Wu,Baoheng Li,Mingchen Gao,Zhenyi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reframes LLM reasoning as adaptive, cost-aware behavior that allocates effort by input difficulty/uncertainty; formalizes deductive/inductive/abductive reasoning, and a control-augmented policy framework; offers a taxonomy of adaptive methods and outlines open challenges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs use uniform reasoning across tasks, generating long traces for easy cases while failing to reason enough on hard ones. This waste and mismatch motivate a shift to adaptivity that tunes reasoning effort to input characteristics.

Method: Formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context; model adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing performance and computational cost; distinguish learned policies from inference-time control; classify existing methods into training-based (reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, learned controllers) and training-free (prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, modular composition).

Result: Delivers a theoretical framework and a systematic taxonomy to compare adaptive reasoning approaches, clarifying how different mechanisms realize adaptivity in practice; enables systematic evaluation across strategies; no empirical results reported in the abstract.

Conclusion: Highlights open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made reasoning a central benchmark for evaluating intelligence. While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.

### [226] [HyperComplEx: Adaptive Multi-Space Knowledge Graph Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10842)
*Jugal Gajjar,Kaustik Ranaware,Kamalasankari Subramaniakuppusamy,Vaibhav Gandhi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HyperComplEx is a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively blends hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces with relation-specific weighting and a multi-space consistency loss to model diverse relations at scale, achieving state-of-the-art results on large knowledge graphs with efficient inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KG embedding methods struggle to model all relation types and scales: Euclidean spaces handle hierarchies poorly, vector spaces miss asymmetry, and hyperbolic spaces struggle with symmetric relations. A flexible, adaptive approach across multiple geometries is needed to capture diverse relational patterns efficiently.

Method: Propose HyperComplEx, which uses learned attention to combine hyperbolic, complex (ComplEx), and Euclidean embeddings. Introduces a relation-specific space weighting strategy to select optimal geometries per relation type, and a multi-space consistency loss to ensure coherent predictions across spaces. Demonstrates near-linear scaling with graph size via adaptive dimension allocation, and reports results on knowledge graphs ranging from ~25K to ~45M triples, plus standard benchmarks.

Result: HyperComplEx achieves consistent improvements over baselines (TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, UltraE). On the 10M-paper dataset, MRR=0.612, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, with 85 ms per-triple inference. Training remains efficient and scales near-linearly with graph size. Additional tests on standard benchmarks show significantly higher performance than all baselines.

Conclusion: Adaptive multi-space embeddings effectively model diverse relation types at scale, offering strong performance gains with efficient training. The authors release code and dataset family to support reproducible research in scalable KG embeddings.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs have emerged as fundamental structures for representing complex relational data across scientific and enterprise domains. However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation. We release our implementation and dataset family to facilitate reproducible research in scalable knowledge graph embeddings.

*Gerui Xu,Boyou Chen,Huizhong Guo,Dave LeBlanc,Ananna Ahmed,Zhaonan Sun,Shan Bao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Two-phase multi-agent AI framework reconstructs pre-crash scenarios from multimodal data and reasons over EDR data; achieves perfect accuracy on a subset of complex rear-end collisions, surpassing human performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate inconsistencies from incomplete multimodal collision data by automating robust reconstruction and reasoning to infer pre-crash behaviors.

Method: Phase I: generate natural-language reconstructions from multimodal inputs (reports, tabular data, scene diagrams). Phase II: crash reasoning by combining reconstructions with temporal EDR data. Validation on 277 rear-end LVD cases; focused evaluation on 39 complex cases with ambiguous data; compare against human accuracy.

Result: Perfect accuracy across 39 complex cases; correctly identifies the most relevant EDR event and vehicle roles; beats humans (92% accuracy); robust to missing or conflicting data.

Conclusion: Shows AI can process heterogeneous collision data with unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and pre-crash behaviors, surpassing traditional human-only approaches.

Abstract: Traffic collision reconstruction traditionally relies on human expertise, often yielding inconsistent results when analyzing incomplete multimodal data. This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams. This study demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.

*Seyedeh Mobina Noorani,Shangde Gao,Changjie Chen,Karla Saldana Ochoa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A planning-support system uses agentic AI and a RepSC-SOM to generate demand-oriented, dynamic regions for disaster planning with human-in-the-loop, demonstrated through a Jacksonville flooding case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional planning units (e.g., census tracts) often miss local demand and lack flexibility for hazard prevention. There is a need for dynamic, transparent, and adaptable regionalization that can support targeted disaster planning.

Method: Develop a RepSC-SOM (representative initialized spatially constrained self-organizing map) with adaptive geographic filtering and region-growing refinement. Integrate AI agents capable of reasoning, planning, and acting to suggest input features, guide spatial constraints, and enable interactive exploration. Provide a user-in-the-loop platform for interactive generation and evaluation of regions. Validate with a case study on flood risk in Jacksonville, FL.

Result: The platform enables users to explore, generate, and evaluate demand-oriented regions interactively, marrying computational rigor with user-driven decision making and demonstrating flexible, transparent regionalization for disaster planning in a real-world case.

Conclusion: Dynamic, demand-oriented planning units guided by agentic AI and RepSC-SOM provide a transparent and adaptable tool for disaster planning, improving targeting and responsiveness compared to conventional fixed units; the Jacksonville case illustrates practical applicability and user-centered decision support.

Abstract: Conventional planning units or urban regions, such as census tracts, zip codes, or neighborhoods, often do not capture the specific demands of local communities and lack the flexibility to implement effective strategies for hazard prevention or response. To support the creation of dynamic planning units, we introduce a planning support system with agentic AI that enables users to generate demand-oriented regions for disaster planning, integrating the human-in-the-loop principle for transparency and adaptability. The platform is built on a representative initialized spatially constrained self-organizing map (RepSC-SOM), extending traditional SOM with adaptive geographic filtering and region-growing refinement, while AI agents can reason, plan, and act to guide the process by suggesting input features, guiding spatial constraints, and supporting interactive exploration. We demonstrate the capabilities of the platform through a case study on the flooding-related risk in Jacksonville, Florida, showing how it allows users to explore, generate, and evaluate regionalization interactively, combining computational rigor with user-driven decision making.

### [229] [LLM enhanced graph inference for long-term disease progression modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10890)
*Tiantian He,An Zhao,Elinor Thompson,Anna Schroder,Ahmed Abdulaal,Frederik Barkhof,Daniel C. Alexander*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework that uses Large Language Models as expert guides to learn long-term, biologically-constrained disease trajectories and interactions among brain regions, improving tau pathology prediction in Alzheimer's disease compared to traditional single-modality connectome and data-driven approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current modeling oversimplifies pathology spread by relying on a single brain-connectivity modality and unconstrained data-driven graphs, leading to poor identifiability and inaccurate long-term predictions. There is a need to incorporate multi-modal disease-driving mechanisms and irregularly sampled longitudinal data; LLMs can synthesize cross-modal relationships to guide learning.

Method: Develop a framework where LLMs guide the interaction among regional biomarkers to jointly learn long-term disease trajectories and a biologically-constrained graph of inter-regional interactions. Optimizes from irregular longitudinal observations and enforces biological constraints; applied to tau-PET data from an AD cohort.

Result: Achieves superior prediction accuracy and interpretability relative to traditional approaches and uncovers additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity.

Conclusion: Supports the viability of LLM-guided, multi-modal constraint-based modeling for neurodegenerative pathology spread, enhancing identifiability and biological insight, with potential generalization to other diseases and biomarkers.

Abstract: Understanding the interactions between biomarkers among brain regions during neurodegenerative disease is essential for unravelling the mechanisms underlying disease progression. For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.

*Ha-Thanh Nguyen,Wachara Fungwacharakorn,Ken Satoh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-agent legal verifier decomposes APPI compliance checking into specialized agents (statutory interpretation, business context, risk assessment) coordinated by a synthesis protocol; on 200 Amended APPI Article 16 cases, achieves 72% overall accuracy ( +21pp over a single-agent baseline ), 90% accuracy on clearly compliant cases ( vs 16% baseline ), and perfect detection of clear violations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing stringency of privacy regulations (e.g., APPI) necessitates trustworthy, interpretable automated compliance checks for AI-driven data transfer. Single-agent systems struggle with legal ambiguity and context; a modular, specialized, coordinated approach promises better performance and interpretability.

Method: Three specialized agents handle statutory interpretation, business-context evaluation, and risk assessment. A structured synthesis protocol coordinates their outputs to produce a compliance verdict. Evaluation on a stratified dataset of 200 Amended APPI Article 16 cases with ground-truth labels and multiple metrics.

Result: 72% overall accuracy on the 200-case dataset, 21 percentage points higher than a single-agent baseline. 90% accuracy on clear compliance cases (baseline 16%). Perfect detection of clear violations. Demonstrates that domain specialization and coordinated reasoning can improve legal AI performance and offer a scalable, interpretable framework; challenges remain for ambiguous scenarios.

Conclusion: Domain specialization and coordinated reasoning yield meaningful gains for legal AI in regulatory compliance verification, offering a scalable and interpretable framework. Further work needed to address ambiguity, generalize to other regulations, and validate robustness across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Legal compliance in AI-driven data transfer planning is becoming increasingly critical under stringent privacy regulations such as the Japanese Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI). We propose a multi-agent legal verifier that decomposes compliance checking into specialized agents for statutory interpretation, business context evaluation, and risk assessment, coordinated through a structured synthesis protocol. Evaluated on a stratified dataset of 200 Amended APPI Article 16 cases with clearly defined ground truth labels and multiple performance metrics, the system achieves 72% accuracy, which is 21 percentage points higher than a single-agent baseline, including 90% accuracy on clear compliance cases (vs. 16% for the baseline) while maintaining perfect detection of clear violations. While challenges remain in ambiguous scenarios, these results show that domain specialization and coordinated reasoning can meaningfully improve legal AI performance, providing a scalable and regulation-aware framework for trustworthy and interpretable automated compliance verification.

*Steven J. Jones,Robert E. Wray,John E. Laird*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Abstract advocates a framework for autonomous AI to reason about extended action sequences in under-specified contexts, going beyond trained policies by integrating normative, pragmatic, and situational knowledge; supported by analysis and empirical case studies to improve robustness and human-aligned decision making.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure deployed AI systems can act in ways consistent with human values and constraints when policy-trained behavior is insufficient, and to justify and evaluate alternative action plans.

Method: The paper uses conceptual analysis complemented by empirical case studies to identify the knowledge types and decision-making requirements necessary for aligning actions with human expectations in complex environments.

Result: Identification and articulation of the essential knowledge categories (normative, pragmatic, situational) and how agents should integrate them to select and pursue aligned, robust courses of action beyond their training.

Conclusion: Provides a framework and insights for enhancing the alignment and robustness of autonomous agents in real-world settings by formalizing the external knowledge and justification needed to navigate under-specified goals and constraints.

Abstract: Deployed, autonomous AI systems must often evaluate multiple plausible courses of action (extended sequences of behavior) in novel or under-specified contexts. Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual "knowledge" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations. Drawing on both analysis and empirical case studies, we examine how agents need to integrate normative, pragmatic, and situational understanding to select and then to pursue more aligned courses of action in complex, real-world environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An AI-agent framework using LLMs to fully automate product knowledge graph construction from unstructured descriptions, achieving high coverage with minimal redundancy on real air-conditioner data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E-commerce generates vast unstructured product data; structured KGs improve retrieval and analytics, but creating product-specific KGs is labor-intensive. Automated, scalable KG construction from unstructured text is needed.

Method: A three-stage AI-agent framework: (1) ontology creation/expansion, (2) ontology refinement, (3) knowledge graph population. Utilizes Large Language Models to drive all steps, operates without predefined schemas or handcrafted extraction rules, ensuring semantic coherence and scalability.

Result: On a real-world air conditioner dataset, the framework achieves over 97% property coverage and minimal redundancy, with strong performance in both ontology generation and KG population.

Conclusion: LLMs can automate structured knowledge extraction in retail, enabling scalable product data integration and utilization through fully automated KG construction.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of e-commerce platforms generates vast amounts of unstructured product data, creating significant challenges for information retrieval, recommendation systems, and data analytics. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a structured, interpretable format to organize such data, yet constructing product-specific KGs remains a complex and manual process. This paper introduces a fully automated, AI agent-driven framework for constructing product knowledge graphs directly from unstructured product descriptions. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our method operates in three stages using dedicated agents: ontology creation and expansion, ontology refinement, and knowledge graph population. This agent-based approach ensures semantic coherence, scalability, and high-quality output without relying on predefined schemas or handcrafted extraction rules. We evaluate the system on a real-world dataset of air conditioner product descriptions, demonstrating strong performance in both ontology generation and KG population. The framework achieves over 97\% property coverage and minimal redundancy, validating its effectiveness and practical applicability. Our work highlights the potential of LLMs to automate structured knowledge extraction in retail, providing a scalable path toward intelligent product data integration and utilization.

### [233] [Faster Symmetry Breaking Constraints for Abstract Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11029)
*Özgür Akgün,Mun See Chang,Ian P. Gent,Christopher Jefferson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new incomplete symmetry-breaking method for abstract structures in constraint programming, which exploits their representations to more efficiently handle indistinguishable objects, showing faster results than the prior Akgün et al. (2025) approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Symmetries in constraint problems create huge search spaces, and when problems are expressed with abstract structures they are represented in lower-level forms (e.g., matrices). Traditional symmetry-breaking methods become intractable due to the explosion of complex constraints. There is a need for a representation-aware approach that can prune symmetric branches without generating excessive constraints.

Method: The authors propose an incomplete symmetry-breaking technique that leverages the representation of abstract structures to identify symmetries associated with indistinguishable objects and prune symmetric search paths without fully enumerating all symmetries. The method focuses on practicality and efficiency over completeness, applying to common symmetry types arising from indistinguishable objects.

Result: Empirical results show that the proposed method outperforms the previous method (Akgün et al. 2025), achieving faster solve times on benchmark problems with indistinguishable objects by exploiting their representations.

Conclusion: Representation-aware, incomplete symmetry breaking offers practical performance gains for abstract structures in constraint programming. While not guaranteeing complete symmetry elimination, it provides a faster, scalable approach applicable to a wide class of problems involving indistinguishable objects.

Abstract: In constraint programming and related paradigms, a modeller specifies their problem in a modelling language for a solver to search and return its solution(s). Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to "break" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akgün et al. 2025).

*Qian Zhang,Yan Zheng,Jinyi Liu,Hebin Liang,Lanjun Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Role allocation in multi-agent debates matters; a 'Truth Last' strategy improves reasoning by up to 22%, and a consistency-based MADC method infers truth and boosts performance across 9 LLMs, addressing MAD bottlenecks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the underexplored impact of role allocation in MAD and to handle unknown truth in practical LLM-agent deployments.

Method: Introduce Truth Last role allocation; propose Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) that uses path consistency across independent roles to estimate truth by simulating the most consistent role; validate across 9 models including DeepSeek-R1 Distilled.

Result: Truth Last improves reasoning performance by up to 22%; MADC consistently enhances MAD performance and mitigates bottlenecks across diverse LLMs.

Conclusion: Proper role allocation substantially affects MAD performance; MADC offers a practical, generalizable mechanism to infer truth and improve LLM agent scaling.

Abstract: Recent studies on LLM agent scaling have highlighted the potential of Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) to enhance reasoning abilities. However, the critical aspect of role allocation strategies remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that allocating roles with differing viewpoints to specific positions significantly impacts MAD's performance in reasoning tasks. Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, "Truth Last", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth. We validated MADC across a range of LLMs (9 models), including the DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models, on challenging reasoning tasks. MADC consistently demonstrated advanced performance, effectively overcoming MAD's performance bottlenecks and providing a crucial pathway for further improvements in LLM agent scaling.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DSS uses a differentiable simulator (Waymax) with hardcoded dynamics as both next-state predictor and critic to enable gradient-based planning over imagined trajectories, combining planning gradients with stochastic search. It improves tracking and path planning in autonomous driving versus baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous driving requires safe, accurate planning in dense traffic, but learning all components (policy, dynamics, value) is hard. A differentiable yet accurate simulator can enable efficient planning.

Method: Leverage Waymax's hardcoded dynamics for real-state prediction and differentiability to perform gradient descent over action sequences across imagined futures; combine planning gradients with stochastic search to optimize actions (DSS).

Result: Experimentally, DSS improves tracking and path planning accuracy compared to sequence prediction, imitation learning, model-free RL, and other planning methods.

Conclusion: Differentiable simulation augmented planning (DSS) effectively uses accurate dynamics and differentiable search to enhance action planning in autonomous driving, suggesting data-efficient, robust planning capable of handling complex traffic.

Abstract: Planning allows an agent to safely refine its actions before executing them in the real world. In autonomous driving, this is crucial to avoid collisions and navigate in complex, dense traffic scenarios. One way to plan is to search for the best action sequence. However, this is challenging when all necessary components - policy, next-state predictor, and critic - have to be learned. Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic. It relies on the simulator's hardcoded dynamics, making state predictions highly accurate, while utilizing the simulator's differentiability to effectively search across action sequences. Our DSS agent optimizes its actions using gradient descent over imagined future trajectories. We show experimentally that DSS - the combination of planning gradients and stochastic search - significantly improves tracking and path planning accuracy compared to sequence prediction, imitation learning, model-free RL, and other planning methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ARCTraj: a dataset and methodological framework that captures temporally ordered human reasoning trajectories in ARC, enabling analysis of intermediate steps and integration with RL, generative modeling, and sequence models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing ARC research relies on static input-output supervision, missing how reasoning unfolds over time. A trajectory dataset can reveal intermediate steps, improve explainability, and aid alignment of AI with human-like reasoning.

Method: Collect ~10,000 object-level reasoning trajectories via the O2ARC interface across 400 ARC-AGI-1 training tasks; annotate with task IDs, timestamps, and success labels. Develop a unified reasoning pipeline with data collection, action abstraction, and MDP formulation, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods (e.g., PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, Decision Transformers). Analyze spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence to characterize reasoning structure and diversity.

Result: Provision of ARCTraj dataset and framework, with analyses highlighting patterns in human reasoning (spatial/color decisions, convergence) and a pathway to combine human-like reasoning trajectories with diverse ML paradigms.

Conclusion: ARCTraj offers a structured, interpretable foundation for studying human-like reasoning, supporting explainability, alignment, and generalizable AI by coupling human trajectories with various learning paradigms.

Abstract: We present ARCTraj, a dataset and methodological framework for modeling human reasoning through complex visual tasks in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). While ARC has inspired extensive research on abstract reasoning, most existing approaches rely on static input--output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers. Analyses of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence highlight the structure and diversity of human reasoning. Together, these contributions position ARCTraj as a structured and interpretable foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence.

*Dillon Z. Chen,Till Hofmann,Toryn Q. Klassen,Sheila A. McIlraith*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A simple generalised planning method that derives first-order conditional-action rules by solving per-goal optimal plans on training problems, regressing them, and lifting outputs; it yields a generalised plan usable for execution or search pruning, with theoretical guarantees and empirical gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable generalisation in planning by learning a set of reusable, interpretable rules with formal guarantees, and to improve planning performance via pruning.

Method: For each training problem, compute an optimal plan for each goal atom in some order; perform goal regression on the resulting plans; lift the regression outcomes into first-order Condition -> Actions rules. The collected rules form a generalised plan that can be executed as-is or used to prune the search space. The approach is formalised with conditions guaranteeing valid generalised plans and pruning axioms for search.

Result: The method yields a set of first-order rules that constitute a generalised plan. The authors formalise and prove conditions under which these plans are valid and provide pruning axioms. Empirical evaluation shows significant improvements over state-of-the-art planners across synthesis cost, planning coverage, and solution quality in various classical and numeric domains.

Conclusion: The approach provides a principled, verifiable pathway to learning effective generalised plans that can be executed or used to prune search, delivering notable performance gains and broad applicability across planning domains.

Abstract: Generalised planning (GP) refers to the task of synthesising programs that solve families of related planning problems. We introduce a novel, yet simple method for GP: given a set of training problems, for each problem, compute an optimal plan for each goal atom in some order, perform goal regression on the resulting plans, and lift the corresponding outputs to obtain a set of first-order $\textit{Condition} \rightarrow \textit{Actions}$ rules. The rules collectively constitute a generalised plan that can be executed as is or alternatively be used to prune the planning search space. We formalise and prove the conditions under which our method is guaranteed to learn valid generalised plans and state space pruning axioms for search. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art (generalised) planners with respect to the 3 metrics of synthesis cost, planning coverage, and solution quality on various classical and numeric planning domains.

*Jingxuan Wei,Caijun Jia,Xi Bai,Xinglong Xu,Siyuan Li,Linzhuang Sun,Bihui Yu,Conghui He,Lijun Wu,Cheng Tan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes GGBench, a benchmark for geometric generative reasoning in Unified Multimodal Models, to evaluate integrated language understanding and precise visual construction; aims to fill an evaluation gap.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks mostly test discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately, failing to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning. Geometric construction inherently requires fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation, making it an ideal testbed.

Method: Design and proposal of GGBench—a benchmark framework to diagnose a model's ability to understand, reason, and actively construct geometric solutions, providing systematic methods and evaluation frameworks for cross-modal generative reasoning.

Result: No empirical results are reported in the abstract; the work presents a benchmark design and aims.

Conclusion: GGBench is presented as a rigorous standard for evaluating geometric generative reasoning in Unified Multimodal Models and is accompanied by a project website.

Abstract: The advent of Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) signals a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving from passive perception to active, cross-modal generation. Despite their unprecedented ability to synthesize information, a critical gap persists in evaluation: existing benchmarks primarily assess discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately, failing to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

### [239] [Multi-agent Undercover Gaming: Hallucination Removal via Counterfactual Test for Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11182)
*Dayong Liang,Xiao-Yong Wei,Changmeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MUG enhances Multi-agent Debate by detecting hallucinating agents via counterfactual multimodal tests, enabling factual verification and active cross-evidence reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAD relies on rational debaters, but hallucinations undermine reliability. There is a need to identify and mitigate hallucinations and improve robustness of crowd-powered multimodal reasoning.

Method: Introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol inspired by social deduction games. Reframe MAD as detecting undercover agents suffering from hallucinations by counterfactual tests: modify reference images to reveal ground-truth changes; use dynamically modified evidence sources; promote active probing discussions rather than static Q&A.

Result: Provides ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents; enables factual verification beyond statistical consensus; improves robustness of multimodal reasoning; code is available at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: MUG advances MAD reliability by detecting hallucinations and enabling active, counterfactual, cross-evidence reasoning in multimodal LLMs, contributing to more trustworthy crowd-powered multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Hallucination continues to pose a major obstacle in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like "Who is Undercover?". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting "undercover" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions. Collectively, these innovations offer a more reliable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/YongLD/MUG.git.

*Huajian Zhang,Mingyue Cheng,Yucong Luo,Xiaoyu Tao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STaR introduces slow-thinking for table reasoning with LLMs, combining step-by-step reasoning and uncertainty-aware inference. It uses two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning to train from simple to complex queries and performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification at inference to select credible reasoning paths, achieving improved accuracy, stability, and cross-domain generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current table reasoning with LLMs suffers from shallow, iterative reasoning and unstable outputs, hindering reliability in real-world downstream tasks. A cognitively inspired approach that fosters deep, controllable reasoning is needed.

Method: Two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL) trains the model on progressively harder table queries, encouraging explicit step-by-step reasoning. At inference, the model combines token-level confidence and answer consistency to quantify trajectory-level uncertainty and select the most credible reasoning paths.

Result: STaR demonstrates superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability on benchmark datasets and shows strong generalization to out-of-domain datasets.

Conclusion: By equipping LLMs with slow-thinking and uncertainty-aware inference, STaR offers a cognitively inspired, reliable framework for table reasoning that improves accuracy, stability, and generalization.

Abstract: Table reasoning with the large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental path toward building intelligent systems that can understand and analyze over structured data. While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability. Moreover, strong generalization over out-of-domain datasets further demonstrates STaR's potential as a reliable and cognitively inspired solution for table reasoning with LLMs.

Conclusion: Provides a reproducible, physically grounded foundation for benchmarking agentic AI in autonomous aerial systems and advancing UAV reasoning intelligence; fosters open science through public release.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial systems increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) for mission planning, perception, and decision-making, yet the lack of standardized and physically grounded benchmarks limits systematic evaluation of their reasoning capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce UAVBench, an open benchmark dataset comprising 50,000 validated UAV flight scenarios generated through taxonomy-guided LLM prompting and multi-stage safety validation. Each scenario is encoded in a structured JSON schema that includes mission objectives, vehicle configuration, environmental conditions, and quantitative risk labels, providing a unified representation of UAV operations across diverse domains. Building on this foundation, we present UAVBench_MCQ, a reasoning-oriented extension containing 50,000 multiple-choice questions spanning ten cognitive and ethical reasoning styles, ranging from aerodynamics and navigation to multi-agent coordination and integrated reasoning. This framework enables interpretable and machine-checkable assessment of UAV-specific cognition under realistic operational contexts. We evaluate 32 state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-5, ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3, Qwen3 235B, and ERNIE 4.5 300B, and find strong performance in perception and policy reasoning but persistent challenges in ethics-aware and resource-constrained decision-making. UAVBench establishes a reproducible and physically grounded foundation for benchmarking agentic AI in autonomous aerial systems and advancing next-generation UAV reasoning intelligence. To support open science and reproducibility, we release the UAVBench dataset, the UAVBench_MCQ benchmark, evaluation scripts, and all related materials on GitHub at https://github.com/maferrag/UAVBench

*Yuqi Yin,Yibo Fu,Siyuan Wang,Peng Sun,Hongyu Wang,Xiaohui Wang,Lei Zheng,Zhiyong Li,Zhirong Liu,Jianji Wang,Zhaoxi Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AIonopedia is introduced as the first LLM agent for ionic liquid discovery, combining an LLM-augmented multimodal domain foundation model with a hierarchical molecular screening/design workflow to enable accurate property predictions, effective IL modification, and real-world validation, showing strong generalization and potential to accelerate IL discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ionic liquids (ILs) face data scarcity, limited model accuracy, and fragmented workflows, hindering discovery; there is a need for an integrated AI-enabled framework that can predict properties, screen designs, and guide wet-lab validation.

Method: Develop an LLM-augmented multimodal domain foundation model for ILs, paired with a hierarchical search architecture for screening and design. Train and evaluate on a curated IL dataset. Assess performance on literature-reported systems and conduct real-world wet-lab validation to test generalization.

Result: The model achieves superior performance in property prediction, enables effective IL modification, and demonstrates exceptional generalization on out-of-distribution tasks, with validation underscoring practical efficacy and potential to accelerate real-world IL discovery.

Conclusion: AIonopedia demonstrates the feasibility and practical impact of an LLM-enabled IL discovery workflow, marking the first such agent and showing promise to streamline IL discovery pipelines through integrated prediction, design, and validation.

Abstract: The discovery of novel Ionic Liquids (ILs) is hindered by critical challenges in property prediction, including limited data, poor model accuracy, and fragmented workflows. Leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce AIonopedia, to the best of our knowledge, the first LLM agent for IL discovery. Powered by an LLM-augmented multimodal domain foundation model for ILs, AIonopedia enables accurate property predictions and incorporates a hierarchical search architecture for molecular screening and design. Trained and evaluated on a newly curated and comprehensive IL dataset, our model delivers superior performance. Complementing these results, evaluations on literature-reported systems indicate that the agent can perform effective IL modification. Moving beyond offline tests, the practical efficacy was further confirmed through real-world wet-lab validation, in which the agent demonstrated exceptional generalization capabilities on challenging out-of-distribution tasks, underscoring its ability to accelerate real-world IL discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: First running workflow for tamper-proof, verifiable, exhaustive traces of AI decisions; extends DBOM with confidential computing; demonstrated on a mushroom classifier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing high-stakes AI decisions risk harming people and infringing rights; current state lacks accountable, court-admissible documentation of decision processes; need traceability to reconstruct responsibility.

Method: Enforces collection and documentation of every component in training and inference; builds a running workflow that generates tamper-proof traces; extends DBOM concept into a live workflow; employs confidential computing to protect data and integrity; demos with a high-stakes mushroom classification app.

Result: Introduces a functioning, running workflow for exhaustive, verifiable traces; demonstrates the workflow's inner workings; provides a practical exemplar for high-stake decision support.

Conclusion: The approach offers a practical path toward traceability and accountability in AI decisions, potentially aiding legal adjudication; demonstrates feasibility with confidential computing; radical but pragmatic.

Abstract: An ever increasing number of high-stake decisions are made or assisted by automated systems employing brittle artificial intelligence technology. There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.
  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions. In doing so, we expand the DBOM concept into an effective running workflow leveraging confidential computing technology. We demonstrate the inner workings of the workflow in the development of an app to tell poisonous and edible mushrooms apart, meant as a playful example of high-stake decision support.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Presents contrastive ABox explanations for Description Logic ontologies to jointly justify positive and negative entailments (why C(a) and not C(b)), analyzes complexity across DL variants, implements a prototype method, and evaluates it on generated realistic KBs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To answer queries like “Why is a an instance of C, but b is not?”, by developing contrastive explanations that simultaneously consider both entailments and non-entailments, specifically tailored to ABox reasoning in DL ontologies.

Method: Define contrastive explanations for ABox reasoning, perform complexity analysis for different DL variants and optimality criteria (ranging from lightweight to expressive logics), implement a first method for one variant to compute these explanations, and evaluate on generated realistic knowledge bases.

Result: Provides complexity insights for various DL variants, presents a prototype method for computing a variant of contrastive explanations, and demonstrates its feasibility through evaluation on generated problems using realistic KBs.

Conclusion: The work advances explainability for DL ontologies by bridging positive and negative entailments via contrastive explanations, offers initial computational and empirical validation, and lays groundwork for broader investigation and optimization.

Abstract: We introduce the notion of contrastive ABox explanations to answer questions of the type "Why is a an instance of C, but b is not?". While there are various approaches for explaining positive entailments (why is C(a) entailed by the knowledge base) as well as missing entailments (why is C(b) not entailed) in isolation, contrastive explanations consider both at the same time, which allows them to focus on the relevant commonalities and differences between a and b. We develop an appropriate notion of contrastive explanations for the special case of ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, and analyze the computational complexity for different variants under different optimality criteria, considering lightweight as well as more expressive description logics. We implemented a first method for computing one variant of contrastive explanations, and evaluated it on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases.

### [245] [EcoAlign: An Economically Rational Framework for Efficient LVLM Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11301)
*Ruoxi Cheng,Haoxuan Ma,Teng Ma,Hongyi Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EcoAlign reframes LVLM alignment as an economically rational, boundedly rational search during inference. By incrementally expanding a thought graph and using a forward-looking value function, it balances safety, utility, and compute budget, enforcing safety via the weakest-link principle. It achieves state-of-the-art safety/utility at lower cost across multiple models and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LVLM alignment struggles to balance safety, usefulness, and operational costs. Process-blindness wastes computation on unsafe reasoning and simple safety scores can be bypassed. An economically-aware, inference-time approach is needed to reduce wasted compute and improve robust alignment.

Method: EcoAlign treats the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent. It incrementally expands a thought graph and evaluates actions with a forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that weighs expected safety, utility, and remaining budget. Path safety is enforced using the weakest-link principle to prevent deception.

Result: Extensive experiments on 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models across 6 datasets show EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility while reducing computational cost.

Conclusion: EcoAlign provides a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment, addressing safety–utility–cost trade-offs and demonstrating practical effectiveness across diverse models and datasets.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit powerful reasoning capabilities but suffer sophisticated jailbreak vulnerabilities. Fundamentally, aligning LVLMs is not just a safety challenge but a problem of economic efficiency. Current alignment methods struggle with the trade-off between safety, utility, and operational costs. Critically, a focus solely on final outputs (process-blindness) wastes significant computational budget on unsafe deliberation. This flaw allows harmful reasoning to be disguised with benign justifications, thereby circumventing simple additive safety scores. To address this, we propose EcoAlign, an inference-time framework that reframes alignment as an economically rational search by treating the LVLM as a boundedly rational agent. EcoAlign incrementally expands a thought graph and scores actions using a forward-looking function (analogous to net present value) that dynamically weighs expected safety, utility, and cost against the remaining budget. To prevent deception, path safety is enforced via the weakest-link principle. Extensive experiments across 3 closed-source and 2 open-source models on 6 datasets show that EcoAlign matches or surpasses state-of-the-art safety and utility at a lower computational cost, thereby offering a principled, economical pathway to robust LVLM alignment.

*Yitian Kou,Yihe Gu,Chen Zhou,DanDan Zhu,Shuguang Kuai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hybrid RL framework RLSLM that merges a rule-based Social Locomotion Model into the RL reward to generate an orientation-sensitive social comfort field, enabling energy-efficient, socially aware navigation with interpretable behavior; outperforms rule-based baselines in user experience; ablations suggest improved interpretability vs data-driven methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between interpretable rule-based approaches and flexible data-driven methods in social navigation, addressing limited generalizability, inefficiency, and misalignment with human intuition.

Method: Integrate a rule-based Social Locomotion Model into the RL reward to produce an orientation-sensitive social comfort field; jointly optimize mechanical energy and social comfort; use VR-based human-agent interaction for validation; perform ablation and sensitivity analyses to assess interpretability.

Result: VR-based experiments show RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience; ablation and sensitivity analyses indicate significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven approaches.

Conclusion: A scalable, human-centered methodology that combines cognitive science and machine learning to enable real-world social navigation.

Abstract: Navigating human-populated environments without causing discomfort is a critical capability for socially-aware agents. While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods. This work presents a scalable, human-centered methodology that effectively integrates cognitive science and machine learning for real-world social navigation.

Conclusion: KarmaTS offers flexible, expert-informed synthetic data generation and benchmarking for causal discovery in multivariate time series, addressing data access limitations and enabling controlled experiments.

Abstract: We introduce KarmaTS, an interactive framework for constructing lag-indexed, executable spatiotemporal causal graphical models for multivariate time series (MTS) simulation. Motivated by the challenge of access-restricted physiological data, KarmaTS generates synthetic MTS with known causal dynamics and augments real-world datasets with expert knowledge. The system constructs a discrete-time structural causal process (DSCP) by combining expert knowledge and algorithmic proposals in a mixed-initiative, human-in-the-loop workflow. The resulting DSCP supports simulation and causal interventions, including those under user-specified distribution shifts. KarmaTS handles mixed variable types, contemporaneous and lagged edges, and modular edge functionals ranging from parameterizable templates to neural network models. Together, these features enable flexible validation and benchmarking of causal discovery algorithms through expert-informed simulation.

*Shulin Liu,Dong Du,Tao Yang,Yang Li,Boyu Qiu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MarsRL is an agentic, pipeline-parallel RL framework for multi-agent reasoning (Solver/Verifier/Corrector) that improves open-source LLMs by mitigating reward noise and enabling long-trajectory training; on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 it boosts AIME2025 accuracy from 86.5% to 93.3% and BeyondAIME from 64.9% to 73.8%, even beating a larger model Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long output length limits constrain deep reasoning; multi-agent reasoning can refine solutions, but existing approaches struggle to generalize to open-source models due to weak critics and corrections and noisy rewards. A framework that jointly optimizes all agents and handles long trajectories could extend benefits to open-source LLMs.

Method: MarsRL introduces agent-specific reward mechanisms to mitigate reward noise and employs pipeline-inspired training to improve efficiency on long trajectories. It jointly optimizes multiple agents (Solver, Verifier, Corrector) using agentic pipeline parallelism for scalable coordination across long reasoning chains.

Result: On Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507, MarsRL raised AIME2025 accuracy from 86.5% to 93.3% and BeyondAIME from 64.9% to 73.8%, and even surpassed Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507, indicating strong generalization to open-source models and effectiveness across reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: MarsRL demonstrates the feasibility and promise of agentic, pipeline-parallel RL for multi-agent reasoning, enabling stronger performance and broader applicability to diverse reasoning tasks beyond closed-model settings.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has been propelled by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and test-time scaling. However, the limited output length of LLMs constrains the depth of reasoning attainable in a single inference process. Multi-agent reasoning systems offer a promising alternative by employing multiple agents including Solver, Verifier, and Corrector, to iteratively refine solutions. While effective in closed-source models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, they struggle to generalize to open-source models due to insufficient critic and correction capabilities. To address this, we propose MarsRL, a novel reinforcement learning framework with agentic pipeline parallelism, designed to jointly optimize all agents in the system. MarsRL introduces agent-specific reward mechanisms to mitigate reward noise and employs pipeline-inspired training to enhance efficiency in handling long trajectories. Applied to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507, MarsRL improves AIME2025 accuracy from 86.5% to 93.3% and BeyondAIME from 64.9% to 73.8%, even surpassing Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507. These findings highlight the potential of MarsRL to advance multi-agent reasoning systems and broaden their applicability across diverse reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Survey of robust and efficient communication in MARL under realistic constraints (delays, perturbations, limited bandwidth), focusing on cooperative driving, distributed SLAM, and federated learning; ends with open challenges and a call for unified co-design of communication, learning, and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world MARL systems face non-ideal communication (noise, delays, bandwidth limits, privacy). Idealized assumptions hinder deployment; a thorough synthesis is needed to guide robust, efficient MARL under practical constraints.

Method: Systematic literature review and synthesis that (i) categorizes communication-robust MARL approaches under perturbations, delays, and bandwidth constraints, (ii) analyzes three application domains, and (iii) outlines open challenges and future research directions with a unified co-design perspective.

Result: Provides a taxonomy of robust communication strategies for MARL under practical constraints, highlights key applications (cooperative autonomous driving, distributed SLAM, federated learning), and identifies open challenges and directions toward co-design of communication, learning, and robustness.

Conclusion: Advocates a unified, co-designed framework integrating communication protocols, learning algorithms, and robustness mechanisms to bridge theory and practice in MARL, addressing latency, bandwidth, and privacy trade-offs.

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant strides in enabling coordinated behaviors among autonomous agents. However, most existing approaches assume that communication is instantaneous, reliable, and has unlimited bandwidth; these conditions are rarely met in real-world deployments. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints, including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, advocating a unified approach that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CURENet is a multimodal EHR model that fuses unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and time-series visit data using LLMs for text and transformer encoders for longitudinal data, achieving strong performance on chronic disease prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current predictive models often fail to capture cross-modal interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities in EHRs; leveraging large language models for text and textual lab data, along with transformers for sequences, could improve chronic disease prediction and clinical decision-making.

Method: CURENet architectures combines unified representations across modalities: LLM-based processing for clinical text and textual lab results, transformer encoders for longitudinal visit data, and a mechanism to integrate notes, labs, and time-series into a joint representation for multi-label prediction of chronic conditions; evaluated on public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets.

Result: Achieved over 94% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework; demonstrates effective modeling of cross-modal interactions and temporal patterns, highlighting the benefit of multimodal EHR integration.

Conclusion: Multimodal EHR integration with LLMs and transformers can enhance clinical decision-making and patient outcomes; CURENet shows promise for chronic disease prediction and motivates future work on broader multimodal clinical tasks.

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are designed to synthesize diverse data types, including unstructured clinical notes, structured lab tests, and time-series visit data. Physicians draw on these multimodal and temporal sources of EHR data to form a comprehensive view of a patient's health, which is crucial for informed therapeutic decision-making. Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits. CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal EHR integration to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

TL;DR: Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR) generates ready-to-run problem-solving strategies at inference time using an LLM-based meta-strategy that outputs complete strategies (prompts, sampling, tools, and control logic) conditioned on current problems and past experience, improving accuracy and efficiency across benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing adaptation approaches either only modify textual prompts or require offline optimization, leaving sampling, tools, and paradigms static. There is a need for dynamic, fully configurable inference-time strategy generation.

Method: Two-component meta-strategy: a Guide that proposes multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current task and summarized past experiences, and a Consolidator that reviews execution feedback to refine future strategy generation. Strategies specify prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic, and are ready-to-run and cacheable for reuse.

Result: Evaluated on five benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieves up to 14% accuracy improvements over the strongest baselines and reduces computational costs by up to 111×, with improvements growing as the system accumulates experience.

Conclusion: Dynamic, experience-driven inference-time strategy generation enables adaptable and efficient agentic AI by producing ready-to-run procedures that can be cached and reused, marking a step toward flexible, resource-efficient AI systems.

Abstract: Enabling agentic AI systems to adapt their problem-solving approaches based on post-training interactions remains a fundamental challenge. While systems that update and maintain a memory at inference time have been proposed, existing designs only steer the system by modifying textual input to a language model or agent, which means that they cannot change sampling parameters, remove tools, modify system prompts, or switch between agentic and workflow paradigms. On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation. This produces complete, ready-to-run strategies optimized for each problem, which can be cached, retrieved, and executed as needed without wasting resources. Across five challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieves up to 14% accuracy improvements over the strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.

TL;DR: Test-time alignment via model-guided policy shaping enables precise control over ethical attributes without retraining, scaling across diverse RL environments, demonstrated on MACHIAVELLI with many scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the reward-alignment trade-off in decision-making AI and the costly, slow retraining required to ensure alignment for pre-trained agents, while handling diverse and potentially conflicting ethical attributes.

Method: Perform policy shaping at test time by using scenario-action attribute classifiers to constrain agent decisions according to ethical attributes, without retraining the agent. Evaluation on the MACHIAVELLI benchmark (134 text-based games, thousands of annotated ethical scenarios) comparing against training-time methods and general-purpose agents, and examining multiple ethical violations and power-seeking behaviors.

Result: Demonstrates that test-time policy shaping effectively mitigates unethical behavior and supports scalable alignment across a wide range of environments and alignment attributes, with a principled trade-off between alignment and reward.

Conclusion: Test-time policy shaping is a viable, scalable approach for aligning RL agents with human values, enabling attribute-level control without retraining and generalizing across diverse environments.

Abstract: The deployment of decision-making AI agents presents a critical challenge in maintaining alignment with human values or guidelines while operating in complex, dynamic environments. Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining the alignment. For the pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes.
