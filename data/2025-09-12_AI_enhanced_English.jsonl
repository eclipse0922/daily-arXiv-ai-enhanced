(2) an Embodiment-Aware\nReasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment\nconstraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are\nboth goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate\nthat OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning\nperformance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of\ndownstream scenarios.

However, existing methods treat instruction\nconditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues,\nwithout modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions.

In the second\nstage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in\nparallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework\npreserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent\nbehind multimodal instructions.
