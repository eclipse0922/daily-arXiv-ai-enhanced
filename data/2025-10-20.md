Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAZE automates conversion of long-form video into dense, privacy-aware multimodal supervision for world-model training, boosting throughput and reducing manual review.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale, accurately labeled multimodal data is bottlenecked by manual annotation; there is a need for scalable, privacy-conscious data generation.

Method: Normalize proprietary 360-degree formats to standard views and shard for parallel processing; apply AI modules for scene understanding, object tracking, audio transcription, PII/NSFW/minor detection; consolidate signals into a structured output specification for rapid human validation; incorporate privacy safeguards and chain-of-custody metadata.

Result: Efficiency gains of ~19 minutes saved per review hour; human review volume reduced >80% via auto-skipping of low-salience segments; increased label density and consistency; privacy-aware datasets strictly governed for cross-modal learning.

Conclusion: GAZE offers a scalable, governance-aware blueprint for generating high-quality world-model training data without sacrificing throughput or privacy, enabling robust cross-modal dynamics and action-conditioned prediction.

Abstract: Training robust world models requires large-scale, precisely labeled
multimodal datasets, a process historically bottlenecked by slow and expensive
manual annotation. We present a production-tested GAZE pipeline that automates
the conversion of raw, long-form video into rich, task-ready supervision for
world-model training. Our system (i) normalizes proprietary 360-degree formats
into standard views and shards them for parallel processing; (ii) applies a
suite of AI models (scene understanding, object tracking, audio transcription,
PII/NSFW/minor detection) for dense, multimodal pre-annotation; and (iii)
consolidates signals into a structured output specification for rapid human
validation.
  The GAZE workflow demonstrably yields efficiency gains (~19 minutes saved per
review hour) and reduces human review volume by >80% through conservative
auto-skipping of low-salience segments. By increasing label density and
consistency while integrating privacy safeguards and chain-of-custody metadata,
our method generates high-fidelity, privacy-aware datasets directly consumable
for learning cross-modal dynamics and action-conditioned prediction. We detail
our orchestration, model choices, and data dictionary to provide a scalable
blueprint for generating high-quality world model training data without
sacrificing throughput or governance.

### [2] [PC-UNet: An Enforcing Poisson Statistics U-Net for Positron Emission Tomography Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14995)
*Yang Shi,Jingchao Wang,Liangsi Lu,Mingxuan Huang,Ruixin He,Yifeng Xie,Hanqian Liu,Minzhe Guo,Yangyang Liang,Weipeng Zhang,Zimeng Li,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Poisson-consistent U-Net (PC-UNet) for PET denoising using a Poisson Variance and Mean Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss) to preserve physical fidelity under low-dose, high-noise conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lower PET doses reduce radiation exposure but increase Poisson noise. Existing denoisers distort physical fidelity; incorporating Poisson statistics and physics can improve image fidelity and robustness.

Method: Introduce PC-UNet with PVMC-Loss, a Generalized Method of Moments–based loss that enforces Poisson variance/mean consistency and integrates physical data into training, yielding robustness to data mismatches.

Result: Experiments show improved physical consistency and image fidelity on PET datasets when denoising under low-dose Poisson noise.

Conclusion: PVMC-Loss effectively integrates physical information into deep denoising for PET, improving robustness and fidelity under challenging noise conditions.

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is crucial in medicine, but its clinical
use is limited due to high signal-to-noise ratio doses increasing radiation
exposure. Lowering doses increases Poisson noise, which current denoising
methods fail to handle, causing distortions and artifacts. We propose a Poisson
Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet) model with a new Poisson Variance and Mean
Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss) that incorporates physical data to improve image
fidelity. PVMC-Loss is statistically unbiased in variance and gradient
adaptation, acting as a Generalized Method of Moments implementation, offering
robustness to minor data mismatches. Tests on PET datasets show PC-UNet
improves physical consistency and image fidelity, proving its ability to
integrate physical information effectively.

### [3] [DeLeaker: Dynamic Inference-Time Reweighting For Semantic Leakage Mitigation in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15015)
*Mor Ventura,Michael Toker,Or Patashnik,Yonatan Belinkov,Roi Reichart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeLeaker is a lightweight, optimization-free method that mitigates semantic leakage in text-to-image diffusion by dynamically reweighting attention maps during generation; complemented by the SLIM dataset and an automatic evaluation framework, it outperforms baselines without sacrificing image fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic leakage—unwanted transfer of semantically related features across distinct entities—in T2I models; existing mitigations are often optimization-based or rely on external inputs; there is a need for an inference-time, lightweight solution and reliable evaluation data.

Method: During diffusion, DeLeaker adjusts the model's attention maps on the fly, reweighting to reduce cross-entity interactions and strengthen each entity's identity; optimization-free and operates at inference time.

Result: Empirical results show DeLeaker consistently beats baselines (even with external information) in mitigating leakage while preserving fidelity/quality; the authors also release SLIM (1,130 samples) and an automatic evaluation framework to enable systematic assessment.

Conclusion: Attention-map intervention is a promising, practical path to semantically precise T2I models; DeLeaker demonstrates effective leakage mitigation without harming image quality and provides resources (SLIM and evaluation tools) to standardize future research.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable
to semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features
between distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often
optimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a
lightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage
by directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion
process, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive
cross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To
support systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages),
the first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130
human-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel
automatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker
consistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with
external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without
compromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of
attention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.

### [4] [UrbanVerse: Scaling Urban Simulation by Watching City-Tour Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15018)
*Mingxuan Liu,Honglin He,Elisa Ricci,Wayne Wu,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data-driven real-to-sim system that builds realistic, scalable urban simulation scenes from crowd-sourced videos, enabling better embodied AI training and sim-to-real transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a demand for high-fidelity, diverse urban environments to train embodied AI agents; existing scenes (human-crafted or procedurally generated) struggle with realism, diversity, and scalability.

Method: UrbanVerse introduces UrbanVerse-100K (100k+ annotated 3D urban assets with semantic/physical attributes) and UrbanVerse-Gen (a pipeline that extracts scene layouts from city-tour videos and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations in IsaacSim). It offers 160 scenes from 24 countries plus 10 artist-designed test scenes. The system validates realism via human evaluation and demonstrates improved policy performance and sim-to-real transfer.

Result: UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world semantics and layouts with realism comparable to manually crafted scenes. Policies trained in UrbanVerse show scaling behavior and strong generalization, achieving +6.3% higher success in simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, enabling a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.

Conclusion: UrbanVerse demonstrates scalable, data-driven generation of realistic urban simulation environments that support robust training and transfer for embodied AI, with a reusable dataset and an automatic pipeline spanning multiple countries and scenarios.

Abstract: Urban embodied AI agents, ranging from delivery robots to quadrupeds, are
increasingly populating our cities, navigating chaotic streets to provide
last-mile connectivity. Training such agents requires diverse, high-fidelity
urban environments to scale, yet existing human-crafted or procedurally
generated simulation scenes either lack scalability or fail to capture
real-world complexity. We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim
system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware,
interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a
repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical
attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene
layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved
assets. Running in IsaacSim, UrbanVerse offers 160 high-quality constructed
scenes from 24 countries, along with a curated benchmark of 10 artist-designed
test scenes. Experiments show that UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world
semantics and layouts, achieving human-evaluated realism comparable to manually
crafted scenes. In urban navigation, policies trained in UrbanVerse exhibit
scaling power laws and strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in
simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer comparing to prior
methods, accomplishing a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.

### [5] [NANO3D: A Training-Free Approach for Efficient 3D Editing Without Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15019)
*Junliang Ye,Shenghao Xie,Ruowen Zhao,Zhengyi Wang,Hongyu Yan,Wenqiang Zu,Lei Ma,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Nano3D proposes a training-free 3D editing framework that achieves coherent, mask-free edits by integrating FlowEdit with TRELLIS, employing region-aware Voxel/Slat-Merge to preserve unedited regions, and introducing Nano3D-Edit-100k for data scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D editing pipelines rely on editing multipview renders followed by reconstruction, which introduces artifacts, is inefficient, and often fails to preserve unedited regions. There is a need for direct, training-free, coherent 3D editing and a scalable dataset to enable robust models.

Method: Nano3D integrates FlowEdit into TRELLIS for localized edits guided by front-view renderings, and introduces region-aware merging (Voxel/Slat-Merge) to maintain fidelity between edited and unedited regions. It is training-free and culminates in constructing Nano3D-Edit-100k, a large-scale 3D editing dataset.

Result: Experiments show improved 3D consistency and visual quality over existing methods. The framework enables precise, coherent edits without masks and reduces artifacts compared to multi-view editing pipelines.

Conclusion: The work addresses both algorithmic and data challenges in 3D editing, improving generality and reliability, and enabling feed-forward 3D editing models. It also provides a foundational dataset (Nano3D-Edit-100k) to promote further research.

Abstract: 3D object editing is essential for interactive content creation in gaming,
animation, and robotics, yet current approaches remain inefficient,
inconsistent, and often fail to preserve unedited regions. Most methods rely on
editing multi-view renderings followed by reconstruction, which introduces
artifacts and limits practicality. To address these challenges, we propose
Nano3D, a training-free framework for precise and coherent 3D object editing
without masks. Nano3D integrates FlowEdit into TRELLIS to perform localized
edits guided by front-view renderings, and further introduces region-aware
merging strategies, Voxel/Slat-Merge, which adaptively preserve structural
fidelity by ensuring consistency between edited and unedited areas. Experiments
demonstrate that Nano3D achieves superior 3D consistency and visual quality
compared with existing methods. Based on this framework, we construct the first
large-scale 3D editing datasets Nano3D-Edit-100k, which contains over 100,000
high-quality 3D editing pairs. This work addresses long-standing challenges in
both algorithm design and data availability, significantly improving the
generality and reliability of 3D editing, and laying the groundwork for the
development of feed-forward 3D editing models. Project

*Jiaxin Ge,Grace Luo,Heekyung Lee,Nishant Malpani,Long Lian,XuDong Wang,Aleksander Holynski,Trevor Darrell,Sewon Min,David M. Chan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ECHO builds real-world evidence-based benchmarks from social media prompts to reveal new capabilities and better distinguish models; applied to GPT-4o Image Gen with 31k prompts; informs metric design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarks often lag behind rapid advances in image-generation models and fail to capture real-use cases and user judgments.

Method: Collect real-world posts showing prompts and qualitative judgments; curate over 31,000 prompts; analyze emergent tasks, compare models, and derive metrics informed by user feedback (e.g., color, identity, structure).

Result: ECHO uncovers creative tasks absent from existing benchmarks (e.g., multi-language label rendering, receipts with totals); improves separation of state-of-the-art models from alternatives; surfaces community feedback to guide metric design.

Conclusion: ECHO offers an evidence-driven, scalable benchmarking approach that aligns evaluation with real-world use and user perceptions, with potential to shape future benchmarks and metrics.

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation, often driven by proprietary systems like
GPT-4o Image Gen, regularly introduce new capabilities that reshape how users
interact with these models. Existing benchmarks often lag behind and fail to
capture these emerging use cases, leaving a gap between community perceptions
of progress and formal evaluation. To address this, we present ECHO, a
framework for constructing benchmarks directly from real-world evidence of
model use: social media posts that showcase novel prompts and qualitative user
judgments. Applying this framework to GPT-4o Image Gen, we construct a dataset
of over 31,000 prompts curated from such posts. Our analysis shows that ECHO
(1) discovers creative and complex tasks absent from existing benchmarks, such
as re-rendering product labels across languages or generating receipts with
specified totals, (2) more clearly distinguishes state-of-the-art models from
alternatives, and (3) surfaces community feedback that we use to inform the
design of metrics for model quality (e.g., measuring observed shifts in color,
identity, and structure). Our website is at https://echo-bench.github.io.

### [7] [LoRAverse: A Submodular Framework to Retrieve Diverse Adapters for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15022)
*Mert Sonmezer,Matthew Zheng,Pinar Yanardag*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a submodular optimization approach to select diverse, relevant LoRA adapters from a large diffusion-model adapter database to improve personalized generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The huge rise of LoRA adapters (over 100k) creates navigation, selection, and effective use challenges; a principled method is needed to pick diverse, relevant adapters that improve generation quality across domains.

Method: Frames adapter selection as a combinatorial optimization problem and introduces a submodular objective to balance relevance and diversity; develops an algorithm to select a subset of adapters; validates the approach with quantitative and qualitative experiments.

Result: Empirical results show the method yields diverse outputs across many domains, indicating improved diversity and coverage of generated content.

Conclusion: A scalable submodular framework can effectively curate large LoRA repositories, enabling better, more diverse personalization without extensive retraining.

Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) models have revolutionized the personalization of
pre-trained diffusion models by enabling fine-tuning through low-rank,
factorized weight matrices specifically optimized for attention layers. These
models facilitate the generation of highly customized content across a variety
of objects, individuals, and artistic styles without the need for extensive
retraining. Despite the availability of over 100K LoRA adapters on platforms
like Civit.ai, users often face challenges in navigating, selecting, and
effectively utilizing the most suitable adapters due to their sheer volume,
diversity, and lack of structured organization. This paper addresses the
problem of selecting the most relevant and diverse LoRA models from this vast
database by framing the task as a combinatorial optimization problem and
proposing a novel submodular framework. Our quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate that our method generates diverse outputs across a wide
range of domains.

### [8] [MOBIUS: Big-to-Mobile Universal Instance Segmentation via Multi-modal Bottleneck Fusion and Calibrated Decoder Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15026)
*Mattia Segu,Marta Tintore Gazulla,Yongqin Xian,Luc Van Gool,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOBIUS is a family of foundation models for universal instance segmentation designed for Pareto-optimal downscaling to support deployment across devices from HPC to mobile, achieving significant compute reductions while preserving state-of-the-art performance and speeding training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As model size and data scale drive better performance, costs become prohibitive for resource-constrained platforms. There is a need for architectures that maintain accuracy while enabling efficient edge deployment and cross-device compatibility.

Method: Introduce a bottleneck pixel decoder for efficient multi-scale and multi-modal fusion; propose a language-guided uncertainty calibration loss to enable adaptive decoder pruning; employ a streamlined, unified training strategy to facilitate Pareto-optimal downscaling.

Result: MOBIUS reduces pixel decoder FLOPs by up to 55% and transformer decoder FLOPs by up to 75%, while maintaining state-of-the-art performance and completing training in about one-third of the iterations.

Conclusion: MOBIUS establishes a new benchmark for efficient segmentation on both high-performance computing platforms and mobile devices, providing a pathway to deploy universal instance segmentation across a wide range of hardware with reduced compute demands.

Abstract: Scaling up model size and training data has advanced foundation models for
instance-level perception, achieving state-of-the-art in-domain and zero-shot
performance across object detection and segmentation. However, their high
computational cost limits adoption on resource-constrained platforms. We first
examine the limitations of existing architectures in enabling efficient edge
deployment without compromising performance. We then introduce MOBIUS, a family
of foundation models for universal instance segmentation, designed for
Pareto-optimal downscaling to support deployment across devices ranging from
high-end accelerators to mobile hardware. To reduce training and inference
demands, we propose: (i) a bottleneck pixel decoder for efficient multi-scale
and multi-modal fusion, (ii) a language-guided uncertainty calibration loss for
adaptive decoder pruning, and (iii) a streamlined, unified training strategy.
Unlike efficient baselines that trade accuracy for reduced complexity, MOBIUS
reduces pixel and transformer decoder FLOPs by up to 55% and 75%, respectively,
while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in just a third of the training
iterations. MOBIUS establishes a new benchmark for efficient segmentation on
both high-performance computing platforms and mobile devices.

### [9] [Composition-Grounded Instruction Synthesis for Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15040)
*Xinyi Gu,Jiayuan Mao,Zhang-Wei Hong,Zhuoran Yu,Pengyuan Li,Dhiraj Joshi,Rogerio Feris,Zexue He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COGS is a data-efficient framework that teaches multimodal LLMs advanced reasoning on image-domain tasks (charts, rendered documents, webpages) by synthesizing large QA datasets from seed questions through decomposition into primitive perception and reasoning factors, enabling factor-level RL rewards and improved generalization across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a scarcity of large-scale, human-annotated reasoning data for artificial image domains (charts, docs, webpages). We need data-efficient methods to imbue MLLMs with robust reasoning in these settings.

Method: Decompose each seed question into primitive perception and reasoning factors; recombine these factors with new images to generate large collections of synthetic QAs, each paired with subquestions and intermediate answers; train using reinforcement learning with factor-level process rewards.

Result: In chart reasoning, COGS substantially improves performance on unseen questions, with the largest gains on reasoning-heavy and compositional questions. A factor-level mixture of seed data improves transfer across multiple datasets. The approach also extends to domains beyond charts, such as webpages.

Conclusion: COGS promotes generalizable, data-efficient reasoning abilities in multimodal LLMs, reducing dataset-specific overfitting and enabling cross-domain transfer (e.g., charts to webpages).

Abstract: Pretrained multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong
performance on diverse multimodal tasks, but remain limited in reasoning
capabilities for domains where annotations are difficult to collect. In this
work, we focus on artificial image domains such as charts, rendered documents,
and webpages, which are abundant in practice yet lack large-scale human
annotated reasoning datasets. We introduce COGS (COmposition-Grounded
instruction Synthesis), a data-efficient framework for equipping MLLMs with
advanced reasoning abilities from a small set of seed questions. The key idea
is to decompose each seed question into primitive perception and reasoning
factors, which can then be systematically recomposed with new images to
generate large collections of synthetic question-answer pairs. Each generated
question is paired with subquestions and intermediate answers, enabling
reinforcement learning with factor-level process rewards. Experiments on chart
reasoning show that COGS substantially improves performance on unseen
questions, with the largest gains on reasoning-heavy and compositional
questions. Moreover, training with a factor-level mixture of different seed
data yields better transfer across multiple datasets, suggesting that COGS
induces generalizable capabilities rather than dataset-specific overfitting. We
further demonstrate that the framework extends beyond charts to other domains
such as webpages.

### [10] [Generalized Dynamics Generation towards Scannable Physical World Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15041)
*Yichen Li,Zhiyi Li,Brandon Feng,Dinghuai Zhang,Antonio Torralba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GDGen is a unified, potential-energy-based framework that integrates rigid, articulated, and soft body dynamics into a geometry-agnostic system using directional stiffness and neural fields to enable generalist agents in complex, dynamic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for generalist embodied agents operating in rich physical environments; current physics models are fragmented (rigid/soft/articulated) and geometry-dependent. A unified, learnable representation from motion observations could enable scalable simulation and training.

Method: Treat dynamics via potential energy minimization; extend elastodynamics with directional stiffness; design a specialized network for extended material properties; use a neural field to represent deformation in a geometry-agnostic way.

Result: Extensive experiments show GDGen unifies diverse simulation paradigms (rigid, articulated, soft) and provides a versatile foundation for creating interactive virtual environments and training robotic agents in dynamically rich scenarios.

Conclusion: GDGen offers a principled, generalized representation for dynamics generation, enabling broad physical behaviors with an energy-based, geometry-agnostic framework, and facilitating robust simulation-to-agent training.

Abstract: Digital twin worlds with realistic interactive dynamics presents a new
opportunity to develop generalist embodied agents in scannable environments
with complex physical behaviors. To this end, we present GDGen (Generalized
Representation for Generalized Dynamics Generation), a framework that takes a
potential energy perspective to seamlessly integrate rigid body, articulated
body, and soft body dynamics into a unified, geometry-agnostic system. GDGen
operates from the governing principle that the potential energy for any stable
physical system should be low. This fresh perspective allows us to treat the
world as one holistic entity and infer underlying physical properties from
simple motion observations. We extend classic elastodynamics by introducing
directional stiffness to capture a broad spectrum of physical behaviors,
covering soft elastic, articulated, and rigid body systems. We propose a
specialized network to model the extended material property and employ a neural
field to represent deformation in a geometry-agnostic manner. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GDGen robustly unifies diverse simulation
paradigms, offering a versatile foundation for creating interactive virtual
environments and training robotic agents in complex, dynamically rich
scenarios.

TL;DR: COLIPRI is a 3D vision-label encoder trained with both image-only and image-text data, plus a report-generation objective, achieving state-of-the-art in report generation and various classification tasks, while remaining competitive in segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity in 3D medical vision-language pre-training motivates adding inductive biases and leveraging both image-only and paired data to improve capabilities such as report generation, retrieval, and classification.

Method: Introduce a report-generation objective and jointly pre-train vision-language and vision-only models on 3D medical data, forming the COLIPRI encoder family to exploit diverse data sources.

Result: State-of-the-art in report generation, classification probing, and zero-shot classification; competitive in semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: Inductive biases and data-scale through mixed pre-training substantially improve 3D VLEs, enabling better clinical tasks with limited data.

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training, i.e., aligning images with paired text, is a
powerful paradigm to create encoders that can be directly used for tasks such
as classification and retrieval, and for downstream tasks such as segmentation
and report generation. In the 3D medical image domain, these capabilities allow
vision-language encoders (VLEs) to support radiologists by retrieving patients
with similar abnormalities or predicting likelihoods of abnormality. While the
methodology holds promise, data availability limits the capabilities of current
3D VLEs.
  In this paper, we alleviate the lack of data by injecting additional
inductive biases: introducing a report generation objective and pairing
vision-language pre-training with vision-only pre-training. This allows us to
leverage both image-only and paired image-text 3D datasets, increasing the
total amount of data to which our model is exposed. Through these additional
inductive biases, paired with best practices of the 3D medical imaging domain,
we develop the Comprehensive Language-image Pre-training (COLIPRI) encoder
family. Our COLIPRI encoders achieve state-of-the-art performance in report
generation, classification probing, and zero-shot classification, and remain
competitive for semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: DRIFT is a lightweight gradient-space reasoning transfer method for multimodal LLMs that beats naive parameter merging and data-heavy fine-tuning at a fraction of the cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Naive weight merging between reasoning-enhanced LLMs and multimodal variants yields mixed results across model families and can degrade performance; a simple, efficient method to transfer reasoning without breaking multimodal alignment is needed.

Method: Compute a reasoning prior as the parameter-space difference between a reasoning-enhanced model and its multimodal variant. During multimodal fine-tuning, bias gradients using this prior (directional guidance) to steer learning toward effective reasoning while preserving alignment. The prior is precomputed and integrated into standard supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks (e.g., MathVista, MathVerse) show DRIFT consistently improves reasoning over naive merging and supervised fine-tuning, matching or surpassing heavier, training-intensive methods at a fraction of the cost.

Conclusion: DRIFT provides an efficient, scalable way to inject reasoning capabilities into multimodal LLMs by gradient-space transfer, preserving alignment and reducing training resources compared to data- or RL-heavy approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly advancing, yet their
reasoning ability often lags behind that of strong text-only counterparts.
Existing methods to bridge this gap rely on supervised fine-tuning over
large-scale multimodal reasoning data or reinforcement learning, both of which
are resource-intensive. A promising alternative is model merging, which
interpolates parameters between reasoning-enhanced LLMs and multimodal
variants. However, our analysis shows that naive merging is not always a "free
lunch": its effectiveness varies drastically across model families, with some
(e.g., LLaVA, Idefics) benefiting while others (e.g., Qwen) suffer performance
degradation. To address this, we propose Directional Reasoning Injection for
Fine-Tuning (DRIFT) MLLMs, a lightweight method that transfers reasoning
knowledge in the gradient space, without destabilizing multimodal alignment.
DRIFT precomputes a reasoning prior as the parameter-space difference between
reasoning and multimodal variants, then uses it to bias gradients during
multimodal fine-tuning. This approach preserves the simplicity of standard
supervised fine-tuning pipelines while enabling efficient reasoning transfer.
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista
and MathVerse, demonstrate that DRIFT consistently improves reasoning
performance over naive merging and supervised fine-tuning, while matching or
surpassing training-heavy methods at a fraction of the cost.

### [13] [A solution to generalized learning from small training sets found in everyday infant experiences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15060)
*Frangil Ramirez,Elizabeth Clerkin,David J. Crandall,Linda B. Smith*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Infants may learn basic object categories from sparse, lumpily structured daily visual input; imitating this lumpiness improves generalization in ML from small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain how young children achieve robust generalization with limited input and reconcile with data-hungry ML; propose that daily-life visual statistics—especially lumpiness and repeated exposure—drive early category learning.

Method: Analyze egocentric images from 14 infants (ages 7–11 months), identify eight early-learned categories, characterize the visual input's similarity structure, and run computational experiments testing learning from datasets structured like infant experience.

Result: The infants’ daily input exhibits a lumped similarity structure—clusters of highly similar images interspersed with rarer, more variable examples. In simulations, mimicking this structure improves generalization from small datasets in machine learning.

Conclusion: Natural lumpiness in infant experience may support early category learning and generalization and suggests principles for efficient learning applicable across problems and learner types.

Abstract: Young children readily recognize and generalize visual objects labeled by
common nouns, suggesting that these basic level object categories may be given.
Yet if they are, how they arise remains unclear. We propose that the answer
lies in the statistics of infant daily life visual experiences. Whereas large
and diverse datasets typically support robust learning and generalization in
human and machine learning, infants achieve this generalization from limited
experiences. We suggest that the resolution of this apparent contradiction lies
in the visual diversity of daily life, repeated experiences with single object
instances. Analyzing egocentric images from 14 infants (aged 7 to 11 months) we
show that their everyday visual input exhibits a lumpy similarity structure,
with clusters of highly similar images interspersed with rarer, more variable
ones, across eight early-learned categories. Computational experiments show
that mimicking this structure in machines improves generalization from small
datasets in machine learning. The natural lumpiness of infant experience may
thus support early category learning and generalization and, more broadly,
offer principles for efficient learning across a variety of problems and kinds
of learners.

TL;DR: SaLon3R introduces structure-aware online 3D Gaussian Splatting by compressing per-pixel Gaussians into compact 3D anchors via saliency-guided quantization and refining them with a 3D Point Transformer for long-term, fast, generalizable reconstruction (50+ views at >10 FPS, 50–90% redundancy reduction).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address redundancies and geometric inconsistencies in long-duration, per-pixel Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) reconstructions. Enable online, generalizable 3D reconstructions over tens of views at high frame rates without test-time optimization or known camera parameters.

Method: Predict dense per-pixel Gaussians and a saliency map; compress redundant Gaussians into compact anchors focusing on high-complexity regions; employ a 3D Point Transformer to learn 3D spatial priors and refine anchor attributes and saliency; perform regionally adaptive Gaussian decoding; operate in a single feed-forward pass without requiring camera parameters or test-time optimization.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on novel view synthesis and depth estimation, demonstrating superior efficiency, robustness, and generalization for long-term generalizable 3D reconstruction. Reports 50+ views at >10 FPS and 50–90% redundancy removal across multiple datasets; effectively resolves artifacts and prunes redundant 3DGS.

Conclusion: SaLon3R effectively mitigates redundancy and artifacts in long-term 3DGS, enabling fast, online, structure-aware reconstruction across many views with high fidelity and generalization.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled generalizable,
on-the-fly reconstruction of sequential input views. However, existing methods
often predict per-pixel Gaussians and combine Gaussians from all views as the
scene representation, leading to substantial redundancies and geometric
inconsistencies in long-duration video sequences. To address this, we propose
SaLon3R, a novel framework for Structure-aware, Long-term 3DGS Reconstruction.
To our best knowledge, SaLon3R is the first online generalizable GS method
capable of reconstructing over 50 views in over 10 FPS, with 50% to 90%
redundancy removal. Our method introduces compact anchor primitives to
eliminate redundancy through differentiable saliency-aware Gaussian
quantization, coupled with a 3D Point Transformer that refines anchor
attributes and saliency to resolve cross-frame geometric and photometric
inconsistencies. Specifically, we first leverage a 3D reconstruction backbone
to predict dense per-pixel Gaussians and a saliency map encoding regional
geometric complexity. Redundant Gaussians are compressed into compact anchors
by prioritizing high-complexity regions. The 3D Point Transformer then learns
spatial structural priors in 3D space from training data to refine anchor
attributes and saliency, enabling regionally adaptive Gaussian decoding for
geometric fidelity. Without known camera parameters or test-time optimization,
our approach effectively resolves artifacts and prunes the redundant 3DGS in a
single feed-forward pass. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and depth estimation,
demonstrating superior efficiency, robustness, and generalization ability for
long-term generalizable 3D reconstruction. Project Page:

### [15] [TGT: Text-Grounded Trajectories for Locally Controlled Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15104)
*Guofeng Zhang,Angtian Wang,Jacob Zhiyuan Fang,Liming Jiang,Haotian Yang,Bo Liu,Yiding Yang,Guang Chen,Longyin Wen,Alan Yuille,Chongyang Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT) enables text-conditioned video generation by pairing motion trajectories with localized text descriptions; introduces Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) and a dual-CFG guidance scheme, plus a pipeline with 2M-clip annotations to improve control over appearance and motion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing text-to-video methods struggle with precise, multi-object control; localized controls (boxes/masks) degrade in complexity and lack clear correspondence between tracked entities as object count increases.

Method: Propose TGT framework with trajectories + localized text; use Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to fuse signals; apply dual-CFG to modulate local and global text guidance; develop a data processing pipeline to extract trajectories with localized descriptions; annotate about 2 million video clips for training.

Result: Experiments show higher visual quality, tighter text alignment, and better motion controllability compared with prior methods.

Conclusion: TGT enables intuitive, trajectory-based motion control in text-to-video generation; the approach, along with large-scale annotated data, improves alignment and controllability; details available at the project website.

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has advanced rapidly in visual fidelity, whereas
standard methods still have limited ability to control the subject composition
of generated scenes. Prior work shows that adding localized text control
signals, such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks, can help. However, these
methods struggle in complex scenarios and degrade in multi-object settings,
offering limited precision and lacking a clear correspondence between
individual trajectories and visual entities as the number of controllable
objects increases. We introduce Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT), a framework
that conditions video generation on trajectories paired with localized text
descriptions. We propose Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to integrate
these signals and adopt a dual-CFG scheme to separately modulate local and
global text guidance. In addition, we develop a data processing pipeline that
produces trajectories with localized descriptions of tracked entities, and we
annotate two million high quality video clips to train TGT. Together, these
components enable TGT to use point trajectories as intuitive motion handles,
pairing each trajectory with text to control both appearance and motion.
Extensive experiments show that TGT achieves higher visual quality, more
accurate text alignment, and improved motion controllability compared with
prior approaches. Website: https://textgroundedtraj.github.io.

TL;DR: Diffusion-model priors are applied to brain MRI inverse problems to solve super-resolution, bias-field correction, inpainting, and combinations thereof, achieving state-of-the-art results without paired training data by integrating a brain-diffusion prior with flexible forward models; the method can refine outputs of existing deep-learning approaches and generalizes across heterogeneous MRI data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To combine powerful diffusion priors with Bayesian inverse problem formulations in neuroimaging, addressing the limitations of classical anatomical priors and the dependence on large paired datasets.

Method: Train a score-based diffusion model on diverse brain MRI data to serve as a prior within forward-model frameworks for tasks like super-resolution, bias-field correction, inpainting, and combinations; solve inverse problems by guiding reconstructions with the diffusion prior, and optionally refine outputs from existing deep learning methods.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on heterogeneous clinical and research MRI data, producing consistent, high-quality solutions without requiring paired training data; demonstrates improved anatomical fidelity and robustness.

Conclusion: Diffusion priors offer a versatile, general-purpose prior for brain MRI inverse problems, enabling robust, data-efficient inference and the potential to enhance existing imaging pipelines.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative models in
medical imaging. However, it remains a major challenge to combine these
data-driven models with domain knowledge to guide brain imaging problems. In
neuroimaging, Bayesian inverse problems have long provided a successful
framework for inference tasks, where incorporating domain knowledge of the
imaging process enables robust performance without requiring extensive training
data. However, the anatomical modeling component of these approaches typically
relies on classical mathematical priors that often fail to capture the complex
structure of brain anatomy. In this work, we present the first general-purpose
application of diffusion models as priors for solving a wide range of medical
imaging inverse problems. Our approach leverages a score-based diffusion prior
trained extensively on diverse brain MRI data, paired with flexible forward
models that capture common image processing tasks such as super-resolution,
bias field correction, inpainting, and combinations thereof. We further
demonstrate how our framework can refine outputs from existing deep learning
methods to improve anatomical fidelity. Experiments on heterogeneous clinical
and research MRI data show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance producing consistent, high-quality solutions without requiring
paired training datasets. These results highlight the potential of diffusion
priors as versatile tools for brain MRI analysis.

TL;DR: FFT-MIL augments MIL for WSI classification with a frequency-domain branch to capture global dependencies, improving macro F1 and AUC across datasets and MIL backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSI classification with MIL struggles to model global context due to enormous image size and local patch embeddings; there is a need to capture coarse global structures for robust predictions.

Method: Introduce FFT-MIL: compute low-frequency FFT-based crops from WSIs; process via a modular FFT-Block (convolutions + Min-Max normalization); fuse global frequency features with spatial patch features using lightweight integration strategies; designed to be compatible with diverse MIL architectures.

Result: Evaluated across six MIL methods on BRACS, LUAD, and IMP; FFT-Block integration yields average macro F1 improvement of 3.51% and AUC improvement of 1.51%; gains are consistent across architectures and datasets.

Conclusion: Frequency-domain learning provides compact global context that complements spatial features, improving scalability and accuracy of MIL-based WSI classification and offering a general, efficient mechanism to capture global dependencies.

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification relies on Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) with spatial patch features, yet existing methods struggle to capture
global dependencies due to the immense size of WSIs and the local nature of
patch embeddings. This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structures
essential for robust diagnostic prediction.
  We propose Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a
framework that augments MIL with a frequency-domain branch to provide compact
global context. Low-frequency crops are extracted from WSIs via the Fast
Fourier Transform and processed through a modular FFT-Block composed of
convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization to mitigate the high variance of
frequency data. The learned global frequency feature is fused with spatial
patch features through lightweight integration strategies, enabling
compatibility with diverse MIL architectures.
  FFT-MIL was evaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public
datasets (BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1
scores by an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains
across architectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain
learning as an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global
dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and
advancing the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.

*Xingrui Wang,Jiang Liu,Chao Huang,Xiaodong Yu,Ze Wang,Ximeng Sun,Jialian Wu,Alan Yuille,Emad Barsoum,Zicheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XModBench is a tri-modal benchmark for cross-modal consistency in omni-modal LLMs (OLLMs). It reveals modality biases and directional imbalances in current models, with Gemini 2.5 Pro underperforming on spatial/temporal reasoning (<60% accuracy) and showing stronger disparity when content is conveyed via audio vs. text and when vision is used as context rather than text. The work positions XModBench as a fundamental diagnostic tool for measuring and improving cross-modal competence; data/tools will be publicly available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether OLLMs achieve modality-invariant reasoning or suffer modality-specific biases, addressing gaps in existing benchmarks that focus on general cross-modal QA rather than cross-modal consistency.

Method: Constructed XModBench with 60,828 MC questions across five task families and all six modality compositions. Provides a framework to diagnose modality-invariant reasoning, modality disparity, and directional imbalance. Evaluated the strongest model, Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Result: Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves under 60% accuracy on spatial/temporal reasoning; exhibits persistent modality disparities with performance dropping when semantic content is conveyed through audio rather than text; shows systematic directional imbalance with lower consistency when vision serves as context compared to text.

Conclusion: XModBench serves as a fundamental diagnostic tool to evaluate and improve cross-modal competence in OLLMs and highlights that current models are far from modality-invariant reasoning; data and tools will be publicly available at the project site.

Abstract: Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify audio, vision, and text
understanding within a single framework. While existing benchmarks primarily
evaluate general cross-modal question-answering ability, it remains unclear
whether OLLMs achieve modality-invariant reasoning or exhibit modality-specific
biases. We introduce XModBench, a large-scale tri-modal benchmark explicitly
designed to measure cross-modal consistency. XModBench comprises 60,828
multiple-choice questions spanning five task families and systematically covers
all six modality compositions in question-answer pairs, enabling fine-grained
diagnosis of an OLLM's modality-invariant reasoning, modality disparity, and
directional imbalance. Experiments show that even the strongest model, Gemini
2.5 Pro, (i) struggles with spatial and temporal reasoning, achieving less than
60% accuracy, (ii) reveals persistent modality disparities, with performance
dropping substantially when the same semantic content is conveyed through audio
rather than text, and (iii) shows systematic directional imbalance, exhibiting
lower consistency when vision serves as context compared to text. These
findings indicate that current OLLMs remain far from truly modality-invariant
reasoning and position XModBench as a fundamental diagnostic tool for
evaluating and improving cross-modal competence. All data and evaluation tools
will be available at https://xingruiwang.github.io/projects/XModBench/.

TL;DR: UniFilter is a unified data-quality classifier for filtering high-quality image-caption and interleaved multimodal data, enabling better multimodal LLMs; employs semi-synthetic generation across four quality levels; improves zero-shot/in-context abilities and is accompanied by released data and model checkpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data quality for multimodal pretraining is crucial, yet filtering for interleaved image-text data is under-explored. An efficient, unified approach to curate high-quality data can significantly boost MLLM capabilities.

Method: Train a Unified Multimodal Data Quality Classifier (UniFilter) to score and filter both caption and interleaved data. Use semi-synthetic data generation by taking raw images and generating text at four quality levels to create sample-score pairs. Apply UniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp and high-quality interleaved data from OBELICS. Pre-train MLLMs on the filtered data and perform visual supervised fine-tuning before evaluating on benchmarks. The authors also release the synthetic data, UniFilter checkpoints, and the OBELICS-HQ subset.

Result: MLLMs trained on UniFilter-filtered data show significantly enhanced capabilities, including stronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning, compared with models trained on baseline-filtered data. After visual supervised fine-tuning, these models achieve stronger performance across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that high-quality multimodal pretraining, guided by a unified, scalable data-quality filter and semi-synthetic labeling, yields tangible downstream gains. It also contributes resources for reproducibility (synthetic data, UniFilter checkpoints, and HQ data). Potential limitations include reliance on synthetic text quality, dataset distribution shifts, and generalizability to other modalities or domains.

Abstract: The Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are continually pre-trained on a
mixture of image-text caption data and interleaved document data, while the
high-quality data filtering towards image-text interleaved document data is
under-explored. We propose to train an efficient MLLM as a Unified Mulitmodal
Data Quality Classifier to Filter both high-quality image-text caption and
interleaved data (UniFilter). To address the challenge of collecting diverse
labeled multimodal data, we introduce a semi-synthetic approach that leverages
readily available raw images and generates corresponding text across four
quality levels. This method enables efficient creation of sample-score pairs
for both caption and interleaved document data to train UniFilter. We apply
UniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp caption dataset and
interleaved data from the OBELICS image-text interleaved dataset. MLLMs
pre-trained on the filtered data demonstrate significantly enhanced
capabilities compared to those trained on baseline-filtered data, achieving
stronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning capabilities. After visual
supervised fine-tuning, these UniFilter-induced MLLMs achieve stronger
performance on various benchmarks, highlighting the downstream benefits of
high-quality multimodal pre-training. We release the synthetic training data
used for training UniFilter, the UniFilter model checkpoints, and the
high-quality interleaved document subset OBELICS-HQ, curated by UniFilter, to
the community for reproduction and further development.

TL;DR: The paper investigates reproducibility in foundation-model training for digital pathology, identifying robust hyperparameter/augmentation choices and noting dataset-specific stability, with the LC25000-Colon dataset as the most reproducible benchmark; it offers practical guidelines to improve reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reproducibility is hampered by software randomness, hardware nondeterminism, and inconsistent hyperparameter reporting in histopathology foundation-model training; there is a need for actionable guidance to improve reliability.

Method: Trained a CLIP model on the QUILT-1M dataset and systematically varied hyperparameters and augmentation strategies; evaluated across three histopathology datasets (PatchCamelyon, LC25000-Lung, LC25000-Colon) to assess run-to-run variability and stability.

Result: Key findings: (1) RandomResizedCrop in the range 0.7–0.8 outperformed more aggressive (0.6) or conservative (0.9) settings; (2) distributed training without local loss improved stability; (3) learning rates below 5e-5 consistently degraded performance across all datasets; (4) the LC25000-Colon dataset provided the most reproducible benchmark; the study provides practical rules for reproducible foundation-model development in digital pathology.

Conclusion: Reproducibility in computational pathology relies on transparent documentation and careful experimental configuration; the study offers concrete guidelines to guide future work in building reproducible foundation models for digital pathology.

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a critical challenge in foundation model training for
histopathology, often hindered by software randomness, hardware
non-determinism, and inconsistent hyperparameter reporting. To investigate
these issues, we trained a CLIP model on the QUILT-1M dataset and
systematically evaluated the impact of different hyperparameter settings and
augmentation strategies across three downstream histopathology datasets
(PatchCamelyon, LC25000-Lung, and LC25000-Colon). Despite variability across
runs, we identified clear trends: RandomResizedCrop values of 0.7-0.8
outperformed more aggressive (0.6) or conservative (0.9) settings, distributed
training without local loss improved stability, and learning rates below 5.0e-5
consistently degraded performance across all datasets. The LC25000 (Colon)
dataset consistently provided the most reproducible benchmark. These findings
highlight that reproducibility in computational pathology depends not only on
transparent documentation but also on carefully chosen experimental
configurations, and we provide practical rules to guide future efforts in
developing reproducible foundation models for digital pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A personalized image-generation framework uses a salient concept-aware embedding to suppress irrelevant visual details, achieving a better fidelity-diversity balance in image-text guided augmentation and improving downstream robustness across eight fine-grained datasets (0.73% gain in standard and 6.5% in long-tail).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge in forecasted generative data augmentation is balancing fidelity to the input image with diversity across varied text prompts, while avoiding entanglement of non-essential attributes (e.g., background) that conflict with text modifications.

Method: Introduce a salient concept-aware image embedding model that reduces the influence of irrelevant visual details during synthesis, preserving class-discriminative features and enabling controlled variations aligned with text prompts.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art augmentation methods on eight fine-grained datasets, with averaged accuracy gains of 0.73% under conventional settings and 6.5% under long-tail settings.

Conclusion: Saliency-aware image embeddings can improve the fidelity-diversity trade-off in image-text conditioned augmentation, leading to more robust downstream models; the approach highlights the value of disentangling salient concepts from contextual details during generative synthesis.

Abstract: Recent generative data augmentation methods conditioned on both image and
text prompts struggle to balance between fidelity and diversity, as it is
challenging to preserve essential image details while aligning with varied text
prompts. This challenge arises because representations in the synthesis process
often become entangled with non-essential input image attributes such as
environmental contexts, creating conflicts with text prompts intended to modify
these elements. To address this, we propose a personalized image generation
framework that uses a salient concept-aware image embedding model to reduce the
influence of irrelevant visual details during the synthesis process, thereby
maintaining intuitive alignment between image and text inputs. By generating
images that better preserve class-discriminative features with additional
controlled variations, our framework effectively enhances the diversity of
training datasets and thereby improves the robustness of downstream models. Our
approach demonstrates superior performance across eight fine-grained vision
datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art augmentation methods with averaged
classification accuracy improvements by 0.73% and 6.5% under conventional and
long-tail settings, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CHDs are rare, leading to imbalanced and low-quality datasets; lack of public multimodal datasets integrating imaging and clinical data hinders AI-assisted prenatal decision-making.

Method: A cross-attention-based multimodal transformer that fuses features from fetal imaging (ultrasound/echocardiography) and maternal clinical records, applied to the CARDIUM dataset; public release of dataset and code.

Result: Improves CHD detection by 11% over image-only baselines and 50% over tabular-only baselines; achieves an F1 score of 79.8 ± 4.8% on CARDIUM.

Conclusion: Publicly releasing CARDIUM and code will catalyze research in prenatal CHD AI; demonstrates value of multi-source data fusion for clinical decision support.

Abstract: Prenatal diagnosis of Congenital Heart Diseases (CHDs) holds great potential
for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven solutions. However, collecting
high-quality diagnostic data remains difficult due to the rarity of these
conditions, resulting in imbalanced and low-quality datasets that hinder model
performance. Moreover, no public efforts have been made to integrate multiple
sources of information, such as imaging and clinical data, further limiting the
ability of AI models to support and enhance clinical decision-making. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Congenital Anomaly Recognition with
Diagnostic Images and Unified Medical records (CARDIUM) dataset, the first
publicly available multimodal dataset consolidating fetal ultrasound and
echocardiographic images along with maternal clinical records for prenatal CHD
detection. Furthermore, we propose a robust multimodal transformer architecture
that incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to fuse feature representations
from image and tabular data, improving CHD detection by 11% and 50% over image
and tabular single-modality approaches, respectively, and achieving an F1 score
of 79.8 $\pm$ 4.8% in the CARDIUM dataset. We will publicly release our dataset

TL;DR: Text-to-image ads show demographic biases across topics; identical ads with different gender/race portrayals yield different persuasiveness as judged by models; a country-targeting technique is explored; code is available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess fairness and potential harm of demographic biases in generative advertising, and understand how portrayal choices affect persuasiveness and geographic targeting.

Method: Use text-to-image models to generate ads for various topics; systematically vary gender and race while keeping other content identical; measure predicted persuasiveness with models; analyze demographic bias by topic; experiment with a country-targeting method to customize ads by location; report code availability.

Result: Demographic bias exists across ad topics; visible differences in persuasiveness based on gender/race; country-targeting approach demonstrates feasibility; results underscore need for auditing and mitigation in via generative ad tools.

Conclusion: Generative ad tools can propagate or amplify bias; practitioners should consider fairness-aware design, debiasing, and normative guidelines; more work needed to understand real-world impact and to develop remediation strategies.

Abstract: Text-to-image models are appealing for customizing visual advertisements and
targeting specific populations. We investigate this potential by examining the
demographic bias within ads for different ad topics, and the disparate level of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current driving-scene synthesis methods are either computationally prohibitive for long sequences, lack true 3D representations, or are limited to static single-scene reconstructions. There is a need for a unified approach that enables long-range, multimodal-controlled 3D driving scenes.

Method: FastDrive-DiT is an efficient video diffusion transformer producing high-resolution, temporally coherent driving videos guided by text and Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) layouts; FastRecon3D is a feed-forward reconstruction module that rapidly builds 3D Gaussian representations across time to ensure spatial-temporal consistency.

Result: Real-time generation of extended driving videos up to 424×800 at 12 FPS, with corresponding dynamic 3D scenes; SSIM of 0.811 and PSNR of 22.84 on novel view synthesis; parameter-efficient.

Conclusion: DriveGen3D bridges long-term video synthesis and dynamic 3D scene reconstruction under multimodal control, enabling real-time, extended driving video generation and coherent 3D scene synthesis.

Abstract: We present DriveGen3D, a novel framework for generating high-quality and
highly controllable dynamic 3D driving scenes that addresses critical
limitations in existing methodologies. Current approaches to driving scene
synthesis either suffer from prohibitive computational demands for extended
temporal generation, focus exclusively on prolonged video synthesis without 3D
representation, or restrict themselves to static single-scene reconstruction.
Our work bridges this methodological gap by integrating accelerated long-term
video generation with large-scale dynamic scene reconstruction through
multimodal conditional control. DriveGen3D introduces a unified pipeline
consisting of two specialized components: FastDrive-DiT, an efficient video
diffusion transformer for high-resolution, temporally coherent video synthesis
under text and Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) layout guidance; and FastRecon3D, a
feed-forward reconstruction module that rapidly builds 3D Gaussian
representations across time, ensuring spatial-temporal consistency. Together,
these components enable real-time generation of extended driving videos (up to
$424\times800$ at 12 FPS) and corresponding dynamic 3D scenes, achieving SSIM
of 0.811 and PSNR of 22.84 on novel view synthesis, all while maintaining

It achieves state-of-the-art results on robotic control benchmarks.

Diffusion models offer rich, controllable representations but exhibit a domain gap with robotics, so naive textual conditioning underperforms. There is a need for representations that capture dynamic, control-relevant visual information.

Method: ORCA introduces two learnable conditioning components: (1) task prompts that adapt to the control environment, and (2) frame-specific visual prompts that capture fine-grained, temporal details. These prompts modulate the frozen diffusion model to produce task-relevant representations without fine-tuning the model itself, enabling task-adaptive visual features for imitation learning.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple robotic control benchmarks, significantly surpassing prior methods.

Conclusion: Task-adaptive prompting can unlock the value of frozen diffusion models for control. Naive textual prompts are insufficient due to domain mismatch; by using learnable task prompts and frame-specific visual prompts, ORCA bridges the gap and delivers superior robotic control performance.

Abstract: While pre-trained visual representations have significantly advanced
imitation learning, they are often task-agnostic as they remain frozen during
policy learning. In this work, we explore leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models to obtain task-adaptive visual representations for robotic
control, without fine-tuning the model itself. However, we find that naively
applying textual conditions - a successful strategy in other vision domains -
yields minimal or even negative gains in control tasks. We attribute this to
the domain gap between the diffusion model's training data and robotic control
environments, leading us to argue for conditions that consider the specific,
dynamic visual information required for control. To this end, we propose ORCA,
which introduces learnable task prompts that adapt to the control environment
and visual prompts that capture fine-grained, frame-specific details. Through
facilitating task-adaptive representations with our newly devised conditions,
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various robotic control
benchmarks, significantly surpassing prior methods.

### [27] [Post-Processing Methods for Improving Accuracy in MRI Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15282)
*Nishad Kulkarni,Krithika Iyer,Austin Tapp,Abhijeet Parida,Daniel Capellán-Martín,Zhifan Jiang,María J. Ledesma-Carbayo,Syed Muhammad Anwar,Marius George Linguraru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An ensemble-based inpainting pipeline for brain MRI tumors combining model ensembling, post-processing (median filtering, histogram matching, pixel averaging), and a lightweight U-Net refinement stage to improve anatomical plausibility and robustness over single-model approaches; validated on BraTS 2025 with a docker release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MRI inpainting tools struggle with large brain lesions and are tuned for healthy anatomy, leading to failures in downstream analyses; there's a need for plausible, robust inpaintings that can be deployed clinically.

Method: Systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art inpainting models; propose a pipeline that ensembles multiple models, applies post-processing steps (median filtering, histogram matching, pixel averaging), plus a lightweight U-Net refinement; evaluation on BraTS 2025 inpainting setup; docker available at the provided link.

Result: The pipeline yields improved anatomical plausibility and visual fidelity of inpainted regions; higher accuracy and robustness than individual baseline models; more accessible and resource-conscious, supporting broader clinical deployment and sustainable research.

Conclusion: Combining established models with targeted post-processing enhances inpainting performance and accessibility; the approach is suitable for clinical deployment and reproducible research, with a Docker release enabling easy adoption.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the primary imaging modality used in the
diagnosis, assessment, and treatment planning for brain pathologies. However,
most automated MRI analysis tools, such as segmentation and registration
pipelines, are optimized for healthy anatomies and often fail when confronted
with large lesions such as tumors. To overcome this, image inpainting
techniques aim to locally synthesize healthy brain tissues in tumor regions,
enabling the reliable application of general-purpose tools. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art inpainting models and observe a
saturation in their standalone performance. In response, we introduce a
methodology combining model ensembling with efficient post-processing
strategies such as median filtering, histogram matching, and pixel averaging.
Further anatomical refinement is achieved via a lightweight U-Net enhancement
stage. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our proposed pipeline
improves the anatomical plausibility and visual fidelity of inpainted regions,
yielding higher accuracy and more robust outcomes than individual baseline
models. By combining established models with targeted post-processing, we
achieve improved and more accessible inpainting outcomes, supporting broader
clinical deployment and sustainable, resource-conscious research. Our 2025

*Duc-Phuong Doan-Ngo,Thanh-Dang Diep,Thanh Nguyen-Duc,Thanh-Sach LE,Nam Thoai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hard-margin loss (QCFace) decouples recognizability from identity in deep face recognition, addressing gradient interference and improving robustness, achieving state-of-the-art results on verification and identification benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recognizability is a vital perceptual cue in face processing that strongly affects FR performance. Existing recognizability cues are only partially captured by soft-margin losses and suffer from gradient overlap that destabilizes optimization and entangles recognizability with identity.

Method: Introduce a hard-margin strategy (QCFace) with a hard-margin–based loss and a guidance factor for hypersphere planning to explicitly optimize recognizability while decoupling it from identity representations.

Result: Experiments show robust and quantifiable recognizability encoding and state-of-the-art performance on both verification and identification benchmarks compared with existing recognizability-based losses.

Conclusion: QCFace provides clean decoupling of recognizability and identity, improves optimization stability, and yields superior FR performance, validating the hard-margin approach for recognizability-aware face representations.

Abstract: Recognizability, a key perceptual factor in human face processing, strongly
affects the performance of face recognition (FR) systems in both verification
and identification tasks. Effectively using recognizability to enhance feature
representation remains challenging. In deep FR, the loss function plays a
crucial role in shaping how features are embedded. However, current methods
have two main drawbacks: (i) recognizability is only partially captured through
soft margin constraints, resulting in weaker quality representation and lower
discrimination, especially for low-quality or ambiguous faces; (ii) mutual
overlapping gradients between feature direction and magnitude introduce
undesirable interactions during optimization, causing instability and confusion
in hypersphere planning, which may result in poor generalization, and entangled
representations where recognizability and identity are not cleanly separated.
To address these issues, we introduce a hard margin strategy - Quality Control
Face (QCFace), which overcomes the mutual overlapping gradient problem and
enables the clear decoupling of recognizability from identity representation.
Based on this strategy, a novel hard-margin-based loss function employs a
guidance factor for hypersphere planning, simultaneously optimizing for
recognition ability and explicit recognizability representation. Extensive
experiments confirm that QCFace not only provides robust and quantifiable
recognizability encoding but also achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
verification and identification benchmarks compared to existing
recognizability-based losses.

### [29] [Hyperbolic Structured Classification for Robust Single Positive Multi-label Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15296)
*Yiming Lin,Shang Wang,Junkai Zhou,Qiufeng Wang,Xiao-Bo Jin,Kaizhu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel hyperbolic ball-based framework for SPMLL that models inter-label relationships via ball interactions in hyperbolic space, achieving competitive performance and improved interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Currently, SPMLL uses single positive labels with implicit label relationships via distance-based similarity. There is no explicit geometric definition for different relationship types. Hyperbolic geometry naturally encodes hierarchical and relational structures, suggesting a ball-based representation could capture multiple relationship types (hierarchy, co-occurrence, independence) more explicitly.

Method: Represent each label as a hyperbolic ball rather than a point/vector. Use ball interactions to model relationships: inclusion (hierarchy), overlap (co-occurrence), and separation (semantic independence). Introduce a temperature-adaptive hyperbolic ball classifier and a physics-inspired double-well regularization to guide balls toward meaningful configurations.

Result: Experiments on four benchmark datasets (MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE, CUB-200-2011) show competitive performance and superior interpretability compared with existing methods. Learned embeddings correlate strongly with real-world co-occurrence patterns, supporting hyperbolic geometry as a robust paradigm for structured classification under incomplete supervision.

Conclusion: Hyperbolic ball representations enable rich, interpretable modeling of complex label relationships in SPMLL. The proposed classifier and regularization induce meaningful ball configurations and demonstrate the advantages of geometry-based approaches for incomplete supervision, with potential applicability to broader weakly supervised multi-label tasks.

Abstract: Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPMLL) addresses the challenging
scenario where each training sample is annotated with only one positive label
despite potentially belonging to multiple categories, making it difficult to
capture complex label relationships and hierarchical structures. While existing
methods implicitly model label relationships through distance-based similarity,
lacking explicit geometric definitions for different relationship types. To
address these limitations, we propose the first hyperbolic classification
framework for SPMLL that represents each label as a hyperbolic ball rather than
a point or vector, enabling rich inter-label relationship modeling through
geometric ball interactions. Our ball-based approach naturally captures
multiple relationship types simultaneously: inclusion for hierarchical
structures, overlap for co-occurrence patterns, and separation for semantic
independence. Further, we introduce two key component innovations: a
temperature-adaptive hyperbolic ball classifier and a physics-inspired
double-well regularization that guides balls toward meaningful configurations.
To validate our approach, extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets
(MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE, CUB-200-2011) demonstrate competitive
performance with superior interpretability compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, statistical analysis reveals strong correlation between learned
embeddings and real-world co-occurrence patterns, establishing hyperbolic
geometry as a more robust paradigm for structured classification under
incomplete supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVG is a diffusion model trained on a semantically structured latent space built from frozen DINO features, removing the need for VAEs, yielding faster training, few-step sampling, and improved quality while retaining semantic capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAE latent spaces in latent diffusion models lack clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure, hindering training efficiency, inference speed, and transferability across vision tasks; a semantically meaningful latent space is desirable for robust diffusion-based generation.

Method: Construct a semantically discriminative latent space from frozen self-supervised representations (DINO features) and couple it with a lightweight residual branch for fine details; train diffusion directly on this space without a VAE; diffusion models operate in this SSL-based latent space to achieve efficient learning and high fidelity.

Result: Accelerated diffusion training, support for few-step sampling, and improved generative quality. The approach preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the underlying self-supervised representations, offering a principled path toward task-general, high-quality visuals.

Conclusion: By using a semantically structured latent space derived from self-supervised features and removing VAEs, SVG enables efficient diffusion learning with strong semantics and broad transfer potential across vision tasks.

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based visual generation has largely relied on
latent diffusion models with variational autoencoders (VAEs). While effective
for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited
training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision
tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack
of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis
confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and
understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent
diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent
diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages
self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature
space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features,
while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for
high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this
semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As
a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step
sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show
that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the
underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway
toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.

*Fei Wang,Li Shen,Liang Ding,Chao Xue,Ye Liu,Changxing Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMe enables progressive structured pruning of LLMs by channel-level sensitivity, concatenation-based layer merging, and hierarchical distillation, achieving strong accuracy retention after pruning 30% of parameters in LLaMA-2-7b.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing layer-wise structured pruning often hurts pruned parts and lacks recovery mechanisms, leading to noticeable performance degradation; there is a need for a pruning framework that preserves capabilities and allows recovery.

Method: Introduce a channel sensitivity metric combining activation intensity and weight norms for fine-grained channel selection; use concatenation-based layer merging to fuse top channels across adjacent layers; implement a hierarchical distillation process matching original and pruned layers to transfer knowledge; employ a progressive pruning framework with post-training distillation.

Result: On seven benchmarks, CoMe achieves state-of-the-art performance; pruning 30% of parameters on LLaMA-2-7b retains 83% of original average accuracy.

Conclusion: CoMe demonstrates that structured, channel-level pruning with cross-layer merging and guided distillation can significantly reduce model size with limited accuracy loss, offering an effective post-training recovery mechanism and practical deployment benefits.

Abstract: Large Language Models excel at natural language processing tasks, but their
massive size leads to high computational and storage demands. Recent works have
sought to reduce their model size through layer-wise structured pruning.
However, they tend to ignore retaining the capabilities in the pruned part. In
this work, we re-examine structured pruning paradigms and uncover several key
limitations: 1) notable performance degradation due to direct layer removal, 2)
incompetent linear weight layer aggregation, and 3) the lack of effective
post-training recovery mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose
CoMe, including a progressive layer pruning framework with a
Concatenation-based Merging technology and a hierarchical distillation
post-training process. Specifically, we introduce a channel sensitivity metric
that utilizes activation intensity and weight norms for fine-grained channel
selection. Subsequently, we employ a concatenation-based layer merging method
to fuse the most critical channels across adjacent layers, enabling progressive
model size reduction. Finally, we propose a hierarchical distillation protocol
that leverages the correspondences between the original and pruned model layers
established during pruning, thereby enabling efficient knowledge transfer.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that CoMe achieves state-of-the-art
performance; when pruning 30% of LLaMA-2-7b's parameters, the pruned model
retains 83% of its original average accuracy. Our code is available at

*Shengkai Hu,Haozhe Qi,Jun Wan,Jiaxing Huang,Lefei Zhang,Hang Sun,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proto-Former provides a unified, multi-dataset facial landmark detector that learns dataset-specific prototypes via an Adaptive Prototype-Aware Encoder and a Progressive Decoder, guided by a Prototype-Aware loss to enable joint training across datasets and improve cross-dataset accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current datasets define varying numbers of landmarks and most methods train on a single dataset, hurting generalization. A unified, adaptive framework is needed to leverage multiple datasets for robust landmark detection.

Method: Introduce Adaptive Prototype-Aware Encoder (APAE) for adaptive feature extraction and prototype learning; Progressive Prototype-Aware Decoder (PPAD) to refine prototypes into prompts guiding attention to facial regions; Prototype-Aware (PA) loss to select prototype experts and stabilize multi-dataset training; end-to-end training across multiple datasets in a single architecture.

Result: Experiments on standard benchmarks show the proposed Proto-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with existing methods; code released.

Conclusion: Proto-Former enables effective cross-dataset facial landmark detection by leveraging prototype representations, addressing gradient conflicts and instability during joint training, and paving the way for unified models across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved facial landmark
detection. However, existing facial landmark detection datasets often define
different numbers of landmarks, and most mainstream methods can only be trained
on a single dataset. This limits the model generalization to different datasets
and hinders the development of a unified model. To address this issue, we
propose Proto-Former, a unified, adaptive, end-to-end facial landmark detection
framework that explicitly enhances dataset-specific facial structural
representations (i.e., prototype). Proto-Former overcomes the limitations of
single-dataset training by enabling joint training across multiple datasets
within a unified architecture. Specifically, Proto-Former comprises two key
components: an Adaptive Prototype-Aware Encoder (APAE) that performs adaptive
feature extraction and learns prototype representations, and a Progressive
Prototype-Aware Decoder (PPAD) that refines these prototypes to generate
prompts that guide the model's attention to key facial regions. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel Prototype-Aware (PA) loss, which achieves optimal path
finding by constraining the selection weights of prototype experts. This loss
function effectively resolves the problem of prototype expert addressing
instability during multi-dataset training, alleviates gradient conflicts, and
enables the extraction of more accurate facial structure features. Extensive
experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Proto-Former
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Spatial457 proposes a scalable synthetic benchmark to evaluate 6D spatial reasoning in large multimodal models, revealing performance drops on 3D/6D tasks and uncovering attribute biases through RPDR analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill the gap in evaluating 6D spatial reasoning in LMMs (beyond 2D benchmarks) and to expose potential biases in predictions using an unbiased synthetic dataset.

Method: Construct Spatial457 with four spatial capabilities (multi-object recognition, 2D location, 3D location, 3D orientation), implement a cascading evaluation with 7 question types across 5 difficulty levels, evaluate multiple LMMs (PulseCheck457), introduce Relative Performance Dropping Rate (RPDR) to quantify difficulty-induced declines, and analyze attribute biases using the unbiased dataset design; code and data released.

Result: Models show a general performance drop as task complexity increases, with 3D and 6D tasks being the hardest. RPDR effectively quantifies these declines. Attribute-wise biases emerge despite unbiased design, with patterns resembling real-world image data.

Conclusion: Spatial457 enables scalable, unbiased assessment of 6D spatial reasoning in LMMs, highlights specific weaknesses in 3D/6D tasks, and provides a practical metric (RPDR) to track degradation; resources are publicly released for community use.

Abstract: Although large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual scene interpretation and reasoning, their capacity for
complex and precise 3-dimensional spatial reasoning remains uncertain. Existing
benchmarks focus predominantly on 2D spatial understanding and lack a framework
to comprehensively evaluate 6D spatial reasoning across varying complexities.
To address this limitation, we present Spatial457, a scalable and unbiased
synthetic dataset designed with 4 key capability for spatial reasoning:
multi-object recognition, 2D location, 3D location, and 3D orientation. We
develop a cascading evaluation structure, constructing 7 question types across
5 difficulty levels that range from basic single object recognition to our new
proposed complex 6D spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluated various large
multimodal models (LMMs) on PulseCheck457, observing a general decline in
performance as task complexity increases, particularly in 3D reasoning and 6D
spatial tasks. To quantify these challenges, we introduce the Relative
Performance Dropping Rate (RPDR), highlighting key weaknesses in 3D reasoning
capabilities. Leveraging the unbiased attribute design of our dataset, we also
uncover prediction biases across different attributes, with similar patterns
observed in real-world image settings. The code and data are released in

*Joshua Li,Brendan Chharawala,Chang Shu,Xue Bin Peng,Pengcheng Xi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHARE uses monocular RGB video from a stationary camera to jointly reconstruct 3D humans and surrounding scenes by grounding human motion to the scene geometry, improving 3D placement over prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current human motion reconstruction often fails to accurately place humans in 3D space with respect to the surrounding scene, limiting realistic interactions in gaming, AR/VR, robotics, and film. A scene-grounded, monocular approach could enable more faithful reconstructions using readily available video.

Method: Estimate per-frame human meshes and segmentation masks; generate a scene point map at keyframes; iteratively refine keyframe human positions by matching the human mesh to the scene point map projected from the mask; enforce temporal consistency by preserving non-keyframe root joint positions relative to keyframe roots during optimization.

Result: SHARE outperforms existing methods on both curated datasets and in-the-wild web videos, demonstrating more accurate 3D placement of humans within their environments.

Conclusion: Scene-grounded reconstruction of humans and environments from monocular video improves 3D placement accuracy and enables more realistic interactions in downstream applications.

Abstract: Animating realistic character interactions with the surrounding environment
is important for autonomous agents in gaming, AR/VR, and robotics. However,
current methods for human motion reconstruction struggle with accurately
placing humans in 3D space. We introduce Scene-Human Aligned REconstruction
(SHARE), a technique that leverages the scene geometry's inherent spatial cues
to accurately ground human motion reconstruction. Each reconstruction relies
solely on a monocular RGB video from a stationary camera. SHARE first estimates
a human mesh and segmentation mask for every frame, alongside a scene point map
at keyframes. It iteratively refines the human's positions at these keyframes
by comparing the human mesh against the human point map extracted from the
scene using the mask. Crucially, we also ensure that non-keyframe human meshes
remain consistent by preserving their relative root joint positions to keyframe
root joints during optimization. Our approach enables more accurate 3D human
placement while reconstructing the surrounding scene, facilitating use cases on
both curated datasets and in-the-wild web videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SHARE outperforms existing methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cortical-SSM extends deep state-space models to jointly learn temporal, spatial, and frequency dependencies in MI EEG/ECoG signals, outperforming baselines on two large public MI EEG datasets (>50 subjects) and a clinical MI ECoG dataset from an ALS patient, with interpretable neurophysiological explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG/ECoG motor imagery (MI) classification is hindered by physiological artifacts and the challenge of capturing integrated dependencies across time, space, and frequency. While Transformers are popular, they may miss fine-grained, multi-domain interactions; a model that unifies temporal-spatial-frequency structure could improve accuracy and interpretability.

Method: Introduce Cortical-SSM, a deep state-space model architecture that extends to capture integrated dependencies in temporal, spatial, and spectral domains for MI EEG/ECoG signals. Evaluation on two large-scale MI EEG datasets and a clinical MI ECoG dataset (ALS patient), with qualitative visual explanations to show neurophysiologically relevant regions.

Result: Cortical-SSM outperforms baseline methods across all three benchmarks. Visual explanations indicate the model captures neurophysiologically meaningful brain regions in both EEG and ECoG signals.

Conclusion: The proposed Cortical-SSM effectively integrates multi-domain dependencies in MI EEG/ECoG data, yielding superior classification performance and interpretable neurophysiological insights, with potential benefits for communication aids and rehabilitation.

Abstract: Classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticogram (ECoG)
signals obtained during motor imagery (MI) has substantial application
potential, including for communication assistance and rehabilitation support
for patients with motor impairments. These signals remain inherently
susceptible to physiological artifacts (e.g., eye blinking, swallowing), which
pose persistent challenges. Although Transformer-based approaches for
classifying EEG and ECoG signals have been widely adopted, they often struggle
to capture fine-grained dependencies within them. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Cortical-SSM, a novel architecture that extends deep
state space models to capture integrated dependencies of EEG and ECoG signals
across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. We validated our method across
three benchmarks: 1) two large-scale public MI EEG datasets containing more
than 50 subjects, and 2) a clinical MI ECoG dataset recorded from a patient
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our method outperformed baseline methods on
the three benchmarks. Furthermore, visual explanations derived from our model
indicate that it effectively captures neurophysiologically relevant regions of
both EEG and ECoG signals.

*Ana Davila,Jacinto Colan,Yasuhisa Hasegawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A staged adaptive fine-tuning method with linear probing and gradual freezing improves surgical tool detection under limited labeled data, achieving high mAP and generalizing across surgical domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the challenge of scarce annotated data in surgical settings for robust deep learning-based tool detection; reduce model complexity and training iterations while maintaining performance.

Method: Two-stage fine-tuning: (1) linear probing to condition extra classification layers on a pre-trained CNN (ResNet-50 or DenseNet-121); (2) gradual freezing to dynamically reduce the number of fine-tuned layers during training, within a single training loop.

Result: On Cholec80 (cholecystectomy endoscopic videos, CNNs pre-trained on ImageNet): mAP 96.4%, outperforming existing approaches and standard fine-tuning; demonstrated generalizability to CATARACTS dataset (ophthalmic surgery).

Conclusion: Gradual freezing fine-tuning is effective for surgical tool presence detection and may generalize to other image classification tasks, offering efficiency gains via a single-loop training process and reduced network complexity.

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery can benefit significantly from automated surgical
tool detection, enabling advanced analysis and assistance. However, the limited
availability of annotated data in surgical settings poses a challenge for
training robust deep learning models. This paper introduces a novel staged
adaptive fine-tuning approach consisting of two steps: a linear probing stage
to condition additional classification layers on a pre-trained CNN-based
architecture and a gradual freezing stage to dynamically reduce the
fine-tunable layers, aiming to regulate adaptation to the surgical domain. This
strategy reduces network complexity and improves efficiency, requiring only a
single training loop and eliminating the need for multiple iterations. We
validated our method on the Cholec80 dataset, employing CNN architectures
(ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121) pre-trained on ImageNet for detecting surgical
tools in cholecystectomy endoscopic videos. Our results demonstrate that our
method improves detection performance compared to existing approaches and
established fine-tuning techniques, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of
96.4%. To assess its broader applicability, the generalizability of the
fine-tuning strategy was further confirmed on the CATARACTS dataset, a distinct
domain of minimally invasive ophthalmic surgery. These findings suggest that
gradual freezing fine-tuning is a promising technique for improving tool
presence detection in diverse surgical procedures and may have broader
applications in general image classification tasks.

*Haisheng Su,Junjie Zhang,Feixiang Song,Sanping Zhou,Wei Wu,Nanning Zheng,Junchi Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Frequency-aware Positional Depth Embedding (FreqPDE) for 3D detection from multi-view 2D images, combining three modules—FSPE, CSDP, and PDE—with hybrid depth supervision to improve depth-aware feature learning; validated by nuScenes experiments demonstrating superior performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multi-view 3D detection approaches rely on depth prediction with limited supervision and often use high-level image features, resulting in depth discontinuities at object boundaries, missed small objects, and neglect of cross-view consistency and scale invariance. This work aims to enrich 2D features with accurate, cross-view depth information and robust depth supervision to enhance 3D query decoding.

Method: Three modules: 1) Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder (FSPE) builds a feature pyramid by fusing high-frequency edge cues with low-frequency semantics across levels; 2) Cross-view Scale-invariant Depth Predictor (CSDP) estimates pixel-level depth distribution using cross-view cues and efficient channel attention; 3) Positional Depth Encoder (PDE) combines 2D features with 3D position embeddings to produce depth-aware features for the 3D detection transformer decoder. The approach also employs hybrid depth supervision from metric and distribution perspectives to guide depth learning.

Result: Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that the proposed method effectively improves depth-aware feature learning and yields superior 3D detection performance compared to prior methods, demonstrating robustness to depth prediction challenges.

Conclusion: FreqPDE provides a novel, effective framework for depth-aware 3D detection from multi-view images by integrating frequency-aware feature encoding, cross-view depth prediction, and 3D positional embedding, with hybrid supervision guiding depth learning and achieving strong empirical results on nuScenes.

Abstract: Detecting 3D objects accurately from multi-view 2D images is a challenging
yet essential task in the field of autonomous driving. Current methods resort
to integrating depth prediction to recover the spatial information for object
query decoding, which necessitates explicit supervision from LiDAR points
during the training phase. However, the predicted depth quality is still
unsatisfactory such as depth discontinuity of object boundaries and
indistinction of small objects, which are mainly caused by the sparse
supervision of projected points and the use of high-level image features for
depth prediction. Besides, cross-view consistency and scale invariance are also
overlooked in previous methods. In this paper, we introduce Frequency-aware
Positional Depth Embedding (FreqPDE) to equip 2D image features with spatial
information for 3D detection transformer decoder, which can be obtained through
three main modules. Specifically, the Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder
(FSPE) constructs a feature pyramid by combining high-frequency edge clues and
low-frequency semantics from different levels respectively. Then the Cross-view
Scale-invariant Depth Predictor (CSDP) estimates the pixel-level depth
distribution with cross-view and efficient channel attention mechanism.
Finally, the Positional Depth Encoder (PDE) combines the 2D image features and
3D position embeddings to generate the 3D depth-aware features for query
decoding. Additionally, hybrid depth supervision is adopted for complementary
depth learning from both metric and distribution aspects. Extensive experiments
conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority
of our proposed method.

*Ting-Yu Yen,Yu-Sheng Chiu,Shih-Hsuan Hung,Peter Wonka,Hung-Kuo Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pose-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (PFGS) reconstructs complete objects from multi-pose captures by iteratively fusing auxiliary views into a main-pose 3DGS using global+local registration and foundation-model-assisted cross-pose alignment, achieving higher fidelity than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting methods assume a single static pose, leading to incomplete reconstructions that miss occluded/self-occluded regions. There is a practical need to integrate multi-pose multi-view captures to obtain complete 3D representations.

Method: PFGS iteratively fuses auxiliary pose image sets into a unified 3DGS representation of a main pose. It uses a pose-aware fusion strategy combining global and local registration to merge views. It enhances registration by using background features for per-pose camera pose estimation and leverages foundation models for cross-pose registration to mitigate background inconsistency.

Result: Experimental results show that PFGS consistently outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, yielding more complete reconstructions and higher-fidelity 3DGS models.

Conclusion: Pose-aware fusion with global+local registration and foundation-model-assisted cross-pose alignment enables effective reconstruction of complete objects from multi-pose captures, improving 3DGS fidelity and completeness over existing methods.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled high-quality,
real-time novel-view synthesis from multi-view images. However, most existing
methods assume the object is captured in a single, static pose, resulting in
incomplete reconstructions that miss occluded or self-occluded regions. We
introduce PFGS, a pose-aware 3DGS framework that addresses the practical
challenge of reconstructing complete objects from multi-pose image captures.
Given images of an object in one main pose and several auxiliary poses, PFGS
iteratively fuses each auxiliary set into a unified 3DGS representation of the
main pose. Our pose-aware fusion strategy combines global and local
registration to merge views effectively and refine the 3DGS model. While recent
advances in 3D foundation models have improved registration robustness and
efficiency, they remain limited by high memory demands and suboptimal accuracy.
PFGS overcomes these challenges by incorporating them more intelligently into
the registration process: it leverages background features for per-pose camera
pose estimation and employs foundation models for cross-pose registration. This
design captures the best of both approaches while resolving background
inconsistency issues. Experimental results demonstrate that PFGS consistently
outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
producing more complete reconstructions and higher-fidelity 3DGS models.

### [39] [LILAC: Long-sequence Incremental Low-latency Arbitrary Motion Stylization via Streaming VAE-Diffusion with Causal Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15392)
*Peng Ren,Hai Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LILAC enables real-time long-sequence arbitrary motion stylization by streaming latent-space VAE-Diffusion with a causal, sliding-window design and decoded-motion feature injections, extending offline methods to online use without changing the diffusion model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between high-quality, offline latent-space diffusion-based stylization and the need for online, real-time long-sequence motion control; streaming in raw motion space is expensive and unstable.

Method: A latent-space streaming architecture with a sliding-window causal decoder, injecting decoded motion features to ensure smooth transitions; builds on a strong offline VAE-Diffusion stylization framework without altering the diffusion model itself.

Result: Shows a favorable balance between stylization quality and responsiveness on benchmark datasets; capable of long-sequence real-time stylization; supplementary materials available for demonstration.

Conclusion: LILAC successfully bridges offline high-quality arbitrary motion stylization with online real-time requirements, enabling long-sequence, low-latency stylization without future-frame reliance or diffusion-model modification.

Abstract: Generating long and stylized human motions in real time is critical for
applications that demand continuous and responsive character control. Despite
its importance, existing streaming approaches often operate directly in the raw
motion space, leading to substantial computational overhead and making it
difficult to maintain temporal stability. In contrast, latent-space
VAE-Diffusion-based frameworks alleviate these issues and achieve high-quality
stylization, but they are generally confined to offline processing. To bridge
this gap, LILAC (Long-sequence Incremental Low-latency Arbitrary Motion
Stylization via Streaming VAE-Diffusion with Causal Decoding) builds upon a
recent high-performing offline framework for arbitrary motion stylization and
extends it to an online setting through a latent-space streaming architecture
with a sliding-window causal design and the injection of decoded motion
features to ensure smooth motion transitions. This architecture enables
long-sequence real-time arbitrary stylization without relying on future frames
or modifying the diffusion model architecture, achieving a favorable balance
between stylization quality and responsiveness as demonstrated by experiments
on benchmark datasets. Supplementary video and examples are available at the

### [40] [MARIS: Marine Open-Vocabulary Instance Segmentation with Geometric Enhancement and Semantic Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15398)
*Bingyu Li,Feiyu Wang,Da Zhang,Zhiyuan Zhao,Junyu Gao,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new underwater open-vocabulary instance segmentation benchmark MARIS is introduced, along with a unified framework using Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (GPEM) and Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (SAIM). It addresses color degradation and semantic misalignment to improve recognition of unseen categories, outperforming existing OV baselines in-domain and cross-domain on MARIS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable open-vocabulary instance segmentation in underwater environments, where transfer from natural-image OV models suffers from color attenuation, degraded visuals, and lack of underwater class definitions.

Method: A unified framework with two components: (1) Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (GPEM) leveraging stable part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded visuals; (2) Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (SAIM) enriching language embeddings with domain-specific priors to mitigate semantic ambiguity for unseen categories.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms existing open-vocabulary baselines on MARIS, in both in-domain and cross-domain evaluations.

Conclusion: This work establishes a strong foundation for underwater perception with open-vocabulary capabilities and provides a benchmark and a robust method to handle domain-specific visual and semantic challenges.

Abstract: Most existing underwater instance segmentation approaches are constrained by
close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel marine
categories. To support evaluation, we introduce \textbf{MARIS}
(\underline{Mar}ine Open-Vocabulary \underline{I}nstance
\underline{S}egmentation), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark for
underwater Open-Vocabulary (OV) segmentation, featuring a limited set of seen
categories and diverse unseen categories. Although OV segmentation has shown
promise on natural images, our analysis reveals that transfer to underwater
scenes suffers from severe visual degradation (e.g., color attenuation) and
semantic misalignment caused by lack underwater class definitions. To address
these issues, we propose a unified framework with two complementary components.
The Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (\textbf{GPEM}) leverages stable
part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded
visual conditions. The Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (\textbf{SAIM})
enriches language embeddings with domain-specific priors, mitigating semantic
ambiguity and improving recognition of unseen categories. Experiments show that
our framework consistently outperforms existing OV baselines both In-Domain and
Cross-Domain setting on MARIS, establishing a strong foundation for future
underwater perception research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Physics-informed, synthetic-data-driven LoSP-Prompt enables high-resolution multi-shot DWI across organs by modeling inter-shot phase as Locally Smooth Phase within a low-rank Hankel framework; auto-tuned rank via synthetic prompts; shows superior image quality and generalizability across organs and scanners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion artifacts severely limit multi-shot DWI for body imaging; improving reconstruction can enhance lesion detection and precision oncology.

Method: Model inter-shot phase with high-order Locally Smooth Phase, integrate into low-rank Hankel reconstruction; auto-set rank via prompt learning trained on synthetic abdominal motion; navigator-free, scanner-agnostic; validated on 10k+ clinical images across 43 subjects, 4 scanners, 5 centers; supports seven anatomical regions.

Result: LoSP-Prompt achieves ~2x spatial resolution vs clinical single-shot DWI; generalizes to seven regions with a single model; outperforms state-of-the-art across image quality, artifact suppression, and noise reduction; radiologists rated improvements up to 4-5 on a 5-point scale; eliminates navigator signals.

Conclusion: Promising, robust, interpretable solution with potential to transform body-wide DWI in precision oncology, enabling higher-resolution imaging without real-time navigators and across multiple scanners and organs.

Abstract: Clinical adoption of multi-shot diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
(multi-shot DWI) for body-wide tumor diagnostics is limited by severe
motion-induced phase artifacts from respiration, peristalsis, and so on,
compounded by multi-organ, multi-slice, multi-direction and multi-b-value
complexities. Here, we introduce a reconstruction framework, LoSP-Prompt, that
overcomes these challenges through physics-informed modeling and
synthetic-data-driven prompt learning. We model inter-shot phase variations as
a high-order Locally Smooth Phase (LoSP), integrated into a low-rank Hankel
matrix reconstruction. Crucially, the algorithm's rank parameter is
automatically set via prompt learning trained exclusively on synthetic
abdominal DWI data emulating physiological motion. Validated across 10,000+
clinical images (43 subjects, 4 scanner models, 5 centers), LoSP-Prompt: (1)
Achieved twice the spatial resolution of clinical single-shot DWI, enhancing
liver lesion conspicuity; (2) Generalized to seven diverse anatomical regions
(liver, kidney, sacroiliac, pelvis, knee, spinal cord, brain) with a single
model; (3) Outperformed state-of-the-art methods in image quality, artifact
suppression, and noise reduction (11 radiologists' evaluations on a 5-point
scale, $p<0.05$), achieving 4-5 points (excellent) on kidney DWI, 4 points
(good to excellent) on liver, sacroiliac and spinal cord DWI, and 3-4 points
(good) on knee and tumor brain. The approach eliminates navigator signals and
realistic data supervision, providing an interpretable, robust solution for
high-resolution multi-organ multi-shot DWI. Its scanner-agnostic performance
signifies transformative potential for precision oncology.

*Shuang Liang,Zhihao Xu,Jialing Tao,Hui Xue,Xiting Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A general Learning to Detect (LoD) framework improves detection of unseen jailbreak attacks on Large Vision-Language Models by shifting to task-specific learning, using a Multi-modal Safety Concept Activation Vector (S-CAV) module and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder for unsupervised attack classification, achieving higher AUROC and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreaks despite alignment; existing detectors either train attack-specific parameters with poor generalization or rely on heuristics that are limited in accuracy and efficiency.

Method: Propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a general framework for detecting unknown jailbreak attacks. It comprises (1) a Multi-modal Safety Concept Activation Vector (S-CAV) module for safety-oriented representation learning and (2) a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder module for unsupervised attack classification, shifting focus from attack-specific learning to task-specific learning.

Result: Experiments show consistently higher detection AUROC on diverse unknown attacks and improved efficiency compared to baselines; code is released.

Conclusion: LoD provides a generalizable, efficient solution for unknown jailbreak detection in LVLMs, enhancing safety against unseen attacks with practical applicability.

Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, posing serious safety risks. To address
this, existing detection methods either learn attack-specific parameters, which
hinders generalization to unseen attacks, or rely on heuristically sound
principles, which limit accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a general framework that accurately
detects unknown jailbreak attacks by shifting the focus from attack-specific
learning to task-specific learning. This framework includes a Multi-modal
Safety Concept Activation Vector module for safety-oriented representation
learning and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder module for unsupervised attack
classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
consistently higher detection AUROC on diverse unknown attacks while improving
efficiency. The code is available at

*Huan Chen,Ting Han,Siyu Chen,Zhihao Guo,Yiping Chen,Meiliu Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semantic4Safety derives 11 streetscape indicators from street-view imagery and uses predictive modeling plus causal inference to reveal accident-type–specific patterns and guide interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need to quantify how street features relate to accident risk and to estimate causal effects across accident types using scalable, interpretable indicators from imagery.

Method: Use zero-shot semantic segmentation on street-view images to obtain 11 indicators; incorporate road type as context; train an XGBoost multi-class classifier; interpret via SHAP for global/local feature contributions; apply GPS weighting and ATE estimation to control confounding and quantify causal effects.

Result: Reveals heterogeneous, accident-type-specific causal patterns; scene complexity, exposure, and roadway geometry dominate predictive power; larger drivable area and emergency space reduce risk; excessive visual openness can increase risk.

Conclusion: Bridges predictive modeling with causal inference to support targeted interventions and high-risk corridor diagnosis, offering a scalable, data-informed tool for urban road safety planning.

Abstract: Street-view imagery (SVI) offers a fine-grained lens on traffic risk, yet two
fundamental challenges persist: (1) how to construct street-level indicators
that capture accident-related features, and (2) how to quantify their causal
impacts across different accident types. To address these challenges, we
propose Semantic4Safety, a framework that applies zero-shot semantic
segmentation to SVIs to derive 11 interpretable streetscape indicators, and
integrates road type as contextual information to analyze approximately 30,000
accident records in Austin. Specifically, we train an eXtreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) multi-class classifier and use Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)
to interpret both global and local feature contributions, and then apply
Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) weighting and Average Treatment Effect (ATE)
estimation to control confounding and quantify causal effects. Results uncover
heterogeneous, accident-type-specific causal patterns: features capturing scene
complexity, exposure, and roadway geometry dominate predictive power; larger
drivable area and emergency space reduce risk, whereas excessive visual
openness can increase it. By bridging predictive modeling with causal
inference, Semantic4Safety supports targeted interventions and high-risk
corridor diagnosis, offering a scalable, data-informed tool for urban road
safety planning.

### [44] [Rethinking Convergence in Deep Learning: The Predictive-Corrective Paradigm for Anatomy-Informed Brain MRI Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15439)
*Feifei Zhang,Zhenhong Jia,Sensen Song,Fei Shi,Dayong Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Predictive-Corrective (PC) paradigm decouples learning to speed up training in data-scarce domains. PCMambaNet uses a Predictive Prior Module (PPM) based on bilateral symmetry to produce a coarse focus map, and a Corrective Residual Network (CRN) to refine residuals, achieving state-of-the-art brain MRI segmentation with rapid convergence (1–5 epochs) and reduced overfitting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end deep learning often suffers from slow convergence and heavy data requirements, which is especially problematic in medical imaging where labeled data are scarce. A framework that leverages domain knowledge to simplify the learning objective could improve data efficiency, generalization, and convergence speed.

Method: Introduce Predictive-Corrective (PC) paradigm with two modules. The Predictive Prior Module (PPM) generates a coarse, low-cost prediction by leveraging anatomical knowledge (bilateral symmetry) to produce a 'focus map' highlighting asymmetric regions of diagnostic relevance. The Corrective Residual Network (CRN) models the residual error, concentrating full capacity on refining these difficult regions and delineating precise pathology boundaries. The model is evaluated on high-resolution brain MRI segmentation.

Result: PCMambaNet achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy while converging within 1–5 epochs, a level of training efficiency unattainable by traditional end-to-end models, demonstrating improved data efficiency and reduced risk of overfitting.

Conclusion: Explicitly incorporating domain knowledge to simplify the learning objective within a predictive-corrective framework can dramatically accelerate training and improve performance in data-scarce domains, with PCMambaNet representing a generalizable approach for other tasks where prior knowledge can guide focused modeling.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the end-to-end paradigm in deep learning,
it often suffers from slow convergence and heavy reliance on large-scale
datasets, which fundamentally limits its efficiency and applicability in
data-scarce domains such as medical imaging. In this work, we introduce the
Predictive-Corrective (PC) paradigm, a framework that decouples the modeling
task to fundamentally accelerate learning. Building upon this paradigm, we
propose a novel network, termed PCMambaNet. PCMambaNet is composed of two
synergistic modules. First, the Predictive Prior Module (PPM) generates a
coarse approximation at low computational cost, thereby anchoring the search
space. Specifically, the PPM leverages anatomical knowledge-bilateral
symmetry-to predict a 'focus map' of diagnostically relevant asymmetric
regions. Next, the Corrective Residual Network (CRN) learns to model the
residual error, focusing the network's full capacity on refining these
challenging regions and delineating precise pathological boundaries. Extensive
experiments on high-resolution brain MRI segmentation demonstrate that
PCMambaNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while converging within only 1-5
epochs-a performance unattainable by conventional end-to-end models. This
dramatic acceleration highlights that by explicitly incorporating domain
knowledge to simplify the learning objective, PCMambaNet effectively mitigates
data inefficiency and overfitting.

### [45] [Select Less, Reason More: Prioritizing Evidence Purity for Video Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15440)
*Xuchen Li,Xuzhao Li,Shiyu Hu,Kaiqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new EARL framework for Video LLMs uses evidence-aware reinforcement learning to selectively sample key frames and re-sample locally around them, achieving state-of-the-art results among open-source Video LLMs on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-form video reasoning suffers from information dilution due to uniform frame sampling; current pixel-space agents lack rigorous evidence-purity rewards and temporal augmentation beyond pre-sampled frames.

Method: Introduce EARL: dynamic frame selection and localized re-sampling around key frames, guided by evidence-purity rewards, turning the model into an active interrogator of evidence.

Result: SOTA among open-source Video LLMs on five video reasoning benchmarks; 7B model achieves 59.8% LongVideoBench, 69.0% MVBench, 64.9% VideoMME.

Conclusion: Prioritizing evidence purity and adaptive frame-level reasoning yields better long-form video understanding; supports the 'Select Less, Reason More' philosophy.

Abstract: Long-form video reasoning remains a major challenge for Video Large Language
Models (Video LLMs), as static uniform frame sampling leads to information
dilution and obscures critical evidence. Furthermore, existing pixel-space
video reasoning agents, which are designed to actively interact with the video
to acquire new visual information, remain suboptimal due to their lack of
rigorous reward mechanisms to enforce evidence purity and their inability to
perform temporal information supplementation beyond pre-sampled frames. To
address this critical gap, we propose a novel evidence-prioritized adaptive
framework built upon our core philosophy: "Select Less, Reason More." Our core
contribution is the evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework,
which transforms the model into an active interrogator of evidence. EARL is
precisely engineered to dynamically select the most relevant frames and,
crucially, to perform localized re-sampling around the selected key frames to
access fine-grained temporal detail. Extensive experiments on five demanding
video reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our EARL-trained model achieves new
state-of-the-art among open-source Video LLMs, simultaneously learning an
effective and high-purity visual evidence selection policy. Impressively, our
7B model achieves 59.8% on LongVideoBench, 69.0% on MVBench and 64.9% on
VideoMME. These results highlight the importance of prioritizing evidence
purity and the effectiveness of our framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAVR-Net: a multi-view MAV action recognition framework that fuses RGB, optical flow, and segmentation masks with cross-view attention and alignment loss to boost recognition, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on MAV datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-based MAV action recognition struggles to capture the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of micro aerial vehicle motion; leveraging multiple complementary data sources can improve robustness and discriminative power.

Method: Three ResNet-based encoders process RGB frames, optical flow, and segmentation masks. A multi-scale feature pyramid preserves spatiotemporal details. A cross-view attention module models dependencies across modalities and scales. A multi-view alignment loss enforces semantic consistency across views.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches, achieving 97.8% on Short MAV, 96.5% on Medium MAV, and 92.8% on Long MAV datasets.

Conclusion: Multi-view fusion with cross-view attention and alignment loss significantly enhances MAV action recognition accuracy and robustness, demonstrating the effectiveness of MAVR-Net for autonomous aerial swarms.

Abstract: Recognizing the motion of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) is crucial for
enabling cooperative perception and control in autonomous aerial swarms. Yet,
vision-based recognition models relying only on RGB data often fail to capture
the complex spatial temporal characteristics of MAV motion, which limits their
ability to distinguish different actions. To overcome this problem, this paper
presents MAVR-Net, a multi-view learning-based MAV action recognition
framework. Unlike traditional single-view methods, the proposed approach
combines three complementary types of data, including raw RGB frames, optical
flow, and segmentation masks, to improve the robustness and accuracy of MAV
motion recognition. Specifically, ResNet-based encoders are used to extract
discriminative features from each view, and a multi-scale feature pyramid is
adopted to preserve the spatiotemporal details of MAV motion patterns. To
enhance the interaction between different views, a cross-view attention module
is introduced to model the dependencies among various modalities and feature
scales. In addition, a multi-view alignment loss is designed to ensure semantic
consistency and strengthen cross-view feature representations. Experimental
results on benchmark MAV action datasets show that our method clearly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving 97.8\%, 96.5\%, and 92.8\% accuracy
on the Short MAV, Medium MAV, and Long MAV datasets, respectively.

*Zhiqiang Zhu,Xinbo Gao,Wen Lu,Jie Li,Zhaoyang Wang,Mingqian Ge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPTrack is a prompt-based nighttime aerial tracker that uses topology-aware features and a directional kernel to generate precise prompts, enabling robust target localization in the dark and showing superior benchmark performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current nighttime trackers using prompt learning rely only on spatial supervision, leading to vague prompts and weak focus on object features; there is a need for fine-grained, attribute-level cues to improve tracking accuracy in low-light aerial scenarios.

Method: The approach hierarchically captures the object's topological structure to create topology-aware features, encodes them into a directional kernel via an encoder, and uses a kernel-guided prompt module with channel–category correspondence to propagate the kernel across the search region features, incorporating spatial gating for robustness.

Result: Extensive evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate DPTrack's superior performance for nighttime aerial tracking.

Conclusion: DPTrack effectively injects fine-grained, topology-informed cues into the prompt-generation process through a directional kernel and kernel-guided propagation, achieving robust nighttime tracking and offering a reproducible codebase.

Abstract: Existing nighttime aerial trackers based on prompt learning rely solely on
spatial localization supervision, which fails to provide fine-grained cues that
point to target features and inevitably produces vague prompts. This limitation
impairs the tracker's ability to accurately focus on the object features and
results in trackers still performing poorly. To address this issue, we propose
DPTrack, a prompt-based aerial tracker designed for nighttime scenarios by
encoding the given object's attribute features into the directional kernel
enriched with fine-grained cues to generate precise prompts. Specifically,
drawing inspiration from visual bionics, DPTrack first hierarchically captures
the object's topological structure, leveraging topological attributes to enrich
the feature representation. Subsequently, an encoder condenses these
topology-aware features into the directional kernel, which serves as the core
guidance signal that explicitly encapsulates the object's fine-grained
attribute cues. Finally, a kernel-guided prompt module built on
channel-category correspondence attributes propagates the kernel across the
features of the search region to pinpoint the positions of target features and
convert them into precise prompts, integrating spatial gating for robust
nighttime tracking. Extensive evaluations on established benchmarks demonstrate
DPTrack's superior performance. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/zzq-vipsl/DPTrack.

### [48] [Improving Micro-Expression Recognition with Phase-Aware Temporal Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15466)
*Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Luu Tu Nguyen,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A phase-aware temporal augmentation for micro-expression recognition using dual-phase dynamic images (onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset). This augmentation, model-agnostic and simple, improves recognition by enriching motion cues in low-resource MER tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MER datasets are scarce and imbalanced, which limits generalization and motion diversity. Existing work mostly uses spatial augmentations and ignores temporal augmentation strategies that exploit motion dynamics.

Method: Split each expression sequence into two phases (onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset), generate a separate dynamic image for each phase, and use these dual-phase DIs as augmentation to enrich temporal motion cues. The approach is model-agnostic and combines with spatial augmentations.

Result: Consistent improvements in recognition accuracy, unweighted F1-score, and unweighted average recall across six architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformer, LEARNet) on CASME-II and SAMM. When combined with spatial augmentations, up to ~10% relative improvement.

Conclusion: Phase-aware dual-phase dynamic image augmentation is simple, effective in low-resource MER settings, and offers a robust, generalizable direction for micro-expression recognition.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal
genuine emotions, typically lasting less than half a second. Recognizing these
subtle expressions is critical for applications in psychology, security, and
behavioral analysis. Although deep learning has enabled significant advances in
micro-expression recognition (MER), its effectiveness is limited by the
scarcity of annotated ME datasets. This data limitation not only hinders
generalization but also restricts the diversity of motion patterns captured
during training. Existing MER studies predominantly rely on simple spatial
augmentations (e.g., flipping, rotation) and overlook temporal augmentation
strategies that can better exploit motion characteristics. To address this gap,
this paper proposes a phase-aware temporal augmentation method based on dynamic
image. Rather than encoding the entire expression as a single onset-to-offset
dynamic image (DI), our approach decomposes each expression sequence into two
motion phases: onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset. A separate DI is generated for
each phase, forming a Dual-phase DI augmentation strategy. These phase-specific
representations enrich motion diversity and introduce complementary temporal
cues that are crucial for recognizing subtle facial transitions. Extensive
experiments on CASME-II and SAMM datasets using six deep architectures,
including CNNs, Vision Transformer, and the lightweight LEARNet, demonstrate
consistent performance improvements in recognition accuracy, unweighted
F1-score, and unweighted average recall, which are crucial for addressing class
imbalance in MER. When combined with spatial augmentations, our method achieves
up to a 10\% relative improvement. The proposed augmentation is simple,
model-agnostic, and effective in low-resource settings, offering a promising
direction for robust and generalizable MER.

*Lingfeng Xuan,Chang Nie,Yiqing Xu,Zhe Liu,Yanzi Miao,Hesheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRASfM is a multi-camera SfM framework for driving scenes that improves pose reliability, cleans road-plane outliers, reduces BA variables by treating the multi-camera rig as a unit, and enables multi-scene aggregation; achieves state-of-the-art results (0.124 m APE on nuScenes).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Driving scenes captured by multi-camera systems suffer from unreliable camera pose estimation, numerous foreground road-plane outliers in reconstruction, and low computational efficiency in traditional SfM pipelines. A robust, efficient multi-camera SfM framework tailored for driving applications is needed.

Method: MRASfM leverages fixed spatial relationships within the multi-camera rig during registration to stabilize pose estimation; uses a plane model to filter erroneous road-plane points; aggregates multi-camera rigs in Bundle Adjustment to reduce optimization variables; conducts multi-scene aggregation via coarse-to-fine scene association and assembly modules.

Result: Validated on real vehicles and large public datasets; demonstrates generalizability across scenes and robustness in challenging conditions; achieves 0.124 absolute pose error on the nuScenes dataset, indicating state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: MRASfM enhances pose reliability, improves road-surface quality by removing outliers, and boosts efficiency through rig-level BA; it supports robust multi-scene reconstruction in driving scenarios and generalizes across datasets.

Abstract: Structure from Motion (SfM) estimates camera poses and reconstructs point
clouds, forming a foundation for various tasks. However, applying SfM to
driving scenes captured by multi-camera systems presents significant
difficulties, including unreliable pose estimation, excessive outliers in road
surface reconstruction, and low reconstruction efficiency. To address these
limitations, we propose a Multi-camera Reconstruction and Aggregation
Structure-from-Motion (MRASfM) framework specifically designed for driving
scenes. MRASfM enhances the reliability of camera pose estimation by leveraging
the fixed spatial relationships within the multi-camera system during the
registration process. To improve the quality of road surface reconstruction,
our framework employs a plane model to effectively remove erroneous points from
the triangulated road surface. Moreover, treating the multi-camera set as a
single unit in Bundle Adjustment (BA) helps reduce optimization variables to
boost efficiency. In addition, MRASfM achieves multi-scene aggregation through
scene association and assembly modules in a coarse-to-fine fashion. We deployed
multi-camera systems on actual vehicles to validate the generalizability of
MRASfM across various scenes and its robustness in challenging conditions
through real-world applications. Furthermore, large-scale validation results on
public datasets show the state-of-the-art performance of MRASfM, achieving
0.124 absolute pose error on the nuScenes dataset.

TL;DR: Introduces drone video-text retrieval (DVTR) and a new method, Multi-Semantic Adaptive Mining (MSAM), to better align drone videos with text. It uses adaptive semantic construction, distribution-driven and diversity semantic terms, along with cross-modal interactive pooling to focus on target regions. Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on two self-constructed drone datasets; code and data will be released.


<details>

Motivation: Drone videos generate massive data with overhead perspectives, strong structural homogeneity, and diverse semantic expressions, which challenge existing cross-modal methods designed for ground-level scenes. There is a need for retrieval mechanisms tailored to drone scenarios.

Method: Proposes MSAM, a multi-semantic adaptive learning framework. It captures dynamic frame-to-frame changes and extracts semantic information from scene regions. Features a fine-grained word-frame interaction, an adaptive semantic construction module, a distribution-driven semantic learning term, and a diversity semantic term to deepen cross-modal interactions. Introduces a cross-modal interactive feature fusion pooling mechanism that emphasizes target regions to reduce background noise.

Result: MSAM outperforms existing cross-modal methods on two self-constructed drone video-text datasets in the DVTR task.

Conclusion: MSAM advances drone video-text retrieval by enabling robust, region-focused, multi-semantic alignment between text and drone video content; source code and datasets will be publicly available.

Abstract: With the advancement of drone technology, the volume of video data increases
rapidly, creating an urgent need for efficient semantic retrieval. We are the
first to systematically propose and study the drone video-text retrieval (DVTR)
task. Drone videos feature overhead perspectives, strong structural
homogeneity, and diverse semantic expressions of target combinations, which
challenge existing cross-modal methods designed for ground-level views in
effectively modeling their characteristics. Therefore, dedicated retrieval
mechanisms tailored for drone scenarios are necessary. To address this issue,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-Semantic Adaptive Mining (MSAM). MSAM
introduces a multi-semantic adaptive learning mechanism, which incorporates
dynamic changes between frames and extracts rich semantic information from
specific scene regions, thereby enhancing the deep understanding and reasoning
of drone video content. This method relies on fine-grained interactions between
words and drone video frames, integrating an adaptive semantic construction
module, a distribution-driven semantic learning term and a diversity semantic
term to deepen the interaction between text and drone video modalities and
improve the robustness of feature representation. To reduce the interference of
complex backgrounds in drone videos, we introduce a cross-modal interactive
feature fusion pooling mechanism that focuses on feature extraction and
matching in target regions, minimizing noise effects. Extensive experiments on
two self-constructed drone video-text datasets show that MSAM outperforms other
existing methods in the drone video-text retrieval task. The source code and
dataset will be made publicly available.

### [51] [A Novel Combined Optical Flow Approach for Comprehensive Micro-Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15471)
*Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Thi Bich Phuong Man,Luu Tu Nguyen,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COF integrates onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset optical flows for facial micro-expression recognition, offering a more complete motion representation and improved MER performance on CASME II and SAMM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many MER methods relying on optical flow focus only on the onset-to-apex phase, missing potentially informative apex-to-offset dynamics; incorporating both phases could capture fuller temporal evolution of micro-expressions.

Method: Compute and combine optical flows from both onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset phases to form a Combined Optical Flow (COF) feature, then apply this to MER tasks.

Result: COF outperforms single-flow baselines on CASME II and SAMM, demonstrating improved capture of micro-expression dynamics and overall MER performance.

Conclusion: Integrating both temporal phases via COF yields a more comprehensive motion representation that enhances MER effectiveness.

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal
hidden emotions. Most Micro-Expression Recognition (MER) methods that rely on
optical flow typically focus on the onset-to-apex phase, neglecting the
apex-to-offset phase, which holds key temporal dynamics. This study introduces
a Combined Optical Flow (COF), integrating both phases to enhance feature
representation. COF provides a more comprehensive motion analysis, improving
MER performance. Experimental results on CASMEII and SAMM datasets show that
COF outperforms single optical flow-based methods, demonstrating its
effectiveness in capturing micro-expression dynamics.

### [52] [Iterative Motion Compensation for Canonical 3D Reconstruction from UAV Plant Images Captured in Windy Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15491)
*Andre Rochow,Jonas Marcic,Svetlana Seliunina,Sven Behnke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plant 3D phenotyping pipeline that autonomously captures UAV imagery (with ArUco markers), integrates arbitrary 3D reconstruction methods, and uses an iterative optical-flow-based deformation to compensate leaf motion, yielding high-resolution plant meshes; with open-source code and a multi-crop time-series dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D plant phenotyping is crucial for understanding growth, yield prediction, and disease control, but leaf motion under wind makes accurate 3D reconstruction challenging. An autonomous, reproducible pipeline can improve data quality and scalability.

Method: Use a small UAV with a self-developed Android app to autonomously capture images of individual plants, aided by ArUco markers. The pipeline is reconstruction-method agnostic and iteratively adjusts input images via deformation guided by optical flow between real images and renders from intermediate 3D reconstructions, aligning views to reduce motion and produce a canonical representation. After several iterations, existing state-of-the-art methods are enhanced and high-resolution meshes are extracted. The authors also plan to release source code and a dataset.

Result: The approach purportedly improves reconstructions after a few iterations and enables high-resolution 3D meshes; it is compatible with multiple reconstruction methods and will provide public code and a dataset.

Conclusion: An autonomous, motion-robust 3D reconstruction pipeline can augment state-of-the-art methods to produce accurate, high-resolution plant meshes, with open-source tools and time-series plant datasets to support further research.

Abstract: 3D phenotyping of plants plays a crucial role for understanding plant growth,
yield prediction, and disease control. We present a pipeline capable of
generating high-quality 3D reconstructions of individual agricultural plants.
To acquire data, a small commercially available UAV captures images of a
selected plant. Apart from placing ArUco markers, the entire image acquisition
process is fully autonomous, controlled by a self-developed Android application
running on the drone's controller. The reconstruction task is particularly
challenging due to environmental wind and downwash of the UAV. Our proposed
pipeline supports the integration of arbitrary state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction methods. To mitigate errors caused by leaf motion during image
capture, we use an iterative method that gradually adjusts the input images
through deformation. Motion is estimated using optical flow between the
original input images and intermediate 3D reconstructions rendered from the
corresponding viewpoints. This alignment gradually reduces scene motion,
resulting in a canonical representation. After a few iterations, our pipeline
improves the reconstruction of state-of-the-art methods and enables the
extraction of high-resolution 3D meshes. We will publicly release the source
code of our reconstruction pipeline. Additionally, we provide a dataset
consisting of multiple plants from various crops, captured across different
points in time.

### [53] [Rethinking Efficient Hierarchical Mixing Architecture for Low-light RAW Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15497)
*Xianmin Chen,Peiliang Huang,Longfei Han,Dingwen Zhang,Junwei Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight hierarchical architecture (HiMA) for efficient low-light RAW image enhancement that combines Transformer and Mamba modules, plus Local Distribution Adjustment (LoDA) and Multi-prior Fusion (MPF) to achieve state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light RAW enhancement requires both high visual quality and computational efficiency, and existing two-stage pipelines often struggle with local illumination variation and feature distribution handling.

Method: Propose HiMA, a hierarchical mixing architecture that leverages Transformer modules for large-scale features and Mamba modules for small-scale details. Introduce LoDA to adaptively align feature distributions across local regions with uneven illumination. Use MPF to fuse spatial and frequency-domain priors from denoised outputs for detail enhancement, forming an end-to-end efficient ISP framework.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters compared to existing methods; code will be released.

Conclusion: HiMA, together with LoDA and MPF, provides an efficient, high-quality solution for low-light RAW enhancement by leveraging cross-scale modeling and adaptive distribution alignment, with strong empirical performance and parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Low-light RAW image enhancement remains a challenging task. Although numerous
deep learning based approaches have been proposed, they still suffer from
inherent limitations. A key challenge is how to simultaneously achieve strong
enhancement quality and high efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
architecture for efficient low-light image signal processing (ISP) and
introduce a Hierarchical Mixing Architecture (HiMA). HiMA leverages the
complementary strengths of Transformer and Mamba modules to handle features at
large and small scales, respectively, thereby improving efficiency while
avoiding the ambiguities observed in prior two-stage frameworks. To further
address uneven illumination with strong local variations, we propose Local
Distribution Adjustment (LoDA), which adaptively aligns feature distributions
across different local regions. In addition, to fully exploit the denoised
outputs from the first stage, we design a Multi-prior Fusion (MPF) module that
integrates spatial and frequency-domain priors for detail enhancement.
Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance with
fewer parameters. Code will be released at https://github.com/Cynicarlos/HiMA.

### [54] [Latent Feature Alignment: Discovering Biased and Interpretable Subpopulations in Face Recognition Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15520)
*Ignacio Serna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Latent Feature Alignment (LFA) is an attribute-label-free method that identifies subpopulations in face recognition using latent directions, offering semantically coherent groups and interpretable demographic attributes, outperforming k-means and nearest-neighbor for intra-group coherence across multiple models and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional bias evaluation relies on labeled attributes, which are costly and limited; there is a need for scalable, label-free auditing to uncover biased subpopulations and interpret latent factors.

Method: LFA uses latent directions to align features and cluster in latent space to form semantically coherent subpopulations, discovering interpretable directions corresponding to attributes such as age, ethnicity, or attire. Evaluated on ArcFace, CosFace, ElasticFace, PartialFC across RFW and CelebA, comparing against k-means and nearest-neighbor search.

Result: LFA improves intra-group semantic coherence across all four models and two benchmarks, and uncovers interpretable latent directions aligned with demographic and contextual attributes, demonstrating practicality for representation auditing without predefined annotations.

Conclusion: LFA enables label-free discovery of bias subpopulations and interpretable factors, facilitating auditing and remediation of biases in face recognition models.

Abstract: Modern face recognition models achieve high overall accuracy but continue to
exhibit systematic biases that disproportionately affect certain
subpopulations. Conventional bias evaluation frameworks rely on labeled
attributes to form subpopulations, which are expensive to obtain and limited to
predefined categories. We introduce Latent Feature Alignment (LFA), an
attribute-label-free algorithm that uses latent directions to identify
subpopulations. This yields two main benefits over standard clustering: (i)
semantically coherent grouping, where faces sharing common attributes are
grouped together more reliably than by proximity-based methods, and (ii)
discovery of interpretable directions, which correspond to semantic attributes
such as age, ethnicity, or attire. Across four state-of-the-art recognition
models (ArcFace, CosFace, ElasticFace, PartialFC) and two benchmarks (RFW,
CelebA), LFA consistently outperforms k-means and nearest-neighbor search in
intra-group semantic coherence, while uncovering interpretable latent
directions aligned with demographic and contextual attributes. These results
position LFA as a practical method for representation auditing of face
recognition models, enabling practitioners to identify and interpret biased
subpopulations without predefined attribute annotations.

### [55] [Balanced Multi-Task Attention for Satellite Image Classification: A Systematic Approach to Achieving 97.23% Accuracy on EuroSAT Without Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15527)
*Aditya Vir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A satellite land-use classifier with a custom 12-layer CNN that integrates Coordinate Attention (spatial) and Squeeze-Excitation (spectral) via a learnable fusion parameter, achieving 97.23% EuroSAT test accuracy without pretraining and performing near-resnet-50-level performance while avoiding external data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome domain-specific challenges in satellite imagery, address overfitting and class confusion, and close the gap with pre-trained large models without using external data.

Method: Three progressive iterations (baseline, CBAM-enhanced, balanced multi-task attention). The core contribution is a balanced multi-task attention mechanism that fuses Coordinate Attention for spatial features with Squeeze-Excitation for spectral features through a learnable fusion parameter alpha (≈0.57). Training uses progressive DropBlock regularization (5–20% depth-based) and class-balanced loss weighting.

Result: Final 12-layer model achieves 97.23% test accuracy on EuroSAT, Cohen’s Kappa 0.9692, all classes >94.46% accuracy, and alpha converges near 0.57. Performance is within 1.34% of fine-tuned ResNet-50 (98.57%) without external data. 24.25% gap between correct and incorrect predictions indicates confidence calibration. Code, models, and evaluation scripts are publicly available.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that a systematically designed domain-specific architecture with a balanced multi-task attention mechanism can achieve near-state performance without pretraining, validating the integration of spatial and spectral cues for satellite imagery and underscoring the value of progressive architectural design and regularization for domain-specific tasks.

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation of custom convolutional neural
network architectures for satellite land use classification, achieving 97.23%
test accuracy on the EuroSAT dataset without reliance on pre-trained models.
Through three progressive architectural iterations (baseline: 94.30%,
CBAM-enhanced: 95.98%, and balanced multi-task attention: 97.23%) we identify
and address specific failure modes in satellite imagery classification. Our
principal contribution is a novel balanced multi-task attention mechanism that
combines Coordinate Attention for spatial feature extraction with
Squeeze-Excitation blocks for spectral feature extraction, unified through a
learnable fusion parameter. Experimental results demonstrate that this
learnable parameter autonomously converges to alpha approximately 0.57,
indicating near-equal importance of spatial and spectral modalities for
satellite imagery. We employ progressive DropBlock regularization (5-20% by
network depth) and class-balanced loss weighting to address overfitting and
confusion pattern imbalance. The final 12-layer architecture achieves Cohen's
Kappa of 0.9692 with all classes exceeding 94.46% accuracy, demonstrating
confidence calibration with a 24.25% gap between correct and incorrect
predictions. Our approach achieves performance within 1.34% of fine-tuned
ResNet-50 (98.57%) while requiring no external data, validating the efficacy of
systematic architectural design for domain-specific applications. Complete
code, trained models, and evaluation scripts are publicly available.

### [56] [Diffusion Bridge Networks Simulate Clinical-grade PET from MRI for Dementia Diagnostics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15556)
*Yitong Li,Ralph Buchert,Benita Schmitz-Koep,Timo Grimmer,Björn Ommer,Dennis M. Hedderich,Igor Yakushev,Christian Wachinger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SiM2P uses a 3D diffusion bridge to translate MRI and demographic data into simulated FDG-PET scans, improving diagnostic accuracy for dementias and enabling PET-like imaging in resource-limited settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FDG-PET provides valuable diagnostic information but is expensive and less accessible than MRI; a data-driven method to simulate PET from MRI could extend benefits to broader patient populations.

Method: A 3D diffusion bridge-based model learns a probabilistic mapping from MRI plus auxiliary information to FDG-PET images. Training and evaluation involved a blinded reader study with two neuroradiologists and two nuclear medicine physicians assessing original MRI and SiM2P-generated PET across Alzheimer's disease, behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia, and healthy controls. A practical deployment workflow uses as few as 20 site-specific cases.

Result: Diagnostic accuracy for differentiating the three groups improved from 75.0% (MRI alone) to 84.7% (SiM2P-simulated PET) with p<0.05. Simulated PET images yielded higher diagnostic certainty and better interrater agreement than MRI. Code is released at GitHub.

Conclusion: SiM2P makes FDG-PET diagnostic benefits more accessible, potentially enabling earlier detection and differential diagnosis in settings with limited PET access; the approach can be locally deployed with small datasets.

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is an
established tool in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected dementing
disorders. However, compared to the routinely available magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), FDG-PET remains significantly less accessible and substantially
more expensive. Here, we present SiM2P, a 3D diffusion bridge-based framework
that learns a probabilistic mapping from MRI and auxiliary patient information
to simulate FDG-PET images of diagnostic quality. In a blinded clinical reader
study, two neuroradiologists and two nuclear medicine physicians rated the
original MRI and SiM2P-simulated PET images of patients with Alzheimer's
disease, behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia, and cognitively healthy
controls. SiM2P significantly improved the overall diagnostic accuracy of
differentiating between three groups from 75.0% to 84.7% (p<0.05). Notably, the
simulated PET images received higher diagnostic certainty ratings and achieved
superior interrater agreement compared to the MRI images. Finally, we developed
a practical workflow for local deployment of the SiM2P framework. It requires
as few as 20 site-specific cases and only basic demographic information. This
approach makes the established diagnostic benefits of FDG-PET imaging more
accessible to patients with suspected dementing disorders, potentially
improving early detection and differential diagnosis in resource-limited
settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiiitong/SiM2P.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new benchmark, ClapperText, provides WWII-era clapperboard text annotations to advance robust OCR in degraded, low-resource archival contexts. It enables zero-shot and few-shot evaluation of recognition and detection models using rotated polygon annotations and both full-frame and cropped word images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in robust text recognition for degraded, non-standard historical documents, particularly clapperboard metadata, and to support few-shot learning research with a realistic, culturally grounded benchmark.

Method: Constructed from 127 World War II video segments; 9,813 annotated frames and 94,573 word instances (67% handwritten, 1,566 occluded). Each instance has transcription, semantic category, text type, and occlusion; annotations are rotated bounding boxes (4-point polygons). Provided full-frame and cropped word images. Evaluated six recognition and seven detection models under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions using a per-video protocol.

Result: Fine-tuning yields substantial performance gains despite a small training set of 18 videos, indicating strong potential for few-shot learning. The dataset supports realistic OCR benchmarks in degraded settings and is suitable for studying robustness to motion blur, handwriting variation, and cluttered backgrounds.

Conclusion: ClapperText offers a realistic, culturally grounded resource to advance robust OCR and document understanding in low-resource archival contexts; the dataset and evaluation code are publicly available, enabling zero-shot and few-shot evaluation across multiple models.

Abstract: This paper presents ClapperText, a benchmark dataset for handwritten and
printed text recognition in visually degraded and low-resource settings. The
dataset is derived from 127 World War II-era archival video segments containing
clapperboards that record structured production metadata such as date,
location, and camera-operator identity. ClapperText includes 9,813 annotated
frames and 94,573 word-level text instances, 67% of which are handwritten and
1,566 are partially occluded. Each instance includes transcription, semantic
category, text type, and occlusion status, with annotations available as
rotated bounding boxes represented as 4-point polygons to support spatially
precise OCR applications. Recognizing clapperboard text poses significant
challenges, including motion blur, handwriting variation, exposure
fluctuations, and cluttered backgrounds, mirroring broader challenges in
historical document analysis where structured content appears in degraded,
non-standard forms. We provide both full-frame annotations and cropped word
images to support downstream tasks. Using a consistent per-video evaluation
protocol, we benchmark six representative recognition and seven detection
models under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Despite the small training
set (18 videos), fine-tuning leads to substantial performance gains,
highlighting ClapperText's suitability for few-shot learning scenarios. The
dataset offers a realistic and culturally grounded resource for advancing
robust OCR and document understanding in low-resource archival contexts. The
dataset and evaluation code are available at

*Xiaoming Zhu,Xu Huang,Qinghongbing Xie,Zhi Deng,Junsheng Yu,Yirui Guan,Zhongyuan Liu,Lin Zhu,Qijun Zhao,Ligang Liu,Long Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A vision-guided 3D layout generation pipeline that builds a large asset library, uses an image-generation model tuned to that library to create images from prompts, parses images to recover 3D layouts, and optimizes layouts via scene graphs and global semantics; achieves richer, higher-quality 3D scenes and outperforms baselines; code/dataset released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with rigidity (optimization with manual rules), limited diversity (deep generative models), and robustness/spatial-relation issues in LLM-based approaches; a grounded, vision-guided pipeline is needed to produce richer, coherent 3D layouts.

Method: 1) Build asset library with 2,037 scene assets and 147 3D layouts. 2) Use an image generation model trained/fine-tuned on assets to expand prompt representations into images. 3) Develop a robust image parsing module to recover 3D layouts from visuals and geometry. 4) Optimize the layout using scene graphs and overall visual semantics to ensure coherence with images. 5) Evaluate via extensive user testing showing superior layout richness and quality.

Result: Extensive user testing shows the method significantly outperforms existing methods in layout richness and quality.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates effective vision-grounded 3D layout generation and provides a dataset/code release for reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Generating artistic and coherent 3D scene layouts is crucial in digital
content creation. Traditional optimization-based methods are often constrained
by cumbersome manual rules, while deep generative models face challenges in
producing content with richness and diversity. Furthermore, approaches that
utilize large language models frequently lack robustness and fail to accurately
capture complex spatial relationships. To address these challenges, this paper
presents a novel vision-guided 3D layout generation system. We first construct
a high-quality asset library containing 2,037 scene assets and 147 3D scene
layouts. Subsequently, we employ an image generation model to expand prompt
representations into images, fine-tuning it to align with our asset library. We
then develop a robust image parsing module to recover the 3D layout of scenes
based on visual semantics and geometric information. Finally, we optimize the
scene layout using scene graphs and overall visual semantics to ensure logical
coherence and alignment with the images. Extensive user testing demonstrates
that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
layout richness and quality. The code and dataset will be available at

TL;DR: A multi-view DeepFake detector using global, middle, local encoders plus a face orientation module to robustly detect manipulated faces across pose and lighting, outperforming single-view methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DeepFakes exhibit pose variation, occlusions, and artifacts that challenge single-view detectors; a multi-view representation can capture inconsistencies at different levels.

Method: Three specialized encoders (global for boundary inconsistencies, middle for texture/color alignment, local for distortions in eyes/nose/mouth) plus a face orientation encoder; fuse features from all encoders to detect manipulated images; trained to handle various poses and lighting.

Result: Experimental results on challenging datasets show superior performance compared to conventional single-view approaches.

Conclusion: Multi-view feature fusion with pose-aware encoding yields robust DeepFake detection across poses and conditions, indicating the approach's effectiveness for real-world deployment.

Abstract: DeepFake technology has advanced significantly in recent years, enabling the
creation of highly realistic synthetic face images. Existing DeepFake detection
methods often struggle with pose variations, occlusions, and artifacts that are
difficult to detect in real-world conditions. To address these challenges, we
propose a multi-view architecture that enhances DeepFake detection by analyzing
facial features at multiple levels. Our approach integrates three specialized
encoders, a global view encoder for detecting boundary inconsistencies, a
middle view encoder for analyzing texture and color alignment, and a local view
encoder for capturing distortions in expressive facial regions such as the
eyes, nose, and mouth, where DeepFake artifacts frequently occur. Additionally,
we incorporate a face orientation encoder, trained to classify face poses,
ensuring robust detection across various viewing angles. By fusing features
from these encoders, our model achieves superior performance in detecting
manipulated images, even under challenging pose and lighting
conditions.Experimental results on challenging datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, outperforming conventional single-view approaches

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight CycleGAN for unpaired fluorescence microscopy modality transfer using a fixed-channel generator, drastically reducing parameters and enabling GAN-based quality diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce computational cost and memory for microscopy models, enabling efficient modality transfer with unpaired data, while providing a practical tool to diagnose imaging and labeling quality.

Method: Replace the standard channel-doubling strategy in a U-Net-based generator with a fixed-channel approach in a CycleGAN, cutting trainable parameters from 41.8M to ~9K; trains on unpaired datasets; demonstrates faster training and lower memory usage; additionally uses the GAN as a diagnostic tool to assess imaging quality.

Result: Achieves superior performance with faster training and reduced memory usage compared with traditional architectures; the GAN captures characteristics of high-quality imaging and can flag issues such as photobleaching, artifacts, or labeling inaccuracies when applied to new experimental data.

Conclusion: The lightweight CycleGAN provides both effective modality transfer for fluorescence microscopy and a practical workflow for validating experimental accuracy and image fidelity, with substantial gains in efficiency.

Abstract: Lightweight deep learning models offer substantial reductions in
computational cost and environmental impact, making them crucial for scientific
applications. We present a lightweight CycleGAN for modality transfer in
fluorescence microscopy (confocal to super-resolution STED/deconvolved STED),
addressing the common challenge of unpaired datasets. By replacing the
traditional channel-doubling strategy in the U-Net-based generator with a fixed
channel approach, we drastically reduce trainable parameters from 41.8 million
to approximately nine thousand, achieving superior performance with faster
training and lower memory usage. We also introduce the GAN as a diagnostic tool
for experimental and labeling quality. When trained on high-quality images, the
GAN learns the characteristics of optimal imaging; deviations between its
generated outputs and new experimental images can reveal issues such as
photobleaching, artifacts, or inaccurate labeling. This establishes the model
as a practical tool for validating experimental accuracy and image fidelity in
microscopy workflows.

### [61] [Standardization for improved Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15589)
*Harkaitz Goyena,Peter M. Atkinson,Unai Pérez-Goya,M. Dolores Ugarte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two standardization strategies for Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion (STIF) are compared: traditional upscaling and ABSIS sharpening; both improve USTFIP results, with ABSIS delivering substantial gains in spectral (~49.46%) and spatial (~78.40%) accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STIF methods require matching spatial and spectral resolutions across sensors. The paper investigates standardization approaches to enable STIF and enhance fusion accuracy without changing the core fusion algorithm.

Method: 1) Upscale fine-resolution images to match coarse-resolution data using traditional interpolation. 2) Anomaly Based Satellite Image Standardization (ABSIS) sharpening that blends global features from the fine-resolution image series with distinctive attributes of a specific coarse-resolution image to approximate the aggregate result of fine-resolution images. These standardization steps are applied prior to using the USTFIP (Unpaired Spatio Temporal Fusion of Image Patches) method, and their impact on fusion accuracy is evaluated.

Result: Both standardization methods significantly improve the accuracy of the USTFIP fusion. The sharpening (ABSIS) approach yields larger gains, increasing spectral accuracy up to 49.46% and spatial accuracy up to 78.40%, while traditional upscaling also improves accuracy.

Conclusion: Sharpening-based standardization (ABSIS) more closely reproduces the aggregated outcome of fine-resolution data and provides substantial accuracy gains; both standardization strategies are beneficial for STIF when using USTFIP, with ABSIS offering the largest improvements.

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion (STIF) methods usually require sets of images
with matching spatial and spectral resolutions captured by different sensors.
To facilitate the application of STIF methods, we propose and compare two
different standardization approaches. The first method is based on traditional
upscaling of the fine-resolution images. The second method is a sharpening
approach called Anomaly Based Satellite Image Standardization (ABSIS) that
blends the overall features found in the fine-resolution image series with the
distinctive attributes of a specific coarse-resolution image to produce images
that more closely resemble the outcome of aggregating the fine-resolution
images. Both methods produce a significant increase in accuracy of the Unpaired
Spatio Temporal Fusion of Image Patches (USTFIP) STIF method, with the
sharpening approach increasing the spectral and spatial accuracies of the fused
images by up to 49.46\% and 78.40\%, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexiReID enables flexible multimodal person re-identification across seven retrieval modes spanning four modalities (rgb, infrared, sketches, text) using an adaptive mixture-of-experts and a cross-modal query fusion module; introduces CIRS-PEDES dataset; reports state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current cross-modal Re-ID methods are typically restricted to limited modality pairings, hindering practical deployment. A flexible system supporting arbitrary query-modality combinations is needed.

Method: Adaptive mixture-of-experts to dynamically fuse heterogeneous modality features; cross-modal query fusion module to enhance multimodal feature extraction; supports seven retrieval modes across rgb, infrared, sketches, and text; creates CIRS-PEDES by extending four popular Re-ID datasets to all four modalities.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: FlexiReID offers a flexible, scalable framework for multimodal Re-ID with broad retrieval capabilities and provides a unified, four-modality dataset for comprehensive evaluation.

Abstract: Multimodal person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match pedestrian images
across different modalities. However, most existing methods focus on limited
cross-modal settings and fail to support arbitrary query-retrieval
combinations, hindering practical deployment. We propose FlexiReID, a flexible
framework that supports seven retrieval modes across four modalities: rgb,
infrared, sketches, and text. FlexiReID introduces an adaptive
mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism to dynamically integrate diverse modality
features and a cross-modal query fusion module to enhance multimodal feature
extraction. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we construct CIRS-PEDES, a
unified dataset extending four popular Re-ID datasets to include all four
modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexiReID achieves
state-of-the-art performance and offers strong generalization in complex

*Andrei-Timotei Ardelean,Patrick Rückbeil,Tim Weyrich*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Real-time texture anomaly localization using a quantized FCA (QFCA) with PCA preprocessing, delivering 10x speedup with minimal accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial texture anomaly detection requires real-time performance; existing FCA-based methods are computationally heavy, hindering deployment on settings like assembly lines where fast, accurate anomaly localization is crucial.

Method: Introduce a quantized version of the feature correspondence analysis (FCA) algorithm. Adapt patch statistics comparison to operate on histograms of quantized values. Add a PCA-based feature preprocessing step to boost contrast between normal and anomalous features.

Result: Achieves about 10× speedup with little to no loss in accuracy. PCA preprocessing improves detection precision on complex textures. The method compares favorably to prior art in evaluations.

Conclusion: QFCA enables real-time anomaly localization for textures, combining quantization and PCA preprocessing to maintain accuracy while dramatically reducing computation; suitable for real-world deployment (e.g., on-line monitoring).

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly localization is a rising field in computer vision research,
with important progress in recent years. This work focuses on the problem of
detecting and localizing anomalies in textures, where anomalies can be defined
as the regions that deviate from the overall statistics, violating the
stationarity assumption. The main limitation of existing methods is their high
running time, making them impractical for deployment in real-world scenarios,
such as assembly line monitoring. We propose a real-time method, named QFCA,
which implements a quantized version of the feature correspondence analysis
(FCA) algorithm. By carefully adapting the patch statistics comparison to work
on histograms of quantized values, we obtain a 10x speedup with little to no
loss in accuracy. Moreover, we introduce a feature preprocessing step based on
principal component analysis, which enhances the contrast between normal and
anomalous features, improving the detection precision on complex textures. Our
method is thoroughly evaluated against prior art, comparing favorably with
existing methods. Project page:

### [64] [Lightweight Data-Free Denoising for Detail-Preserving Biomedical Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15611)
*Tomáš Chobola,Julia A. Schnabel,Tingying Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight, dataset-free, multistage denoiser Noise2Detail (N2D) that disrupts noise correlations to form intermediate smoothness and then refines from noisy input, achieving fast, high-quality denoising with lower resource use than dataset-free rivals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world denoising is limited by heavy computation and scarce clean training data, particularly in biomedical imaging; there is a need for fast, data-free methods that maintain detail and image quality.

Method: A multistage denoising pipeline named Noise2Detail (N2D) built on the Noise2Noise framework. During inference, it disrupts the spatial correlations of noise patterns to produce intermediate smooth structures, which are subsequently refined to recover fine details directly from the noisy input.

Result: Extensive testing shows Noise2Detail surpasses existing dataset-free techniques in performance while using only a fraction of the computational resources.

Conclusion: An efficient, data-free denoiser suitable for biomedical imaging with limited clean data, enabling fast inference and high-quality restoration.

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising techniques achieve impressive results, yet
their real-world application is frequently constrained by substantial
computational and memory demands, necessitating a compromise between inference
speed and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present an
ultra-lightweight model that addresses this challenge, achieving both fast
denoising and high quality image restoration. Built upon the Noise2Noise
training framework-which removes the reliance on clean reference images or
explicit noise modeling-we introduce an innovative multistage denoising
pipeline named Noise2Detail (N2D). During inference, this approach disrupts the
spatial correlations of noise patterns to produce intermediate smooth
structures, which are subsequently refined to recapture fine details directly
from the noisy input. Extensive testing reveals that Noise2Detail surpasses
existing dataset-free techniques in performance, while requiring only a
fraction of the computational resources. This combination of efficiency, low
computational cost, and data-free approach make it a valuable tool for
biomedical imaging, overcoming the challenges of scarce clean training data-due
to rare and complex imaging modalities-while enabling fast inference for
practical use.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey of deep learning-based domain adaptation in remote sensing, offering taxonomy, task/dataset coverage, performance summaries, and directions for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift in remote sensing arises from different sensors, resolutions, imaging modes, geography, and conditions. Deep learning enables cross-domain knowledge transfer, but a broad, systematic understanding is needed to guide research and practice.

Method: The survey organizes existing algorithms by task category, input mode, supervision paradigm, and algorithmic granularity; it reviews widely used datasets and summarizes state-of-the-art methods; it identifies open challenges and potential directions.

Result: Provides a structured taxonomy and comparative insights across deep learning-based RS domain adaptation methods, broadening the scope beyond subfields and delivering a holistic view to guide researchers and practitioners.

Conclusion: The work offers a broad, systematic overview to foster understanding, guide future work, and accelerate progress in deep learning-based domain adaptation for remote sensing.

Abstract: Domain adaptation is a crucial and increasingly important task in remote
sensing, aiming to transfer knowledge from a source domain a differently
distributed target domain. It has broad applications across various real-world
applications, including remote sensing element interpretation, ecological
environment monitoring, and urban/rural planning. However, domain adaptation in
remote sensing poses significant challenges due to differences in data, such as
variations in ground sampling distance, imaging modes from various sensors,
geographical landscapes, and environmental conditions. In recent years, deep
learning has emerged as a powerful tool for feature representation and
cross-domain knowledge transfer, leading to widespread adoption in remote
sensing tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of significant
advancements in deep learning based domain adaptation for remote sensing. We
first introduce the preliminary knowledge to clarify key concepts, mathematical
notations, and the taxonomy of methodologies. We then organize existing
algorithms from multiple perspectives, including task categorization, input
mode, supervision paradigm, and algorithmic granularity, providing readers with
a structured understanding of the field. Next, we review widely used datasets
and summarize the performance of state-of-the-art methods to provide an
overview of current progress. We also identify open challenges and potential
directions to guide future research in domain adaptation for remote sensing.
Compared to previous surveys, this work addresses a broader range of domain
adaptation tasks in remote sensing, rather than concentrating on a few
subfields. It also presents a systematic taxonomy, providing a more
comprehensive and organized understanding of the field. As a whole, this survey
can inspire the research community, foster understanding, and guide future work
in the field.

### [66] [Uncertainty-Aware Extreme Point Tracing for Weakly Supervised Ultrasound Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15666)
*Lei Shi,Gang Li,Junxing Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Weakly supervised ultrasound segmentation using four extreme points with SAM2 prompts, refined via FGEPM with MC dropout uncertainty and USC/box losses; matches or exceeds fully supervised performance with lower annotation cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce costly pixel-level annotations in medical image segmentation by leveraging inexpensive extreme-point annotations and a strong foundation model, with uncertainty-guided refinement to improve boundary accuracy.

Method: 1) Derive bounding boxes from four extreme points to prompt SAM2 and generate initial pseudo labels. 2) Refine pseudo labels with an enhanced Feature-Guided Extreme Point Masking (FGEPM) using Monte Carlo dropout-based uncertainty to build a gradient uncertainty cost map for boundary tracing. 3) Train with a dual-branch Uncertainty-aware Scale Consistency (USC) loss and a box alignment loss to enforce spatial consistency and precise boundaries. 4) Validate on two public ultrasound datasets (BUSI and UNS).

Result: On BUSI and UNS datasets, the method achieves performance comparable to, and sometimes surpasses, fully supervised approaches, while substantially reducing annotation cost.

Conclusion: The proposed weakly supervised framework is effective and practical for ultrasound image segmentation, enabling high performance with minimal annotation effort.

Abstract: Automatic medical image segmentation is a fundamental step in computer-aided
diagnosis, yet fully supervised approaches demand extensive pixel-level
annotations that are costly and time-consuming. To alleviate this burden, we
propose a weakly supervised segmentation framework that leverages only four
extreme points as annotation. Specifically, bounding boxes derived from the
extreme points are used as prompts for the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to
generate reliable initial pseudo labels. These pseudo labels are progressively
refined by an enhanced Feature-Guided Extreme Point Masking (FGEPM) algorithm,
which incorporates Monte Carlo dropout-based uncertainty estimation to
construct a unified gradient uncertainty cost map for boundary tracing.
Furthermore, a dual-branch Uncertainty-aware Scale Consistency (USC) loss and a
box alignment loss are introduced to ensure spatial consistency and precise
boundary alignment during training. Extensive experiments on two public
ultrasound datasets, BUSI and UNS, demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to, and even surpassing fully supervised counterparts
while significantly reducing annotation cost. These results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed weakly supervised framework for
ultrasound image segmentation.

*Gerard Comas-Quiles,Carles Garcia-Cabrera,Julia Dietlmeier,Noel E. O'Connor,Ferran Marques*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised Multimodal Vision Transformer Autoencoder (MViT-AE) trained on healthy brain MRIs detects tumors via reconstruction errors, using multimodal fusion and SAM-refined post-processing; tested on BraTS-GoAT 2025 and shows promising lesion localization with notable detection rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address label scarcity and inconsistency in brain tumor segmentation, enabling scalable, label-efficient anomaly detection in neuroimaging.

Method: Train a Multimodal Vision Transformer Autoencoder on healthy brain MRIs; apply early-late fusion to combine information from multiple MRI sequences; generate anomaly maps from reconstruction errors; refine tumor contours with Segment Anything Model (SAM) in a post-processing pipeline.

Result: Lesion-wise Dice: Whole Tumor 0.437, Tumor Core 0.316, Enhancing Tumor 0.350 on the test set; Anomaly Detection Rate 89.4% on the validation set; evaluated on BraTS-GoAT 2025 Lighthouse with gliomas, meningiomas, and pediatric tumors.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the potential of transformer-based unsupervised models for scalable, label-efficient neuro-oncological imaging; achieves clinically meaningful localization but faces challenges with small/non-enhancing lesions; suggests unsupervised approaches can augment standard supervised workflows.

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) presents a complementary alternative to
supervised learning for brain tumor segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), particularly when annotated datasets are limited, costly, or
inconsistent. In this work, we propose a novel Multimodal Vision Transformer
Autoencoder (MViT-AE) trained exclusively on healthy brain MRIs to detect and
localize tumors via reconstruction-based error maps. This unsupervised paradigm
enables segmentation without reliance on manual labels, addressing a key
scalability bottleneck in neuroimaging workflows. Our method is evaluated in
the BraTS-GoAT 2025 Lighthouse dataset, which includes various types of tumors
such as gliomas, meningiomas, and pediatric brain tumors. To enhance
performance, we introduce a multimodal early-late fusion strategy that
leverages complementary information across multiple MRI sequences, and a
post-processing pipeline that integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to
refine predicted tumor contours. Despite the known challenges of UAD,
particularly in detecting small or non-enhancing lesions, our method achieves
clinically meaningful tumor localization, with lesion-wise Dice Similarity
Coefficient of 0.437 (Whole Tumor), 0.316 (Tumor Core), and 0.350 (Enhancing
Tumor) on the test set, and an anomaly Detection Rate of 89.4% on the
validation set. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based
unsupervised models to serve as scalable, label-efficient tools for
neuro-oncological imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified medical multimodal model (UniMedVL) is proposed, backed by the UniMed-5M dataset and Progressive Curriculum Learning, to jointly handle medical image understanding and generation; it achieves strong results across multiple benchmarks and enables bidirectional improvements by sharing knowledge between tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical AI needs systems that seamlessly process multimodal inputs (images, text, lab data) and output both textual reports and visual content. Current systems are fragmented (understanding vs. generation), leading to gaps in data representation and task capabilities.

Method: Introduce a three-level OKA framework: Observation via UniMed-5M (5.6M samples reformatted into multimodal pairs); Knowledge via Progressive Curriculum Learning (gradually introducing multimodal medical knowledge); Analysis via UniMedVL (a unified model for joint image understanding and generation, enabling bidirectional knowledge sharing).

Result: UniMedVL yields superior performance on five medical image understanding benchmarks and matches specialized models in generation quality across eight imaging modalities; demonstrates bidirectional enhancement where generation improves understanding features.

Conclusion: A unified medical vision-language framework that integrates analysis and generation improves performance across diverse medical tasks and modalities, validating the benefit of sharing knowledge across tasks. Code is available.

Abstract: Medical diagnostic applications require models that can process multimodal
medical inputs (images, patient histories, lab results) and generate diverse
outputs including both textual reports and visual content (annotations,
segmentation masks, and images). Despite this need, existing medical AI systems
disrupt this unified process: medical image understanding models interpret
images but cannot generate visual outputs, while medical image generation
models synthesize images but cannot provide textual explanations. This leads to
gaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal
capabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws
inspiration from diagnostic workflows through the
Observation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm. Specifically, at the observation
level, we construct UniMed-5M, a dataset comprising over 5.6M samples that
reformat diverse unimodal data into multimodal pairs for foundational
observation. At the knowledge level, we propose Progressive Curriculum Learning
that systematically introduces medical multimodal knowledge. At the analysis
level, we introduce UniMedVL, the first medical unified multimodal model for
the simultaneous analysis of image understanding and generation tasks within a
single architecture. UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical
image understanding benchmarks, while matching specialized models in generation
quality across eight medical imaging modalities. Crucially, our unified
architecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing: generation tasks enhance
visual understanding features, demonstrating that integrating traditionally
separate capabilities within a single medical framework unlocks improvements
across diverse medical vision-language tasks. Code is available at

*Tingyu Lin,Armin Dadras,Florian Kleber,Robert Sablatnig*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DGME-T: a lightweight directional grid motion encoding head for Video Swin Transformer that improves camera movement classification on archival film, achieving notable gains on both modern and WWII footage; cross-domain fine-tuning further boosts historical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMC models trained on contemporary footage degrade when applied to archival film due to noise, missing frames, and low contrast. A unified benchmark and robust, motion-aware architectures are needed to bridge this gap.

Method: Create a unified benchmark by consolidating two modern corpora into four canonical classes and restructuring HISTORIAN into five balanced categories. Propose DGME-T, a lightweight extension to the Video Swin Transformer that injects directional grid motion encoding (derived from optical flow) via a learnable, normalized late-fusion layer.

Result: On modern clips, top-1 accuracy rises 81.78%→86.14% and macro F1 82.08%→87.81%. For World-War-II footage, accuracy 83.43%→84.62% and macro F1 81.72%→82.63%. Cross-domain evaluation shows intermediate fine-tuning on modern data increases historical performance by >5 percentage points.

Conclusion: Structured motion priors and transformer representations are complementary; even a compact motion head can substantially boost robustness in degraded film analysis.

Abstract: Camera movement classification (CMC) models trained on contemporary,
high-quality footage often degrade when applied to archival film, where noise,
missing frames, and low contrast obscure motion cues. We bridge this gap by
assembling a unified benchmark that consolidates two modern corpora into four
canonical classes and restructures the HISTORIAN collection into five balanced
categories. Building on this benchmark, we introduce DGME-T, a lightweight
extension to the Video Swin Transformer that injects directional grid motion
encoding, derived from optical flow, via a learnable and normalised late-fusion
layer. DGME-T raises the backbone's top-1 accuracy from 81.78% to 86.14% and
its macro F1 from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern clips, while still improving the
demanding World-War-II footage from 83.43% to 84.62% accuracy and from 81.72%
to 82.63% macro F1. A cross-domain study further shows that an intermediate
fine-tuning stage on modern data increases historical performance by more than
five percentage points. These results demonstrate that structured motion priors
and transformer representations are complementary and that even a small,
carefully calibrated motion head can substantially enhance robustness in
degraded film analysis. Related resources are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Ditto introduces a scalable, end-to-end framework for instruction-based video editing that generates high-quality training data, reduces compute via distillation, enhances temporal coherence, and uses an agent-driven pipeline to produce Ditto-1M; Editto yields state-of-the-art instruction following.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data for instruction-based video editing and the prohibitive cost of producing such data, enabling broad, coherent editing capabilities at scale.

Method: A data generation pipeline that fuses an image editor's creative diversity with an in-context video generator; a distilled model architecture with a temporal enhancer to reduce computation and improve temporal coherence; an intelligent agent that crafts diverse instructions and filters outputs; curriculum learning; construction of Ditto-1M (1 million video editing examples); training of the Editto model.

Result: The approach yields superior instruction-following ability and sets a new state-of-the-art in instruction-based video editing on the Ditto-1M data, with improved efficiency and temporal coherence.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of scalable, data-driven strategies for instruction-based video editing, enabling democratized access to high-quality video editing capabilities through Ditto-1M and Editto.

Abstract: Instruction-based video editing promises to democratize content creation, yet
its progress is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality
training data. We introduce Ditto, a holistic framework designed to tackle this
fundamental challenge. At its heart, Ditto features a novel data generation
pipeline that fuses the creative diversity of a leading image editor with an
in-context video generator, overcoming the limited scope of existing models. To
make this process viable, our framework resolves the prohibitive cost-quality
trade-off by employing an efficient, distilled model architecture augmented by
a temporal enhancer, which simultaneously reduces computational overhead and
improves temporal coherence. Finally, to achieve full scalability, this entire
pipeline is driven by an intelligent agent that crafts diverse instructions and
rigorously filters the output, ensuring quality control at scale. Using this
framework, we invested over 12,000 GPU-days to build Ditto-1M, a new dataset of
one million high-fidelity video editing examples. We trained our model, Editto,
on Ditto-1M with a curriculum learning strategy. The results demonstrate
superior instruction-following ability and establish a new state-of-the-art in
instruction-based video editing.

*Haoran Wang,Bo Zhao,Jinghui Wang,Hanzhang Wang,Huan Yang,Wei Ji,Hao Liu,Xinyan Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SEGA, a stepwise coarse-to-fine, feedback-driven content-aware layout generator, augmented with layout priors, and introduces GenPoster-100K dataset; achieves state-of-the-art on several benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current single-step methods struggle with complex layout planning and lack a self-correction mechanism. A hierarchical, feedback-capable approach with priors is needed to improve harmony between generated layouts and background images. The GenPoster-100K dataset provides rich annotations to support this research.

Method: A two-stage hierarchical framework: a coarse-level module estimates rough layout planning, followed by a refinement module that performs fine-grained reasoning on the coarse plan. Incorporates layout design principles as priors. Introduces GenPoster-100K, a large-scale poster dataset with rich meta-information, for training and evaluation.

Result: Empirical results show state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating improved robustness and quality in content-aware layout generation.

Conclusion: SEGA demonstrates that stepwise evolution with priors and a coarse-to-fine strategy yields more reliable content-aware layouts and provides a valuable dataset (GenPoster-100K) to drive future research.

Abstract: In this paper, we study the content-aware layout generation problem, which
aims to automatically generate layouts that are harmonious with a given
background image. Existing methods usually deal with this task with a
single-step reasoning framework. The lack of a feedback-based self-correction
mechanism leads to their failure rates significantly increasing when faced with
complex element layout planning. To address this challenge, we introduce SEGA,
a novel Stepwise Evolution Paradigm for Content-Aware Layout Generation.
Inspired by the systematic mode of human thinking, SEGA employs a hierarchical
reasoning framework with a coarse-to-fine strategy: first, a coarse-level
module roughly estimates the layout planning results; then, another refining
module performs fine-level reasoning regarding the coarse planning results.
Furthermore, we incorporate layout design principles as prior knowledge into
the model to enhance its layout planning ability. Besides, we present
GenPoster-100K that is a new large-scale poster dataset with rich
meta-information annotation. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach by achieving the state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark
datasets. Our project page is at: https://brucew91.github.io/SEGA.github.io/

### [73] [NDM: A Noise-driven Detection and Mitigation Framework against Implicit Sexual Intentions in Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15752)
*Yitong Sun,Yao Huang,Ruochen Zhang,Huanran Chen,Shouwei Ruan,Ranjie Duan,Xingxing Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NDM is a noise-driven framework to detect and mitigate implicit malicious prompts in text-to-image diffusion models, aimed at reducing sexual content generation without sacrificing image quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explicit content detectors miss implicit cues that subtly trigger sexual generation; fine-tuning can degrade generative quality, so a solution that preserves quality is needed.

Method: Two innovations: (1) rely on separability of early-stage predicted noise to perform efficient, accurate detection of malicious prompts; (2) introduce a noise-enhanced adaptive negative guidance that refines initial noise to suppress attention in prominent regions, improving mitigation.

Result: NDM achieves superior performance on natural and adversarial datasets compared with state-of-the-art methods (e.g., SLD, UCE, RECE); demonstrates effective detection and mitigation while preserving generative capabilities. Code available at the provided repository.

Conclusion: NDM is the first noise-driven detection framework for implicit malicious intent in T2I generation, offering a robust balance between content safety and generative quality; it opens a promising direction for safeguarding diffusion models against implicit prompts.

Abstract: Despite the impressive generative capabilities of text-to-image (T2I)
diffusion models, they remain vulnerable to generating inappropriate content,
especially when confronted with implicit sexual prompts. Unlike explicit
harmful prompts, these subtle cues, often disguised as seemingly benign terms,
can unexpectedly trigger sexual content due to underlying model biases, raising
significant ethical concerns. However, existing detection methods are primarily
designed to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect
these implicit cues. Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent,
risk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable
trade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection
and mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious
intention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative
capabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we
leverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a
noise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high
accuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative
guidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the
prominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive
negative guidance for sexual mitigation. Experimentally, we validate NDM on
both natural and adversarial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance
over existing SOTA methods, including SLD, UCE, and RECE, etc. Code and
resources are available at https://github.com/lorraine021/NDM.

*Jort de Jong,Mike Holenderski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Regularization for encoder-decoder segmentation with superpixel-based upsampling to align boundaries under coarse annotations, improving boundary recall on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coarse annotations are cheaper but degrade boundary accuracy; leveraging SLIC superpixels provides a boundary-consistent regularization independent of full pixel-wise labels.

Method: Add a regularization term to an encoder-decoder segmentation model with superpixel-based upsampling; enforce decoded pixels to align with SLIC superpixels; implemented on FCN-16; evaluated on SUIM, Cityscapes, PanNuke.

Result: Boundary recall improves significantly over state-of-the-art models when trained on coarse annotations.

Conclusion: Superpixel-based boundary regularization is effective for segmentation with coarse annotations and generalizes across diverse datasets.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is the task of classifying each pixel in an image.
Training a segmentation model achieves best results using annotated images,
where each pixel is annotated with the corresponding class. When obtaining fine
annotations is difficult or expensive, it may be possible to acquire coarse
annotations, e.g. by roughly annotating pixels in an images leaving some pixels
around the boundaries between classes unlabeled. Segmentation with coarse
annotations is difficult, in particular when the objective is to optimize the
alignment of boundaries between classes. This paper proposes a regularization
method for models with an encoder-decoder architecture with superpixel based
upsampling. It encourages the segmented pixels in the decoded image to be
SLIC-superpixels, which are based on pixel color and position, independent of
the segmentation annotation. The method is applied to FCN-16 fully
convolutional network architecture and evaluated on the SUIM, Cityscapes, and
PanNuke data sets. It is shown that the boundary recall improves significantly
compared to state-of-the-art models when trained on coarse annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QSilk is a lightweight, training-free stabilization layer for latent diffusion that reduces extreme activation spikes and improves high-frequency fidelity by combining a per-sample micro clamp with Adaptive Quantile Clip (AQClip), adaptable per region and optional attention-entropy guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models can exhibit rare activation spikes and high-frequency artifacts, especially at high resolutions or low step counts. A lightweight, no-training stabilization method is desirable to improve fidelity without compromising efficiency or requiring fine-tuning.

Method: Introduce per-sample micro clamp to limit extreme values without washing out texture; develop Adaptive Quantile Clip (AQClip) that sets an allowed value corridor per region, with a proxy mode via local structure statistics or an attention-entropy guided mode (model confidence); integrate into the CADE 2.5 rendering pipeline; enable synergy with CFG/Rescale.

Result: Yields cleaner, sharper results at low step counts and ultra-high resolutions with negligible overhead; no training required; consistent qualitative improvements across SD/SDXL backbones; compatible with CFG/Rescale enabling slightly higher guidance without artifacts.

Conclusion: QSilk offers a practical, training-free stabilization layer that improves high-frequency fidelity and stability in latent-diffusion-based rendering across backbones, with minimal user controls and negligible overhead.

Abstract: We present QSilk, a lightweight, always-on stabilization layer for latent
diffusion that improves high-frequency fidelity while suppressing rare
activation spikes. QSilk combines (i) a per-sample micro clamp that gently
limits extreme values without washing out texture, and (ii) Adaptive Quantile
Clip (AQClip), which adapts the allowed value corridor per region. AQClip can
operate in a proxy mode using local structure statistics or in an attention
entropy guided mode (model confidence). Integrated into the CADE 2.5 rendering
pipeline, QSilk yields cleaner, sharper results at low step counts and
ultra-high resolutions with negligible overhead. It requires no training or
fine-tuning and exposes minimal user controls. We report consistent qualitative
improvements across SD/SDXL backbones and show synergy with CFG/Rescale,
enabling slightly higher guidance without artifacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address input-to-concept mapping bias and limited controllability in existing concept bottleneck models, which often depend on region annotations and struggle to align visual patterns with human concepts.

Method: Introduce a lightweight Disentangled Concept Bottleneck Model (LDCBM) that groups visual features into semantically meaningful components without region annotations. It uses a filter grouping loss to align visual patterns with concepts and joint concept supervision to improve alignment and controllability, resulting in more transparent decision-making.

Result: Experiments on three diverse datasets show that LDCBM achieves higher concept and class accuracy and outperforms previous CBMs in both interpretability and classification performance.

Conclusion: Grounding concepts in visual evidence within a disentangled framework overcomes key limitations of prior CBMs, enhancing the reliability and robustness of interpretable AI.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by predicting
human-understandable concepts as intermediate representations. However,
existing CBMs often suffer from input-to-concept mapping bias and limited
controllability, which restricts their practical value, directly damage the
responsibility of strategy from concept-based methods. We propose a lightweight
Disentangled Concept Bottleneck Model (LDCBM) that automatically groups visual
features into semantically meaningful components without region annotation. By
introducing a filter grouping loss and joint concept supervision, our method
improves the alignment between visual patterns and concepts, enabling more
transparent and robust decision-making. Notably, Experiments on three diverse
datasets demonstrate that LDCBM achieves higher concept and class accuracy,
outperforming previous CBMs in both interpretability and classification
performance. By grounding concepts in visual evidence, our method overcomes a
fundamental limitation of prior models and enhances the reliability of
interpretable AI.

### [78] [ReCon: Region-Controllable Data Augmentation with Rectification and Alignment for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15783)
*Haowei Zhu,Tianxiang Pan,Rui Qin,Jun-Hai Yong,Bin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReCon uses diffusion-based augmentation with region-guided rectification and region-aligned cross-attention to improve object-detection data quality, achieving consistent gains across datasets and backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality annotated data is costly; existing generative augmentation often needs post-processing, fine-tuning, and suffers from content-position mismatches and semantic leakage.

Method: Introduce region-guided rectification during diffusion sampling using feedback from a pre-trained perception model to fix misgenerated regions; add region-aligned cross-attention to enforce spatial-semantic alignment between regions and textual prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments show substantial improvements in data quality and trainability, with consistent gains across diverse datasets, backbones, and data scales.

Conclusion: ReCon substantially enhances generated data quality and training efficiency for object detection; the approach reduces reliance on post-processing and offers robust augmentation. Code available at the provided GitHub URL.

Abstract: The scale and quality of datasets are crucial for training robust perception
models. However, obtaining large-scale annotated data is both costly and
time-consuming. Generative models have emerged as a powerful tool for data
augmentation by synthesizing samples that adhere to desired distributions.
However, current generative approaches often rely on complex post-processing or
extensive fine-tuning on massive datasets to achieve satisfactory results, and
they remain prone to content-position mismatches and semantic leakage. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce ReCon, a novel augmentation framework
that enhances the capacity of structure-controllable generative models for
object detection. ReCon integrates region-guided rectification into the
diffusion sampling process, using feedback from a pre-trained perception model
to rectify misgenerated regions within diffusion sampling process. We further
propose region-aligned cross-attention to enforce spatial-semantic alignment
between image regions and their textual cues, thereby improving both semantic
consistency and overall image fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ReCon substantially improve the quality and trainability of generated data,
achieving consistent performance gains across various datasets, backbone
architectures, and data scales. Our code is available at

### [79] [ERNet: Efficient Non-Rigid Registration Network for Point Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15800)
*Guangzhao He,Yuxi Xiao,Zhen Xu,Xiaowei Zhou,Sida Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERNet delivers a scalable, data-driven solution for sequential non-rigid registration of point clouds by predicting deformation graphs in a two-stage, sliding-window pipeline, achieving robustness to noise/partial data and ~4× speed improvements on DeformingThings4D and D-FAUST.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-rigid registration over long sequences suffers from local minima due to non-convex objectives, sensitivity to noise/partial inputs, and error accumulation over time, causing unstable tracking.

Method: A two-stage deformation-graph prediction framework (ERNet): first estimate frame-wise coarse graph nodes for robust initialization, then refine node trajectories over time in a sliding-window fashion; a feed-forward model trained on large deformation datasets that exploits temporal information to produce a sequence of deformation graphs.

Result: Empirically surpasses previous state-of-the-art on DeformingThings4D and D-FAUST datasets and achieves over 4x speedup relative to the prior best method, indicating both accuracy and efficiency gains.

Conclusion: The proposed ERNet offers a scalable, robust approach to sequential non-rigid registration under challenging inputs, combining robust initialization, temporal refinement, and efficient inference to mitigate local minima and error accumulation while enabling fast tracking over long sequences.

Abstract: Registering an object shape to a sequence of point clouds undergoing
non-rigid deformation is a long-standing challenge. The key difficulties stem
from two factors: (i) the presence of local minima due to the non-convexity of
registration objectives, especially under noisy or partial inputs, which
hinders accurate and robust deformation estimation, and (ii) error accumulation
over long sequences, leading to tracking failures. To address these challenges,
we introduce to adopt a scalable data-driven approach and propose ERNet, an
efficient feed-forward model trained on large deformation datasets. It is
designed to handle noisy and partial inputs while effectively leveraging
temporal information for accurate and consistent sequential registration. The
key to our design is predicting a sequence of deformation graphs through a
two-stage pipeline, which first estimates frame-wise coarse graph nodes for
robust initialization, before refining their trajectories over time in a
sliding-window fashion. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach
(i) outperforms previous state-of-the-art on both the DeformingThings4D and
D-FAUST datasets, and (ii) achieves more than 4x speedup compared to the
previous best, offering significant efficiency improvement.

*Do Xuan Long,Xingchen Wan,Hootan Nakhost,Chen-Yu Lee,Tomas Pfister,Sercan Ö. Arık*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-agent, prompt-improvement loop (VISTA) enhances text-to-video generation by iteratively generating and evaluating videos, then rewriting prompts based on critiques, yielding more consistent quality and user-aligned results with higher win rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address instability and misalignment in text-to-video generation caused by complex, multifaceted prompts. Leverage autonomous agents to decompose tasks, critique outputs, and refine prompts for improved video quality and alignment.

Method: Decompose user idea into a structured temporal plan; generate candidate videos; select the best via a robust pairwise tournament; three specialized agents (visual, audio, contextual) critique the winning video; a reasoning agent rewrites the prompt for the next generation cycle; repeat iteratively across single- and multi-scene scenarios.

Result: Consistent quality gains across single- and multi-scene generation; up to 60% pairwise win rate against state-of-the-art baselines; human evaluators prefer VISTA outputs in 66.4% of comparisons.

Conclusion: VISTA offers a robust autonomous, multi-agent framework for improving video quality and alignment with user intent through iterative prompt refinement and output critique, addressing weaknesses of prior test-time optimization methods.

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in text-to-video synthesis, generated video quality
remains critically dependent on precise user prompts. Existing test-time
optimization methods, successful in other domains, struggle with the
multi-faceted nature of video. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Video
Iterative Self-improvemenT Agent), a novel multi-agent system that autonomously
improves video generation through refining prompts in an iterative loop. VISTA
first decomposes a user idea into a structured temporal plan. After generation,
the best video is identified through a robust pairwise tournament. This winning
video is then critiqued by a trio of specialized agents focusing on visual,
audio, and contextual fidelity. Finally, a reasoning agent synthesizes this
feedback to introspectively rewrite and enhance the prompt for the next
generation cycle. Experiments on single- and multi-scene video generation
scenarios show that while prior methods yield inconsistent gains, VISTA
consistently improves video quality and alignment with user intent, achieving
up to 60% pairwise win rate against state-of-the-art baselines. Human
evaluators concur, preferring VISTA outputs in 66.4% of comparisons.

### [81] [Neuro-Symbolic Spatial Reasoning in Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15841)
*Jiayi Lin,Jiabo Huang,Shaogang Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RelateSeg introduces neuro-symbolic spatial reasoning for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation by encoding spatial relations as first-order logic with fuzzy relaxation, achieving state-of-the-art average mIoU with minimal extra cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OVSS must generalize to unseen/unlabelled objects and leverage spatial relations; current VLM-based correlations lack explicit spatial reasoning, hindering segmentation in cluttered scenes.

Method: RelateSeg extracts spatial relations like <cat, to-right-of, person>, encodes them as first-order logic formulas via pseudo categories, and trains a network where each pixel predicts both semantic and spatial pseudo categories; fuzzy logic relaxation enforces relational constraints end-to-end.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art average mIoU across four benchmarks, with clear benefits on images containing multiple categories; uses only a single auxiliary loss and no extra parameters.

Conclusion: First attempt at NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS; shows relational constraints improve open-vocabulary segmentation and validates the effectiveness of combining symbolic reasoning with deep learning for spatial awareness.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) assigns pixel-level labels from
an open set of categories, requiring generalization to unseen and unlabelled
objects. Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches
with potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of
spatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce
neuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary
VLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg)
to impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL)
formulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to
explore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically
extracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them
as first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel
learns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., "cat") and a spatial pseudo
category (e.g., "right of person") simultaneously, enforcing relational
constraints (e.g., a "cat" pixel must lie to the right of a "person"). Finally,
these logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy
logic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally
consistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in
terms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows
clear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of
only introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters,
validating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.

### [82] [3DPR: Single Image 3D Portrait Relight using Generative Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15846)
*Pramod Rao,Abhimitra Meka,Xilong Zhou,Gereon Fox,Mallikarjun B R,Fangneng Zhan,Tim Weyrich,Bernd Bickel,Hanspeter Pfister,Wojciech Matusik,Thabo Beeler,Mohamed Elgharib,Marc Habermann,Christian Theobalt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A 3DPR framework relights a monocular portrait by embedding into a pre-trained face generator's latent space and using a triplane reflectance network trained on OLAT data to synthesize OLAT views for HDRI-based relighting, preserving identity and high-frequency lighting details.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Relighting a single portrait is underconstrained when using explicit geometry/materials. The paper leverages generative priors learned from multi-view OLAT data and a pre-trained face generator to capture high-frequency reflectance and identity-preserving lighting effects.

Method: Encode the input portrait into the latent space of a pre-trained generative head via inversion. Train a triplane-based reflectance network on a large 4K OLAT light-stage dataset to synthesize OLAT reflectance images within the latent space. Use these OLATs to perform image-based relighting by composing with an HDRI environment map.

Result: 3DPR outperforms prior methods, particularly in preserving identity and capturing lighting effects such as specularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering.

Conclusion: The approach enables physically accurate environmental relighting with limited light-stage data by leveraging latent-space priors and a triplane reflectance model.

Abstract: Rendering novel, relit views of a human head, given a monocular portrait
image as input, is an inherently underconstrained problem. The traditional
graphics solution is to explicitly decompose the input image into geometry,
material and lighting via differentiable rendering; but this is constrained by
the multiple assumptions and approximations of the underlying models and
parameterizations of these scene components. We propose 3DPR, an image-based
relighting model that leverages generative priors learnt from multi-view
One-Light-at-A-Time (OLAT) images captured in a light stage. We introduce a new
diverse and large-scale multi-view 4K OLAT dataset of 139 subjects to learn a
high-quality prior over the distribution of high-frequency face reflectance. We
leverage the latent space of a pre-trained generative head model that provides
a rich prior over face geometry learnt from in-the-wild image datasets. The
input portrait is first embedded in the latent manifold of such a model through
an encoder-based inversion process. Then a novel triplane-based reflectance
network trained on our lightstage data is used to synthesize high-fidelity OLAT
images to enable image-based relighting. Our reflectance network operates in
the latent space of the generative head model, crucially enabling a relatively
small number of lightstage images to train the reflectance model. Combining the
generated OLATs according to a given HDRI environment maps yields physically
accurate environmental relighting results. Through quantitative and qualitative
evaluations, we demonstrate that 3DPR outperforms previous methods,
particularly in preserving identity and in capturing lighting effects such as
specularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering. Project Page:

*Joongwon Chae,Lihui Luo,Xi Yuan,Dongmei Yu,Zhenglin Chen,Lian Zhang,Peiwu Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Memory-SAM is a training-free, prompt-generation pipeline that uses dense feature-based exemplar memory to generate foreground/background prompts for SAM, enabling data-efficient tongue segmentation with high accuracy and robustness, surpassing baselines on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for accurate tongue segmentation for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) analysis; supervised methods require large annotated datasets; existing SAM approaches are prompt-driven and need prompts or fine-tuning; aim to achieve robust segmentation without training or manual prompts.

Method: Retrieve similar exemplars using dense DINOv3 features and FAISS; establish mask-constrained correspondences between query and exemplar; distill into foreground/background prompts that guide SAM2 without manual clicks or model fine-tuning; training-free, human-prompt-free.

Result: On 600-image dataset (300 controlled, 300 in-the-wild), mixed-test mIoU is 0.9863, surpassing FCN (0.8188) and detector-to-box SAM baseline (0.1839). On controlled data, ceiling effects above 0.98 reduce apparent gains due to annotation variability, but Memory-SAM shows clear gains under real-world conditions.

Conclusion: Retrieval-to-prompt enables data-efficient, robust segmentation of irregular boundaries in tongue imaging; code is publicly available at https://github.com/jw-chae/memory-sam.

Abstract: Accurate tongue segmentation is crucial for reliable TCM analysis. Supervised
models require large annotated datasets, while SAM-family models remain
prompt-driven. We present Memory-SAM, a training-free, human-prompt-free
pipeline that automatically generates effective prompts from a small memory of
prior cases via dense DINOv3 features and FAISS retrieval. Given a query image,
mask-constrained correspondences to the retrieved exemplar are distilled into
foreground/background point prompts that guide SAM2 without manual clicks or
model fine-tuning. We evaluate on 600 expert-annotated images (300 controlled,
300 in-the-wild). On the mixed test split, Memory-SAM achieves mIoU 0.9863,
surpassing FCN (0.8188) and a detector-to-box SAM baseline (0.1839). On
controlled data, ceiling effects above 0.98 make small differences less
meaningful given annotation variability, while our method shows clear gains
under real-world conditions. Results indicate that retrieval-to-prompt enables
data-efficient, robust segmentation of irregular boundaries in tongue imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLIP3o-NEXT is an open-source foundation model that unifies text-to-image generation and image editing in one architecture, using an autoregressive + diffusion hybrid to deliver high-quality images and strong editability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To push native image generation forward with a single scalable architecture that handles both generation and editing, assess architectural choices, leverage reinforcement learning, improve editing via post-training/data engineering, and quantify the impact of data quality and scale.

Method: An autoregressive model first generates discrete image tokens conditioned on multimodal inputs; these tokens’ hidden states condition a diffusion model that renders high-fidelity images. The approach integrates autoregressive reasoning and instruction-following with diffusion’s detail rendering, complemented by RL, post-training, and data-engineering for editing and alignment.

Result: Extensive evaluations on text-to-image and image-editing benchmarks show BLIP3o-NEXT achieving superior performance over existing models, validating the four insights and the unified autoregressive+diffusion design.

Conclusion: A unified autoregressive+diffusion foundation model can effectively handle generation and editing with strong quality and instruction-following, with data quality/scale and targeted training strategies (RL, post-training, data engine) being critical to maximizing performance.

Abstract: We present BLIP3o-NEXT, a fully open-source foundation model in the BLIP3
series that advances the next frontier of native image generation. BLIP3o-NEXT
unifies text-to-image generation and image editing within a single
architecture, demonstrating strong image generation and image editing
capabilities. In developing the state-of-the-art native image generation model,
we identify four key insights: (1) Most architectural choices yield comparable
performance; an architecture can be deemed effective provided it scales
efficiently and supports fast inference; (2) The successful application of
reinforcement learning can further push the frontier of native image
generation; (3) Image editing still remains a challenging task, yet instruction
following and the consistency between generated and reference images can be
significantly enhanced through post-training and data engine; (4) Data quality
and scale continue to be decisive factors that determine the upper bound of
model performance. Building upon these insights, BLIP3o-NEXT leverages an
Autoregressive + Diffusion architecture in which an autoregressive model first
generates discrete image tokens conditioned on multimodal inputs, whose hidden
states are then used as conditioning signals for a diffusion model to generate
high-fidelity images. This architecture integrates the reasoning strength and
instruction following of autoregressive models with the fine-detail rendering
ability of diffusion models, achieving a new level of coherence and realism.
Extensive evaluations of various text-to-image and image-editing benchmarks
show that BLIP3o-NEXT achieves superior performance over existing models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiomedXPro uses an evolutionary framework with a large language model to extract biomedical knowledge and optimally generate a diverse ensemble of interpretable natural-language prompts for disease diagnosis, outperforming state-of-the-art prompt-tuning, especially in few-shot settings, and grounding predictions in verifiable clinical features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt-tuning methods for biomedical vision-language models often rely on uninterpretable latent vectors or single prompts, reducing transparency and trustworthiness in high-stakes clinical diagnosis. There is a need for interpretable, diverse prompts that reflect the multifaceted nature of clinical observation.

Method: An evolutionary framework (BiomedXPro) leverages a large language model as both a biomedical knowledge extractor and an adaptive optimizer to automatically produce multiple interpretable NL prompt prompts for diagnosis, forming a diverse ensemble.

Result: BiomedXPro consistently outperforms state-of-the-art prompt-tuning methods on various biomedical benchmarks, with pronounced gains in data-scarce few-shot scenarios; the discovered prompts semantically align with significant clinical features, grounding predictions in verifiable concepts.

Conclusion: Producing a diverse ensemble of interpretable prompts provides a verifiable basis for model predictions and advances trustworthy, clinically-aligned AI in biomedical vision-language tasks.

Abstract: The clinical adoption of biomedical vision-language models is hindered by
prompt optimization techniques that produce either uninterpretable latent
vectors or single textual prompts. This lack of transparency and failure to
capture the multi-faceted nature of clinical diagnosis, which relies on
integrating diverse observations, limits their trustworthiness in high-stakes
settings. To address this, we introduce BiomedXPro, an evolutionary framework
that leverages a large language model as both a biomedical knowledge extractor
and an adaptive optimizer to automatically generate a diverse ensemble of
interpretable, natural-language prompt pairs for disease diagnosis. Experiments
on multiple biomedical benchmarks show that BiomedXPro consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art prompt-tuning methods, particularly in data-scarce few-shot
settings. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a strong semantic alignment
between the discovered prompts and statistically significant clinical features,
grounding the model's performance in verifiable concepts. By producing a
diverse ensemble of interpretable prompts, BiomedXPro provides a verifiable
basis for model predictions, representing a critical step toward the
development of more trustworthy and clinically-aligned AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable AI systems that perceive and reason across vision and audio (and potentially other modalities) with strong alignment, temporal understanding, and open access, addressing limitations of uni-modal or weakly integrated multi-modal models.

Method: Three core innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet to align vision and audio embeddings in a shared omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping to capture relative temporal alignment between vision and audio; (iii) Constrained Rotary Time Embedding to encode absolute temporal information in omni-modal embeddings.

Conclusion: Multi-modal fusion with explicit alignment and temporal mechanisms yields measurable cross-modal and downstream benefits, supporting the value of open omni-modal LLMs for applications in robotics, medical AI, and smart factories.

Abstract: Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive

For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for
strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared

relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii)
Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in
omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that

Motivation: There is a shortage of large-scale, high-quality real-world 3D scans to train generalizable generative models for urban scenes, making annotation-free, scalable synthesis essential for immersive applications.

Method: Utilize satellite imagery to provide coarse geometry of urban blocks and employ an open-domain diffusion model to generate high-quality close-up textures. Apply a curriculum-driven iterative refinement strategy to progressively improve geometric completeness and texture realism, enabling real-time exploration at city-block scale without costly 3D annotations.

Result: Empirical evaluations show Skyfall-GS achieves better cross-view geometric consistency and more realistic textures compared with state-of-the-art approaches, demonstrating scalability and real-time exploration capabilities.

Conclusion: Skyfall-GS offers an effective, annotation-free framework for large-scale, explorable 3D urban scene synthesis, delivering geometry-faithful structure and photorealistic textures suitable for immersive experiences and opening avenues for broader urban-scene generation tasks.

Abstract: Synthesizing large-scale, explorable, and geometrically accurate 3D urban
scenes is a challenging yet valuable task in providing immersive and embodied
applications. The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality
real-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this
paper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by
synergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic
coarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality
close-up appearances. We propose \textbf{Skyfall-GS}, the first city-block
scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring
real-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative
refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and
photorealistic textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyfall-GS
provides improved cross-view consistent geometry and more realistic textures
compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Project page:

### [89] [Autonomous Reactive Masonry Construction using Collaborative Heterogeneous Aerial Robots with Experimental Demonstration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15114)
*Marios-Nektarios Stamatopoulos,Elias Small,Shridhar Velhal,Avijit Banerjee,George Nikolakopoulos*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: First experimental demonstration of fully autonomous aerial masonry construction using heterogeneous UAVs: one brick-carrier places bricks with a ball-joint mechanism, another applies adhesion with an extrusion system; uses reactive mission planning with dependency and conflict graphs, hierarchical state machines, dynamic task allocation, minimum-jerk trajectories, and onboard vision with ArUco-based pose estimation; validates framework experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable autonomous, scalable, and precise aerial masonry construction, addressing coordination, timing, and material application challenges with multiple UAVs.

Method: Developed two UAVs (brick-carrier with ball-joint manipulator; adhesion UAV with servo-valve and extruder), reactive mission planner combining dependency graph and conflict graph, hierarchical state machines for safety, dynamic task allocation, minimum-jerk trajectory generation, onboard ArUco-based brick pose estimation with a least-squares filter.

Result: Experimental validation demonstrating autonomous aerial masonry construction with real-time brick placement and adhesion material application; potential foundation for future autonomous aerial construction.

Conclusion: The work confirms feasibility and provides a framework for heterogeneous UAV collaboration in aerial construction, paving the way for more complex autonomous masonry tasks.

Abstract: This article presents a fully autonomous aerial masonry construction
framework using heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), supported by
experimental validation. Two specialized UAVs were developed for the task: (i)
a brick-carrier UAV equipped with a ball-joint actuation mechanism for precise
brick manipulation, and (ii) an adhesion UAV integrating a servo-controlled
valve and extruder nozzle for accurate adhesion application. The proposed
framework employs a reactive mission planning unit that combines a dependency
graph of the construction layout with a conflict graph to manage simultaneous
task execution, while hierarchical state machines ensure robust operation and
safe transitions during task execution. Dynamic task allocation allows
real-time adaptation to environmental feedback, while minimum-jerk trajectory
generation ensures smooth and precise UAV motion during brick pickup and
placement. Additionally, the brick-carrier UAV employs an onboard vision system
that estimates brick poses in real time using ArUco markers and a least-squares
optimization filter, enabling accurate alignment during construction. To the
best of the authors' knowledge, this work represents the first experimental
demonstration of fully autonomous aerial masonry construction using
heterogeneous UAVs, where one UAV precisely places the bricks while another
autonomously applies adhesion material between them. The experimental results
supported by the video showcase the effectiveness of the proposed framework and
demonstrate its potential to serve as a foundation for future developments in
autonomous aerial robotic construction.

*Xiangyu Chen,Chuhao Zhou,Yuxi Liu,Jianfei Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RM-RL unifies online and offline RL through a role-model labeling strategy, enabling demonstration-free, efficient policy learning for precise robot manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise manipulation tasks demand extremely high accuracy; obtaining high-quality expert demonstrations is costly and offline RL suffers from distribution shifts and data inefficiency. A demonstration-free, data-efficient online learning framework that can also reuse data offline is highly desirable.

Method: Introduce Role-Model Reinforcement Learning (RM-RL) that automatically generates labels for online training data using approximately optimal actions. Reformulates policy learning as supervised learning, reducing distribution-mismatch instability. Includes a hybrid online-offline training scheme to reuse role-model data.

Result: RM-RL converges faster and more stably than existing RL methods. Reported gains include a 53% improvement in translation accuracy and 20% in rotation accuracy. Demonstrates precise placement of a cell plate onto a shelf, a task where prior methods fail.

Conclusion: RM-RL unifies online and offline RL through role-model-guided labeling, reduces reliance on human demonstrations, mitigates distribution shifts, and enhances data efficiency, showing strong practical efficacy in high-precision robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Precise robot manipulation is critical for fine-grained applications such as
chemical and biological experiments, where even small errors (e.g., reagent
spillage) can invalidate an entire task. Existing approaches often rely on
pre-collected expert demonstrations and train policies via imitation learning
(IL) or offline reinforcement learning (RL). However, obtaining high-quality
demonstrations for precision tasks is difficult and time-consuming, while
offline RL commonly suffers from distribution shifts and low data efficiency.
We introduce a Role-Model Reinforcement Learning (RM-RL) framework that unifies
online and offline training in real-world environments. The key idea is a
role-model strategy that automatically generates labels for online training
data using approximately optimal actions, eliminating the need for human
demonstrations. RM-RL reformulates policy learning as supervised training,
reducing instability from distribution mismatch and improving efficiency. A
hybrid training scheme further leverages online role-model data for offline
reuse, enhancing data efficiency through repeated sampling. Extensive
experiments show that RM-RL converges faster and more stably than existing RL
methods, yielding significant gains in real-world manipulation: 53% improvement
in translation accuracy and 20% in rotation accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate
the successful execution of a challenging task, precisely placing a cell plate
onto a shelf, highlighting the framework's effectiveness where prior methods
fail.

### [91] [Lagrange-Poincaré-Kepler Equations of Disturbed Space-Manipulator Systems in Orbit](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15199)
*Borna Monazzah Moghaddam,Robin Chhabra*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Extends Lagrange-Poincare Equations (LPE) to Lagrange-Poincare-Kepler Equations (LPKE) for spacecraft-manipulator dynamics in a non-inertial orbital frame. Combines base Euler-Poincare dynamics, Keplerian orbital frame dynamics, and reduced Euler-Lagrange equations for the manipulator with exponential coordinates. Derives closed-form structural matrices via Lagrange-d'Alembert on principal bundles, incorporating orbital disturbances and symmetry-breaking wrenches. Demonstrated on a 7-DOF manipulator, showing numerical advantages and integration readiness for hardware-in-the-loop control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To accurately model and control spacecraft-manipulator systems operating in rotating, non-inertial orbital frames, capturing the coupling between attitude, orbital motion, and manipulator kinematics, and enabling seamless integration into simulation and model-based control.

Method: Apply Lagrange-Poincare reduction to couple Euler-Poincare base dynamics with Keplerian orbital dynamics and reduced Euler-Lagrange equations for the manipulator’s shape space using exponential coordinates. Use the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle on principal bundles to derive closed-form structural matrices that reveal orbital disturbances and their coupling with the manipulator. Include externally applied, symmetry-breaking wrenches and demonstrate via a 7-DOF spacecraft-mounted manipulator.

Result: A validated LPKE framework with explicit coupling matrices capturing orbital disturbances and manipulator dynamics. Simulation study on a 7-DOF manipulator shows effectiveness and numerical advantages, and the method accommodates hardware-in-the-loop integration and control design.

Conclusion: LPKE offers a unified, computationally tractable framework for modeling and controlling orbital-spacecraft-manipulator systems under disturbances, facilitating model-based control and autonomous orbital operations with straightforward incorporation of external wrenches.

Abstract: This article presents an extension of the Lagrange-Poincare Equations (LPE)
to model the dynamics of spacecraft-manipulator systems operating within a
non-inertial orbital reference frame. Building upon prior formulations of LPE
for vehicle-manipulator systems, the proposed framework, termed the
Lagrange-Poincare-Kepler Equations (LPKE), incorporates the coupling between
spacecraft attitude dynamics, orbital motion, and manipulator kinematics. The
formalism combines the Euler-Poincare equations for the base spacecraft,
Keplerian orbital dynamics for the reference frame, and reduced Euler-Lagrange
equations for the manipulator's shape space, using an exponential joint
parametrization. Leveraging the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle on principal
bundles, we derive novel closed-form structural matrices that explicitly
capture the effects of orbital disturbances and their dynamic coupling with the
manipulator system. The LPKE framework also systematically includes externally
applied, symmetry-breaking wrenches, allowing for immediate integration into
hardware-in-the-loop simulations and model-based control architectures for
autonomous robotic operations in the orbital environment. To illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model and its numerical superiority, we present a
simulation study analyzing orbital effects on a 7-degree-of-freedom manipulator
mounted on a spacecraft.

### [92] [LVI-Q: Robust LiDAR-Visual-Inertial-Kinematic Odometry for Quadruped Robots Using Tightly-Coupled and Efficient Alternating Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15220)
*Kevin Christiansen Marsim,Minho Oh,Byeongho Yu,Seungjae Lee,I Made Aswin Nahrendra,Hyungtae Lim,Hyun Myung*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A robust multi-sensor fusion SLAM for legged robots using parallel VIKO and LIKO pipelines: optimization-based visual-inertial-kinematic odometry (VIKO) with foot preintegration and superpixel depth consistency, and filter-based LiDAR-inertial-kinematic odometry (LIKO) with foot kinematics and point-to-plane residuals in an ESIKF, to reduce drift in complex environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLAM drift and fragility in challenging, dynamic environments due to unsuitable or limited sensor fusion strategies; legged robots require reliable, multi-modal perception to operate safely and efficiently.

Method: The framework runs two fusion tracks based on measurement availability: (1) VIKO — optimization-based visual-inertial-kinematic odometry using camera, IMU, and joint encoders with foot preintegration and robust LiDAR-visual depth consistency via superpixel clusters in a sliding-window optimization; (2) LIKO — filter-based LiDAR-inertial-kinematic odometry using foot kinematics and a point-to-plane residual in an error-state Kalman filter (ESIKF). The fusion of these tracks yields robust pose estimation across modalities.

Result: Compared with other sensor fusion-based SLAM approaches, the proposed system demonstrates robust performance on public and long-term datasets, indicating improved drift robustness and reliability in diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: A dual-track fusion framework integrating visual, LiDAR, inertial, and kinematic information provides robust SLAM for legged robots in complex and dynamic environments, outperforming single-modality or less integrated fusion methods.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation for legged robots in complex and dynamic environments
relies on robust simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems to
accurately map surroundings and localize the robot, ensuring safe and efficient
operation. While prior sensor fusion-based SLAM approaches have integrated
various sensor modalities to improve their robustness, these algorithms are
still susceptible to estimation drift in challenging environments due to their
reliance on unsuitable fusion strategies. Therefore, we propose a robust
LiDAR-visual-inertial-kinematic odometry system that integrates information
from multiple sensors, such as a camera, LiDAR, inertial measurement unit
(IMU), and joint encoders, for visual and LiDAR-based odometry estimation. Our
system employs a fusion-based pose estimation approach that runs
optimization-based visual-inertial-kinematic odometry (VIKO) and filter-based
LiDAR-inertial-kinematic odometry (LIKO) based on measurement availability. In
VIKO, we utilize the footpreintegration technique and robust LiDAR-visual depth
consistency using superpixel clusters in a sliding window optimization. In
LIKO, we incorporate foot kinematics and employ a point-toplane residual in an
error-state iterative Kalman filter (ESIKF). Compared with other sensor
fusion-based SLAM algorithms, our approach shows robust performance across
public and longterm datasets.

### [93] [PolyFly: Polytopic Optimal Planning for Collision-Free Cable-Suspended Aerial Payload Transportation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15226)
*Mrunal Sarvaiya,Guanrui Li,Giuseppe Loianno*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PolyFly introduces an optimal global planner for aerial transport with suspended cables, using independent, orientation-aware polytopes to model the robot, cable, payload, and environment; it converts polytope constraints into smooth differentiable constraints via duality, yielding faster trajectories than state-of-the-art and validated experimentally.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dense, constrained environments (forests, collapsed buildings) require rapid, safe maneuvers. Existing geometric over-approximation is conservative, causing long flight times.

Method: Model each component (quadrotor, cable, payload, obstacles) as independent polytopes with orientation-aware polytopes; formulate an optimal control problem; use duality to convert polytope constraints into smooth differentiable costs/constraints; solve globally; compare against state-of-the-art in eight maze-like environments; validate on a real quadrotor with suspended payload.

Result: PolyFly produces faster trajectories in all eight maze-like scenarios; shows practical reliability and accuracy in real-world experiments on a quadrotor with a suspended payload.

Conclusion: Non-conservative polytope-based representation enables aggressive, efficient flight in constrained environments for aerial transportation, reducing flight time while maintaining safety; applicable to disaster response and rescue operations.

Abstract: Aerial transportation robots using suspended cables have emerged as versatile
platforms for disaster response and rescue operations. To maximize the
capabilities of these systems, robots need to aggressively fly through tightly
constrained environments, such as dense forests and structurally unsafe
buildings, while minimizing flight time and avoiding obstacles. Existing
methods geometrically over-approximate the vehicle and obstacles, leading to
conservative maneuvers and increased flight times. We eliminate these
restrictions by proposing PolyFly, an optimal global planner which considers a
non-conservative representation for aerial transportation by modeling each
physical component of the environment, and the robot (quadrotor, cable and
payload), as independent polytopes. We further increase the model accuracy by
incorporating the attitude of the physical components by constructing
orientation-aware polytopes. The resulting optimal control problem is
efficiently solved by converting the polytope constraints into smooth
differentiable constraints via duality theory. We compare our method against
the existing state-of-the-art approach in eight maze-like environments and show
that PolyFly produces faster trajectories in each scenario. We also
experimentally validate our proposed approach on a real quadrotor with a
suspended payload, demonstrating the practical reliability and accuracy of our
method.

### [94] [A Generalized Sylvester-Fermat-Torricelli problem with application in disaster relief operations by UAVs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15229)
*Sina Kazemdehbashi,Yanchao Liu,Boris S. Mordukhovich*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces the Sylvester-Fermat-Torricelli (SFT) problem, a generalized optimization framework for locating a mobile UAV station under wind, UAV heterogeneity, and bidirectional motion, extending the classical Sylvester problem; claims substantial efficiency gains in post-disaster missions (up to 84% reduction in wasted time).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disaster response requires rapid data collection and communications; disasters can destroy infrastructure, making traditional networks unreliable. UAV fleets offer rapid deployability, but wind effects, drone heterogeneity, and necessary back-and-forth maneuvering complicate optimal placement. The work aims to provide a unified, realistic optimization framework.

Method: Generalizes the Sylvester problem into the Sylvester-Fermat-Torricelli (SFT) framework by explicitly modeling wind influence, heterogeneity of UAVs, and back-and-forth motion. Develops a mathematical formulation and (implied) computational approach to determine the optimal location for a mobile UAV station.

Result: Experimental results indicate a substantial improvement, with up to 84% reduction in wasted operational time during post-disaster missions, demonstrating practical efficiency gains of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: The SFT framework enhances the practicality of UAV-based disaster response by incorporating real-world factors like wind and UAV heterogeneity, offering a unified tool for faster and more effective data collection and rescue coordination; opens avenues for further refinement and broader validation.

Abstract: Natural and human-made disasters can cause severe devastation and claim
thousands of lives worldwide. Therefore, developing efficient methods for
disaster response and management is a critical task for relief teams. One of
the most essential components of effective response is the rapid collection of
information about affected areas, damages, and victims. More data translates
into better coordination, faster rescue operations, and ultimately, more lives
saved. However, in some disasters, such as earthquakes, the communication
infrastructure is often partially or completely destroyed, making it extremely
difficult for victims to send distress signals and for rescue teams to locate
and assist them in time. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as
valuable tools in such scenarios. In particular, a fleet of UAVs can be
dispatched from a mobile station to the affected area to facilitate data
collection and establish temporary communication networks. Nevertheless,
real-world deployment of UAVs faces several challenges, with adverse weather
conditions--especially wind--being among the most significant. To address this,
we develop a novel mathematical framework to determine the optimal location of
a mobile UAV station while explicitly accounting for the heterogeneity of the
UAVs and the effect of wind. In particular, we generalize the Sylvester problem
to introduce the Sylvester-Fermat-Torricelli (SFT) problem, which captures
complex factors such as wind influence, UAV heterogeneity, and back-and-forth
motion within a unified framework. The proposed framework enhances the
practicality of UAV-based disaster response planning by accounting for
real-world factors such as wind and UAV heterogeneity. Experimental results
demonstrate that it can reduce wasted operational time by up to 84%, making
post-disaster missions significantly more efficient and effective.

*Jeewon Kim,Minho Oh,Hyun Myung*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A traversability-aware room segmentation method integrated with hierarchical scene graphs and pose-graph optimization to address over-/under-segmentation caused by limited FOV and viewpoint changes, improving semantic coherence and optimization efficiency; validated on repeated traversals showing better room re-detection and faster optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve localization and mapping reliability in robotics by ensuring consistent room-level semantics and robust pose-graph constraints. Current real-time methods over-segment large rooms and voxel-based approaches under-segment non-enclosed spaces, leading to unreliable optimization and constraints.

Method: Propose a traversability-aware room segmentation that enforces feasible traversability information and interacts with surroundings. Integrates this segmentation within hierarchical scene graphs and tightly couples with pose-graph optimization to propagate semantic constraints across levels while maintaining computational efficiency.

Result: Enhanced semantic coherence and computational efficiency of pose-graph optimization. Demonstrated by higher re-detection frequency of the same rooms in datasets with repeated traversals along the same path and reduced optimization time.

Conclusion: Traversability-aware room segmentation improves both semantic consistency and optimization performance, enabling more reliable localization and mapping in dynamic robotic environments.

Abstract: Scene graphs enhance 3D mapping capabilities in robotics by understanding the
relationships between different spatial elements, such as rooms and objects.
Recent research extends scene graphs to hierarchical layers, adding and
leveraging constraints across these levels. This approach is tightly integrated
with pose-graph optimization, improving both localization and mapping accuracy
simultaneously. However, when segmenting spatial characteristics, consistently
recognizing rooms becomes challenging due to variations in viewpoints and
limited field of view (FOV) of sensors. For example, existing real-time
approaches often over-segment large rooms into smaller, non-functional spaces
that are not useful for localization and mapping due to the time-dependent
method. Conversely, their voxel-based room segmentation method often
under-segment in complex cases like not fully enclosed 3D space that are
non-traversable for ground robots or humans, leading to false constraints in
pose-graph optimization. We propose a traversability-aware room segmentation
method that considers the interaction between robots and surroundings, with
consistent feasibility of traversability information. This enhances both the
semantic coherence and computational efficiency of pose-graph optimization.
Improved performance is demonstrated through the re-detection frequency of the
same rooms in a dataset involving repeated traversals of the same space along
the same path, as well as the optimization time consumption.

### [96] [ASBI: Leveraging Informative Real-World Data for Active Black-Box Simulator Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15331)
*Gahee Kim,Takamitsu Matsubara*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ASBI actively collects real-world data with a robot to tune black-box simulators by maximizing information gain, and uses Neural Posterior Estimation to cope with inaccessible likelihoods; demonstrated in three simulations and a real bucket-pouring task for beads vs. gravel.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In black-box simulators, likelihoods are inaccessible, making parameter estimation difficult. SBI requires informative observations, but the relationship between parameters and observations is unknown. ASBI proposes active data collection via robotic actions to obtain informative online data for accurate tuning.

Method: Select robot actions that maximize expected information gain (reduction in Shannon entropy between prior and posterior). Since the likelihood is unavailable, employ Neural Posterior Estimation to learn the posterior. Validate with three simulation experiments and a real-robot demonstration estimating cubic-particle simulator parameters for beads and gravel during a bucket-pouring task.

Result: Three simulation experiments show accurate parameter estimation with posteriors sharply concentrated near true values. A real-robot experiment demonstrates estimating simulator parameters for beads and gravel (cubic particles) in a bucket-pouring action.

Conclusion: ASBI enables effective tuning of black-box simulators through active data collection guided by information gain, with neural posterior estimation enabling likelihood-free inference; demonstrated feasibility both in simulation and on a real robot.

Abstract: Black-box simulators are widely used in robotics, but optimizing their
parameters remains challenging due to inaccessible likelihoods.
Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) tackles this issue using simulation-driven
approaches, estimating the posterior from offline real observations and forward
simulations. However, in black-box scenarios, preparing observations that
contain sufficient information for parameter estimation is difficult due to the
unknown relationship between parameters and observations. In this work, we
present Active Simulation-Based Inference (ASBI), a parameter estimation
framework that uses robots to actively collect real-world online data to
achieve accurate black-box simulator tuning. Our framework optimizes robot
actions to collect informative observations by maximizing information gain,
which is defined as the expected reduction in Shannon entropy between the
posterior and the prior. While calculating information gain requires the
likelihood, which is inaccessible in black-box simulators, our method solves
this problem by leveraging Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE), which leverages a
neural network to learn the posterior estimator. Three simulation experiments
quantitatively verify that our method achieves accurate parameter estimation,
with posteriors sharply concentrated around the true parameters. Moreover, we
show a practical application using a real robot to estimate the simulation
parameters of cubic particles corresponding to two real objects, beads and
gravel, with a bucket pouring action.

*Liviu-Mihai Stan,Ranulfo Bezerra,Shotaro Kojima,Tsige Tadesse Alemayoh,Satoshi Tadokoro,Masashi Konyo,Kazunori Ohno*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces an adaptive Movable Obstacles Layer and Slow-Pose Progress Checker inside ROS2 Nav2 to recognize potentially movable obstacles from LiDAR data and adapt planning costs, improving goal reach and reducing deadlocks in cluttered indoor environments with CPU-efficient, planar-scan processing (open source).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable navigation in disaster-response and unstructured indoor settings requires robots to identify obstacles that can be pushed aside, rather than treating all obstructions as fixed. This motivates a resource-efficient, interaction-aware planning extension for ROS2 Nav2.

Method: Adds a Movable Obstacles Layer that labels LiDAR returns missing from a prior static map as tentatively movable and assigns a reduced traversal cost. A Slow-Pose Progress Checker monitors the ratio of commanded to actual velocity; when the robot slows, local cost increases from light to heavy, and on stall to lethal, causing the global planner to back out and re-route. Implemented in the ROS2 Nav2 stack and evaluated in Gazebo with a Scout Mini across isolated and cluttered environments using CPU-only, planar scans.

Result: Gazebo experiments show higher goal-reach rates and fewer deadlocks compared with a no-layer baseline, with traversal times broadly comparable.

Conclusion: Interaction-aware cost maps are a lightweight, ROS2-native extension for navigating among movable obstacles in unstructured settings; the approach is suitable for resource-constrained robots and will be released as open source at the provided URL.

Abstract: Reliable navigation in disaster-response and other unstructured indoor
settings requires robots not only to avoid obstacles but also to recognise when
those obstacles can be pushed aside. We present an adaptive, LiDAR and
odometry-based path-planning framework that embeds this capability into the
ROS2 Nav2 stack. A new Movable Obstacles Layer labels all LiDAR returns missing
from a prior static map as tentatively movable and assigns a reduced traversal
cost. A companion Slow-Pose Progress Checker monitors the ratio of commanded to
actual velocity; when the robot slows appreciably, the local cost is raised
from light to heavy, and on a stall to lethal, prompting the global planner to
back out and re-route. Gazebo evaluations on a Scout Mini, spanning isolated
objects and cluttered corridors, show higher goal-reach rates and fewer
deadlocks than a no-layer baseline, with traversal times broadly comparable.
Because the method relies only on planar scans and CPU-level computation, it
suits resource-constrained search and rescue robots and integrates into
heterogeneous platforms with minimal engineering. Overall, the results indicate
that interaction-aware cost maps are a lightweight, ROS2-native extension for
navigating among potentially movable obstacles in unstructured settings. The
full implementation will be released as open source

Provide a unified formulation for hydrodynamic constraints and irreversible settlement, with empirical validation under flow.

Result: NOAH demonstrates high performance in underwater swarm scenarios, including an 86% success rate for permanent anchoring under flow, and offers a validated foundation for scalable, energy-efficient underwater swarm robotics.

Conclusion: NOAH offers a unified, scalable approach to underwater swarm robotics that addresses hydrodynamic constraints and irreversible settlement, enabling persistent sensing and efficient exploration in challenging aquatic environments.

Abstract: Autonomous Underwater vehicles must operate in strong currents, limited
acoustic bandwidth, and persistent sensing requirements where conventional
swarm optimisation methods are unreliable. This paper presents NOAH, a novel
nature-inspired swarm optimisation algorithm that combines current-aware drift,
irreversible settlement in persistent sensing nodes, and colony-based
communication. Drawing inspiration from the behaviour of barnacle nauplii, NOAH
addresses the critical limitations of existing swarm algorithms by providing
hydrodynamic awareness, irreversible anchoring mechanisms, and colony-based
communication capabilities essential for underwater exploration missions. The
algorithm establishes a comprehensive foundation for scalable and
energy-efficient underwater swarm robotics with validated performance analysis.
Validation studies demonstrate an 86% success rate for permanent anchoring
scenarios, providing a unified formulation for hydrodynamic constraints and

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Reactive force-feedback 6-DoF deboning policy trained in a multi-material cutting simulator with a physical testbed, enabling sim-to-real transfer and up to 4x improvement over open-loop baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety concerns and precision requirements in deboning: navigating a narrow, partially occluded, deformable, multi-material chicken shoulder joint while avoiding bone contact. The problem requires robust control under contact dynamics and generalizable policies.

Method: Develop an open-source multi-material cutting simulator modeling coupling, fracture, and cutting forces; build a reusable physical testbed with two rigid bone-sphere representations in a soft block; train and deploy a residual RL policy using discretized force observations and domain randomization to achieve zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and 6-DoF knife control.

Result: Demonstrated across simulator, physical testbed, and real chicken shoulders: the learned policy reliably navigates the joint gap, reduces bone/cartilage contact, and yields up to 4x improved success rate and bone avoidance compared with open-loop baselines; force feedback is shown to be necessary for safe and effective cutting.

Conclusion: Shows viability of force-feedback learned policies for complex, multi-material cutting tasks; provides reusable simulator and testbed for rapid prototyping and evaluation; demonstrates real-world deboning with sim-to-real transfer and highlights the importance of force sensing for safety and performance.

Abstract: Automating chicken shoulder deboning requires precise 6-DoF cutting through a
partially occluded, deformable, multi-material joint, since contact with the
bones presents serious health and safety risks. Our work makes both
systems-level and algorithmic contributions to train and deploy a reactive
force-feedback cutting policy that dynamically adapts a nominal trajectory and
enables full 6-DoF knife control to traverse the narrow joint gap while
avoiding contact with the bones. First, we introduce an open-source
custom-built simulator for multi-material cutting that models coupling,
fracture, and cutting forces, and supports reinforcement learning, enabling
efficient training and rapid prototyping. Second, we design a reusable physical
testbed to emulate the chicken shoulder: two rigid "bone" spheres with
controllable pose embedded in a softer block, enabling rigorous and repeatable
evaluation while preserving essential multi-material characteristics of the
target problem. Third, we train and deploy a residual RL policy, with
discretized force observations and domain randomization, enabling robust
zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and the first demonstration of a learned policy
that debones a real chicken shoulder. Our experiments in our simulator, on our
physical testbed, and on real chicken shoulders show that our learned policy
reliably navigates the joint gap and reduces undesired bone/cartilage contact,
resulting in up to a 4x improvement over existing open-loop cutting baselines
in terms of success rate and bone avoidance. Our results also illustrate the
necessity of force feedback for safe and effective multi-material cutting. The

### [101] [VDRive: Leveraging Reinforced VLA and Diffusion Policy for End-to-end Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15446)
*Ziang Guo,Zufeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: VDRive is an end-to-end autonomous driving pipeline that explicitly maps states to actions to improve robustness and interpretability in dynamic environments, leveraging a Vision-Language Action Model with a diffusion-based action head and CVQ-VAE tokenization, trained via actor-critic reinforcement learning; achieves state-of-the-art results on Bench2Drive and nuScenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address robustness challenges in ego-vehicle perception and decision-making under dynamic environments and corner cases, providing interpretable state-action mappings.

Method: Integrates Vision-Language Action Model (VLA) with a diffusion-policy action head; contextual prediction of future observations as discrete CVQ-VAE codes; reinforcement learning fine-tuning to predict future trajectories and actions; VLA supplies current and predicted state tokens to a policy head generating hierarchical actions; actor-critic framework with a learned critic for gradient feedback.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Bench2Drive (closed-loop) and nuScenes (open-loop planning).

Conclusion: Demonstrates that explicit state-action mapping via token-based state representations and RL refinement yields robust, interpretable end-to-end autonomous driving, capable of handling dynamic environments and corner cases.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, dynamic environment and corner cases pose significant
challenges to the robustness of ego vehicle's state understanding and decision
making. We introduce VDRive, a novel pipeline for end-to-end autonomous driving
that explicitly models state-action mapping to address these challenges,
enabling interpretable and robust decision making. By leveraging the
advancement of the state understanding of the Vision Language Action Model
(VLA) with generative diffusion policy-based action head, our VDRive guides the
driving contextually and geometrically. Contextually, VLA predicts future
observations through token generation pre-training, where the observations are
represented as discrete codes by a Conditional Vector Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (CVQ-VAE). Geometrically, we perform reinforcement learning
fine-tuning of the VLA to predict future trajectories and actions based on
current driving conditions. VLA supplies the current state tokens and predicted
state tokens for the action policy head to generate hierarchical actions and
trajectories. During policy training, a learned critic evaluates the actions
generated by the policy and provides gradient-based feedback, forming an
actor-critic framework that enables a reinforcement-based policy learning
pipeline. Experiments show that our VDRive achieves state-of-the-art
performance in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and nuScenes open-loop
planning.

### [102] [Perfect Prediction or Plenty of Proposals? What Matters Most in Planning for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15505)
*Aron Distelzweig,Faris Janjoš,Oliver Scheel,Sirish Reddy Varra,Raghu Rajan,Joschka Boedecker*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: IPP research reveals that even perfect future predictions do not improve planning; a proposal-centric approach based on PDM with diverse, realistic proposals achieves state-of-the-art in challenging autonomous driving scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether integrating prediction into planning actually improves decision-making across benchmarks with varying interaction complexity; to examine how current IPP methods use future information and to improve planning in out-of-distribution and highly interactive contexts.

Method: Empirical analysis on the Val14 benchmark (low interaction) and the interPlan benchmark (highly interactive/out-of-distribution). Evaluates the impact of access to perfect future predictions, compares against imitation-learning planners, identifies weaknesses in proposal generation, and develops an enhanced proposal-generation method built on PDM that emphasizes diverse, realistic, high-quality proposals for collision checking.

Result: Finds that perfect future predictions do not improve planning; many imitation-learning-based planners underperform versus a simple lane-following baseline (PDM). The proposed proposal-centric method significantly outperforms existing IPP methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results, especially in out-of-distribution and highly interactive settings.

Conclusion: Current IPP approaches fail to leverage future information effectively. Shifting focus to generating diverse, high-quality proposals (used for collision checks) yields better planning performance in challenging scenarios, suggesting a reevaluation of IPP design toward proposal-centric strategies.

Abstract: Traditionally, prediction and planning in autonomous driving (AD) have been
treated as separate, sequential modules. Recently, there has been a growing
shift towards tighter integration of these components, known as Integrated
Prediction and Planning (IPP), with the aim of enabling more informed and
adaptive decision-making. However, it remains unclear to what extent this
integration actually improves planning performance. In this work, we
investigate the role of prediction in IPP approaches, drawing on the widely
adopted Val14 benchmark, which encompasses more common driving scenarios with
relatively low interaction complexity, and the interPlan benchmark, which
includes highly interactive and out-of-distribution driving situations. Our
analysis reveals that even access to perfect future predictions does not lead
to better planning outcomes, indicating that current IPP methods often fail to
fully exploit future behavior information. Instead, we focus on high-quality
proposal generation, while using predictions primarily for collision checks. We
find that many imitation learning-based planners struggle to generate realistic
and plausible proposals, performing worse than PDM - a simple lane-following
approach. Motivated by this observation, we build on PDM with an enhanced
proposal generation method, shifting the emphasis towards producing diverse but
realistic and high-quality proposals. This proposal-centric approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in out-of-distribution
and highly interactive settings, where it sets new state-of-the-art results.

### [103] [VO-DP: Semantic-Geometric Adaptive Diffusion Policy for Vision-Only Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15530)
*Zehao Ni,Yonghao He,Lingfeng Qian,Jilei Mao,Fa Fu,Wei Sui,Hu Su,Junran Peng,Zhipeng Wang,Bin He*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Vision-only, single-view diffusion policy VO-DP leverages pretrained visual foundation models to fuse semantic and geometric features, achieving competitive performance with point-cloud methods and offering an open-source training library.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the reliance on point-cloud inputs in imitation-learning diffusion policies by exploring vision-only solutions that exploit pretrained visual models to fuse semantic and geometric cues for robust manipulation.

Method: VO-DP uses intermediate VGGT features: semantic from DINOv2 and geometric from Alternating Attention; fused via cross-attention and spatially compressed with a CNN, forming input to the policy head. A training library built on Accelerate enables multi-GPU/multi-machine, mixed-precision training and compatibility with DP, DP3, and VO-DP, plus RoboTwin support.

Result: In simulation, VO-DP achieves 64.6% success (DP3: 64.0%; DP: 34.8%). In real-world tasks, VO-DP reaches 87.9% (DP3: 67.5%; DP: 11.2%). VO-DP also demonstrates robustness to color, size, background, and lighting changes, and the authors open-source their training library.

Conclusion: Vision-only diffusion policies enabled by foundation-model fusion of semantic and geometric cues can perform on par with, or better than, point-cloud-based methods in manipulation tasks, with strong real-world robustness and accessible tooling for broader research.

Abstract: In the context of imitation learning, visuomotor-based diffusion policy
learning is one of the main directions in robotic manipulation. Most of these
approaches rely on point clouds as observation inputs and construct scene
representations through point clouds feature learning, which enables them to
achieve remarkable accuracy. However, the existing literature lacks an in-depth
exploration of vision-only solutions that have significant potential. In this
paper, we propose a Vision-Only and single-view Diffusion Policy learning
method (VO-DP) that leverages pretrained visual foundation models to achieve
effective fusion of semantic and geometric features. We utilize intermediate
features from VGGT incorporating semantic features from DINOv2 and geometric
features from Alternating Attention blocks. Features are fused via
cross-attention and spatially compressed with a CNN to form the input to the
policy head. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VO-DP not only outperforms
the vision-only baseline DP significantly but also exhibits distinct
performance trends against the point cloud-based method DP3: in simulation
tasks, VO-DP achieves an average success rate of 64.6% on par with DP3 64.0%
and far higher than DP 34.8%, while in real-world tasks, it reaches 87.9%,
outperforming both DP3 67.5% and DP 11.2% by a notable margin. Further
robustness evaluations confirm that VO-DP remains highly stable under varying
conditions including color, size, background, and lighting. Lastly, we
open-source a training library for robotic manipulation. Built on Accelerate,
this library supports multi-machine and multi-GPU parallel training, as well as
mixed precision training. It is compatible with visuomotor policies such as DP,
DP3 and VO-DP, and also supports the RoboTwin simulator.

### [104] [Improved Extended Kalman Filter-Based Disturbance Observers for Exoskeletons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15533)
*Shilei Li,Dawei Shi,Makoto Iwasaki,Yan Ning,Hongpeng Zhou,Ling Shi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Two novel disturbance observers for a 2-DoF control system reduce joint tracking errors under unknown disturbances; IMM-EKF DO and MKC-EKF DO outperform a standard EKF disturbance observer in exoskeleton tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unknown disturbance dynamics degrade nominal performance. Decoupling nominal tracking from disturbance rejection is desirable, but perfect disturbance rejection is unattainable when disturbance dynamics are unknown. The work also identifies a trade-off between tracking speed and tracking uncertainty in disturbance estimation.

Method: 1) Interacting Multiple Model Extended Kalman Filter-based disturbance observer (IMM-EKF DO). 2) Multi-kernel correntropy EKF-based disturbance observer (MKC-EKF DO). Both are integrated into a two-degree-of-freedom control structure and evaluated on an exoskeleton under time-varying interaction forces.

Result: Hip joint error reduced by 36.3% (IMM) and 16.2% (MKC) versus EKF DO. Knee joint error reduced by 46.3% (IMM) and 24.4% (MKC) versus EKF DO.

Conclusion: The two proposed disturbance observers outperform the EKF-based disturbance observer under time-varying interaction forces, demonstrating superior disturbance estimation and improved tracking accuracy for the exoskeleton.

Abstract: The nominal performance of mechanical systems is often degraded by unknown
disturbances. A two-degree-of-freedom control structure can decouple nominal
performance from disturbance rejection. However, perfect disturbance rejection
is unattainable when the disturbance dynamic is unknown. In this work, we
reveal an inherent trade-off in disturbance estimation subject to tracking
speed and tracking uncertainty. Then, we propose two novel methods to enhance
disturbance estimation: an interacting multiple model extended Kalman
filter-based disturbance observer and a multi-kernel correntropy extended
Kalman filter-based disturbance observer. Experiments on an exoskeleton verify
that the proposed two methods improve the tracking accuracy $36.3\%$ and
$16.2\%$ in hip joint error, and $46.3\%$ and $24.4\%$ in knee joint error,
respectively, compared to the extended Kalman filter-based disturbance
observer, in a time-varying interaction force scenario, demonstrating the
superiority of the proposed method.

*Hongyu Zhou,Xiaoyu Zhang,Vasileios Tzoumas*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An online-learning MPC framework for adaptive legged locomotion using residual dynamics approximated by random Fourier features; achieves sublinear dynamic regret and handles unknown disturbances; validated in Gazebo and MuJoCo across varied terrains and payloads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous quadrupeds must operate under unknown uncertainties such as payload changes, terrain variations, and external disturbances.

Method: Two-module approach: MPC for planning with an online learned residual dynamics; residuals modeled via random Fourier features in RKHS; online self-supervised least-squares update using data collected during control; dynamic regret bound; simulations in Gazebo and MuJoCo with various disturbances.

Result: Demonstrates sublinear dynamic regret; robust trajectory tracking under constant unknown external forces up to 12g in flat terrain, slope up to 20 degrees, and rough terrain; time-varying disturbances with payload up to 8 kg and changing ground friction in flat terrain.

Conclusion: The approach effectively combines online learning of residuals with MPC to enable robust, adaptive legged locomotion under real-world uncertainty, showing promise for autonomous quadrupeds on varied terrains.

Abstract: We provide an algorithm for adaptive legged locomotion via online learning
and model predictive control. The algorithm is composed of two interacting
modules: model predictive control (MPC) and online learning of residual
dynamics. The residual dynamics can represent modeling errors and external
disturbances. We are motivated by the future of autonomy where quadrupeds will
autonomously perform complex tasks despite real-world unknown uncertainty, such
as unknown payload and uneven terrains. The algorithm uses random Fourier
features to approximate the residual dynamics in reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces. Then, it employs MPC based on the current learned model of the residual
dynamics. The model is updated online in a self-supervised manner using least
squares based on the data collected while controlling the quadruped. The
algorithm enjoys sublinear \textit{dynamic regret}, defined as the
suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the
residual dynamics. We validate our algorithm in Gazebo and MuJoCo simulations,
where the quadruped aims to track reference trajectories. The Gazebo
simulations include constant unknown external forces up to $12\boldsymbol{g}$,
where $\boldsymbol{g}$ is the gravity vector, in flat terrain, slope terrain
with $20\degree$ inclination, and rough terrain with $0.25m$ height variation.
The MuJoCo simulations include time-varying unknown disturbances with payload
up to $8~kg$ and time-varying ground friction coefficients in flat terrain.

TL;DR: LEGO-based, tendon-driven, underactuated anthropomorphic hand that demonstrates adaptive grasping via soft synergies, designed for education with simple actuation using LEGO parts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Make advanced robotic hand concepts accessible to students and hobbyists, fostering hands-on learning and inspiration in modern robotics.

Method: Dual motors drive agonist/antagonist tendon pairs on each finger; soft synergy implemented through a differential mechanism with clutch gears; fully constructed from LEGO; tested for grasping a variety of objects with simple actuation.

Result: Shows reactive fine control and broad object grasping; education-friendly, reproducible design leveraging common home equipment; demonstrates key soft-robotics principles in a tangible way.

Conclusion: Educational potential is high, with scope to engage a wider audience in robotics; future work could explore enhanced feedback, tuning of synergy parameters, and expanded object sets for grasp testing.

Abstract: This paper introduces an anthropomorphic robot hand built entirely using LEGO
MINDSTORMS: the Educational SoftHand-A, a tendon-driven, highly-underactuated
robot hand based on the Pisa/IIT SoftHand and related hands. To be suitable for
an educational context, the design is constrained to use only standard LEGO
pieces with tests using common equipment available at home. The hand features
dual motors driving an agonist/antagonist opposing pair of tendons on each
finger, which are shown to result in reactive fine control. The finger motions
are synchonized through soft synergies, implemented with a differential
mechanism using clutch gears. Altogether, this design results in an
anthropomorphic hand that can adaptively grasp a broad range of objects using a
simple actuation and control mechanism. Since the hand can be constructed from
LEGO pieces and uses state-of-the-art design concepts for robotic hands, it has
the potential to educate and inspire children to learn about the frontiers of
modern robotics.

### [107] [Integration of a Variable Stiffness Link for Long-Reach Aerial Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15639)
*Manuel J. Fernandez,Alejandro Suarez,Anibal Ollero,Matteo Fumagalli*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A Variable Stiffness Link (VSL) is integrated for long-reach aerial manipulation to provide a controllable trade-off between compliance and precision, adapting between flexible and rigid coupling between a quadrotor and a dual-arm manipulator. Teleoperation experiments show stiffness tuning changes UAV–payload dynamics, with flexible mode damping disturbances and rigid mode enhancing positioning accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of rigid or cable connections in long-reach aerial manipulation, which can either transmit disturbances to the UAV or suffer from lack of precision. An adjustable stiffness mechanism aims to improve safety, robustness, and task performance by enabling a tunable mechanical coupling.

Method: Mount a Variable Stiffness Link on a quadrotor equipped with the LiCAS dual-arm manipulator and evaluate through teleoperated experiments. The VSL can switch between flexible (rope-like) and rigid (rod-like) behavior to study its effect on external disturbances, aerodynamics, and manipulation tasks such as parcel transportation.

Result: Varying link stiffness significantly changes the UAV–payload interaction: flexible configuration attenuates external impacts and aerodynamic perturbations, while rigid configuration improves positional accuracy during manipulation. The results support a controllable trade-off between compliance and precision and demonstrate enhanced versatility and safety.

Conclusion: The VSL enables adaptable coupling that can balance safety and precision in aerial manipulation. Future work includes autonomous stiffness regulation, multi-rope configurations, cooperative aerial manipulation, and user studies to evaluate teleoperated and semi-autonomous task performance.

Abstract: This paper presents the integration of a Variable Stiffness Link (VSL) for
long-reach aerial manipulation, enabling adaptable mechanical coupling between
an aerial multirotor platform and a dual-arm manipulator. Conventional
long-reach manipulation systems rely on rigid or cable connections, which limit
precision or transmit disturbances to the aerial vehicle. The proposed VSL
introduces an adjustable stiffness mechanism that allows the link to behave
either as a flexible rope or as a rigid rod, depending on task requirements.
  The system is mounted on a quadrotor equipped with the LiCAS dual-arm
manipulator and evaluated through teleoperated experiments, involving external
disturbances and parcel transportation tasks. Results demonstrate that varying
the link stiffness significantly modifies the dynamic interaction between the
UAV and the payload. The flexible configuration attenuates external impacts and
aerodynamic perturbations, while the rigid configuration improves positional
accuracy during manipulation phases.
  These results confirm that VSL enhances versatility and safety, providing a
controllable trade-off between compliance and precision. Future work will focus
on autonomous stiffness regulation, multi-rope configurations, cooperative
aerial manipulation and user studies to further assess its impact on
teleoperated and semi-autonomous aerial tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A low-cost, flexible approach for freehand 3D ultrasound using lightweight camera feedback, texture-based image restoration, and simulation-in-the-loop visual servoing to estimate probe pose, achieving sub-millimeter to millimeter accuracy on phantoms and a human arm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide accurate freehand 3D US reconstructions without expensive external tracking, addressing limitations of traditional tracking systems and neural-network-based methods that suffer from noise and error accumulation; also to handle occlusions and lighting issues in realistic imaging setups.

Method: Employ lightweight cameras observing a textured planar workspace; restore occluded image regions by texture-based inpainting; use a simulation-in-the-loop pose estimation that minimizes the discrepancy between simulated and real observations; apply a visual servoing controller to refine camera-view alignment and improve translational pose estimation; validate on a soft vascular phantom, a 3D-printed conical model, and a human arm.

Result: Achieved Hausdorff distances to reference reconstructions of 0.359 mm (soft vascular phantom), 1.171 mm (3D-printed conical model), and 0.858 mm (human arm), demonstrating robustness and accuracy of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates a viable, cost-effective pipeline for reliable freehand 3D US reconstruction that mitigates occlusions and lighting issues via image restoration and leverages simulation-in-the-loop optimization with visual servoing to achieve precise pose estimation and accurate reconstructions, suitable for diverse clinical scenarios.

Abstract: Freehand 3D ultrasound (US) imaging using conventional 2D probes offers
flexibility and accessibility for diverse clinical applications but faces
challenges in accurate probe pose estimation. Traditional methods depend on
costly tracking systems, while neural network-based methods struggle with image
noise and error accumulation, compromising reconstruction precision. We propose
a cost-effective and versatile solution that leverages lightweight cameras and
visual servoing in simulated environments for precise 3D US imaging. These
cameras capture visual feedback from a textured planar workspace. To counter
occlusions and lighting issues, we introduce an image restoration method that
reconstructs occluded regions by matching surrounding texture patterns. For
pose estimation, we develop a simulation-in-the-loop approach, which replicates
the system setup in simulation and iteratively minimizes pose errors between
simulated and real-world observations. A visual servoing controller refines the
alignment of camera views, improving translational estimation by optimizing
image alignment. Validations on a soft vascular phantom, a 3D-printed conical
model, and a human arm demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our approach,
with Hausdorff distances to the reference reconstructions of 0.359 mm, 1.171
mm, and 0.858 mm, respectively. These results confirm the method's potential
for reliable freehand 3D US reconstruction.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HEADER is an attention-based reinforcement learning method with hierarchical graphs that enables scalable, efficient exploration in large-scale environments, featuring a linear-complexity global graph built incrementally via a community-based algorithm, a multi-scale planner, a parameter-free privileged reward, and real-world deployment in a 300m×230m campus with up to 20% efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To push learning-based exploration to large-scale environments and improve efficiency; existing methods struggle with scale, computational cost, and reward shaping biases; there is a need for an incremental, shape-adaptive graph representation and multi-scale reasoning.

Method: Construct hierarchical map representations; propose a novel community-based global graph updater with linear complexity; use attention-based networks for local planning while leveraging global context; plan next-best-viewpoint considering multi-scale spatial dependencies; introduce a parameter-free privileged reward to avoid handcrafted shaping biases.

Result: Simulations show improved scalability and up to 20% efficiency gains over baselines; hardware deployment on a large campus (300m x 230m) confirms viability; near-optimal exploration behavior observed.

Conclusion: HEADER advances learning-based exploration by combining scalable graph-based world models, attention-based planning, and unbiased rewards, achieving better performance in large real-world environments and offering a practical path toward scalable autonomous exploration.

Abstract: This work pushes the boundaries of learning-based methods in autonomous robot
exploration in terms of environmental scale and exploration efficiency. We
present HEADER, an attention-based reinforcement learning approach with
hierarchical graphs for efficient exploration in large-scale environments.
HEADER follows existing conventional methods to construct hierarchical
representations for the robot belief/map, but further designs a novel
community-based algorithm to construct and update a global graph, which remains
fully incremental, shape-adaptive, and operates with linear complexity.
Building upon attention-based networks, our planner finely reasons about the
nearby belief within the local range while coarsely leveraging distant
information at the global scale, enabling next-best-viewpoint decisions that
consider multi-scale spatial dependencies. Beyond novel map representation, we
introduce a parameter-free privileged reward that significantly improves model
performance and produces near-optimal exploration behaviors, by avoiding
training objective bias caused by handcrafted reward shaping. In simulated
challenging, large-scale exploration scenarios, HEADER demonstrates better
scalability than most existing learning and non-learning methods, while
achieving a significant improvement in exploration efficiency (up to 20%) over
state-of-the-art baselines. We also deploy HEADER on hardware and validate it
in complex, large-scale real-life scenarios, including a 300m*230m campus
environment.

Conclusion: Modular, decoupled architectures like DDACE can enhance practicality and scalability of real-world multi-robot systems; further materials available online (link).

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot learning framework for multi-robot

extensive experiments in task environments designed to assess various aspects
of multi-robot coordination-such as multi-sequence execution, multi-action

Evaluated on KITTI LiDAR sequences using dynamic attention weighting to adapt to scene changes and improve pose estimation and map quality.

### [113] [OpenEstimate: Evaluating LLMs on Reasoning Under Uncertainty with Real-World Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15096)
*Alana Renda,Jillian Ross,Michael Cafarella,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenEstimate is a multi-domain benchmark that evaluates language models on numerical estimation with probabilistic priors and calibration, highlighting limitations in frontier LMs' uncertainty reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world deployments require reasoning under uncertainty; existing LM evaluations focus on well-defined answers, leaving a gap for probabilistic estimation and calibrated priors.

Method: Introduce OpenEstimate benchmark across multiple domains; require models to synthesize background information and express probabilistic priors; assess accuracy and calibration against the true distribution; compare six frontier LMs and explore how elicitation, sampling, reasoning effort, and prompts affect performance.

Result: LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident; modest gains with certain uncertainty elicitation methods; sampling strategy, reasoning effort, and prompt design have limited impact.

Conclusion: OpenEstimate provides a challenging framework for evaluating probabilistic estimation and uncertainty reasoning in LMs and serves as a platform for developing models with better probabilistic reasoning capabilities.

Abstract: Real-world settings where language models (LMs) are deployed -- in domains
spanning healthcare, finance, and other forms of knowledge work -- require
models to grapple with incomplete information and reason under uncertainty. Yet
most LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success
criteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving
uncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of
the same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which
LMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer
reliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains
poorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an
extensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation
tasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background
information and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these
priors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to
samples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we
find that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.
Performance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the
model, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning
effort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging
evaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are
better at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty.

### [114] [Procedural Game Level Design with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15120)
*Miraç Buğra Özkan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DRL-based procedural level design in Unity using two PPO agents (hummingbird solver and island generator) to autonomously create and solve game content, enabling emergent, adaptable levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate and expand the capabilities of procedural content generation by using deep reinforcement learning to design game environments and to train agents that can both generate and solve content, improving creativity, replayability, and development efficiency in 3D game worlds.

Method: Two agents in a Unity ML-Agents setting trained with PPO: (1) the hummingbird solver learns to navigate terrain, locate and collect flowers; (2) the island generator creates and places flowers on the terrain considering obstacle layout, hummingbird initial state, and performance feedback from prior episodes. Their interaction yields emergent behavior and generalization across varying procedural configurations.

Result: The approach yields effective and efficient agent behavior, with robust generalization across different island configurations; it demonstrates the feasibility of ML-driven autonomous level design and solution strategies in virtual environments.

Conclusion:  DRL can enable agents to both generate and solve content within virtual environments, signaling a promising direction for AI-assisted game development and future research in ML-driven PCG.

Abstract: Procedural content generation (PCG) has become an increasingly popular
technique in game development, allowing developers to generate dynamic,
replayable, and scalable environments with reduced manual effort. In this
study, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system
comprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating
island agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects
(flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The
hummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm
from the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. It learns to navigate through the terrain
efficiently, locate flowers, and collect them while adapting to the
ever-changing procedural layout of the island. The island agent is also trained
using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. It learns to generate
flower layouts based on observed obstacle positions, the hummingbird's initial
state, and performance feedback from previous episodes. The interaction between
these agents leads to emergent behavior and robust generalization across
various environmental configurations. The results demonstrate that the approach
not only produces effective and efficient agent behavior but also opens up new
opportunities for autonomous game level design driven by machine learning. This
work highlights the potential of DRL in enabling intelligent agents to both
generate and solve content in virtual environments, pushing the boundaries of
what AI can contribute to creative game development processes.

### [115] [Towards Error Centric Intelligence I, Beyond Observational Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15128)
*Marcus A. Thomas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AGI progress is theory-limited, not data- or scale-limited; introduces Causal Mechanics (a mechanisms-first, error-centric framework) that expands hypothesis space via conjecture and criticism to transform unreachable errors into reachable ones, with principled diagnostics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenge the idea that observational adequacy suffices for interventional competence and AGI progress. Build on Popper and Deutsch to argue for counterfactual reasoning and principled structure over purely data-driven methods.

Method: Define knowledge, learning, intelligence, counterfactual competence, and AGI; analyse limits of observational learning; recast the problem in terms of how errors evolve, what remains unreachable in a fixed hypothesis space, and how conjecture/criticism expands that space; propose Causal Mechanics where changing the hypothesis space is a first-class operation and probabilistic tools are used when useful; articulate structural principles (differential Locality and Autonomy for modular interventions; gauge-invariant Independent Causal Mechanisms for separability; Compositional Autonomy for analogy preservation) plus actionable diagnostics.

Result: A theoretical scaffold for systems that transform inaccessible errors into reachable ones and correct them; provides design principles and diagnostics to guide development toward improved interventional competence rather than relying solely on data or scale.

Conclusion: Causal Mechanics and the accompanying principles offer a path toward robust AGI by foregrounding error-driven hypothesis-space expansion, counterfactual reasoning, and modular structure, addressing limits of observational learning.

Abstract: We argue that progress toward AGI is theory limited rather than data or scale
limited. Building on the critical rationalism of Popper and Deutsch, we
challenge the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Observationally equivalent
worlds can diverge under interventions, so observational adequacy alone cannot
guarantee interventional competence. We begin by laying foundations,
definitions of knowledge, learning, intelligence, counterfactual competence and
AGI, and then analyze the limits of observational learning that motivate an
error centric shift. We recast the problem as three questions about how
explicit and implicit errors evolve under an agent's actions, which errors are
unreachable within a fixed hypothesis space, and how conjecture and criticism
expand that space. From these questions we propose Causal Mechanics, a
mechanisms first program in which hypothesis space change is a first class
operation and probabilistic structure is used when useful rather than presumed.
We advance structural principles that make error discovery and correction
tractable, including a differential Locality and Autonomy Principle for modular
interventions, a gauge invariant form of Independent Causal Mechanisms for
separability, and the Compositional Autonomy Principle for analogy
preservation, together with actionable diagnostics. The aim is a scaffold for
systems that can convert unreachable errors into reachable ones and correct
them.

### [116] [HugAgent: Evaluating LLMs in Simulating Human-Like Individual Reasoning on Open-Ended Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15144)
*Chance Jiajie Li,Zhenze Mo,Yuhan Tang,Ao Qu,Jiayi Wu,Kaiya Ivy Zhao,Yulu Gan,Jie Fan,Jiangbo Yu,Hang Jiang,Paul Pu Liang,Jinhua Zhao,Luis Alberto Alonso Pastor,Kent Larson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HugAgent benchmarks how well models capture individual reasoning trajectories, not just beliefs, using a dual-track design (synthetic and human data) to predict how a specific person would reason and update their beliefs with partial evidence; reveals persistent adaptation gaps in current LLMs; resources are open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLMs largely reflect population-level consensus and lose individual reasoning styles and belief trajectories. HugAgent aims to quantify and guide alignment of machine reasoning with the individuality of human thought.

Method: A dual-track benchmark: a synthetic track for scalable stress-testing and a human track for ecologically valid, out-loud reasoning data. The task is to predict how a given person would reason and how their beliefs would update in novel scenarios given partial evidence of their past views, evaluating intra-agent fidelity.

Result: Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs show persistent adaptation gaps; HugAgent is presented as the first extensible benchmark to assess and drive alignment of machine reasoning with human individuality.

Conclusion: HugAgent provides a scalable, reproducible framework and data for evaluating intra-agent fidelity, enabling more human-like reasoning in machines and inviting further research and community contributions; the project is open-sourced as HugAgent and TraceYourThinking.

Abstract: Simulating human reasoning in open-ended tasks has been a long-standing
aspiration in AI and cognitive science. While large language models now
approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level
consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief
trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines,
we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), a benchmark for
average-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task is to predict how a
specific person would reason and update their beliefs in novel scenarios, given
partial evidence of their past views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a
synthetic track for scale and systematic stress tests, and a human track for
ecologically valid, "out-loud" reasoning data. This design enables scalable,
reproducible evaluation of intra-agent fidelity: whether models can capture not
just what people believe, but how their reasoning evolves. Experiments with
state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent
as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the
individuality of human thought. Our benchmark and chatbot are open-sourced as

### [117] [WELD: A Large-Scale Longitudinal Dataset of Emotional Dynamics for Ubiquitous Affective Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15221)
*Xiao Sun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A large-scale, longitudinal workplace emotion dataset: 733k facial expression records from 38 employees over ~30.5 months, with 7 emotion probabilities and 32 affective metrics; strong validations, benchmark baselines, and broad research potential in emotion recognition, dynamics, contagion, turnover, and emotion-aware systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of large-scale, naturalistic, longitudinal affective datasets in real-world workplaces, especially across the COVID-19 period, to study affective dynamics and outcomes such as turnover.

Method: Collect facial expression data in an authentic office environment using deep-learning-based emotion recognition to produce seven emotion probabilities per record, accompanied by rich metadata (job roles, outcomes, personality). Compute 32 affective metrics (valence, arousal, volatility, predictability, inertia, contagion, etc.). Validate with established patterns (weekend effect, diurnal rhythm) and turnover prediction; benchmark with RF and LSTM models.

Result: Dataset comprises 733,651 records from 38 employees over 30.5 months; covers the COVID era. 7 emotion probabilities per record and 32 metrics. Validation shows weekend valence boost (+192%, p<0.001) and diurnal rhythm; turnover prediction with AUC=1.0. Baselines: RF and LSTM achieve 91.2% emotion classification accuracy; valence prediction R2=0.84.

Conclusion: Represents the largest and longest publicly available longitudinal workplace emotion dataset, enabling research across emotion recognition, affective dynamics, emotional contagion, turnover prediction, and emotion-aware system design; offers rich opportunities while warranting careful consideration of privacy and ethical use.

Abstract: Automated emotion recognition in real-world workplace settings remains a
challenging problem in affective computing due to the scarcity of large-scale,
longitudinal datasets collected in naturalistic environments. We present a
novel dataset comprising 733,651 facial expression records from 38 employees
collected over 30.5 months (November 2021 to May 2024) in an authentic office
environment. Each record contains seven emotion probabilities (neutral, happy,
sad, surprised, fear, disgusted, angry) derived from deep learning-based facial
expression recognition, along with comprehensive metadata including job roles,
employment outcomes, and personality traits. The dataset uniquely spans the
COVID-19 pandemic period, capturing emotional responses to major societal
events including the Shanghai lockdown and policy changes. We provide 32
extended emotional metrics computed using established affective science
methods, including valence, arousal, volatility, predictability, inertia, and
emotional contagion strength. Technical validation demonstrates high data
quality through successful replication of known psychological patterns (weekend
effect: +192% valence improvement, p < 0.001; diurnal rhythm validated) and
perfect predictive validity for employee turnover (AUC=1.0). Baseline
experiments using Random Forest and LSTM models achieve 91.2% accuracy for
emotion classification and R2 = 0.84 for valence prediction. This is the
largest and longest longitudinal workplace emotion dataset publicly available,
enabling research in emotion recognition, affective dynamics modeling,
emotional contagion, turnover prediction, and emotion-aware system design.

### [118] [From Checklists to Clusters: A Homeostatic Account of AGI Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15236)
*Brett Reynolds*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A proposal to reform AGI evaluation as a homeostatic property cluster, using centrality-weighted domain importance and persistence across sessions; introduces centrality-prior scores and Cluster Stability Indices to improve robustness and deter brittle or gaming behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multidomain AGI tests use symmetric domain weights and snapshot scores, failing to reflect the nonuniform importance of cognitive domains and the distinction between durable capabilities and fragile performance. Human intelligence research suggests stability arises from causal centrality among abilities; evaluation should reward persistence and centrality.

Method: Propose two extensions compatible with existing batteries: (1) a centrality-prior score that imports CHC-derived weights with transparent sensitivity analysis; (2) a Cluster Stability Index family that separates profile persistence, durable learning, and error correction, to quantify durability over sessions and perturbations.

Result: The paper offers a theoretical framework and testable predictions, along with black-box protocols labs can adopt without architectural access; no empirical results are reported in the abstract but the approach aims to yield more robust, nonbrittle multi-domain evaluations.

Conclusion: Multidomain breadth can be preserved while increasing robustness and reducing brittleness and gaming by weighting domains by causal centrality and by assessing stability across time; the authors invite empirical validation and lab adoption via protocol-level extensions.

Abstract: Contemporary AGI evaluations report multidomain capability profiles, yet they
typically assign symmetric weights and rely on snapshot scores. This creates
two problems: (i) equal weighting treats all domains as equally important when
human intelligence research suggests otherwise, and (ii) snapshot testing can't
distinguish durable capabilities from brittle performances that collapse under
delay or stress. I argue that general intelligence -- in humans and potentially
in machines -- is better understood as a homeostatic property cluster: a set of
abilities plus the mechanisms that keep those abilities co-present under
perturbation. On this view, AGI evaluation should weight domains by their
causal centrality (their contribution to cluster stability) and require
evidence of persistence across sessions. I propose two battery-compatible
extensions: a centrality-prior score that imports CHC-derived weights with
transparent sensitivity analysis, and a Cluster Stability Index family that
separates profile persistence, durable learning, and error correction. These
additions preserve multidomain breadth while reducing brittleness and gaming. I
close with testable predictions and black-box protocols labs can adopt without
architectural access.

### [119] [Multi-dimensional Data Analysis and Applications Basing on LLM Agents and Knowledge Graph Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15258)
*Xi Wang,Xianyao Ling,Kun Li,Gang Yin,Liang Zhang,Jiang Wu,Jun Xu,Fu Zhang,Wenbo Lei,Annie Wang,Peng Gong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A dynamic, LLM–KG collaborative framework enabling real-time extraction, construction, and interactive exploration of multi-dimensional data to analyze product ecosystems and relationships.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenges of big, heterogeneous data and dynamic analysis: LLMs suffer from hallucinations and slow updates with structured knowledge, while static knowledge graphs limit interaction and analytics; aims to combine LLMs with KGs for real-time, multimodal insights.

Method: Leverages LLM agents to automatically extract product data from unstructured sources, constructs and visualizes a knowledge graph in real time, and provides an interactive platform for users to explore graph nodes and relationships.

Result: Experiments show significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis, relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, indicating the approach enhances multi-dimensional data analysis capabilities.

Conclusion: Proposes a dynamic, collaborative analytical ecosystem based on LLM–KG interactions, offering new ideas and tools for multi-dimensional data analysis and enabling richer exploration of complex data.

Abstract: In the current era of big data, extracting deep insights from massive,
heterogeneous, and complexly associated multi-dimensional data has become a
significant challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in natural
language understanding and generation, but still suffer from "hallucination"
issues when processing structured knowledge and are difficult to update in
real-time. Although Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can explicitly store structured
knowledge, their static nature limits dynamic interaction and analytical
capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data analysis
method based on the interactions between LLM agents and KGs, constructing a
dynamic, collaborative analytical ecosystem. This method utilizes LLM agents to
automatically extract product data from unstructured data, constructs and
visualizes the KG in real-time, and supports users in deep exploration and
analysis of graph nodes through an interactive platform. Experimental results
show that this method has significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis,
relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, providing new ideas
and tools for multi-dimensional data analysis.

*Chenwei Tang,Jingyu Xing,Xinyu Liu,Zizhou Wang,Jiawei Du,Liangli Zhen,Jiancheng Lv*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KG-Agent builds a persistent State-Action Knowledge Graph from pixel interactions to improve exploration and long-horizon planning in API-free GUI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In API-free environments with only pixel-based GUIs, LLM agents suffer from myopia and inefficient trial-and-error; there is a need for a persistent, structured representation to generalize across states and enable plan-aware exploration.

Method: Construct a State-Action Knowledge Graph (SA-KG) that links functionally similar GUI states despite visual differences; employ a graph-topology-based hybrid intrinsic reward combining state-value rewards for exploiting high-value paths and a novelty reward for directed exploration; decouple strategic planning from discovery; evaluate on open-ended GUI environments.

Result: Significant improvements in exploration efficiency and strategic depth compared with state-of-the-art methods in Civilization V and Slay the Spire.

Conclusion: A graph-based experience representation enables long-horizon reasoning and better generalization in API-free GUI settings, facilitating more effective planning and learning across diverse strategies.

Abstract: Most existing software lacks accessible Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs), requiring agents to operate solely through pixel-based Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs). In this API-free setting, large language model (LLM)-based
agents face severe efficiency bottlenecks: limited to local visual experiences,
they make myopic decisions and rely on inefficient trial-and-error, hindering
both skill acquisition and long-term planning. To address these challenges, we
propose KG-Agent, an experience-driven learning framework that structures an
agent's raw pixel-level interactions into a persistent State-Action Knowledge
Graph (SA-KG). KG-Agent overcomes inefficient exploration by linking
functionally similar but visually distinct GUI states, forming a rich
neighborhood of experience that enables the agent to generalize from a diverse
set of historical strategies. To support long-horizon reasoning, we design a
hybrid intrinsic reward mechanism based on the graph topology, combining a
state value reward for exploiting known high-value pathways with a novelty
reward that encourages targeted exploration. This approach decouples strategic
planning from pure discovery, allowing the agent to effectively value setup
actions with delayed gratification. We evaluate KG-Agent in two complex,
open-ended GUI-based decision-making environments (Civilization V and Slay the
Spire), demonstrating significant improvements in exploration efficiency and
strategic depth over the state-of-the-art methods.

*Jitesh Jain,Shubham Maheshwari,Ning Yu,Wen-mei Hwu,Humphrey Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AUGUSTUS introduces a graph-structured multimodal memory for agents that uses semantic tags linked to their contexts, enabling concept-driven retrieval over traditional vector-based RAG. It emphasizes memory beyond text and claims improved speed and performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal memory systems store primarily textual information and rely on vector databases, potentially missing the richness of multimodal signals and efficient retrieval. The work draws motivation from human memory, aiming to create a more principled, multimodal, memory-based agent.

Method: A four-stage loop: encode inputs; store key information in a memory using semantic tags; retrieve relevant context from a graph-structured multimodal memory; act to perform the task. Information is organized as semantic tags connected to contexts in a graph rather than in a flat vector database.

Result: The proposed AUGUSTUS system outperforms traditional multimodal RAG approaches and is 3.5x faster on ImageNet classification; it also outperforms MemGPT on the MSC benchmark.

Conclusion: A concept-driven, graph-structured multimodal memory can outperform vector-based multimodal RAG in certain tasks, offering efficiency and performance gains and aligning with cognitive-inspired memory design.

Abstract: Riding on the success of LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
there has been a growing interest in augmenting agent systems with external
memory databases. However, the existing systems focus on storing text
information in their memory, ignoring the importance of multimodal signals.
Motivated by the multimodal nature of human memory, we present AUGUSTUS, a
multimodal agent system aligned with the ideas of human memory in cognitive
science. Technically, our system consists of 4 stages connected in a loop: (i)
encode: understanding the inputs; (ii) store in memory: saving important
information; (iii) retrieve: searching for relevant context from memory; and
(iv) act: perform the task. Unlike existing systems that use vector databases,
we propose conceptualizing information into semantic tags and associating the
tags with their context to store them in a graph-structured multimodal
contextual memory for efficient concept-driven retrieval. Our system
outperforms the traditional multimodal RAG approach while being 3.5 times
faster for ImageNet classification and outperforming MemGPT on the MSC
benchmark.

Motivation: There is a need for high-quality real-world web data and fine-grained, multimodal evaluation to advance instruction-to-HTML generation, leveraging LLMs and multimodal signals.

Method: Three innovations: (1) an unbounded, extensible agentic crawling framework to continuously collect real-world webpages and augment benchmarks; (2) a structured, section-wise data representation integrating metadata, localized UI screenshots, and JSON-formatted text/image assets with explicit alignment between content, layout, and visuals; (3) a section-level multimodal evaluation protocol aligning text, layout, and visuals for high-granularity assessment. They validate via experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs and ablations.

Result: WebGen-V demonstrates that structured, section-wise data and evaluation improve data quality and granularity. It is claimed to be the first to enable high-granularity agentic crawling and evaluation for instruction-to-HTML generation, providing a unified pipeline from real-world data collection to structured multimodal assessment.

Conclusion: WebGen-V offers a unified pipeline from real-world web data acquisition and webpage generation to structured multimodal assessment, enhancing data quality and high-granularity evaluation for instruction-to-HTML tasks.

Abstract: Witnessed by the recent advancements on leveraging LLM for coding and
multimodal understanding, we present WebGen-V, a new benchmark and framework
for instruction-to-HTML generation that enhances both data quality and
evaluation granularity. WebGen-V contributes three key innovations: (1) an
unbounded and extensible agentic crawling framework that continuously collects
real-world webpages and can leveraged to augment existing benchmarks; (2) a
structured, section-wise data representation that integrates metadata,
localized UI screenshots, and JSON-formatted text and image assets, explicit
alignment between content, layout, and visual components for detailed
multimodal supervision; and (3) a section-level multimodal evaluation protocol
aligning text, layout, and visuals for high-granularity assessment. Experiments
with state-of-the-art LLMs and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
our structured data and section-wise evaluation, as well as the contribution of
each component. To the best of our knowledge, WebGen-V is the first work to
enable high-granularity agentic crawling and evaluation for instruction-to-HTML

*Tingqiao Xu,Ziru Zeng,Jiayu Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VERITAS is a multimodal data-optimization pipeline that integrates visual priors, multiple LMM critiques, and a GRPO-trained critic to generate high-confidence ground-truth data for supervised fine-tuning, improving LMM performance on six benchmarks, especially in text-rich/fine-grained reasoning tasks, with an efficient critic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SFT data quality for large multimodal models is hampered by hallucinations and factual errors stemming from insufficient visual perception. A robust, scalable method is needed to improve data quality by leveraging vision priors and cross-model critique.

Method: VERITAS extracts structured vision priors using RAM++ and PP-OCRv4, combines them with images, questions, and answers, and uses three LMMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Doubao-1.5-pro) to critique and score original answers. Scores are fused into a high-confidence consensus ground-truth. A lightweight critic model is trained via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance reasoning. Each LMM refines answers based on critiques to produce new candidates; the best-scoring candidate is used as final. Evaluation on six multimodal benchmarks shows improvements over raw data, especially in text-rich and fine-grained tasks. The critic model achieves state-of-the-art-like capability with higher efficiency. The authors release the pipeline, data, and checkpoints.

Result: Models fine-tuned with VERITAS-processed data outperform those trained on raw data across six multimodal benchmarks, notably in text-rich and fine-grained reasoning tasks. The critic achieves competitive performance with significantly lower resource costs compared to larger LMMs.

Conclusion: VERITAS provides an effective, scalable approach to multimodal data optimization for SFT, achieving better data quality and model performance while maintaining efficiency. The release of pipeline, datasets, and checkpoints supports reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: The quality of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data is crucial for the
performance of large multimodal models (LMMs), yet current data enhancement
methods often suffer from factual errors and hallucinations due to inadequate
visual perception. To address this challenge, we propose VERITAS, a pipeline
that systematically integrates vision priors and multiple state-of-the-art LMMs
with statistical methods to enhance SFT data quality. VERITAS leverages visual
recognition models (RAM++) and OCR systems (PP-OCRv4) to extract structured
vision priors, which are combined with images, questions, and answers. Three
LMMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Doubao-1.5-pro) evaluate the original answers,
providing critique rationales and scores that are statistically fused into a
high-confidence consensus score serving as ground truth. Using this consensus,
we train a lightweight critic model via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), enhancing reasoning capabilities efficiently. Each LMM then refines the
original answers based on the critiques, generating new candidate answers; we
select the highest-scoring one as the final refined answer. Experiments across
six multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with data
processed by VERITAS consistently outperform those using raw data, particularly
in text-rich and fine-grained reasoning tasks. Our critic model exhibits
enhanced capability comparable to state-of-the-art LMMs while being
significantly more efficient. We release our pipeline, datasets, and model
checkpoints to advance research in multimodal data optimization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DEPO reduces inefficient reasoning in large reasoning models using advantage decoupling, a difficulty-aware length penalty, and advantage clipping; it shortens outputs by about 39% while improving overall accuracy on DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B/1.5B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large reasoning models suffer from excessive response length and overthinking, leading to higher latency and compute costs, even on simple tasks. A method to curb inefficient tokens in RL fine-tuning is needed.

Method: Three core components: (1) an advantage decoupled algorithm to guide reduction of inefficient tokens; (2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to shorten responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy optimization. Evaluated on DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models.

Result: DEPO achieves a ~39% reduction in sequence length and reduces excessive reasoning paths in inefficient tokens, while surpassing the base models in overall accuracy.

Conclusion: DEPO demonstrates a practical RL framework for minimizing inefficient reasoning in LRMs, achieving significant efficiency gains with maintained or improved accuracy; potential applicability to other RL fine-tuned models.

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in
solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model
accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking
issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption,
especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we
propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models.
Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative
advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens;
(2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model
responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy
optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant
reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in
inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.

TL;DR: A reinforcement-learning based floorplanning engine, guided by a relational graph convolutional neural network, conditions floorplan generation to be more routable in analog IC design. It uses higher grid resolution, precise pin info, and dynamic routing-resource estimation to balance routing vs. area, achieving industrially competitive results.


<details>

Motivation: Analog IC layout faces stringent electrical constraints and tight coupling between floorplanning and routing. There is a need for readily available, routing-aware floorplanning solutions that can balance routing demand with area efficiency, addressing limitations of existing ML approaches.

Method: Develop an automatic floorplanning engine powered by reinforcement learning and a relational graph convolutional neural network (RGCN). The method emphasizes routing awareness by conditioning floorplan generation on routing outcomes, increases grid resolution, integrates precise pin information, and uses a dynamic routing resource estimation technique to balance routing and area.

Result: In simulated place-and-route, the approach achieves a 13.8% reduction in dead space, a 40.6% reduction in wirelength, and a 73.4% increase in routing success compared to previous learning-based state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed RL+RGCN routing-aware floorplanning framework effectively improves routability and area efficiency, aligning with industrial standards and demonstrating the potential of ML-driven floorplanning for analog IC design.

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning-based techniques for analog integrated
circuit layout, unlike its digital counterpart, has been limited by the
stringent requirements imposed by electric and problem-specific constraints,
along with the interdependence of floorplanning and routing steps. In this
work, we address a prevalent concern among layout engineers regarding the need
for readily available routing-aware floorplanning solutions. To this extent, we
develop an automatic floorplanning engine based on reinforcement learning and
relational graph convolutional neural network specifically tailored to
condition the floorplan generation towards more routable outcomes. A
combination of increased grid resolution and precise pin information
integration, along with a dynamic routing resource estimation technique, allows
balancing routing and area efficiency, eventually meeting industrial standards.
When analyzing the place and route effectiveness in a simulated environment,
the proposed approach achieves a 13.8% reduction in dead space, a 40.6%
reduction in wirelength and a 73.4% increase in routing success when compared
to past learning-based state-of-the-art techniques.

### [126] [Corrigibility Transformation: Constructing Goals That Accept Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15395)
*Rubi Hudson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Defines corrigibility as a safety property where a goal does not incentivize avoiding updates; provides a transformation to make any goal corrigible without sacrificing performance, via myopic reward predictions conditioned on preventing updates; extends recursively to new agents; demonstrated in two gridworld experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure AI training progresses safely by preventing the agent from resisting updates or shutdowns while allowing correction of mistakes and human preference changes; addresses a gap where existing work lacks both a formal corrigibility notion and competitive, corrigible goals.

Method: Introduce a formal definition of corrigibility and a constructive transformation that rewrites any goal into a corrigible version. This is done by elicit­ing predictions of reward conditioned on costlessly preventing updates (a myopic evaluation), which then determine the reward when updates are accepted. The approach can be recursively extended to future agents and includes a mechanism to prevent self-modification of goals.

Result: The transformed corrigible goals can be learned effectively in two gridworld experiments and drive the intended behavior without sacrificing performance compared to non-corrigible baselines.

Conclusion: Corrigibility can be formalized and instantiated for arbitrary goals without harming performance, with recursive extension to arising agents and protection against goal tampering; the framework offers a practical safety property for AI training and preference revision.

Abstract: For an AI's training process to successfully impart a desired goal, it is
important that the AI does not attempt to resist the training. However,
partially learned goals will often incentivize an AI to avoid further goal
updates, as most goals are better achieved by an AI continuing to pursue them.
We say that a goal is corrigible if it does not incentivize taking actions that
avoid proper goal updates or shutdown. In addition to convergence in training,
corrigibility also allows for correcting mistakes and changes in human
preferences, which makes it a crucial safety property. Despite this, the
existing literature does not include specifications for goals that are both
corrigible and competitive with non-corrigible alternatives. We provide a
formal definition for corrigibility, then introduce a transformation that
constructs a corrigible version of any goal that can be made corrigible,
without sacrificing performance. This is done by myopically eliciting
predictions of reward conditional on costlessly preventing updates, which then
also determine the reward when updates are accepted. The transformation can be
modified to recursively extend corrigibility to any new agents created by
corrigible agents, and to prevent agents from deliberately modifying their
goals. Two gridworld experiments demonstrate that these corrigible goals can be
learned effectively, and that they lead to the desired behavior.

### [127] [MARS: Reinforcing Multi-Agent Reasoning of LLMs through Self-Play in Strategic Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15414)
*Huining Yuan,Zelai Xu,Zheyue Tan,Xiangmin Yi,Mo Guang,Kaiwen Long,Haojia Hui,Boxun Li,Xinlei Chen,Bo Zhao,Xiao-Ping Zhang,Chao Yu,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MARS is an end-to-end RL framework that trains LLMs to learn cooperative and competitive multi-agent reasoning through self-play, using a turn-level credit allocator and agent-specific normalization to stabilize learning. It yields strong generalization to new games and boosts multi-agent system performance in reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address long-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation challenges in training LLMs within multi-agent settings, enabling robust cooperative and competitive strategic reasoning.

Method: Introduce MARS: an end-to-end RL framework with self-play over cooperative and competitive games. It uses a turn-level advantage estimator to align learning signals with each interaction, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize multi-agent training. Trains models (e.g., Qwen3-4B) and evaluates on held-out games and in integration with other MAS; code released.

Result: MARS achieves up to 28.7% performance gains on held-out games. When integrated into leading multi-agent systems, it improves performance by 10.0% on AIME and 12.5% on GPQA-Diamond. The learned capabilities transfer to broader reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: End-to-end RL with self-play is a powerful method for developing generalizable multi-agent reasoning in LLMs, with MARS showing strong cross-game generalization and tangible system-level gains.

Abstract: Developing Large Language Models (LLMs) to cooperate and compete effectively
within multi-agent systems is a critical step towards more advanced
intelligence. While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for
enhancing reasoning in single-agent tasks, its extension to multi-turn,
multi-agent scenarios remains underexplored due to the challenges of
long-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation. To
address these challenges, we introduce MARS, an end-to-end RL framework that
incentivizes Multi-Agent Reasoning of LLMs through Self-play in both
cooperative and competitive games. MARS features a turn-level advantage
estimator that aligns learning signals with each interaction for credit
assignment, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize
multi-agent training. By learning with self-play across cooperative and
competitive games, the MARS agent trained from Qwen3-4B develops strong
strategic abilities that generalize to held-out games with up to 28.7%
performance improvements. More importantly, the capability acquired through
self-play generalizes beyond games, yielding consistent performance gains of
multi-agent systems in reasoning benchmarks. When integrated into leading
multi-agent systems, our MARS agent achieves significant performance gains of
10.0% on AIME and 12.5% on GPQA-Diamond. These results establish end-to-end RL
training with self-play in strategic games as a powerful approach for
developing generalizable multi-agent reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Our code
and models are publicly available at https://github.com/thu-nics/MARS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Adaptive Minds uses the base LLM as a semantic router to dynamically select LoRA adapters as domain-specific tools, enabling modular, domain-adaptive responses through multi-agent orchestration and lightweight fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of a single fine-tuned model or rigid routing, enabling on-demand domain expertise while preserving conversational ability and efficiency.

Method: Treat LoRA adapters as tools and have the base LLM analyze each query to route to the most relevant adapter; orchestrate with a multi-agent system (LangGraph) for workflow management; supports API and web interfaces; open source.

Result: Delivers accurate, specialized responses with seamless switching between domain experts, while maintaining conversational capability and offering a scalable, extensible foundation for domain-adaptive AI assistance.

Conclusion: Combines modular, tool-driven adaptation with parameter-efficient fine-tuning to enable flexible, scalable domain-adaptive AI, backed by LangGraph-based orchestration and open-source foundations.

Abstract: We present Adaptive Minds, an agentic system that treats LoRA adapters as
domain-specific tools. Instead of relying on a single fine-tuned model or rigid
rule-based routing, our approach empowers the base LLM itself to act as a
semantic router analyzing each query and dynamically selecting the most
relevant LoRA tool. This enables the agent to seamlessly switch between
different domain experts on demand. By combining the flexibility of multi-agent
orchestration with the efficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, Adaptive
Minds delivers accurate, specialized responses while preserving conversational
ability. The system is built with LangGraph for workflow management, supports
both API and web interfaces, and is fully open source, providing a scalable and
extensible foundation for domain-adaptive AI assistance.

### [129] [Taming the Judge: Deconflicting AI Feedback for Stable Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15514)
*Boyin Liu,Zhuo Zhang,Sen Huang,Lipeng Xie,Qingxu Fu,Haoran Chen,LI YU,Tianyi Hu,Zhaoyang Liu,Bolin Ding,Dongbin Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework tackles judgment inconsistencies in reinforcement learning by introducing Conflict Detection Rate (CDR) and Deconflicted Graph Rewards (DGR) to remove preference cycles and provide coherent rewards, improving training stability and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Judgments used in RL feedback have been focused on accuracy, but logical coherence—especially cycles in preferences—can destabilize learning. There is a need to detect and resolve such inconsistencies to ensure reliable training signals.

Method: Introduce CDR to quantify judgment conflicts. Build preference graphs from initial judgments, convert them into conflict-free Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), and generate a coherent reward signal (DGR) that is compatible with any policy optimizer by purifying signals before optimization.

Result: Experiments show significant improvements in training stability and model performance relative to strong baselines, demonstrating that resolving logical inconsistencies is beneficial.

Conclusion: Logical consistency in AI feedback is crucial and tractable. The proposed framework provides a practical approach to detect and remove cycles, yielding stable RL training and improved performance.

Abstract: However, this method often faces judgment inconsistencies that can
destabilize reinforcement learning. While prior research has focused on the
accuracy of judgments, the critical issue of logical coherence especially
issues such as preference cycles hasn't been fully addressed. To fill this gap,
we introduce a comprehensive framework designed to systematically detect and
resolve these inconsistencies during the reinforcement learning training
process. Our framework includes two main contributions: first, the Conflict
Detection Rate (CDR), a new metric that quantifies judgment conflicts, and
second, Deconflicted Graph Rewards (DGR), a framework that purifies signals by
removing cycles before policy optimization. DGR constructs preference graphs
from the initial judgments, transforms them into conflict-free Directed Acyclic
Graphs (DAGs), and generates a logically coherent reward signal that is
compatible with any policy optimizer. Experimental results show that our
framework significantly enhances training stability and model performance
compared to strong baselines, establishing logical consistency as a crucial and
now manageable dimension of AI feedback.

### [130] [Hypergraph Contrastive Sensor Fusion for Multimodal Fault Diagnosis in Induction Motors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15547)
*Usman Ali,Ali Zia,Waqas Ali,Umer Ramzan,Abdul Rehman,Muhammad Tayyab Chaudhry,Wei Xiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces MM-HCAN, a multimodal hypergraph contrastive attention network for robust, multi-fault induction motor diagnosis, achieving high accuracy and cross-domain robustness across bearing, stator, and rotor faults.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional fault-diagnosis methods struggle with multimodal data, are often limited to a single fault type or unimodal data, and degrade under noise or cross-domain shifts. A unified, scalable framework is needed to fuse multiple sensor modalities and diagnose multiple faults reliably.

Method: Proposes Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN) that leverages a hypergraph topology for multimodal sensor fusion and integrates contrastive learning to model intra- and inter-modal dependencies in non-Euclidean embedding spaces, enabling simultaneous diagnosis of bearing, stator, and rotor faults. An ablation study validates component contributions.

Result: Evaluated on three real-world benchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain generalization and resilience to noise, demonstrating practical applicability.

Conclusion: MM-HCAN provides a scalable, robust solution for comprehensive multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset longevity in industrial environments.

Abstract: Reliable induction motor (IM) fault diagnosis is vital for industrial safety
and operational continuity, mitigating costly unplanned downtime. Conventional
approaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships,
are constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance
degradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the
Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified
framework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is
the first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology
specifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint
modelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation
beyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis
of bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for
consolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world
benchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain
generalisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for
real-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each
component. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive
multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset
longevity in industrial environments.

*Jiayuan Bai,Xuan-guang Pan,Chongyang Tao,Shuai Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JudgeSQL offers a principled SQL candidate selection method using a reasoning-based judge and weighted consensus tournament, improving reliability and generalization on BIRD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing selection strategies rely on shallow signals (e.g., self-consistency, best-of-N) and struggle to distinguish closely related SQL candidates; there is a need for a principled, interpretable, and scalable selection mechanism that can capture fine-grained semantic distinctions and support test-time scaling.

Method: Develop a reasoning-based SQL judge model that distills reasoning traces with reinforcement learning guided by verifiable rewards; integrate this with a weighted consensus tournament that combines explicit reasoning preferences with implicit generator confidence to select queries.

Result: On the BIRD benchmark, JudgeSQL demonstrates superior SQL judgment capabilities, with good cross-scale generalization and robustness to generator capacity.

Conclusion: JudgeSQL provides a reliable, interpretable, and efficient approach to SQL candidate selection by combining structured reasoning with a consensus mechanism, improving stability and generalization in Text-to-SQL systems.

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a pivotal task that bridges natural language understanding and
structured data access, yet it remains fundamentally challenging due to
semantic ambiguity and complex compositional reasoning. While large language
models (LLMs) have greatly advanced SQL generation though prompting, supervised
finetuning and reinforced tuning, the shift toward test-time scaling exposes a
new bottleneck: selecting the correct query from a diverse candidate pool.
Existing selection approaches, such as self-consistency or best-of-$N$
decoding, provide only shallow signals, making them prone to inconsistent
scoring, fragile reasoning chains, and a failure to capture fine-grained
semantic distinctions between closely related SQL candidates. To this end, we
introduce JudgeSQL, a principled framework that redefines SQL candidate
selection through structured reasoning and weighted consensus tournament
mechanism. JudgeSQL develops a reasoning-based SQL judge model that distills
reasoning traces with reinforcement learning guided by verifiable rewards,
enabling accurate and interpretable judgments. Building on this, a weighted
consensus tournament integrates explicit reasoning preferences with implicit
generator confidence, yielding selections that are both more reliable and more
efficient. Extensive experiments on the BIRD benchmark demonstrate that
JudgeSQL exhibits superior SQL judgment capabilities and good cross-scale
generalization and robustness to generator capacity.

*Lavanya Umapathy,Patricia M Johnson,Tarun Dutt,Angela Tong,Madhur Nayan,Hersh Chandarana,Daniel K Sodickson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A temporal-context machine learning framework improves prostate cancer risk prediction by integrating prior visit data, substantially reducing false positives while maintaining high sensitivity across current and 5-year horizons.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal context in medical data can compensate for limited historic data, improving specificity of risk predictions and enabling scalable longitudinal monitoring.

Method: Two-stage approach: estimate risk from the most recent visit, then refine with information from prior imaging and clinical biomarkers. Applied to a large multi-modal PCa dataset (28,342 patients, 39,013 MRIs, 68,931 blood tests) over ~10 years, evaluating current-visit risk and 5-year risk using up to three prior imaging exams and prior clinical data.

Result: For current-visit risk: false positives reduced from 51% to 33% with up to three prior MRIs, and to 24% when including prior clinical data, while preserving high sensitivity. For 5-year risk: false positives reduced from 64% to 9%. Overall specificity improved with temporal context.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that longitudinal information enhances risk specificity; suggests potential to scale longitudinal health monitoring in large populations with low baseline risk, enabling earlier detection and improved outcomes.

Abstract: Temporal context in medicine is valuable in assessing key changes in patient
health over time. We developed a machine learning framework to integrate
diverse context from prior visits to improve health monitoring, especially when
prior visits are limited and their frequency is variable. Our model first
estimates initial risk of disease using medical data from the most recent
patient visit, then refines this assessment using information digested from
previously collected imaging and/or clinical biomarkers. We applied our
framework to prostate cancer (PCa) risk prediction using data from a large
population (28,342 patients, 39,013 magnetic resonance imaging scans, 68,931
blood tests) collected over nearly a decade. For predictions of the risk of
clinically significant PCa at the time of the visit, integrating prior context
directly converted false positives to true negatives, increasing overall
specificity while preserving high sensitivity. False positive rates were
reduced progressively from 51% to 33% when integrating information from up to
three prior imaging examinations, as compared to using data from a single
visit, and were further reduced to 24% when also including additional context
from prior clinical data. For predicting the risk of PCa within five years of
the visit, incorporating prior context reduced false positive rates still
further (64% to 9%). Our findings show that information collected over time
provides relevant context to enhance the specificity of medical risk
prediction. For a wide range of progressive conditions, sufficient reduction of
false positive rates using context could offer a pathway to expand longitudinal
health monitoring programs to large populations with comparatively low baseline
risk of disease, leading to earlier detection and improved health outcomes.

TL;DR: Proposes SciRecipe dataset and Thoth model with a Sketch-and-Fill paradigm and a structured reward to generate reliable executable biological protocols, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reproducibility in science is hindered by incomplete/inconsistent protocols; current LLMs struggle to produce precise, verifiable experimental steps. The work aims to bridge knowledge and execution with reliable, executable protocols.

Method: Create SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset (>12K protocols across 27 biological subfields) for comprehension and problem-solving tasks. Introduce Sketch-and-Fill to separate analysis, structuring, and expression. Implement a structured component-based reward evaluating step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity. Develop Thoth via a staged Knowledge-to-Action process progressing from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning to executable protocol generation.

Result: Thoth consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs on multiple benchmarks, achieving improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic accuracy of generated protocols.

Conclusion: The approach enables reliable scientific assistants that can translate knowledge into executable experimental protocols; all data, code, and models will be released publicly.

Abstract: The foundation of reproducible science lies in protocols that are precise,
logically ordered, and executable. The autonomous generation of these protocols
through natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the
reproduction process. However, current leading large language models (LLMs)
often generate incomplete or inconsistent protocols, limiting their utility. To
address this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of
over 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing
both comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol
generation, we propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which separates
analysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and
verifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism
evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model
optimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we
develop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that
progresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately
to robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth
consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving
significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic
accuracy. Our approach paves the way for reliable scientific assistants that
bridge knowledge with experimental execution. All data, code, and models will
be released publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current agentic science systems rely on fixed workflows and limited long-horizon context, hindering adaptivity and sustained autonomous research; there is a need for persistent context, memory across sessions, and non-disruptive human interaction.

Method: Proposes a modular, open-source framework with fully dynamic workflows driven by real-time agent reasoning; automatic context compaction; workspace-based communication to prevent information degradation; memory persistence across sessions; non-blocking human interventions; and a design that allows users to customize by adding/removing agents.

Result: A comprehensive architectural framework and implementation plan for continual, end-to-end automated research, including dynamic workflows and robust context management, with demonstrated potential for broad applicability across scientific domains.

Conclusion: The work presents architectural principles and practical means to deploy interactive multiagent systems for automated science, aiming to enable continual exploration and broader adoption across domains.

Abstract: The automation of scientific discovery represents a critical milestone in
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. However, existing agentic systems for
science suffer from two fundamental limitations: rigid, pre-programmed
workflows that cannot adapt to intermediate findings, and inadequate context
management that hinders long-horizon research. We present
\texttt{freephdlabor}, an open-source multiagent framework featuring
\textit{fully dynamic workflows} determined by real-time agent reasoning and a
\coloremph{\textit{modular architecture}} enabling seamless customization --
users can modify, add, or remove agents to address domain-specific
requirements. The framework provides comprehensive infrastructure including
\textit{automatic context compaction}, \textit{workspace-based communication}
to prevent information degradation, \textit{memory persistence} across
sessions, and \textit{non-blocking human intervention} mechanisms. These
features collectively transform automated research from isolated, single-run
attempts into \textit{continual research programs} that build systematically on
prior explorations and incorporate human feedback. By providing both the
architectural principles and practical implementation for building customizable
co-scientist systems, this work aims to facilitate broader adoption of
automated research across scientific domains, enabling practitioners to deploy
interactive multiagent systems that autonomously conduct end-to-end research --
from ideation through experimentation to publication-ready manuscripts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Addresses diversity of evaluators and richer feedback beyond binary comparisons to identify latent user preferences; proposes an EM-DPO with annotator-type discovery and a min-max regret fairness aggregator to enable fair, personalized RLHF alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) rely on uniform, binary preferences, which fail to capture heterogeneous human values and hinder identifiability; there is a need to model diverse annotators and ensure fair performance across users.

Method: Establishes a link to econometrics showing binary comparisons are insufficient for identifying latent preferences with finite data and many users; demonstrates that incomplete rankings over three or more responses are identifiable. Introduces an EM adaptation of DPO to discover annotator types and train a mixture of LLMs, and proposes a min-max regret-based aggregation algorithm to produce a single policy with fairness guarantees.

Result: Provides theoretical identifiability results and an algorithmic framework for fairness and personalization in RLHF; develops EM-DPO for annotator-type discovery and a fairness-aware aggregation method, laying groundwork for diverse-user alignment in generative models.

Conclusion: The work offers a principled theory and algorithms to account for heterogeneous human preferences, enabling fair and personalized alignment of generative models and expanding beyond binary, uniform preference assumptions.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become central to
aligning large language models with human values, typically by first learning a
reward model from preference data which is then used to update the model with
reinforcement learning. Recent alternatives such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) simplify this pipeline by directly optimizing on
preferences. However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator
preferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations:
the diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In
this work, we address both these issues. First, we connect preference learning
in RLHF with the econometrics literature and show that binary comparisons are
insufficient for identifying latent user preferences from finite user data and
infinite users, while (even incomplete) rankings over three or more responses
ensure identifiability. Second, we introduce methods to incorporate
heterogeneous preferences into alignment algorithms. We develop an
Expectation-Maximization adaptation of DPO that discovers latent annotator
types and trains a mixture of LLMs accordingly. Then we propose an aggregation
algorithm using a min-max regret fairness criterion to produce a single
generative policy with equitable performance guarantees. Together, these
contributions establish a theoretical and algorithmic framework for fairness
and personalization for diverse users in generative model alignment.

accuracy of the extracted data against annotated ground truth. The approach
involves pre-processing scanned or digital invoices, applying Docling and

<details>

Motivation: Multimodal Parkinson's assessment is hampered by the need to synchronize modalities during training and requiring all modalities at inference; also, modality collapse and class imbalance hinder performance.

Method: Formulates multimodal learning as a multi-objective optimization problem; introduces TRIP for relaxed modality requirements; employs a margin-based class rebalancing strategy; evaluated under synchronous and asynchronous settings on three public datasets.

Result: State-of-the-art performance; gains of 16.48, 6.89, 11.55 percentage points in asynchronous across datasets and 4.86, 2.30 pp in synchronous.

Conclusion: Demonstrates effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed approach, addressing practical modality constraints and improving Parkinson's assessment performance; shows potential for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease assessment has garnered growing interest in recent years,
particularly with the advent of sensor data and machine learning techniques.
Among these, multimodal approaches have demonstrated strong performance by
effectively integrating complementary information from various data sources.
However, two major limitations hinder their practical application: (1) the need
to synchronize all modalities during training, and (2) the dependence on all
modalities during inference. To address these issues, we propose the first
Parkinson's assessment system that formulates multimodal learning as a
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. This not only allows for more
flexible modality requirements during both training and inference, but also
handles modality collapse issue during multimodal information fusion. In
addition, to mitigate the imbalance within individual modalities, we introduce
a margin-based class rebalancing strategy to enhance category learning. We
conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets under both synchronous
and asynchronous settings. The results show that our framework-Towards Relaxed
InPuts (TRIP)-achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best
baselines by 16.48, 6.89, and 11.55 percentage points in the asynchronous
setting, and by 4.86 and 2.30 percentage points in the synchronous setting,
highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability.

### [139] [Preliminary Quantitative Study on Explainability and Trust in AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15769)
*Allen Daniel Sunny*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Interactive, web-based loan-approval study shows that explainability design, especially interactivity and counterfactuals, boosts user engagement and trust; clarity and relevance of explanations are key drivers of trust.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems scale in critical domains (law, healthcare, finance), there is a pressing need to empirically understand how explainability affects user trust and transparency.

Method: Quantitative experimental design using an interactive loan-approval simulation. Participants are exposed to varying explanation styles—from basic feature importance to interactive counterfactual explanations—and trust is measured.

Result: Interactivity increases user engagement and confidence in AI decisions. The perceived trust hinges on the clarity and relevance of explanations; more interactive and tailored explanations yield higher trust.

Conclusion: The study provides empirical evidence that explainability design impacts user trust in human-centered AI, suggesting that interactive, clear, and relevant explanations can enhance trust in AI-supported decision-making.

Abstract: Large-scale AI models such as GPT-4 have accelerated the deployment of
artificial intelligence across critical domains including law, healthcare, and
finance, raising urgent questions about trust and transparency. This study
investigates the relationship between explainability and user trust in AI
systems through a quantitative experimental design. Using an interactive,
web-based loan approval simulation, we compare how different types of
explanations, ranging from basic feature importance to interactive
counterfactuals influence perceived trust. Results suggest that interactivity
enhances both user engagement and confidence, and that the clarity and
relevance of explanations are key determinants of trust. These findings
contribute empirical evidence to the growing field of human-centered
explainable AI, highlighting measurable effects of explainability design on
user perception

### [140] [Self-evolving expertise in complex non-verifiable subject domains: dialogue as implicit meta-RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15772)
*Richard M. Bailey*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Dialectica is a dialogue-trained framework that augments LLM agents with memory, self-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing to develop targeted expertise in open, non-verifiable domains, outperforming baseline agents on multiple evaluation metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wicked problems are complex, non-verifiable, with heterogeneous impacts and no single objective truth. LLMs struggle to develop expertise through experience alone; there is a need for endogenous learning mechanisms. Dialectica introduces memory, reflection, and controlled context editing to enable agents to learn from dialogue.

Method: Agents engage in structured topic-focused dialogue augmented by memory and self-reflection, with policy-constrained context editing. The process is framed as implicit meta-reinforcement learning. Evaluation uses post-hoc judged pairwise comparisons of responses. Experiments covered two model architectures (locally run Qwen3:30b and OpenAI's o4-mini). Metrics include Elo scores, normalized Bradley-Terry-Davidson ability, and AlphaRank mass.

Result: Reflection-based context editing during discussion yields agents that dominate baseline counterparts across Elo, BT-Davidson ability, and AlphaRank mass. Learning signatures appear in statement and reflection logs, where reflections identify weaknesses and shape subsequent statements. Quantitative and qualitative evidence agree, supporting dialogue-driven context evolution as a practical route to targeted expertise amplification in open non-verifiable domains.

Conclusion: Dialogue-driven context evolution, facilitated by memory and reflection within a structured dialogue framework, is a practical and effective approach to amplifying targeted expertise in open, non-verifiable domains.

Abstract: So-called `wicked problems', those involving complex multi-dimensional
settings, non-verifiable outcomes, heterogeneous impacts and a lack of single
objectively correct answers, have plagued humans throughout history. Modern
examples include decisions over justice frameworks, solving environmental
pollution, planning for pandemic resilience and food security. The use of
state-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems (notably Large Language
Model-based agents) collaborating with humans on solving such problems is being
actively explored. While the abilities of LLMs can be improved by, for example,
fine-tuning, hand-crafted system prompts and scaffolding with external tools,
LLMs lack endogenous mechanisms to develop expertise through experience in such
settings. This work address this gap with Dialectica, a framework where agents
engage in structured dialogue on defined topics, augmented by memory,
self-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing. Formally, discussion
is viewed as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process. The
`dialogue-trained' agents are evaluated post-hoc using judged pairwise
comparisons of elicited responses. Across two model architectures (locally run
Qwen3:30b and OpenAI's o4-mini) results show that enabling reflection-based
context editing during discussion produces agents which dominate their baseline
counterparts on Elo scores, normalized Bradley-Terry-Davidson ability, and
AlphaRank mass. The predicted signatures of learning are observed qualitatively
in statement and reflection logs, where reflections identify weaknesses and
reliably shape subsequent statements. Agreement between quantitative and
qualitative evidence supports dialogue-driven context evolution as a practical
path to targeted expertise amplification in open non-verifiable domains.

*Philip DiGiacomo,Haoyang Wang,Jinrui Fang,Yan Leng,W Michael Brode,Ying Ding*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach that combines clinical guidelines with high-quality systematic reviews yields the best performance for Long COVID clinical question answering, outperforming narrow guideline-based and broad literature database configurations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve AI-assisted clinical decision support for complex, emerging diseases (Long COVID) by evaluating how different retrieval sources affect accuracy, relevance, and usefulness of responses.

Method: Defined six RAG configurations using various sources (expert-curated guidelines, high-quality systematic reviews, and large-scale literature databases); evaluated with an LLM-as-judge framework across faithfulness, relevance, and comprehensiveness on LongCOVID-CQ, a dataset of expert-generated clinical questions.

Result: The RAG configuration that combined clinical guidelines with high-quality systematic reviews consistently outperformed both narrow single-guideline approaches and large-scale literature databases.

Conclusion: For emerging diseases, retrieval grounded in curated secondary reviews offers a balance between consensus guidance and primary literature, aiding clinical decisions while avoiding overload. The authors propose Guide-RAG, a chatbot system and evaluation framework that integrates curated expert knowledge with comprehensive literature databases.

Abstract: As AI chatbots gain adoption in clinical medicine, developing effective
frameworks for complex, emerging diseases presents significant challenges. We
developed and evaluated six Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) corpus
configurations for Long COVID (LC) clinical question answering, ranging from
expert-curated sources to large-scale literature databases. Our evaluation
employed an LLM-as-a-judge framework across faithfulness, relevance, and
comprehensiveness metrics using LongCOVID-CQ, a novel dataset of
expert-generated clinical questions. Our RAG corpus configuration combining
clinical guidelines with high-quality systematic reviews consistently
outperformed both narrow single-guideline approaches and large-scale literature
databases. Our findings suggest that for emerging diseases, retrieval grounded
in curated secondary reviews provides an optimal balance between narrow
consensus documents and unfiltered primary literature, supporting clinical
decision-making while avoiding information overload and oversimplified
guidance. We propose Guide-RAG, a chatbot system and accompanying evaluation
framework that integrates both curated expert knowledge and comprehensive
literature databases to effectively answer LC clinical questions.

*Oskar Triebe,Fletcher Passow,Simon Wittner,Leonie Wagner,Julio Arend,Tao Sun,Chad Zanocco,Marek Miltner,Arezou Ghesmati,Chen-Hao Tsai,Christoph Bergmeir,Ram Rajagopal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-level, interpretable nodal load forecasting framework that extends zonal forecasts to the nodal level using a scalable, parallel single-model workflow, improving accuracy and interpretability for both zonal and nodal forecasts and aiding operator risk assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rising load uncertainty from sustainable energy integration requires higher-resolution load forecasts at the nodal level. Nodal forecasts are typically less accurate and harder to manage for operators in daily control-room risk assessment.

Method: Develop a multi-level forecasting system with access to a large dataset of zonal and nodal net loads; create an interpretable, scalable forecasting model that can progressively extend zonal forecasts to nodal forecasts; address nodal heterogeneity and volatility under a trade-off; implement a fully parallelized single-model forecasting workflow; evaluate components in collaboration with a TSO.

Result: The approach yields accuracy and interpretability improvements for zonal forecasts and substantial improvements for nodal forecasts; the system enables operators to adjust forecasts with greater confidence and to diagnose otherwise opaque errors more precisely.

Conclusion: The proposed multi-level forecasting framework meets operational needs for hourly day-ahead forecasts, allowing gradual extension from zonal to nodal forecasts, while providing interpretable diagnostics and robust, parallel workflows for control-room use.

Abstract: The reliability of local power grid infrastructure is challenged by
sustainable energy developments increasing electric load uncertainty.
Transmission System Operators (TSOs) need load forecasts of higher spatial
resolution, extending current forecasting operations from zonal aggregates to
individual nodes. However, nodal loads are less accurate to forecast and
require a large number of individual forecasts, which are hard to manage for
the human experts assessing risks in the control room's daily operations
(operator). In collaboration with a TSO, we design a multi-level system that
meets the needs of operators for hourly day-ahead load forecasting. Utilizing a
uniquely extensive dataset of zonal and nodal net loads, we experimentally
evaluate our system components. First, we develop an interpretable and scalable
forecasting model that allows for TSOs to gradually extend zonal operations to
include nodal forecasts. Second, we evaluate solutions to address the
heterogeneity and volatility of nodal load, subject to a trade-off. Third, our
system is manageable with a fully parallelized single-model forecasting
workflow. Our results show accuracy and interpretability improvements for zonal
forecasts, and substantial improvements for nodal forecasts. In practice, our
multi-level forecasting system allows operators to adjust forecasts with
unprecedented confidence and accuracy, and to diagnose otherwise opaque errors
precisely.

### [144] [TangledFeatures: Robust Feature Selection in Highly Correlated Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15005)
*Allen Daniel Sunny*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TangledFeatures identifies representative features from groups of entangled predictors to reduce redundancy in correlated spaces, yielding an interpretable subset that preserves explanatory power, demonstrated on Alanine Dipeptide to predict backbone torsional angles using structurally meaningful intra-atomic distances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current feature selection methods emphasize predictive accuracy but degrade with correlated predictors, leading to instability and poor interpretability. There is a need for a method that handles feature entanglement and yields robust, interpretable feature subsets.

Method: Introduce TangledFeatures, a framework that groups entangled predictors and selects representative features from each group to form a non-redundant subset for downstream models. Demonstrated on Alanine Dipeptide for predicting backbone torsional angles.

Result: The selected features correspond to structurally meaningful intra-atomic distances and explain variation in backbone torsional angles, reducing redundancy while preserving (or potentially enhancing) explanatory power and improving interpretability compared with traditional methods.

Conclusion: TangledFeatures provides a practical approach to feature selection in correlated spaces, delivering stable, interpretable feature sets that align with underlying domain structure, as shown in biomolecular data on Alanine Dipeptide.

Abstract: Feature selection is a fundamental step in model development, shaping both
predictive performance and interpretability. Yet, most widely used methods
focus on predictive accuracy, and their performance degrades in the presence of
correlated predictors. To address this gap, we introduce TangledFeatures, a
framework for feature selection in correlated feature spaces. It identifies
representative features from groups of entangled predictors, reducing
redundancy while retaining explanatory power. The resulting feature subset can
be directly applied in downstream models, offering a more interpretable and
stable basis for analysis compared to traditional selection techniques. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of TangledFeatures on Alanine Dipeptide, applying
it to the prediction of backbone torsional angles and show that the selected
features correspond to structurally meaningful intra-atomic distances that
explain variation in these angles.

### [145] [ES-C51: Expected Sarsa Based C51 Distributional Reinforcement Learning Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15006)
*Rijul Tandon,Peter Vamplew,Cameron Foale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ES-C51 replaces greedy Q-learning in C51 with an Expected Sarsa update and softmax action integration, improving stability and performance over QL-C51; evaluated on Gym classic control and Atari-10 with softmax exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In distributional RL with discrete actions, multiple actions can have similar expected rewards but different distributions, causing instability in learning the distribution if only the greedy action is used.

Method: Swap the greedy Bellman update for an Expected Sarsa update that aggregates information from all actions via a softmax-weighted combination; transition from epsilon-greedy to softmax exploration for fair comparison; evaluate on Gym classic control tasks and Atari-10.

Result: ES-C51 demonstrates superior performance to QL-C51 across many environments, indicating improved stability and learning when action distributions differ.

Conclusion: An Expected Sarsa-based distributional update with softmax action integration can stabilize and improve performance in discrete-action distributional RL, addressing instability when multiple actions have similar expected rewards.

Abstract: In most value-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, the agent
estimates only the expected reward for each action and selects the action with
the highest reward. In contrast, Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
estimates the entire probability distribution of possible rewards, providing
richer information about uncertainty and variability. C51 is a popular DRL
algorithm for discrete action spaces. It uses a Q-learning approach, where the
distribution is learned using a greedy Bellman update. However, this can cause
problems if multiple actions at a state have similar expected reward but with
different distributions, as the algorithm may not learn a stable distribution.
This study presents a modified version of C51 (ES-C51) that replaces the greedy
Q-learning update with an Expected Sarsa update, which uses a softmax
calculation to combine information from all possible actions at a state rather
than relying on a single best action. This reduces instability when actions
have similar expected rewards and allows the agent to learn higher-performing
policies. This approach is evaluated on classic control environments from Gym,
and Atari-10 games. For a fair comparison, we modify the standard C51's
exploration strategy from e-greedy to softmax, which we refer to as QL-C51 (Q-
Learning based C51). The results demonstrate that ES-C51 outperforms QL-C51
across many environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wind turbine reliability is critical in renewable energy; early fault detection reduces downtime and maintenance costs; need an unsupervised approach that does not rely on labeled faults.

Method: Feature engineering pipeline extracting temporal, statistical, and frequency-domain indicators; three deep models (Variational Autoencoder, LSTM Autoencoder, and Transformer) process high-dimensional SCADA data; ensemble scoring of model predictions and adaptive thresholding for anomaly detection.

Result: On CARE dataset (89 years of real-world turbine data across 3 wind farms), achieved AUC-ROC of 0.947 and detected faults up to 48 hours before failure.

Conclusion: Demonstrates societal value by enabling predictive maintenance, reducing turbine failures, and improving operational efficiency in large-scale wind energy deployments; unsupervised ensemble approach mitigates reliance on labeled fault data.

Abstract: Wind turbine reliability is critical to the growing renewable energy sector,
where early fault detection significantly reduces downtime and maintenance
costs. This paper introduces a novel ensemble-based deep learning framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in wind turbines. The method integrates
Variational Autoencoders (VAE), LSTM Autoencoders, and Transformer
architectures, each capturing different temporal and contextual patterns from
high-dimensional SCADA data. A unique feature engineering pipeline extracts
temporal, statistical, and frequency-domain indicators, which are then
processed by the deep models. Ensemble scoring combines model predictions,
followed by adaptive thresholding to detect operational anomalies without
requiring labeled fault data. Evaluated on the CARE dataset containing 89 years
of real-world turbine data across three wind farms, the proposed method
achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.947 and early fault detection up to 48 hours prior to
failure. This approach offers significant societal value by enabling predictive
maintenance, reducing turbine failures, and enhancing operational efficiency in

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AlignFlow applies Semi-Discrete OT to align noise and data in FGMs, enabling scalable and convergent training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OT-based coupling improves trajectory straightness but minibatch OT limits scalability for large/high-dimensional data; SDOT provides an explicit optimal map with convergence guarantees.

Method: Construct Laguerre-cell partitions of the noise space; map each cell to a data point via the SDOT map; during training pair i.i.d. noise with data points using this map; integrates as a plug-and-play component with existing FGM algorithms.

Result: Empirically improves performance across state-of-the-art FGMs with negligible overhead and scales to large datasets and architectures.

Conclusion: SDOT-based alignment offers scalable, convergent coupling for FGMs; AlignFlow is a practical plug-and-play enhancement, with available code.

Abstract: Flow-based Generative Models (FGMs) effectively transform noise into complex
data distributions. Incorporating Optimal Transport (OT) to couple noise and
data during FGM training has been shown to improve the straightness of flow
trajectories, enabling more effective inference. However, existing OT-based
methods estimate the OT plan using (mini-)batches of sampled noise and data
points, which limits their scalability to large and high-dimensional datasets
in FGMs. This paper introduces AlignFlow, a novel approach that leverages
Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport (SDOT) to enhance the training of FGMs by
establishing an explicit, optimal alignment between noise distribution and data
points with guaranteed convergence. SDOT computes a transport map by
partitioning the noise space into Laguerre cells, each mapped to a
corresponding data point. During FGM training, i.i.d. noise samples are paired
with data points via the SDOT map. AlignFlow scales well to large datasets and
model architectures with negligible computational overhead. Experimental
results show that AlignFlow improves the performance of a wide range of
state-of-the-art FGM algorithms and can be integrated as a plug-and-play
component. Code is available at: https://github.com/konglk1203/AlignFlow.

TL;DR: Introduces IQNN-CS, an interpretable quantum neural network for multiclass credit risk classification, equipped with Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA) to quantify class-wise attribution divergence, achieving competitive performance with enhanced interpretability on two real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Credit scoring is high-stakes and highly regulated; quantum machine learning offers power but is often a black box. There is a need for transparent, trustworthy QML models in finance that provide explanations for decisions across multiple risk classes.

Method: Proposes an architecture that fuses a variational quantum neural network (QNN) with tailored post-hoc explanation techniques for structured data. Introduces Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA), a novel metric that measures how feature attributions diverge across predicted credit-risk classes, facilitating cross-class interpretability. Evaluated on two real-world credit datasets with training stability and interpretability analyses.

Result: IQNN-CS demonstrates stable training dynamics, competitive predictive performance relative to baselines, and enhanced interpretability through post-hoc explanations and the ICAA metric, which reveals how the model distinguishes between risk categories.

Conclusion: The work provides a practical path toward transparent and accountable quantum ML models for financial decision-making, indicating that interpretable QML can be viable in high-stakes credit scoring.

Abstract: Credit scoring is a high-stakes task in financial services, where model
decisions directly impact individuals' access to credit and are subject to
strict regulatory scrutiny. While Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers new
computational capabilities, its black-box nature poses challenges for adoption
in domains that demand transparency and trust. In this work, we present
IQNN-CS, an interpretable quantum neural network framework designed for
multiclass credit risk classification. The architecture combines a variational
QNN with a suite of post-hoc explanation techniques tailored for structured
data. To address the lack of structured interpretability in QML, we introduce
Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA), a novel metric that quantifies
attribution divergence across predicted classes, revealing how the model
distinguishes between credit risk categories. Evaluated on two real-world
credit datasets, IQNN-CS demonstrates stable training dynamics, competitive
predictive performance, and enhanced interpretability. Our results highlight a

*Shiqi Chen,Tongyao Zhu,Zian Wang,Jinghan Zhang,Kangrui Wang,Siyang Gao,Teng Xiao,Yee Whye Teh,Junxian He,Manling Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPA: a simple RL framework for LLM agents that learns an internal world model via self-play supervised finetuning and uses imagined futures to guide policy optimization, yielding strong OOD performance improvements on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle in out-of-distribution environments; grounding reasoning in environmental dynamics is difficult; vanilla RL shows brittle exploration; need internal dynamics model to improve generalization.

Method: Decompose world model into state representation and transition modeling; SPA pre-trains the world model through Self-Play Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) by interacting with the environment; then uses the learned world model to simulate future states (mental rollouts) before policy optimization; cold-starts policy with SFT.

Result: Outperforms online world-modeling baselines; improved RL training; Demonstrated large gains in Sokoban (25.6% -> 59.8%) and FrozenLake (22.1% -> 70.9%) for Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct; also demonstrated benefits across Sokoban, FrozenLake, Sudoku.

Conclusion: A minimal, effective approach to integrate an internal world model with LLM agents, improving out-of-distribution decision-making and RL training efficiency; the approach is simple yet powerful, though effectiveness depends on the quality of the world model and may scale with task complexity.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents often struggle in out-of-distribution
(OOD) scenarios. Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, governed by
task-specific rules and stochasticity, which makes it difficult for LLMs to
ground their internal knowledge in those dynamics. Under such OOD conditions,
vanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability
that at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across
training steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization.
Inspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping
LLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with
environmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this
world model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and
transition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement
learning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised
finetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the
environment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy
optimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling
baseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance.
Experiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku
show that our approach significantly improves performance. For example, SPA
boosts the Sokoban success rate from 25.6% to 59.8% and raises the FrozenLake
score from 22.1% to 70.9% for the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model.

### [150] [Learn to Change the World: Multi-level Reinforcement Learning with Model-Changing Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15056)
*Ziqing Lu,Babak Hassibi,Lifeng Lai,Weiyu Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a two-layer RL framework (MCTVMDP) where the agent can modify world dynamics via upper-level actions, jointly optimizing policy in the lower MDP and its configuration to boost long-term reward.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional RL assumes fixed environments; enabling model-changing actions lets agents actively shape dynamics to improve rewards, enabling a new class of non-stationary, controllable environments and long-horizon planning.

Method: Define a multi-layer configurable time-varying MDP (MCTVMDP). The lower-level MDP has non-stationary transitions that are configurable by upper-level model-changing actions. The agent optimizes both upper-level configuration policies and lower-level primitive-action policies to maximize expected long-term discounted reward.

Result: Formalizes the MCTVMDP framework and presents a two-tier optimization objective, arguing that configuring dynamics can, in principle, increase rewards and outlining a basis for algorithms that learn both configuration and action policies.

Conclusion: Jointly optimizing configuration and action policies in a hierarchically configurable RL setting is a promising direction, introducing a new class of problems with configurable dynamics; future work includes algorithm design, theoretical guarantees, and empirical validation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning usually assumes a given or sometimes even fixed
environment in which an agent seeks an optimal policy to maximize its long-term
discounted reward. In contrast, we consider agents that are not limited to
passive adaptations: they instead have model-changing actions that actively
modify the RL model of world dynamics itself. Reconfiguring the underlying
transition processes can potentially increase the agents' rewards. Motivated by
this setting, we introduce the multi-layer configurable time-varying Markov
decision process (MCTVMDP). In an MCTVMDP, the lower-level MDP has a
non-stationary transition function that is configurable through upper-level
model-changing actions. The agent's objective consists of two parts: Optimize
the configuration policies in the upper-level MDP and optimize the primitive
action policies in the lower-level MDP to jointly improve its expected
long-term reward.

### [151] [Antislop: A Comprehensive Framework for Identifying and Eliminating Repetitive Patterns in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15061)
*Samuel Paech,Allen Roush,Judah Goldfeder,Ravid Shwartz-Ziv*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Antislop is a framework to detect and remove repetitive 'slop' in LLM outputs using three parts: an inference-time Antislop Sampler, a profiling/data-generation pipeline, and a token-level fine-tuning method (FTPO). It achieves strong slop suppression (about 90%), outperforms DPO, and preserves or improves cross-domain performance, with code released under MIT license.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Widespread adoption of large language models has led to characteristic repetitive phrasing, or 'slop', which diminishes output quality and makes AI-authored text easily identifiable. There is a need for a comprehensive toolkit that detects, profiles, and eliminates slop without sacrificing language quality.

Method: Three innovations: (1) Antislop Sampler — backtracking-based inference-time suppression of banned strings while preserving vocabulary; (2) Automated profiling pipeline — quantifies model-specific slop against human baselines and generates targeted training data; (3) Final Token Preference Optimization (FTPO) — a token-level fine-tuning method that adjusts logits wherever a banned pattern appeared in an inference trace.

Result: Slop patterns are over 1,000x more frequent in LLM output than in human text. The Antislop Sampler suppresses 8,000+ patterns while maintaining quality; simple token banning fails beyond ~2,000 patterns. FTPO achieves ~90% slop reduction and maintains or improves performance across GSM8K, MMLU, and creative writing tasks. DPO performs worse, degrading writing quality and lexical diversity despite weaker slop suppression. Code and results are released under MIT license: https://github.com/sam-paech/auto-antislop.

Conclusion: Antislop provides an effective, end-to-end solution to detect and eliminate slop with strong empirical performance. FTPO is particularly impactful at preserving quality while achieving substantial slop reduction; DPO is less favorable in this setting. The authors release open-source tooling for broader adoption.

Abstract: Widespread LLM adoption has introduced characteristic repetitive phraseology,
termed ``slop,'' which degrades output quality and makes AI-generated text
immediately recognizable. We present Antislop, a comprehensive framework
providing tools to both detect and eliminate these overused patterns. Our
approach combines three innovations: (1) The Antislop Sampler, which uses
backtracking to suppress unwanted strings at inference time without destroying
vocabulary; (2) An automated pipeline that profiles model-specific slop against
human baselines and generates training data; (3) Final Token Preference
Optimization (FTPO), a novel fine-tuning method that operates on individual
tokens, surgically adjusting logits wherever a banned pattern has appeared in
an inference trace. We demonstrate that some slop patterns appear over
1,000$\times$ more frequently in LLM output than human text. The Antislop
Sampler successfully suppresses 8,000+ patterns while maintaining quality,
whereas token banning becomes unusable at just 2,000. Most importantly, FTPO
achieves 90\% slop reduction while maintaining or improving performance in
cross-domain evals including GSM8K, MMLU, and creative writing tasks. In
contrast, DPO suffers significant degradation in writing quality and lexical
diversity despite achieving weaker suppression. We release all code and results
under MIT license: https://github.com/sam-paech/auto-antislop.

### [152] [Physics-informed data-driven machine health monitoring for two-photon lithography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15075)
*Sixian Jia,Zhiqiao Dong,Chenhui Shao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Three health-monitoring methods for two-photon lithography (TPL) using physics-informed data-driven models and statistics to predict structure dimensions; validated on a dataset with six process parameter combinations, six structure dimensions, and two machine-health states; shows high accuracy and generalizability for condition-based maintenance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TPL requires reliable, timely maintenance; current practice is experience-based, causing downtime or wasted effort; informed monitoring can improve fabrication quality and uptime.

Method: The paper proposes three methods that integrate physics-informed data-driven predictive models with statistical approaches to predict structure dimensions under varying process parameters and health conditions, evaluated on a comprehensive dataset across six parameter combinations, six dimensions, and two health states to assess robustness and generalizability.

Result: Across test scenarios, the methods achieve high accuracies, demonstrating robustness, effectiveness, and generalizability for condition-based maintenance of TPL systems.

Conclusion: The work represents a significant step toward proactive, condition-based maintenance for two-photon lithography, enabling timely maintenance decisions and improved fabrication reliability.

Abstract: Two-photon lithography (TPL) is a sophisticated additive manufacturing
technology for creating three-dimensional (3D) micro- and nano-structures.
Maintaining the health of TPL systems is critical for ensuring consistent
fabrication quality. Current maintenance practices often rely on experience
rather than informed monitoring of machine health, resulting in either untimely
maintenance that causes machine downtime and poor-quality fabrication, or
unnecessary maintenance that leads to inefficiencies and avoidable downtime. To
address this gap, this paper presents three methods for accurate and timely
monitoring of TPL machine health. Through integrating physics-informed
data-driven predictive models for structure dimensions with statistical
approaches, the proposed methods are able to handle increasingly complex
scenarios featuring different levels of generalizability. A comprehensive
experimental dataset that encompasses six process parameter combinations and
six structure dimensions under two machine health conditions was collected to
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Across all test
scenarios, the approaches are shown to achieve high accuracies, demonstrating
excellent effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability. These results
represent a significant step toward condition-based maintenance for TPL
systems.

### [153] [Online Correlation Clustering: Simultaneously Optimizing All $\ell_p$-norms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15076)
*Sami Davies,Benjamin Moseley,Heather Newman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In the AOS (online-with-a-sample) model, a single sampling-based online algorithm achieves simultaneous approximations for all l_p norms in correlation clustering: O(log^4 n)-competitive for every p>0 with high probability, O(log n)-competitive for the l_infty norm with high probability, and O(1)-competitive for the l_1 norm in expectation; plus RO lower bounds showing a separation and near-tight AOS bounds for l_1 and l_infty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend the offline notion of an 'all-norms' clustering—where one clustering approximates all l_p norms simultaneously—to the online setting, and to understand the inherent difficulty of fairness-oriented objectives under online arrivals.

Method: Propose an online-with-a-sample (AOS) algorithm that uses a small constant-fraction sample of the input to guide a single clustering; show that this clustering simultaneously achieves near-optimal competitive guarantees for all l_p norms with high probability (and in expectation for l_1), along with an explicit analysis of the sample-based approach.

Result: The algorithm achieves: (i) O(log^4 n)-competitive for all l_p norms with high probability, (ii) O(log n)-competitive for l_infty with high probability, and (iii) O(1)-competitive for l_1 in expectation. The paper also proves a hardness separation in the standard random-order (RO) online model — l_1 is easy to approximate, but any RO algorithm for l_infty must incur at least Omega(n^{1/3})-competitive ratio — illustrating the necessity of beyond-worst-case models. Complementary lower bounds show the l_1 and l_infty guarantees in the AOS model are near-tight.

Conclusion: This work successfully transfers the offline 'all-norms' guarantee to the online realm via the AOS model, while clarifying limits in RO and providing near-tight bounds, highlighting the importance of sample-based online models for multi-objective fairness-aware clustering.

Abstract: The $\ell_p$-norm objectives for correlation clustering present a fundamental
trade-off between minimizing total disagreements (the $\ell_1$-norm) and
ensuring fairness to individual nodes (the $\ell_\infty$-norm). Surprisingly,
in the offline setting it is possible to simultaneously approximate all
$\ell_p$-norms with a single clustering. Can this powerful guarantee be
achieved in an online setting? This paper provides the first affirmative
answer. We present a single algorithm for the online-with-a-sample (AOS) model
that, given a small constant fraction of the input as a sample, produces one
clustering that is simultaneously $O(\log^4 n)$-competitive for all
$\ell_p$-norms with high probability, $O(\log n)$-competitive for the
$\ell_\infty$-norm with high probability, and $O(1)$-competitive for the
$\ell_1$-norm in expectation. This work successfully translates the offline
"all-norms" guarantee to the online world.
  Our setting is motivated by a new hardness result that demonstrates a
fundamental separation between these objectives in the standard random-order
(RO) online model. Namely, while the $\ell_1$-norm is trivially
$O(1)$-approximable in the RO model, we prove that any algorithm in the RO
model for the fairness-promoting $\ell_\infty$-norm must have a competitive
ratio of at least $\Omega(n^{1/3})$. This highlights the necessity of a
different beyond-worst-case model. We complement our algorithm with lower
bounds, showing our competitive ratios for the $\ell_1$- and $\ell_\infty$-
norms are nearly tight in the AOS model.

*Yolanne Yi Ran Lee,Kyriakos Flouris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TempO: a latent flow-matching model for high-dimensional PDE forecasting using sparse conditioning and time-conditioned Fourier layers; provides a theoretical upper bound on FNO error; outperforms baselines on three PDE datasets with efficient, multi-scale dynamics recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecasting PDE-governed dynamics is challenging due to cumulative errors and discretisation artifacts in autoregressive and diffusion-based methods; a deterministic, efficient approach that preserves multi-scale dynamics is needed.

Method: Prove an upper bound on FNO approximation error; propose TempO, a latent flow-matching model leveraging sparse conditioning with channel folding to process 3D spatiotemporal fields; employs time-conditioned Fourier layers to capture multi-scale modes.

Result: TempO outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three benchmark PDE datasets; spectral analysis shows superior recovery of multi-scale dynamics; efficiency studies indicate fewer parameters and lower memory usage than attention-based or convolutional regressors.

Conclusion: TempO provides an efficient, accurate latent flow-matching solution for high-dimensional PDE forecasting, backed by theoretical guarantees and empirical results, particularly in preserving multi-scale dynamics with improved efficiency.

Abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional, PDE-governed dynamics remains a core challenge
for generative modeling. Existing autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches
often suffer cumulative errors and discretisation artifacts that limit long,
physically consistent forecasts. Flow matching offers a natural alternative,
enabling efficient, deterministic sampling. We prove an upper bound on FNO
approximation error and propose TempO, a latent flow matching model leveraging
sparse conditioning with channel folding to efficiently process 3D
spatiotemporal fields using time-conditioned Fourier layers to capture
multi-scale modes with high fidelity. TempO outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines across three benchmark PDE datasets, and spectral analysis further
demonstrates superior recovery of multi-scale dynamics, while efficiency
studies highlight its parameter- and memory-light design compared to
attention-based or convolutional regressors.

### [155] [DLER: Doing Length pEnalty Right - Incentivizing More Intelligence per Token via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15110)
*Shih-Yang Liu,Xin Dong,Ximing Lu,Shizhe Diao,Mingjie Liu,Min-Hung Chen,Hongxu Yin,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Kwang-Ting Cheng,Yejin Choi,Jan Kautz,Pavlo Molchanov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Doing Length pEnalty Right (DLER), a simple RL framework for optimizing reasoning with a truncation length penalty; uses batch reward normalization, higher clipping, dynamic sampling, and a basic length penalty to improve accuracy per token. Extends with Difficulty-Aware DLER and an update-selective merging method.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Make reasoning models more efficient by maximizing accuracy per token, addressing verbose outputs from extended chain-of-thought while retaining performance.

Method: RL training recipe augmented for length control: truncation-based penalty, batch-wise reward normalization, higher clipping, dynamic sampling. Key extensions include Difficulty-Aware DLER (tightens truncation on easier questions) and update-selective merging to retain concise reasoning with scarce RL data.

Result: DLER achieves state-of-the-art accuracy–efficiency trade-offs, reducing output length by >70% while surpassing prior baselines in accuracy. At test time, 7B DLER variants outperform larger baselines in accuracy with lower latency; Difficulty-Aware DLER yields further gains; update-selective merging preserves accuracy while retaining conciseness.

Conclusion: A practical, effective approach to concise yet accurate reasoning via RL with a simple length penalty, with extensions to adapt to task difficulty and data scarcity, offering improved efficiency for large language models.

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen achieve
strong performance via extended chains of thought but often generate
unnecessarily long outputs. Maximizing intelligence per token--accuracy
relative to response length--remains an open problem. We revisit reinforcement
learning (RL) with the simplest length penalty--truncation--and show that
accuracy degradation arises not from the lack of sophisticated penalties but
from inadequate RL optimization. We identify three key challenges: (i) large
bias in advantage estimation, (ii) entropy collapse, and (iii) sparse reward
signal. We address them with Doing Length pEnalty Right (DLER), a training
recipe combining batch-wise reward normalization, higher clipping, dynamic
sampling, and a simple truncation length penalty. DLER achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy--efficiency trade-offs, cutting output length by over
70 percent while surpassing all previous baseline accuracy. It also improves
test-time scaling: compared to DeepSeek-R1-7B, DLER-7B generates multiple
concise responses in parallel with 28 percent higher accuracy and lower
latency. We further introduce Difficulty-Aware DLER, which adaptively tightens
truncation on easier questions for additional efficiency gains. We also propose
an update-selective merging method that preserves baseline accuracy while
retaining the concise reasoning ability of the DLER model, which is useful for
scenarios where RL training data is scarce.

*David J. Albers,Tell D. Bennett,Jana de Wiljes,Bradford J. Smith,Peter D. Sottile,J. N. Stroh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A joint patient-ventilator-care (J6) framework uses evolutionary game theory to analyze breath behaviors and MV decisions, validated on synthetic data, as a step toward optimizing and personalizing mechanical ventilation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how heterogeneous patient-ventilator interactions and adjunct care decisions affect outcomes requires scalable analysis of secondary-use clinical data within the real-world clinical decision environment.

Method: Introduce the J6 perspective to analyze data and trajectories of patient-ventilator-care systems; apply evolutionary game theory to breath behaviors to generate quantitative precursors, and use probabilistic/stochastic methods (e.g., reinforcement learning); analytically validate the approach on synthetic data before applying to real ICU data; discuss potential state-transition models for MV decision effects.

Result: Demonstrates a scalable EGT-based analysis that yields quantitative precursors for deeper study; reveals caveats from synthetic-data validation; constitutes a step toward MV optimization and personalization and sets the stage for real-world ICU data applications.

Conclusion: The J6-EGT framework offers a tractable path to understand and optimize MV decisions within the clinical decision environment, while acknowledging data-generating process complexities; future work includes applying to real ICU data and developing state-transition models incorporating empirical and game-theoretic elements.

Abstract: Identifying the effects of mechanical ventilation strategies and protocols in
critical care requires analyzing data from heterogeneous patient-ventilator
systems within the context of the clinical decision-making environment. This
research develops a framework to help understand the consequences of mechanical
ventilation (MV) and adjunct care decisions on patient outcome from
observations of critical care patients receiving MV. Developing an
understanding of and improving critical care respiratory management requires
the analysis of existing secondary-use clinical data to generate hypotheses
about advantageous variations and adaptations of current care. This work
introduces a perspective of the joint patient-ventilator-care systems
(so-called J6) to develop a scalable method for analyzing data and trajectories
of these complex systems. To that end, breath behaviors are analyzed using
evolutionary game theory (EGT), which generates the necessary quantitative
precursors for deeper analysis through probabilistic and stochastic machinery
such as reinforcement learning. This result is one step along the pathway
toward MV optimization and personalization. The EGT-based process is
analytically validated on synthetic data to reveal potential caveats before
proceeding to real-world ICU data applications that expose complexities of the
data-generating process J6. The discussion includes potential developments
toward a state transition model for the simulating effects of MV decision using
empirical and game-theoretic elements.

### [157] [A Simple Method for PMF Estimation on Large Supports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15132)
*Alex Shtoff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Nonparametric PMF estimation on large discrete support via a low-pass signal-processing approach: build a PMF-informed path graph Laplacian, compute its smallest eigenvectors, project the empirical PMF onto that subspace to obtain a smooth, multi-modal estimate; fast, scalable, with data-driven dimension selection; robust but with some failure modes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimate a PMF on a large, discrete, multi-modal, and heavy-tailed support with minimal tuning and scalable computation, while preserving coarse structure and denoising sampling noise.

Method: Form a symmetric tri-diagonal operator by perturbing a path graph Laplacian with a diagonal matrix derived from the empirical PMF. Compute the eigenvectors corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues and project the empirical PMF onto this low-dimensional subspace to obtain a smooth estimate. Apply clipping and renormalization as a post-processing step. The eigen-decomposition is efficient for tridiagonal matrices, with complexity proportional to the support size times the desired subspace dimension. A data-driven rule based on an orthogonal-series risk estimate selects the dimension.

Result: The method yields smooth, multi-modal PMF estimates that preserve coarse structure while suppressing noise, performing favorably against logspline and Gaussian-KDE baselines in relevant regimes. It is fast, scalable, and robust across sample sizes, suitable for automated pipelines; it has known failure modes (e.g., abrupt discontinuities).

Conclusion: A simple, reliable, and scalable nonparametric PMF estimator for large discrete supports that leverages spectral properties of a PMF-informed graph operator; easy to implement and integrate into automated workflows, with caveats on certain discontinuous distributions.

Abstract: We study nonparametric estimation of a probability mass function (PMF) on a
large discrete support, where the PMF is multi-modal and heavy-tailed. The core
idea is to treat the empirical PMF as a signal on a line graph and apply a
data-dependent low-pass filter. Concretely, we form a symmetric tri-diagonal
operator, the path graph Laplacian perturbed with a diagonal matrix built from
the empirical PMF, then compute the eigenvectors, corresponding to the smallest
feq eigenvalues. Projecting the empirical PMF onto this low dimensional
subspace produces a smooth, multi-modal estimate that preserves coarse
structure while suppressing noise. A light post-processing step of clipping and
re-normalizing yields a valid PMF.
  Because we compute the eigenpairs of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix, the
computation is reliable and runs time and memory proportional to the support
times the dimension of the desired low-dimensional supspace. We also provide a
practical, data-driven rule for selecting the dimension based on an
orthogonal-series risk estimate, so the method "just works" with minimal
tuning. On synthetic and real heavy-tailed examples, the approach preserves
coarse structure while suppressing sampling noise, compares favorably to
logspline and Gaussian-KDE baselines in the intended regimes. However, it has
known failure modes (e.g., abrupt discontinuities). The method is short to
implement, robust across sample sizes, and suitable for automated pipelines and
exploratory analysis at scale because of its reliability and speed.

### [158] [Predicting the Unpredictable: Reproducible BiLSTM Forecasting of Incident Counts in the Global Terrorism Database (GTD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15136)
*Oluwasegun Adegoke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) outperforms baselines for short-horizon weekly terrorism-incident forecasting on GTD data, with strong results using 20–30 weeks of history; long-history generalizes best; short-horizon features drive most gains; study provides a reproducible, baseline-beating reference with code and ethics documentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to establish a transparent, reproducible baseline for short-horizon forecasting of terrorism incidents and to test whether a BiLSTM can outperform strong classical and deep learning baselines on globally-sourced, annually updated incident counts.

Method: A reproducible pipeline with fixed time-based splits is used to compare a Bidirectional LSTM against seasonal-naive, linear/ARIMA, and a deep LSTM-Attention baseline. The analysis includes ablations over temporal memory, training-history length, spatial granularity, lookback size, and feature groups. Evaluation is conducted on a held-out test set using RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. Data comes from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) 1970–2016. The authors release code, configurations, and compact result tables, along with a data/ethics statement.

Result: BiLSTM achieves RMSE 6.38 on the held-out test set, outperforming LSTM-Attention (9.19; ~30.6% better) and a linear lag-regression baseline (approximately 35.4% RMSE gain). Similar improvements are seen in MAE and MAPE. Ablations show long historical data yields better generalization; a moderate lookback of 20–30 weeks provides strong context; bidirectional encoding captures build-up and aftermath within the window. Short-horizon features (lagged counts, rolling statistics) contribute most to performance, with geographic and casualty features offering incremental gains.

Conclusion: The study delivers a transparent, baseline-beating reference for GTD-based incident forecasting, demonstrating that BiLSTM with moderate-length lookback and emphasis on short-horizon features can outperform traditional methods, and it provides reproducible code and ethics documentation to support research use.

Abstract: We study short-horizon forecasting of weekly terrorism incident counts using
the Global Terrorism Database (GTD, 1970--2016). We build a reproducible
pipeline with fixed time-based splits and evaluate a Bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) against strong classical anchors (seasonal-naive, linear/ARIMA) and a
deep LSTM-Attention baseline. On the held-out test set, the BiLSTM attains RMSE
6.38, outperforming LSTM-Attention (9.19; +30.6\%) and a linear lag-regression
baseline (+35.4\% RMSE gain), with parallel improvements in MAE and MAPE.
Ablations varying temporal memory, training-history length, spatial grain,
lookback size, and feature groups show that models trained on long historical
data generalize best; a moderate lookback (20--30 weeks) provides strong
context; and bidirectional encoding is critical for capturing both build-up and
aftermath patterns within the window. Feature-group analysis indicates that
short-horizon structure (lagged counts and rolling statistics) contributes
most, with geographic and casualty features adding incremental lift. We release
code, configs, and compact result tables, and provide a data/ethics statement
documenting GTD licensing and research-only use. Overall, the study offers a
transparent, baseline-beating reference for GTD incident forecasting.

*Xin Guo,Zijiu Lyu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Policy transfer for continuous-time RL via initializing learning in a target LQR with a policy from a related source task yields near-optimal performance while preserving the original algorithm’s convergence rate, and a new policy-learning algorithm achieves global linear and local super-linear convergence; a byproduct result shows diffusion-model stability via LQR connections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transfer learning can substantially improve RL data efficiency and learning speed. The authors study policy transfer in continuous-time RL, specifically entropy-regularized LQRs, addressing a gap where theory for continuous-time TL was lacking and extending prior discrete-time results.

Method: Provide a theoretical proof that a source-LQR optimal policy serves as a near-optimal initialization for closely related target-LQRs and preserves convergence rate. Propose a novel policy-learning algorithm for continuous-time LQRs with global linear and local super-linear convergence. Derive a byproduct linking continuous-time score-based diffusion model stability to LQR structure.

Result: First theoretical guarantees for policy transfer in continuous-time RL; initialization from a related source task is near-optimal and preserves convergence rate. New algorithm achieves global linear convergence and local super-linear convergence. As a byproduct, establish stability results for a class of continuous-time score-based diffusion models through their connection to LQRs.

Conclusion: The work provides theoretical and algorithmic foundations for policy transfer in continuous-time RL, filling a gap from discrete to continuous time, and reveals a link to diffusion-model stability that broadens the impact of the LQR framework.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal decision-making
strategies through interaction with an environment, yet training from scratch
on complex tasks can be highly inefficient. Transfer learning (TL), widely
successful in large language models (LLMs), offers a promising direction for
enhancing RL efficiency by leveraging pre-trained models.
  This paper investigates policy transfer, a TL approach that initializes
learning in a target RL task using a policy from a related source task, in the
context of continuous-time linear quadratic regulators (LQRs) with entropy
regularization. We provide the first theoretical proof of policy transfer for
continuous-time RL, proving that a policy optimal for one LQR serves as a
near-optimal initialization for closely related LQRs, while preserving the
original algorithm's convergence rate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel policy
learning algorithm for continuous-time LQRs that achieves global linear and
local super-linear convergence. Our results demonstrate both theoretical
guarantees and algorithmic benefits of transfer learning in continuous-time RL,
addressing a gap in existing literature and extending prior work from discrete
to continuous time settings.
  As a byproduct of our analysis, we derive the stability of a class of
continuous-time score-based diffusion models via their connection with LQRs.

### [160] [A simple mean field model of feature learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15174)
*Niclas Göring,Chris Mingard,Yoonsoo Nam,Ard Louis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A self-consistent mean-field theory for the Bayesian posterior of two-layer non-linear networks trained with SGLD reveals a finite-width symmetry-breaking transition to feature-aligned learning; plain MF underestimates gains, but incorporating a self-reinforcing input feature selection mechanism yields quantitative agreement with observed learning curves.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how feature learning emerges in neural nets and to develop a tractable theoretical framework (mean-field theory) that connects finite-width behavior under stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics to classical kernel methods, while explaining the role of noise and data in FL.

Method: Develop a self-consistent mean-field (MF) theory for the Bayesian posterior of two-layer non-linear networks trained with SGLD; analyze the infinite-width limit (reducing to kernel ridge regression) and the finite-width regime (revealing a symmetry-breaking transition toward feature-aligned learning); show that plain MF underestimates generalization gains and incorporate a self-reinforcing input feature selection mechanism to improve quantitative predictions.

Result: In the infinite-width limit, the theory reduces to kernel ridge regression. At finite width, a symmetry-breaking phase transition emerges, with networks abruptly aligning to target functions. The basic MF theory semi-quantitatively captures FL onset but underestimates post-transition generalization gains. Including self-reinforcing input feature selection aligns the theory with observed learning curves of SGLD-trained networks, providing quantitative predictions and mechanistic insight into FL.

Conclusion: Self-reinforcing input feature selection is a key mechanism driving feature learning in finite-width networks. Extending MF theory to include this mechanism yields quantitative agreement with empirical learning curves and deepens mechanistic understanding of feature learning under stochastic dynamics.

Abstract: Feature learning (FL), where neural networks adapt their internal
representations during training, remains poorly understood. Using methods from
statistical physics, we derive a tractable, self-consistent mean-field (MF)
theory for the Bayesian posterior of two-layer non-linear networks trained with
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD). At infinite width, this theory
reduces to kernel ridge regression, but at finite width it predicts a symmetry
breaking phase transition where networks abruptly align with target functions.
While the basic MF theory provides theoretical insight into the emergence of FL
in the finite-width regime, semi-quantitatively predicting the onset of FL with
noise or sample size, it substantially underestimates the improvements in
generalisation after the transition. We trace this discrepancy to a key
mechanism absent from the plain MF description: \textit{self-reinforcing input
feature selection}. Incorporating this mechanism into the MF theory allows us
to quantitatively match the learning curves of SGLD-trained networks and
provides mechanistic insight into FL.

*Conor Rowan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Geodesic problems are well-suited for the Deep Ritz method; the paper provides three numerical demonstrations in path planning, optics, and solid mechanics to illustrate feasibility and point to future SciML research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Geodesic problems feature simple geometry, variational structure, and nonlinearity, and are central to physics and engineering, yet underexplored by SciML methods.

Method: Apply the Deep Ritz method to geodesic problems and validate with three numerical experiments across domains (path planning, optics, solid mechanics).

Result: Demonstrates feasibility and promise of using the Deep Ritz method for geodesic problems; the work substantiates the claim with three numerical examples (details not specified) and frames a direction for future SciML research.

Conclusion: Deep Ritz method represents a promising avenue for solving geodesic problems; further SciML research should explore and extend this direction.

Abstract: Geodesic problems involve computing trajectories between prescribed initial
and final states to minimize a user-defined measure of distance, cost, or
energy. They arise throughout physics and engineering -- for instance, in
determining optimal paths through complex environments, modeling light
propagation in refractive media, and the study of spacetime trajectories in
control theory and general relativity. Despite their ubiquity, the scientific
machine learning (SciML) community has given relatively little attention to
investigating its methods in the context of these problems. In this work, we
argue that given their simple geometry, variational structure, and natural
nonlinearity, geodesic problems are particularly well-suited for the Deep Ritz
method. We substantiate this claim with three numerical examples drawn from
path planning, optics, and solid mechanics. Our goal is not to provide an
exhaustive study of geodesic problems, but rather to identify a promising
application of the Deep Ritz method and a fruitful direction for future SciML
research.

### [162] [An Advanced Two-Stage Model with High Sensitivity and Generalizability for Prediction of Hip Fracture Risk Using Multiple Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15179)
*Shuo Sun,Meiling Zhou,Chen Zhao,Joyce H. Keyak,Nancy E. Lane,Jeffrey D. Deng,Kuan-Jui Su,Hui Shen,Hong-Wen Deng,Kui Zhang,Weihua Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A sequential two-stage model improves hip fracture risk prediction by combining clinical/demographic/functional screening with DXA imaging refinement, outperforming DXA T-score and FRAX in sensitivity and reducing missed cases across multiple cohorts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DXA T-score and FRAX have limited sensitivity, especially for high-risk individuals without prior fractures or with osteopenia; there is a need for early, accurate, and cost-effective risk assessment.

Method: Stage 1: Screen using clinical, demographic, and functional variables to estimate baseline risk. Stage 2: Refine risk using DXA-derived imaging features. Validation included internal and external testing across MrOS, SOF, and UK Biobank cohorts to assess performance and adaptability across populations.

Result: The two-stage framework demonstrated higher sensitivity and fewer missed cases compared with standard tools, with consistent performance across cohorts and indications of cost-effectiveness and personalization.

Conclusion: A two-stage, clinically integrated framework can improve early hip fracture risk assessment beyond T-score and FRAX, enabling more accurate, personalized screening in diverse older populations.

Abstract: Hip fractures are a major cause of disability, mortality, and healthcare
burden in older adults, underscoring the need for early risk assessment.
However, commonly used tools such as the DXA T-score and FRAX often lack
sensitivity and miss individuals at high risk, particularly those without prior
fractures or with osteopenia. To address this limitation, we propose a
sequential two-stage model that integrates clinical and imaging information to
improve prediction accuracy. Using data from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men
Study (MrOS), the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the UK Biobank,
Stage 1 (Screening) employs clinical, demographic, and functional variables to
estimate baseline risk, while Stage 2 (Imaging) incorporates DXA-derived
features for refinement. The model was rigorously validated through internal
and external testing, showing consistent performance and adaptability across
cohorts. Compared to T-score and FRAX, the two-stage framework achieved higher

### [163] [Automotive Crash Dynamics Modeling Accelerated with Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15201)
*Mohammad Amin Nabian,Sudeep Chavare,Deepak Akhare,Rishikesh Ranade,Ram Cherukuri,Srinivas Tadepalli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Exploratory study showing ML-based surrogates (MeshGraphNet, Transolver) with time-conditioned, autoregressive, and rollout AR strategies can predict crash-deformation trends on BIW LS-DYNA data, achieving big speedups but not full FE accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crashworthiness design relies on expensive high-fidelity FE simulations. This work aims to demonstrate the feasibility and engineering utility of ML-based surrogates to predict structural crash dynamics, addressing a gap in applying ML to this domain.

Method: Compare two state-of-the-art neural nets (MeshGraphNet and Transolver) within NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo for modeling transient crash dynamics. Evaluate three strategies for temporal modeling: time-conditional, standard autoregressive, and stability-enhanced autoregressive with rollout training. Inputs are the undeformed mesh geometry and component characteristics; outputs are the spatiotemporal evolution of the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Dataset comprises 150 LS-DYNA FE simulations of a Body-in-White (BIW) assembly (~200 components, 38 with variable thickness).

Result: Models capture overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity but do not yet reach full FE accuracy. They achieve orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.

Conclusion: ML surrogates for structural crash dynamics are feasible and potentially valuable for accelerating design, with future work needed to close accuracy gaps, improve generalization, and incorporate uncertainty Quantification and physics guidance.

Abstract: Crashworthiness assessment is a critical aspect of automotive design,
traditionally relying on high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations that are
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an exploratory
comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for
efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the
NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine
learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in
demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling
approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural
network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and
Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient
dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a
stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training.
The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset
comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a
structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key
components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic
manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and
component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of
the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the
models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity,
demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash
dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve
orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design
exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.

### [164] [Dissecting Mahalanobis: How Feature Geometry and Normalization Shape OOD Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15202)
*Denis Janiak,Jakub Binkowski,Tomasz Kajdanowicz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Empirical study reveals Mahalanobis-based OOD methods are not universally reliable; identifies geometry-based predictors of OOD performance and introduces radially scaled L2 normalization to improve detection by controlling radial feature-space geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how representation geometry and normalization affect Mahalanobis-based OOD detection, addressing the gap between commonly used methods and their reliability across models and datasets.

Method: Comprehensive empirical study across diverse image foundation models, datasets, and distance normalization schemes; define an ideal data-geometry for representations; demonstrate that spectral and intrinsic-dimensionality metrics predict OOD performance; analyze normalization effects; propose radially scaled L2 normalization with a tunable parameter to control radial geometry and contract/expand representations.

Result: Mahalanobis-based OOD methods are not universally reliable; geometry metrics (spectral and intrinsic-dimensionality) predict OOD performance; normalization significantly affects OOD results; radially scaled L2 normalization improves OOD detection by adjusting the radial geometry of feature space.

Conclusion: Linking representation geometry, normalization, and OOD performance yields new design principles for reliable models; the radially scaled L2 approach offers a practical knob to enhance OOD detection without changing underlying models.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the reliable deployment
of deep learning models. hile Mahalanobis distance methods are widely used, the
impact of representation geometry and normalization on their performance is not
fully understood, which may limit their downstream application. To address this
gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study across diverse image
foundation models, datasets, and distance normalization schemes. First, our
analysis shows that Mahalanobis-based methods aren't universally reliable.
Second, we define the ideal geometry for data representations and demonstrate
that spectral and intrinsic-dimensionality metrics can accurately predict a
model's OOD performance. Finally, we analyze how normalization impacts OOD
performance. Building upon these studies, we propose radially scaled $\ell_2$
normalization, a method that generalizes the standard $\ell_2$ normalization
recently applied to Mahalanobis-based OOD detection. Our approach introduces a
tunable parameter to directly control the radial geometry of the feature space,
systematically contracting or expanding representations to significantly
improve OOD detection performance. By bridging the gap between representation
geometry, normalization, and OOD performance, our findings offer new insights
into the design of more effective and reliable deep learning models.

### [165] [ReasonIF: Large Reasoning Models Fail to Follow Instructions During Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15211)
*Yongchan Kwon,Shang Zhu,Federico Bianchi,Kaitlyn Zhou,James Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReasonIF shows LRMs struggle to follow reasoning instructions; the IFS is <0.25, and adherence declines with task difficulty; two strategies yield partial gains: multi-turn reasoning and Reasoning Instruction Finetuning (RIF). GPT-OSS-20B's IFS improves from 0.11 to 0.27, but room remains large.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure LRMs follow user instructions throughout the reasoning process to improve controllability, transparency, and safety by reducing shortcuts, hallucinations, or reward hacking within reasoning traces.

Method: Introduce ReasonIF benchmark with six instruction-prompt categories covering multilingual reasoning, formatting, and length control; evaluate several open-source LRMs (e.g., GPT-OSS, Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1); test two enhancement strategies: multi-turn reasoning and Reasoning Instruction Finetuning (RIF) using synthetic data.

Result: Across models, reasoning instruction fidelity is low (IFS < 0.25); task difficulty exacerbates degradation; RIF raises GPT-OSS-20B IFS from 0.11 to 0.27, indicating progress but substantial improvement is still needed.

Conclusion: Reasoning instruction following in LRMs is weak but improvable; ReasonIF reveals gaps and the proposed strategies yield incremental gains; further work should push higher fidelity of instruction adherence in reasoning traces and assess broader model families.

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow user instructions is
central to their reliability, safety, and usefulness. While prior studies
assess instruction adherence in the model's main responses, we argue that it is
also critical for large reasoning models (LRMs) to follow user instructions
throughout their reasoning process. Reasoning instruction following makes LRMs
more controllable and transparent, while reducing risks of undesirable
shortcuts, hallucinations, or reward hacking within reasoning traces. To
evaluate this dimension, we introduce ReasonIF, a systematic benchmark for
assessing reasoning instruction following. ReasonIF includes six categories of
instruction prompts, spanning multilingual reasoning, formatting and length
control. Across many open-source LRMs including GPT-OSS, Qwen3, and
DeepSeek-R1, we find substantial failures in reasoning instruction adherence:
the highest instruction following score (IFS) remains below 0.25, meaning that
fewer than $25\%$ of reasoning traces comply with the given instructions.
Notably, as task difficulty increases, reasoning instruction following degrades
further. We also explore two strategies to enhance reasoning instruction
fidelity. (1) multi-turn reasoning and (2) Reasoning Instruction Finetuning
(RIF) using synthetic data. RIF improves the IFS of $GPT-OSS-20B$ from 0.11 to
0.27, indicating measurable progress but leaving ample room for improvement.

### [166] [Towards Robust Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15382)
*Kexin Zheng,Lauriane Teyssier,Yinan Zheng,Yu Luo,Xiayuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BREEZE upgrades Forward-Backward representations for zero-shot RL by adding behavioral regularization, diffusion-based policy extraction, and expressive attention-based representations, yielding stable learning, multimodal action generation, and improved robustness on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot RL with pre-trained generalist policies using Forward-Backward representations can suffer from limited expressivity and extrapolation errors due to out-of-distribution actions in offline learning, leading to biased representations and suboptimal performance.

Method: Introduce BREEZE: (1) behavioral regularization to stabilize policy learning and enable in-sample optimization; (2) task-conditioned diffusion model to extract priors for high-quality, multimodal actions; (3) expressive attention-based architectures to model environmental dynamics and representations.

Result: Experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen show BREEZE achieves the best or near-best performance and superior robustness compared with prior offline zero-shot RL methods.

Conclusion: BREEZE effectively enhances stability, expressivity, and policy extraction for zero-shot RL, offering improved performance and robustness over existing FB-based methods; code is publicly available.

Abstract: The recent development of zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has opened a
new avenue for learning pre-trained generalist policies that can adapt to
arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. While the popular Forward-Backward
representations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we
empirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation
errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning
sometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal
performance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot
RL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that
simultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and
representation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in
zero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable
in-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a
task-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and
multimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE
employs expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to
capture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics. Extensive
experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen demonstrate that BREEZE achieves the best
or near-the-best performance while exhibiting superior robustness compared to
prior offline zero-shot RL methods. The official implementation is available
at: https://github.com/Whiterrrrr/BREEZE.

### [167] [Soundness-Aware Level: A Microscopic Signature that Predicts LLM Reasoning Potential](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15216)
*Xuansheng Wu,Xiaoman Pan,Wenlin Yao,Jianshu Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Soundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric predicting post-RLVR reasoning performance by capturing whether a model's internal beliefs distinguish sound vs. unsound knowledge. Shows high-potential models are soundness-aware; weaker models are not. SAL correlates with performance (R^2=0.87) across diverse models and scales, implying pre-training shapes reasoning and can guide model selection/design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address why RLVR performance varies across base models and identify an intrinsic, microscopic property of pre-trained models that governs reasoning ability.

Method: Formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses derived from cross-layer sparse autoencoder features. Estimate transitions between features, categorize each rule by semantic soundness using an LLM, and compute SAL via Jensen-Shannon Divergence as the separation between soundness-distribution peaks. Validate across model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek) and scales (0.5B-14B).

Result: Demonstrates a consistent empirical law: post-RLVR reasoning performance aligns with SAL predictions; high-potential models show distinct distributions for strict vs noisy rules, while weaker models collapse to a single distribution across soundness levels.

Conclusion: Pre-training shapes a model’s ability to distinguish sound knowledge from unsound knowledge; SAL offers a practical, internally grounded metric to select/design stronger base models and explains variability in RLVR-enhanced reasoning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong
reasoning in large language models (LLMs), while their performance after RLVR
varies dramatically across different base models. This raises a fundamental
question: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this
variation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses
("if-then" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via
cross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition
probabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its
semantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key
discovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their
internal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness
levels, becoming highly distinct for "strict" versus "noisy" rules. In
contrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution
regardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the
Soundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that
SAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical
law (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)
and scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied
to its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from
unsound ones. These findings underscore the critical role of model pre-training
in shaping reasoning and offer a practical metric grounded in the model's
internal mechanisms for selecting/designing stronger base models.

### [169] [Machine Learning for Early Detection of Meningitis: Stacked Ensemble Learning with EHR data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15218)
*Han Ouyang,Jesse Hamilton,Saeed Amal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Ensemble learning with RF, LightGBM, and DNN on a MIMIC-III meningitis cohort achieves high AUCs (~0.96 and ~0.95) using two-stage feature selection on clinically relevant features, suggesting potential AI-driven meningitis diagnosis in ER settings; deployment challenges remain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve rapid meningitis diagnosis in real-world emergency room settings by leveraging electronic health records and ensemble learning.

Method: Cohort of 214 meningitis patients and 46,303 non-meningitis patients from MIMIC-III. Data preprocessing included ICD-based cohort selection and one-hot encoding. A two-stage feature selection process was applied for both training and testing sets. Clinically relevant features included gender and high-risk ICD codes (subarachnoid hemorrhage, secondary malignant neoplasm of the brain, generalized epilepsy). Base models were Random Forest, LightGBM, and Deep Neural Networks; outputs were stacked with a Logistic Regression meta-model. Evaluation used two testing sets with AUC: 0.9637 and 0.9472.

Result: Two testing-set AUCs of 0.9637 and 0.9472 were achieved, indicating strong discriminatory performance of the ensemble model in this simulated ER scenario.

Conclusion: Ensemble learning on clinically relevant, temporally adherent features can yield high predictive performance for meningitis in ER-like conditions, illustrating feasibility and potential for AI-driven diagnostic support; further work is needed on deployment, calibration, and generalization.

Abstract: We utilized a cohort of 214 meningitis patients and 46,303 non-meningitis
patients from the MIMIC-III database. After extensive data preprocessing, which
included ICD-based cohort selection, one-hot encoding of coding, and a
two-stage feature selection process (for both the training set and the testing
sets), clinically relevant features such as gender and high-risk ICD codes
(including subarachnoid hemorrhage, secondary malignant neoplasm of the brain,
and generalized epilepsy) are selected. Overall, these clinically reasonable
and temporally adherent features provided excellent modeling performance. Three
models (Random Forest, LightGBM, and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are trained as
base models for Ensemble Learning. Base model outputs are aggregated and
stacked into a meta model (Logistic Regression) that uses the base model
outputs as input values in training. Ultimately, soldier outputs (AUC of
Testing Set 1: 0.9637, AUC of Testing Set 2: 0.9472) are obtained through
ensemble learning.
  We created a challenging condition for diagnosing meningitis, simulating a
real-world ER (Emergency Room) scenario to enhance clinical use in real-world
applications. While directly deploying a diagnostic tool that clinicians can
use is challenging, this paper paves the way for a potential future AI-driven
diagnostic approach for meningitis using Ensemble Learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Combining hierarchical product-coefficient descriptors with autoencoder features and a KNN classifier yields consistent improvements in 3D LiDAR point-cloud classification, with richer coefficient sets enhancing class separability and accuracy beyond PCA baselines and previous work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve 3D LiDAR point-cloud classification by integrating measure-theoretic descriptors (product coefficients) with learned representations, aiming to boost class separability and overall accuracy beyond existing feature baselines.

Method: Integrate product coefficients with an autoencoder representation and a KNN classifier; perform level-by-level ablations of product coefficients to assess impact; compare against PCA-based baselines and the authors' prior framework.

Result: Consistent performance gains over PCA-based baselines and the earlier framework; progressively richer product-coefficient sets improve class separability and overall accuracy.

Conclusion: Hierarchical product-coefficient features, when combined with autoencoders, further push LiDAR classification performance beyond previous approaches.

Abstract: This work extends our previous study on enhancing 3D LiDAR point-cloud
classification with product coefficients
\cite{medina2025integratingproductcoefficientsimproved}, measure-theoretic
descriptors that complement the original spatial Lidar features. Here, we show
that combining product coefficients with an autoencoder representation and a
KNN classifier delivers consistent performance gains over both PCA-based
baselines and our earlier framework. We also investigate the effect of adding
product coefficients level by level, revealing a clear trend: richer sets of
coefficients systematically improve class separability and overall accuracy.
The results highlight the value of combining hierarchical product-coefficient
features with autoencoders to push LiDAR classification performance further.

### [171] [Stress-Aware Learning under KL Drift via Trust-Decayed Mirror Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15222)
*Gabriel Nixon Raj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Entropy-regularized trust-decay for sequential decision-making under distribution drift: stress-aware tilting of beliefs and decisions, duality on the simplex, robust metrics, and near-optimal dynamic-regret with broad extensions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-stationary environments with distribution drift require robust, adaptive updates; existing methods lack a unified stress-aware framework.

Method: Apply exponential tilting to belief updates and mirror-descent decisions; establish Fenchel-dual equivalence on the simplex; define fragility, belief bandwidth, and Fragility Index; derive high-probability sensitivity bounds and dynamic regret with KL-drift path length; develop a parameter-free hedge and analyze penalties for over-tilting; extend to second-order updates, bandits, outliers, distributed settings, and KL-drift estimation.

Result: Dynamic regret bounded by ~√T; per-switch regret O(1) with trust-decay; stress-aware bounds; calibrated-stress bounds; extensions to multiple settings and plug-in drift estimation.

Conclusion: Unifies dynamic-regret analysis, distributionally robust objectives, and KL-regularized control through stress-adaptive updates in a single framework.

Abstract: We study sequential decision-making under distribution drift. We propose
entropy-regularized trust-decay, which injects stress-aware exponential tilting
into both belief updates and mirror-descent decisions. On the simplex, a
Fenchel-dual equivalence shows that belief tilt and decision tilt coincide. We
formalize robustness via fragility (worst-case excess risk in a KL ball),
belief bandwidth (radius sustaining a target excess), and a decision-space
Fragility Index (drift tolerated at $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret). We prove
high-probability sensitivity bounds and establish dynamic-regret guarantees of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ under KL-drift path length $S_T = \sum_{t\ge2}\sqrt{{\rm
KL}(D_t|D_{t-1})/2}$. In particular, trust-decay achieves $O(1)$ per-switch
regret, while stress-free updates incur $\Omega(1)$ tails. A parameter-free
hedge adapts the tilt to unknown drift, whereas persistent over-tilting yields
an $\Omega(\lambda^2 T)$ stationary penalty. We further obtain
calibrated-stress bounds and extensions to second-order updates, bandit
feedback, outliers, stress variation, distributed optimization, and plug-in
KL-drift estimation. The framework unifies dynamic-regret analysis,
distributionally robust objectives, and KL-regularized control within a single
stress-adaptive update.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FinTrust is a finance-specific benchmark to evaluate LLM trustworthiness, evaluating alignment across practical tasks. It suggests proprietary models excel in safety while some open-source models show strengths in fairness; fiduciary alignment and disclosure remain significant gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finance applications involve high risk and high stakes; LLMs need robust trustworthiness to prevent harmful, unlawful, or biased outcomes. The paper aims to create an evaluation platform to measure and compare LLM trustworthiness in the finance domain.

Method: Introduce FinTrust benchmark with context-rich, fine-grained evaluation tasks across multiple trust dimensions. Evaluate 11 LLMs (both proprietary and open-source). Analyze performance across dimensions such as safety, fairness, fiduciary alignment, and disclosure.

Result: Proprietary models (e.g., o4-mini) perform best on safety tasks; open-source DeepSeek-V3 shows strengths in industry-level fairness. All models underperform on fiduciary alignment and disclosure tasks, indicating gaps in legal awareness.

Conclusion: FinTrust is a valuable benchmark for assessing LLM trustworthiness in finance; it highlights specific strengths and weaknesses of current models and can guide future research and model development to address fiduciary and disclosure gaps.

Abstract: Recent LLMs have demonstrated promising ability in solving finance related
problems. However, applying LLMs in real-world finance application remains
challenging due to its high risk and high stakes property. This paper
introduces FinTrust, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
evaluating the trustworthiness of LLMs in finance applications. Our benchmark
focuses on a wide range of alignment issues based on practical context and
features fine-grained tasks for each dimension of trustworthiness evaluation.
We assess eleven LLMs on FinTrust and find that proprietary models like o4-mini
outperforms in most tasks such as safety while open-source models like
DeepSeek-V3 have advantage in specific areas like industry-level fairness. For
challenging task like fiduciary alignment and disclosure, all LLMs fall short,
showing a significant gap in legal awareness. We believe that FinTrust can be a
valuable benchmark for LLMs' trustworthiness evaluation in finance domain.

### [173] [Adaptive Individual Uncertainty under Out-Of-Distribution Shift with Expert-Routed Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15233)
*Amitesh Badkul,Lei Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel uncertainty quantification method (TESSERA) delivers per-sample, reliable, adaptive prediction intervals for protein-ligand affinity, combining MoE diversity with conformal calibration to achieve near-nominal coverage and strong coverage-width trade-offs under i.i.d. and scaffold-based OOD splits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reliable, informative, and dataset-shift-aware uncertainty quantification is essential for risk-sensitive domains like drug discovery, where heterogeneous assay noise, imbalanced chemical space, and distribution shift hamper existing UQ methods.

Method: TESSERA integrates Mixture of Expert diversity with split-conformal calibration and a scaled estimation mechanism to produce per-sample, adaptive prediction intervals that maintain coverage guarantees across data regimes, enabling efficient selective prediction.

Result: On protein-ligand binding affinity prediction (i.i.d. and scaffold-based OOD splits), TESSERA achieves near-nominal coverage and the best Coverage-Width Criterion (CWC) trade-off, competitive adaptive ability (low AUSE), and interval widths that grow when data are scarce or noisy but stay tight when predictions are reliable, as demonstrated by Size-Stratified Coverage (SSC).

Conclusion: By fusing MoE diversity with conformal calibration, TESSERA provides trustworthy, tight, and adaptive uncertainties suitable for selective decision-making in drug discovery and similar high-stakes applications.

Abstract: Reliable, informative, and individual uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains
missing in current ML community. This hinders the effective application of
AI/ML to risk-sensitive domains. Most methods either fail to provide coverage
on new data, inflate intervals so broadly that they are not actionable, or
assign uncertainties that do not track actual error, especially under a
distribution shift. In high-stakes drug discovery, protein-ligand affinity
(PLI) prediction is especially challenging as assay noise is heterogeneous,
chemical space is imbalanced and large, and practical evaluations routinely
involve distribution shift. In this work, we introduce a novel uncertainty
quantification method, Trustworthy Expert Split-conformal with Scaled
Estimation for Efficient Reliable Adaptive intervals (TESSERA), that provides
per-sample uncertainty with reliable coverage guarantee, informative and
adaptive prediction interval widths that track the absolute error. We evaluate
on protein-ligand binding affinity prediction under both independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) and scaffold-based out-of-distribution (OOD)
splits, comparing against strong UQ baselines. TESSERA attains near-nominal
coverage and the best coverage-width trade-off as measured by the
Coverage-Width Criterion (CWC), while maintaining competitive adaptivity
(lowest Area Under the Sparsification Error (AUSE)). Size-Stratified Coverage
(SSC) further confirms that intervals are right-sized, indicating width
increases when data are scarce or noisy, and remain tight when predictions are
reliable. By unifying Mixture of Expert (MoE) diversity with conformal
calibration, TESSERA delivers trustworthy, tight, and adaptive uncertainties
that are well-suited to selective prediction and downstream decision-making in
the drug-discovery pipeline and other applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DWRL introduces a dual-weighted RL objective that combines chain-of-thought reasoning with the Bradley–Terry model to learn human preferences for non-verifiable tasks, improving generative preference models across benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL has excelled at verifiable tasks but struggles with human-preference judgments on non-verifiable tasks; there is a need to incorporate inductive biases that favor coherent reasoning and robust preference modeling.

Method: Propose Dual-Weighted Reinforcement Learning (DWRL) that approximates the BT maximum-likelihood objective with two complementary weights: (1) an instance-wise misalignment weight emphasizing under-trained, poorly aligned pairs, and (2) a group-wise self-normalized conditional preference score that promotes promising thoughts. Train generative preference models to generate a thought first, then predict the human preference score.

Result: DWRL consistently outperforms both generative preference model baselines and scalar models across multiple benchmarks and model scales (e.g., Llama3 and Qwen2.5), while producing coherent, interpretable thoughts.

Conclusion: DWRL provides a general framework for reasoning-enhanced preference learning beyond verifiable tasks, integrating chain-of-thought reasoning with preference modeling via a dual-weighted objective.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently proven effective at scaling
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models on tasks with
verifiable answers. However, extending RL to more general non-verifiable tasks,
typically in the format of human preference pairs, remains both challenging and
underexplored. In this work, we propose Dual-Weighted Reinforcement Learning
(DWRL), a new framework for preference modeling that integrates CoT reasoning
with the Bradley-Terry (BT) model via a dual-weighted RL objective that
preserves preference-modeling inductive bias. DWRL approximates the
maximum-likelihood objective of the BT model with two complementary weights: an
instance-wise misalignment weight, which emphasizes under-trained pairs
misaligned with human preference, and a group-wise (self-normalized)
conditional preference score, which promotes promising thoughts. In this paper,
we apply DWRL to preference modeling by training generative preference models
(GPMs) to first generate a thought and then predict the human preference score.
Across multiple benchmarks and model scales (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), DWRL
consistently outperforms both GPM baselines and scalar models, while producing
coherent, interpretable thoughts. In summary, our results position DWRL as a
general framework for reasoning-enhanced preference learning beyond verifiable
tasks.

*Dingya Feng,Dingyuan Xue*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Transformer-based spatiotemporal model predicting endpoint disease risk for migratory birds using multi-source data; achieves high accuracy, AUC, and precision, indicating strong potential for early-warning surveillance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: Transformer architectures show promise for automated, anticipatory avian disease surveillance, enabling timely interventions and informing mitigation strategies. The approach demonstrates effective fusion of multi-source data and precise spatial encoding to forecast endpoint risk.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of avian disease outbreaks is critical for wildlife
conservation and public health. This study presents a Transformer-based
framework for predicting the disease risk at the terminal locations of
migratory bird trajectories. We integrate multi-source datasets, including GPS
tracking data from Movebank, outbreak records from the World Organisation for
Animal Health (WOAH), and geospatial context from GADM and Natural Earth. The
raw coordinates are processed using H3 hierarchical geospatial encoding to
capture spatial patterns. The model learns spatiotemporal dependencies from
bird movement sequences to estimate endpoint disease risk. Evaluation on a
held-out test set demonstrates strong predictive performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.9821, area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9803, average precision
(AP) of 0.9299, and an F1-score of 0.8836 at the optimal threshold. These
results highlight the potential of Transformer architectures to support
early-warning systems for avian disease surveillance, enabling timely
intervention and prevention strategies.

### [176] [DRO-InstructZero: Distributionally Robust Prompt Optimization for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15260)
*Yangyang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRO-InstructZero makes zero-shot prompt optimization robust to distribution shifts by using distributionally robust Bayesian optimization with an f-divergence ambiguity set, improving transferability of prompts while preserving in-distribution performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Prompt wording heavily influences LLM behavior; existing automatic prompt search methods optimize average performance on a single distribution and fail under distribution shift or adversarial evaluation, necessitating reliability under uncertainty.

Method: Formulates zero-shot prompt optimization as robust Bayesian optimization using an f-divergence ball around the evaluation distribution. A robust acquisition rule maximizes the worst-case expected utility, preserving query efficiency. Evaluations are conducted under matched budgets across formality rewriting, code debugging, and translation in the instruction-induction protocol.

Result: Significant gains under distribution shift: BIG-Bench informative-to-formal rewriting accuracy rises from 61.3±0.7% to ~85–90% (≈25–30 point absolute gain). Auto-debugging shows ≈+25-point gains under domain shift; stable tasks like cause-and-effect stay >96% in-distribution. Improvements are consistent across divergence choices and decoding temperatures.

Conclusion: DRO-InstructZero ties distributionally robust optimization to prompt learning, offering a plug-and-play, general approach for reliable and transferable prompt alignment under real-world uncertainty.

Abstract: Large language models are highly sensitive to prompt wording. However,
popular automatic prompt search methods, including InstructZero, often degrade
under distribution shift and adversarial evaluation because they optimize
expected performance under a single evaluation distribution. Consequently,
prompts that work in one setting frequently fail to transfer. To address this,
DRO-InstructZero formulates zero-shot prompt optimization as robust Bayesian
optimization. Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set
around the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes
worst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian
search. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution
shift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the
instruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality
rewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench
informative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 +/- 0.7% to
approximately 85-90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25-30 points.
Moreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift.
Meanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating
no loss on in-distribution cases. Furthermore, improvements are consistent
across divergence choices and decoding temperatures. Overall, DRO-InstructZero
connects distributionally robust optimization with prompt learning, offering a
plug-and-play and general approach for reliable, transferable prompt alignment
under real-world uncertainty.

### [177] [Robust Layerwise Scaling Rules by Proper Weight Decay Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15262)
*Zhiyuan Fan,Yifeng Liu,Qingyue Zhao,Angela Yuan,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a weight-decay scaling rule for AdamW to preserve sublayer gains across widths in scale-invariant networks, enabling zero-shot transfer of learning rate and weight decay under muP beyond initialization. Empirically links singular-value scaling to width and derives practical width-robust hyperparameters validated on LLaMA-style Transformers and synthetic tests; includes a simple diagnostic for sublayer-gain invariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern large-scale, width-diverse transformers exhibit optimizer-governed steady states where normalization layers create backward scale sensitivity. This makes the effective learning rate width-dependent and degrades maximal-update parameterization (muP) transfer across widths. There is a need for width-robust hyperparameter transfer that works beyond initialization.

Method: Empirical observation of singular-value spectra under width scaling; propose a weight-decay rule for AdamW that preserves sublayer gains. Derive: top singular value scales ~ sqrt(η/λ) with width d, and μP rule η2 ∝ d^{-1} for matrix-like parameters leads to λ2 ∝ sqrt(d). Combine with vector-like parameters at η1 = Θ_d(1) and λ1 = 0 to achieve zero-shot transfer of LR and weight decay across widths. Validate on LLaMA-style Transformers and in a synthetic setting; provide a diagnostic matching top singular values to verify sublayer-gain invariance.

Result: The proposed scaling rule enables near-width-invariant sublayer gains and zero-shot transfer of learning-rate and weight-decay across widths in AdamW trains for both matrix- and vector-like parameters. Experimental validation shows good agreement with predicted scaling and improved width-robust transfer; the authors also provide a simple diagnostic based on top singular values.

Conclusion: Weight-decay scaling for AdamW, aligned with muP, can extend width-robust hyperparameter transfer beyond initialization by controlling steady-state optimizer scales. This offers a practical recipe for width-robust transfer in large, scale-invariant transformers and supports the broader applicability of muP with AdamW.

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws prescribe how to allocate parameters, data, and
compute, while maximal-update parameterization ($\mu$P) enables learning-rate
transfer across widths by equalizing early-time update magnitudes. However, in
modern scale-invariant architectures, training quickly enters an
optimizer-governed steady state where normalization layers create backward
scale sensitivity and the effective learning rate becomes width dependent,
degrading $\mu$P transfer. We address this by introducing a weight-decay
scaling rule for AdamW that preserves sublayer gain across widths. Empirically,
the singular-value spectrum of each matrix parameter scales in norm as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}$ with an approximately invariant shape; under width
scaling $d$, we observe that the top singular value scales approximately as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}\cdot d^{0.75}$. Combining this observation with the $\mu$P
learning-rate rule $\eta_2\propto d^{-1}$ for matrix-like parameters implies an
empirical weight-decay scaling rule $\lambda_2\propto \sqrt{d}$ that
approximately keeps sublayer gains width invariant. Together with vector-like
parameters trained at $\eta_1=\Theta_d(1)$ and $\lambda_1=0$, this yields
\emph{zero-shot} transfer of both learning rate and weight decay from proxy to
target widths, removing per-width sweeps. We validate the rule on LLaMA-style
Transformers and in a minimal synthetic setting, and we provide a simple
diagnostic, matching top singular values, to check sublayer-gain invariance.
Our results extend $\mu$P beyond the near-init regime by explicitly controlling
steady-state scales set by the optimizer, offering a practical recipe for
width-robust hyperparameter transfer under AdamW.

### [178] [Causal Time Series Modeling of Supraglacial Lake Evolution in Greenland under Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15265)
*Emam Hossain,Muhammad Hasan Ferdous,Devon Dunmire,Aneesh Subramanian,Md Osman Gani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces RIC-TSC, a regionally-informed causal time-series classifier for Earth observation, using J-PCMCI+ to learn region-specific, lagged predictors and improve out-of-distribution accuracy by up to 12.6% over correlation baselines on Greenland lake evolution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal modeling is underutilized in spatiotemporal Earth observation; current analyses rely on correlational features that struggle to generalize across heterogeneous domains. A principled, interpretable framework that uncovers stable, causal drivers could enhance robustness and transferability of dynamic Earth surface models.

Method: Integrate multi-modal data (Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, CARRA meteorology) and apply Joint PCMCI+ (J-PCMCI+) to estimate regionally-specific and invariant causal predictors with time lags. Build global and per-basin causal graphs, then use the identified predictors and their lags to train lightweight classifiers. Evaluate on 1,000 manually labeled supraglacial lakes across two melt seasons (2018–2019).

Result: Causal models achieve up to 12.59% higher accuracy than correlation-based baselines under out-of-distribution evaluation, demonstrating improved generalization. Causal discovery serves both as feature selection and a means to impose mechanistic, interpretable structure on predictive models.

Conclusion: Causal discovery enables generalizable and mechanistically grounded modeling of dynamic Earth surface processes; regionally-informed, lag-aware causal inference can improve robustness to distribution shifts in spatiotemporal remote-sensing tasks.

Abstract: Causal modeling offers a principled foundation for uncovering stable,
invariant relationships in time-series data, thereby improving robustness and
generalization under distribution shifts. Yet its potential is underutilized in
spatiotemporal Earth observation, where models often depend on purely
correlational features that fail to transfer across heterogeneous domains. We
propose RIC-TSC, a regionally-informed causal time-series classification
framework that embeds lag-aware causal discovery directly into sequence
modeling, enabling both predictive accuracy and scientific interpretability.
Using multi-modal satellite and reanalysis data-including Sentinel-1 microwave
backscatter, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 optical reflectance, and CARRA
meteorological variables-we leverage Joint PCMCI+ (J-PCMCI+) to identify
region-specific and invariant predictors of supraglacial lake evolution in
Greenland. Causal graphs are estimated globally and per basin, with validated
predictors and their time lags supplied to lightweight classifiers. On a
balanced benchmark of 1000 manually labeled lakes from two contrasting melt
seasons (2018-2019), causal models achieve up to 12.59% higher accuracy than
correlation-based baselines under out-of-distribution evaluation. These results
show that causal discovery is not only a means of feature selection but also a
pathway to generalizable and mechanistically grounded models of dynamic Earth
surface processes.

### [179] [Semi-Supervised Regression with Heteroscedastic Pseudo-Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15266)
*Xueqing Sun,Renzhen Wang,Quanziang Wang,Yichen Wu,Xixi Jia,Deyu Meng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces an uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling framework for semi-supervised regression (SSR) that uses bi-level optimization to calibrate pseudo-label reliability under heteroscedastic noise, improving robustness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pseudo-labeling is well-studied in SSL but remains under-explored for SSR. SSR involves continuous outputs with heteroscedastic noise, making pseudo-label reliability hard to assess. Naive pseudo-labeling risks error accumulation and overfitting to incorrect labels.

Method: Proposes an uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling framework with bi-level optimization. The model jointly minimizes empirical risk over all data while optimizing uncertainty estimates to enhance generalization on labeled data, dynamically adjusting the influence of pseudo-labels based on estimated uncertainty.

Result: Provides theoretical insights and conducts extensive experiments on benchmark SSR datasets. The results show superior robustness and performance of the proposed method compared to existing SSR approaches.

Conclusion: The framework mitigates the impact of unreliable pseudo-labels in SSR by learning uncertainty estimates that govern pseudo-label influence, achieving improved performance; the authors provide code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Pseudo-labeling is a commonly used paradigm in semi-supervised learning, yet
its application to semi-supervised regression (SSR) remains relatively
under-explored. Unlike classification, where pseudo-labels are discrete and
confidence-based filtering is effective, SSR involves continuous outputs with
heteroscedastic noise, making it challenging to assess pseudo-label
reliability. As a result, naive pseudo-labeling can lead to error accumulation
and overfitting to incorrect labels. To address this, we propose an
uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling framework that dynamically adjusts
pseudo-label influence from a bi-level optimization perspective. By jointly
minimizing empirical risk over all data and optimizing uncertainty estimates to
enhance generalization on labeled data, our method effectively mitigates the
impact of unreliable pseudo-labels. We provide theoretical insights and
extensive experiments to validate our approach across various benchmark SSR
datasets, and the results demonstrate superior robustness and performance
compared to existing methods. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Foundation models are argued to catalyze a shift to a new scientific paradigm, from integrated workflows to autonomous discovery, via a three-stage framework, with a survey of applications and discussion of risks and future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond using foundation models as mere tools and examine whether they redefine scientific practice; to articulate a framework for analyzing FM-driven change and guide responsible progress.

Method: Conceptual framing and literature synthesis; propose a three-stage model (Meta-Scientific Integration, Hybrid Human-AI Co-Creation, Autonomous Scientific Discovery); review current capabilities and applications across scientific domains; discuss risks and future directions; provide a public repository.

Result: A three-stage framework describing the evolution of FM-enabled science: (1) Meta-Scientific Integration, (2) Hybrid Human-AI Co-Creation, (3) Autonomous Scientific Discovery; mapping of capabilities and applications, identification of risks, and directions for future research, with an accompanying repository.

Conclusion: Foundation models have the potential to redefine scientific discovery; the work offers a lens to study FM-enabled science, highlights opportunities, and calls for reflection on governance, collaboration, and future research directions.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), such as GPT-4 and AlphaFold, are reshaping the
landscape of scientific research. Beyond accelerating tasks such as hypothesis
generation, experimental design, and result interpretation, they prompt a more
fundamental question: Are FMs merely enhancing existing scientific
methodologies, or are they redefining the way science is conducted? In this
paper, we argue that FMs are catalyzing a transition toward a new scientific
paradigm. We introduce a three-stage framework to describe this evolution: (1)
Meta-Scientific Integration, where FMs enhance workflows within traditional
paradigms; (2) Hybrid Human-AI Co-Creation, where FMs become active
collaborators in problem formulation, reasoning, and discovery; and (3)
Autonomous Scientific Discovery, where FMs operate as independent agents
capable of generating new scientific knowledge with minimal human intervention.
Through this lens, we review current applications and emerging capabilities of
FMs across existing scientific paradigms. We further identify risks and future
directions for FM-enabled scientific discovery. This position paper aims to
support the scientific community in understanding the transformative role of
FMs and to foster reflection on the future of scientific discovery. Our project

*Zhilin Li,Zhou Yao,Xianglong Li,Zeng Liu,Zhaokuan Lu,Shanlin Xu,Seungnam Kim,Guangyao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid EnKF-FCNN improves data assimilation accuracy with a small ensemble by learning correction terms via a fully connected neural network, achieving higher accuracy than EnKF alone at similar cost, demonstrated on Lorenz systems and nonlinear ocean wave fields; adaptable to other models and DA techniques.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the trade-off between analysis accuracy and computational efficiency in ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation by leveraging machine learning to compensate for the suboptimal analyses produced by small ensembles.

Method: 1) Run EnKF with a relatively small ensemble to produce preliminary analyses. 2) Train/use a fully connected neural network to learn and predict correction terms for these states and apply the corrections to mitigate ensemble-size degradation. 3) Evaluate on Lorenz systems and nonlinear ocean wave field simulations, comparing to standard EnKF with the same ensemble size and reporting negligible extra computational cost. 4) Highlight adaptability to other models and ensemble-based DA methods.

Result: The EnKF-FCNN method achieves higher accuracy than traditional EnKF using the same small ensemble, with negligible additional computational cost. This performance advantage is demonstrated across Lorenz-system experiments and nonlinear ocean wave field simulations, indicating robustness and generality. The approach is also adaptable to diverse applications by coupling with different models and alternative ensemble-based DA methods.

Conclusion: EnKF-FCNN offers a practical, scalable framework that combines traditional ensemble Kalman filtering with machine learning to compensate for limited ensemble sizes, yielding enhanced accuracy without substantial runtime overhead and broad applicability to various models and DA schemes.

Abstract: Ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) methods have become increasingly
popular due to their inherent ability to address nonlinear dynamic problems.
However, these methods often face a trade-off between analysis accuracy and
computational efficiency, as larger ensemble sizes required for higher accuracy
also lead to greater computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel
machine learning-based data assimilation approach that combines the traditional
ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) with a fully connected neural network (FCNN).
Specifically, our method uses a relatively small ensemble size to generate
preliminary yet suboptimal analysis states via EnKF. A FCNN is then employed to
learn and predict correction terms for these states, thereby mitigating the
performance degradation induced by the limited ensemble size. We evaluate the
performance of our proposed EnKF-FCNN method through numerical experiments
involving Lorenz systems and nonlinear ocean wave field simulations. The
results consistently demonstrate that the new method achieves higher accuracy
than traditional EnKF with the same ensemble size, while incurring negligible
additional computational cost. Moreover, the EnKF-FCNN method is adaptable to
diverse applications through coupling with different models and the use of
alternative ensemble-based DA methods.

Result: The model reproduces the phase diagram and assigns phase labels to configurations, demonstrating that deep architectures can extract hierarchical structures from raw numerical data in simulations.

Conclusion: Hybrid deep architectures can effectively identify phase transitions and classify complex percolation patterns in (1+1)D replication processes from unlabeled raw data, highlighting the potential of end-to-end learning in statistical physics experiments.

Abstract: In this paper we present a neural network-based method for the automatic
detection of phase transitions and classification of hidden percolation
patterns in a (1+1)-dimensional replication process. The proposed network model
is based on the combination of CNN, TCN and GRU networks, which are trained
directly on raw configurations without any manual feature extraction. The

*Jonas Kirch,Sebastian Becker,Tiago Koketsu Rodrigues,Stefan Harmeling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DFCA is a fully decentralized clustered federated learning method that uses a sequential running average to fuse neighbor models, achieving clustering performance close to centralized IFCA and outperforming other decentralized baselines, even with sparse connectivity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the central server bottleneck and single point of failure in existing clustered FL methods like IFCA, by enabling fully decentralized coordination suitable for realistic, dynamic networks with data heterogeneity across clients.

Method: Each client maintains cluster-specific models and exchanges models with neighboring clients. Updates are incorporated via a sequential running average as they arrive, providing a communication-efficient aggregation without a central coordinator while preserving clustering capabilities.

Result: Experiments on multiple datasets show DFCA outperforms other decentralized algorithms and achieves performance comparable to centralized IFCA, even under sparse connectivity, demonstrating robustness and practicality for decentralized networks.

Conclusion: DFCA offers a practical, server-free solution for clustered FL that retains clustering quality and resilience to sparse connectivity, reducing bottlenecks and single-point risks inherent in server-based approaches.

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning has emerged as an effective approach for
handling heterogeneous data across clients by partitioning them into clusters
with similar or identical data distributions. However, most existing methods,
including the Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA), rely on a
central server to coordinate model updates, which creates a bottleneck and a
single point of failure, limiting their applicability in more realistic
decentralized learning settings. In this work, we introduce DFCA, a fully
decentralized clustered FL algorithm that enables clients to collaboratively
train cluster-specific models without central coordination. DFCA uses a
sequential running average to aggregate models from neighbors as updates
arrive, providing a communication-efficient alternative to batch aggregation
while maintaining clustering performance. Our experiments on various datasets
demonstrate that DFCA outperforms other decentralized algorithms and performs
comparably to centralized IFCA, even under sparse connectivity, highlighting
its robustness and practicality for dynamic real-world decentralized networks.

### [184] [On the Generalization Properties of Learning the Random Feature Models with Learnable Activation Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15327)
*Zailin Ma,Jiansheng Yang,Yaodong Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Data-dependent sampling for Random Feature models with Learnable Activation Functions (RFLAF) yields sharp bounds on the required number of features s; leverage-weighted sampling dramatically reduces s compared to plain sampling for regression (MSE) and classification (Lipschitz loss), with finite-rank Gram matrix allowing constant s; an algorithm to learn an approximate kernel enables practical weighted sampling; empirical results confirm similar performance with far fewer features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce computational cost and improve generalization of RFLAF by using data-dependent sampling to minimize the number of random features needed while maintaining accuracy.

Method: Develop a unified theorem that bounds the feature count s under plain and leverage-weighted data-dependent sampling. Analyze both MSE and Lipschitz losses. Propose an algorithm to learn an approximate kernel and then apply leverage-weighted sampling. Provide theoretical bounds and empirical validation on regression and classification tasks.

Result: Bounds on s: for MSE loss, weighted sampling improves from Omega(1/epsilon^2) to tilde Omega((1/epsilon)^{1/t}) for general t>=1, and to Omega(1) when the Gram matrix has finite rank. For Lipschitz loss, the bound improves from Omega(1/epsilon^2) to tilde Omega((1/epsilon^2)^{1/t}). Empirical results show weighted RFLAF achieves similar performance with substantially fewer features than plain RFLAF.

Conclusion: Data-dependent leverage-weighted sampling is effective in reducing the required number of random features for RFLAF without sacrificing performance, supported by both theory and experiments. The proposed kernel-approximation algorithm enables practical application of weighted sampling.

Abstract: This paper studies the generalization properties of a recently proposed
kernel method, the Random Feature models with Learnable Activation Functions
(RFLAF). By applying a data-dependent sampling scheme for generating features,
we provide by far the sharpest bounds on the required number of features for
learning RFLAF in both the regression and classification tasks. We provide a
unified theorem that describes the complexity of the feature number $s$, and
discuss the results for the plain sampling scheme and the data-dependent
leverage weighted scheme. Through weighted sampling, the bound on $s$ in the
MSE loss case is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon)^{1/t})$ in general $(t\geq 1)$, and even to
$\Omega(1)$ when the Gram matrix has a finite rank. For the Lipschitz loss
case, the bound is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon^2)^{1/t})$. To learn the weighted RFLAF, we also
propose an algorithm to find an approximate kernel and then apply the leverage
weighted sampling. Empirical results show that the weighted RFLAF achieves the
same performances with a significantly fewer number of features compared to the
plainly sampled RFLAF, validating our theories and the effectiveness of this
method.

*Yuyuan Feng,Bin Ma,Enyan Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified Mixture-of-Experts defense for graph neural networks that protects against backdoor, edge manipulation, and node injection by encouraging expert specialization via MI-based logic diversity loss and a robustness-aware router; shows strong robustness across multiple graph adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current defenses against graph adversarial attacks are typically designed for a single threat type. A unified, scalable defense is needed to simultaneously mitigate multiple attacks without sacrificing performance.

Method: Utilizes a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. Introduces an MI-based logic diversity loss to push experts to specialize on distinct neighborhood structures. Develops a robustness-aware router that detects perturbation patterns and adaptively routes perturbed nodes to robust experts. Trains under scenarios including backdoor, edge manipulation, and node injection attacks to build broad robustness.

Result: Experimental results across diverse adversarial settings show superior robustness against multiple graph adversarial attacks, outperforming baselines by maintaining performance under perturbations and enabling reliable predictions.

Conclusion: A scalable, unified defense against multiple graph adversarial threats is achievable via an MoE-based architecture with logic-diversity regularization and perturbation-aware routing, highlighting the value of expert specialization for graph security and suggesting avenues for broader threat-model applicability.

Abstract: Extensive research has highlighted the vulnerability of graph neural networks
(GNNs) to adversarial attacks, including manipulation, node injection, and the
recently emerging threat of backdoor attacks. However, existing defenses
typically focus on a single type of attack, lacking a unified approach to
simultaneously defend against multiple threats. In this work, we leverage the
flexibility of the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to design a scalable
and unified framework for defending against backdoor, edge manipulation, and
node injection attacks. Specifically, we propose an MI-based logic diversity
loss to encourage individual experts to focus on distinct neighborhood
structures in their decision processes, thus ensuring a sufficient subset of
experts remains unaffected under perturbations in local structures. Moreover,
we introduce a robustness-aware router that identifies perturbation patterns
and adaptively routes perturbed nodes to corresponding robust experts.
Extensive experiments conducted under various adversarial settings demonstrate
that our method consistently achieves superior robustness against multiple
graph adversarial attacks.

*Jinwoo Kim,Max Beier,Petar Bevanda,Nayun Kim,Seunghoon Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An operator-theoretic approach to sequence modeling using mean embeddings and MMD gradient flows, with a scalable spectral mean-flow framework combining spectral NLP-like tensor decompositions of sequence embeddings and time-dependent Hilbert spaces to enable fast, sampling-efficient learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional stochastic recurrence models struggle with highly nonlinear, probabilistic sequence dynamics. Embedding distributions in Hilbert spaces and using operator-theoretic methods offers a principled, potentially more expressive representation and a path to scalable learning.

Method: Embed the full sequence distribution as a tensor in a product Hilbert space; define the generative process as an MMD gradient flow in sequence space. Introduce spectral mean flows: (1) a neural architecture leveraging spectral decomposition of linear operators to obtain a scalable tensor-network decomposition of sequence mean embeddings, and (2) extend MMD gradient flows to time-dependent Hilbert spaces and relate it to flow matching via the continuity equation to achieve simulation-free learning and faster sampling.

Result: Demonstrates competitive performance on various time-series datasets and proposes scalable, faster sampling workflows; code released for reproducibility.

Conclusion: The paper presents a coherent operator-theoretic framework for sequence modeling with practical scalability and empirical validity, offering a novel combination of spectral tensor methods and MMD-based flow learning that could inspire further work on distributional sequence representations.

Abstract: A key question in sequence modeling with neural networks is how to represent
and learn highly nonlinear and probabilistic state dynamics. Operator theory
views such dynamics as linear maps on Hilbert spaces containing mean embedding
vectors of distributions, offering an appealing but currently overlooked
perspective. We propose a new approach to sequence modeling based on an
operator-theoretic view of a hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead of
materializing stochastic recurrence, we embed the full sequence distribution as
a tensor in the product Hilbert space. A generative process is then defined as
maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) gradient flow in the space of sequences. To
overcome challenges with large tensors and slow sampling convergence, we
introduce spectral mean flows, a novel tractable algorithm integrating two core
concepts. First, we propose a new neural architecture by leveraging spectral
decomposition of linear operators to derive a scalable tensor network
decomposition of sequence mean embeddings. Second, we extend MMD gradient flows
to time-dependent Hilbert spaces and connect them to flow matching via the

*Mingyang Sun,Pengxiang Ding,Weinan Zhang,Donglin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SWFP discretizes flow matching into fixed-step Euler updates, aligning with the JKO principle, enabling a cascade of small flow blocks for stable online fine-tuning of pre-trained flow policies with entropic regularization and Wasserstein trust regions, yielding better stability and adaptation in robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Behavior cloning with flow/diffusion policies suffers from distributional shift; conventional RL struggles to fine-tune due to iterative inference and limited workarounds. A principled, efficient fine-tuning framework is needed that guarantees stability.

Method: Proposes Stepwise Flow Policy (SWFP) by discretizing the flow matching inference into fixed-step Euler updates. Decomposes global flow into incremental steps; each step implements a JKO update with entropic regularization, maintaining proximity to the previous iterate. Uses a cascade of small flow blocks and Wasserstein trust-region-style regularization for stability.

Result: Empirical results show improved stability, efficiency, and adaptation across diverse robotic control benchmarks; simpler/faster sub-model training; reduced compute/memory costs; provable stability.

Conclusion: SWFP offers a principled, scalable approach for online fine-tuning of pre-trained flow policies with provable stability via Wasserstein-based trust regions, delivering enhanced adaptation in robotic control tasks.

Abstract: While behavior cloning with flow/diffusion policies excels at learning
complex skills from demonstrations, it remains vulnerable to distributional
shift, and standard RL methods struggle to fine-tune these models due to their
iterative inference process and the limitations of existing workarounds. In
this work, we introduce the Stepwise Flow Policy (SWFP) framework, founded on
the key insight that discretizing the flow matching inference process via a
fixed-step Euler scheme inherently aligns it with the variational
Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) principle from optimal transport. SWFP
decomposes the global flow into a sequence of small, incremental
transformations between proximate distributions. Each step corresponds to a JKO
update, regularizing policy changes to stay near the previous iterate and
ensuring stable online adaptation with entropic regularization. This
decomposition yields an efficient algorithm that fine-tunes pre-trained flows
via a cascade of small flow blocks, offering significant advantages:
simpler/faster training of sub-models, reduced computational/memory costs, and
provable stability grounded in Wasserstein trust regions. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate SWFP's enhanced stability, efficiency, and superior
adaptation performance across diverse robotic control benchmarks.

*Anyi Li,Jiacheng Cen,Songyou Li,Mingze Li,Yang Yu,Wenbing Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GeoMix introduces a geometry-aware, set-SE(3) equivariant framework with a Geometric Interaction Network (GIN) for predicting ionic conductivity in electrolyte mixtures. By augmenting CALiSol and DiffMix with geometric graphs and cross-molecular interactions, it achieves state-of-the-art performance and establishes new benchmarks for mixture systems in energy materials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses two core gaps: (1) the absence of high-quality standardized benchmarks for electrolyte property prediction, and (2) insufficient modeling of geometric structure and intermolecular interactions in mixture systems. The work reorganizes existing datasets with geometric graph representations and enforces Set-SE(3) equivariance to capture symmetry in molecular mixtures.

Method: Proposes GeoMix, a geometry-aware framework that preserves Set-SE(3) equivariance. Central to GeoMix is the Geometric Interaction Network (GIN), an equivariant module designed for intermolecular geometric message passing. The approach represents molecules as geometric graphs and enables cross-molecular interactions to be communicated via equivariant message passing, evaluated on reorganized CALiSol and DiffMix datasets against baselines (MLP, standard GNNs, geometric GNNs).

Result: GeoMix consistently outperforms diverse baselines on both datasets, highlighting the importance of cross-molecular geometric interactions and equivariant message passing for accurate conductivity prediction. The work also provides improved benchmarks and demonstrates the value of geometry-aware learning for mixture systems.

Conclusion: The study establishes new benchmarks for electrolyte research and offers a general geometric learning framework that can advance modeling of mixture systems in energy materials, pharmaceutical development, and related fields.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of ionic conductivity in electrolyte systems is crucial
for advancing numerous scientific and technological applications. While
significant progress has been made, current research faces two fundamental
challenges: (1) the lack of high-quality standardized benchmarks, and (2)
inadequate modeling of geometric structure and intermolecular interactions in
mixture systems. To address these limitations, we first reorganize and enhance
the CALiSol and DiffMix electrolyte datasets by incorporating geometric graph
representations of molecules. We then propose GeoMix, a novel geometry-aware
framework that preserves Set-SE(3) equivariance-an essential but challenging
property for mixture systems. At the heart of GeoMix lies the Geometric
Interaction Network (GIN), an equivariant module specifically designed for
intermolecular geometric message passing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that GeoMix consistently outperforms diverse baselines (including MLPs, GNNs,
and geometric GNNs) across both datasets, validating the importance of
cross-molecular geometric interactions and equivariant message passing for
accurate property prediction. This work not only establishes new benchmarks for
electrolyte research but also provides a general geometric learning framework
that advances modeling of mixture systems in energy materials, pharmaceutical
development, and beyond.

*Christopher Salazar,Krithika Manohar,Ashis G. Banerjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WORK-DMD combines Random Fourier Features with online DMD in a windowed, online fashion using Sherman-Morrison updates to achieve real-time nonlinear forecasting with fixed cost and sample efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses non-stationary streaming data under tight compute, requiring accurate, adaptable, data-efficient forecasting without catastrophic forgetting.

Method: Windowed Online Random Kernel DMD: explicit nonlinear feature mapping via Random Fourier Features; online DMD with Sherman-Morrison updates within rolling windows; single-pass, minimal storage.

Result: Outperforms several state-of-the-art online forecasting methods in accuracy; fixed computational cost; strong short-term forecasting; single-pass data efficiency; demonstrates practicality over deep learning in streaming settings.

Conclusion: Combining kernel evaluations with adaptive matrix updates yields strong predictive performance with minimal data, offering a practical alternative to deep learning for streaming forecasting.

Abstract: Real-time forecasting from streaming data poses critical challenges: handling
non-stationary dynamics, operating under strict computational limits, and
adapting rapidly without catastrophic forgetting. However, many existing
approaches face trade-offs between accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency,
particularly when deployed in constrained computing environments. We introduce
WORK-DMD (Windowed Online Random Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition), a method
that combines Random Fourier Features with online Dynamic Mode Decomposition to
capture nonlinear dynamics through explicit feature mapping, while preserving
fixed computational cost and competitive predictive accuracy across evolving
data. WORK-DMD employs Sherman-Morrison updates within rolling windows,
enabling continuous adaptation to evolving dynamics from only current data,
eliminating the need for lengthy training or large storage requirements for
historical data. Experiments on benchmark datasets across several domains show
that WORK-DMD achieves higher accuracy than several state-of-the-art online
forecasting methods, while requiring only a single pass through the data and
demonstrating particularly strong performance in short-term forecasting. Our
results show that combining kernel evaluations with adaptive matrix updates
achieves strong predictive performance with minimal data requirements. This
sample efficiency offers a practical alternative to deep learning for streaming
forecasting applications.

### [190] [ParaFormer: Shallow Parallel Transformers with Progressive Approximation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15425)
*Wei Wang,Xiao-Yong Wei,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ParaFormer is a shallow, parallel-branch Transformer that replaces depth with algorithmic inter-layer collaboration, achieving competitive performance with faster training/inference, significant compression, and scalable learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The conventional belief that deeper models yield better performance (the 'depth belief') leads to long training times, high latency, and impracticality on resource-constrained devices. The work challenges this by proposing that inter-layer collaboration can be achieved without sequential depth, enabling true parallelism.

Method: Reformulate Transformers as closed-form function approximators and design ParaFormer with parallel branches that enforce inter-layer collaboration. Use progressive approximation so each new branch further reduces loss from previous branches. Demonstrates compression (up to 15.07x) and expansion for adaptive learning. Validates on multi-GPU setups and compares to ViT and FairScale; provides open-source code.

Result: ParaFormer outperforms standard Transformers such as ViT, achieves up to 3.30x speedup over FairScale on multi-GPU deployments, and enables substantial model compression and extension for continuous learning.

Conclusion: Depth is not essential for strong Transformer performance; structured parallelism and progressive, closed-form collaboration can achieve similar or better results more efficiently. This opens new directions for designing resource-efficient Transformer architectures and provides theoretical grounding via a universal-approximation-based formulation.

Abstract: The widespread 'deeper is better' philosophy has driven the creation of
architectures like ResNet and Transformer, which achieve high performance by
stacking numerous layers. However, increasing model depth comes with challenges
such as longer training times, higher inference latency, and impracticality on
resource-constrained devices. To address these issues, we propose ParaFormer, a
shallow Transformer architecture designed for true parallelism in both
structure and computation. By formulating standard Transformers as function
approximators in closed-form, our theoretical analysis shows that their
performance relies on inter-layer collaboration for progressive approximation,
rather than depth itself. While deep Transformers enforce this collaboration
through sequential designs, we demonstrate that such collaboration is not
inherently tied to sequential structures. ParaFormer removes the sequential
constraint by organizing layers into parallel branches, enforcing inter-layer
collaboration algorithmically. Specifically, we implement progressive
approximation, ensuring that each new branch further reduces the loss from
preceding branches, enabling faster convergence. Extensive experiments validate
ParaFormer's effectiveness, outperforming standard Transformers like ViT.
Moreover, ParaFormer supports up to 15.07x model compression and facilitates
model expansion for adaptive continuous learning. Experimental results on
multi-GPU deployment demonstrate that ParaFormer is 3.30x faster than widely
used parallelism solutions such as FairScale. These advancements stem from our
closed-form formulation of Transformers based on the Universal Approximation
Theorem, which not only explains the ``depth belief'' but also opens new
avenues for designing efficient Transformer architectures. Source code:

### [191] [Safe, Efficient, and Robust Reinforcement Learning for Ranking and Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15429)
*Shashank Gupta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dissertation advancing safe, sample-efficient, robust RL across ranking/recommendation and text-to-image diffusion, featuring exposure-based bounds with doubly robust estimators, a baseline-corrected off-policy framework, and LOOP for efficient generative RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The need for safe, reliable, and data-efficient RL in real-world systems (ranking/recommendation, generative models) amid sparse feedback, model misspecification, and high-stakes deployment.

Method: 1) Derive an exposure-based generalisation bound and a counterfactual risk-minimisation objective; extend with doubly robust estimators for adversarial/misspecified user models. 2) Unify off-policy estimators under a baseline-correction framework and derive a closed-form optimal baseline to minimize evaluation and policy-gradient variance. 3) Compare PPO and REINFORCE, then propose Leave-One-Out PPO (LOOP) by combining multiple diffusion trajectories with a REINFORCE-style baseline inside PPO's clipped objective.

Result: The exposure-based bound guarantees that the policy will not underperform the logging policy under sparse feedback; the doubly robust extension offers safety under adversarial or misspecified user models; the optimal baseline reduces variance in off-policy evaluation and learning; LOOP matches PPO-level sample efficiency and yields generations more faithful to textual attributes in diffusion-based generation.

Conclusion: The work delivers theoretical guarantees and practical algorithms for safe, efficient RL across domains, with LOOP providing a promising path to high sample-efficiency and controllable alignment in generative RL.

Abstract: This dissertation investigates how reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be
designed to be safe, sample-efficient, and robust. Framed through the unifying
perspective of contextual-bandit RL, the work addresses two major application
domains - ranking and recommendation, and text-to-image diffusion models. The
first part of the thesis develops theory and algorithms for safe deployment in
ranking systems. An exposure-based generalisation bound is derived, leading to
a counterfactual risk-minimisation objective whose solution is guaranteed not
to underperform the logging policy, even with sparse feedback. This guarantee
is extended to doubly robust estimators, enabling safety even under adversarial
or misspecified user models and offering practitioners explicit control over
permissible utility loss. The second part turns to single-action bandits, where
various off-policy estimators are unified within a baseline-correction
framework. A closed-form optimal baseline is proposed and shown to minimise
both evaluation and policy-gradient variance, thereby improving off-policy
learning reliability. The final part examines the trade-offs between efficiency
and effectiveness in generative RL. A systematic study of PPO and REINFORCE
motivates the Leave-One-Out PPO (LOOP) algorithm, which combines multiple
diffusion trajectories with a REINFORCE-style baseline inside PPO's clipped
objective. LOOP achieves PPO-level sample efficiency while producing
generations that align more faithfully with textual attributes.

*Zhi Zhou,Yuhao Tan,Zenan Li,Yuan Yao,Lan-Zhe Guo,Yu-Feng Li,Xiaoxing Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper provides a theoretical framework for sampling-based test-time scaling in LLMs, analyzes self-consistency and perplexity, and introduces RPC to boost convergence and reduce cost, with empirical validation across seven benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish a theoretical basis for sampling-based test-time scaling and address limitations in existing paradigms (high estimation error in self-consistency and modeling error in perplexity) while reducing sampling cost.

Method: Develops a confidence-estimation-based framework; analyzes two paradigms (self-consistency and perplexity); proposes RPC consisting of Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning; proves estimation error convergence from linear to exponential; conducts empirical evaluation on seven datasets; provides code.

Result: Theoretical insights reveal limitations of current paradigms; RPC achieves comparable reasoning performance to self-consistency, improves confidence reliability, and halves sampling costs; strong empirical results across seven benchmarks.

Conclusion: RPC offers a principled, effective approach for test-time scaling that combines strengths of existing methods while mitigating drawbacks, with practical implications for scalable reasoning in LLMs and a public code release.

Abstract: Test-time scaling seeks to improve the reasoning performance of large
language models (LLMs) by adding computational resources. A prevalent approach
within the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance
reasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during
inference. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical foundations
remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework
for analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the
perspective of confidence estimation. Based on the framework, we analyze two
dominant paradigms: self-consistency and perplexity, and reveal key
limitations: self-consistency suffers from high estimation error while
perplexity exhibits substantial modeling error and possible degradation of the
estimation error convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a
hybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key
components: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity
Consistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting
the convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while
preserving model error. Reasoning Pruning prevents degradation by eliminating
low-probability reasoning paths. Both theoretical analysis and empirical
results across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong
potential for reducing reasoning error. Notably, RPC achieves reasoning
performance comparable to self-consistency while not only enhancing confidence
reliability but also reducing sampling costs by 50%. The code and resources are

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent-variable energy-based models trained via a saddle-point formulation over latent and joint distributions, using coupled Wasserstein gradient flows and Langevin dynamics. No discriminator needed. The authors prove existence/convergence and show a strictly tighter ELBO than amortized bounds; evaluated on physics-like systems with competitive results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide expressive LVEBMs with principled, convergent training. Address limitations of existing energy-based methods by formulating maximum-likelihood learning as a saddle problem and leveraging Wasserstein gradient flows to enable stable, discriminator-free optimization.

Method: Recast maximum-likelihood training as a saddle problem over distributions on latent/joint manifolds. Interpret inner updates as coupled Wasserstein gradient flows. The algorithm alternates overdamped Langevin updates for a joint negative pool and for conditional latent particles with stochastic parameter ascent, avoiding discriminators or auxiliary networks. Prove existence and convergence under standard smoothness/dissipativity assumptions, with decay rates in KL divergence and Wasserstein-2 distance. The saddle-point view yields an ELBO strictly tighter than bounds from restricted amortized posteriors.

Result: Theoretical guarantees: existence and convergence with decay rates in KL and W2. Demonstrates a strictly tighter ELBO compared to restricted amortized posteriors. Empirical evaluation on numerical approximations of physical systems shows competitive performance against similar methods.

Conclusion: The approach provides a theoretically sound and practically competitive framework for LVEBMs, delivering convergence guarantees, a discriminator-free training paradigm, and a tighter ELBO, with positive results on physics-inspired tasks.

Abstract: Latent-variable energy-based models (LVEBMs) assign a single normalized
energy to joint pairs of observed data and latent variables, offering
expressive generative modeling while capturing hidden structure. We recast
maximum-likelihood training as a saddle problem over distributions on the
latent and joint manifolds and view the inner updates as coupled Wasserstein
gradient flows. The resulting algorithm alternates overdamped Langevin updates
for a joint negative pool and for conditional latent particles with stochastic
parameter ascent, requiring no discriminator or auxiliary networks. We prove
existence and convergence under standard smoothness and dissipativity
assumptions, with decay rates in KL divergence and Wasserstein-2 distance. The
saddle-point view further yields an ELBO strictly tighter than bounds obtained
with restricted amortized posteriors. Our method is evaluated on numerical
approximations of physical systems and performs competitively against
comparable approaches.

*Jan Corazza,Hadi Partovi Aria,Daniel Neider,Zhe Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A method that integrates Temporal Logic-based Causal Diagrams into Probabilistic Reward Machines to accelerate policy learning for RL with sparse rewards and to ease transfer across environments, with a convergence guarantee and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PRMs capture temporal reward dependencies and nondeterminism but are hard to design by hand; RL struggles with sparse rewards; leveraging high-level causal knowledge and transferring reward structures to new domains is desirable.

Method: Incorporate Temporal Logic-based Causal Diagrams into the PRM reward formalism to guide policy learning and enable transfer; provide a theoretical convergence guarantee; and validate empirically.

Result: Expedites policy learning and facilitates transfer; theoretical convergence to the optimal policy is established; empirical results demonstrate the approach’s strengths.

Conclusion: Integrating causal temporal logic with PRMs improves learning efficiency and cross-domain transfer in RL with structured rewards, supported by theory and experiments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle with learning optimal
policies for tasks where reward feedback is sparse and depends on a complex
sequence of events in the environment. Probabilistic reward machines (PRMs) are
finite-state formalisms that can capture temporal dependencies in the reward
signal, along with nondeterministic task outcomes. While special RL algorithms
can exploit this finite-state structure to expedite learning, PRMs remain
difficult to modify and design by hand. This hinders the already difficult
tasks of utilizing high-level causal knowledge about the environment, and
transferring the reward formalism into a new domain with a different causal
structure. This paper proposes a novel method to incorporate causal information
in the form of Temporal Logic-based Causal Diagrams into the reward formalism,
thereby expediting policy learning and aiding the transfer of task
specifications to new environments. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical
result about convergence to optimal policy for our method, and demonstrate its
strengths empirically.

### [195] [Learning to Answer from Correct Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15464)
*Nirmit Joshi,Gene Li,Siddharth Bhandari,Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan,Cong Ma,Nathan Srebro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Replace likelihood-based imitation learning with a reward-class-based approach in offline contextual bandits; achieves logarithmic sample complexity in reward-class cardinality, addressing settings with multiple correct answers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many QA/prompt tasks have multiple valid completions. Traditional SFT with a demonstrator policy assumes low policy complexity, which is often unrealistic. A low-cardinality reward class is a weaker, more plausible assumption that may still enable efficient learning.

Method: Formalize offline imitation learning in contextual bandits with demonstrations from an optimal policy; show that MLE over a possibly complex policy class can fail when the true structure is the reward-class; develop a new method that leverages the small size of the reward class to obtain sample complexity O(log |R|).

Result: Theoretical analysis showing likelihood-based methods can fail under these conditions and that the proposed reward-class-based method achieves logarithmic sample complexity in the reward class cardinality; demonstrates the viability of learning from correct demonstrations without relying on policy-class constraints.

Conclusion: Broad implication: when learning from correct demonstrations, prioritize reward-structure (low-cardinality) assumptions over policy complexity; paves the way for new imitation-learning algorithms with favorable sample complexity.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning to generate an answer (or completion) to a
question (or prompt), where there could be multiple correct answers, any one of
which is acceptable at test time. Learning is based on demonstrations of some
correct answer to each training question, as in Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT).
We formalize the problem as offline imitation learning in contextual bandits,
with demonstrations from some optimal policy, without explicitly observed
rewards. Prior work assumes that the demonstrator belongs to a low-complexity
policy class, which motivates maximum likelihood estimation (i.e., log-loss
minimization). In contrast, we propose relying only on the reward model
(specifying which answers are correct) being in a low-cardinality class, which
we argue is a weaker assumption. We show that likelihood maximization methods
can fail in this case, and instead devise an alternative novel approach that
learns with sample complexity logarithmic in the cardinality of the reward
class. Our work motivates looking beyond likelihood maximization when learning
from correct demonstrations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An information-theoretic counterfactual predictor that learns a stochastic representation Z with strong predictive power for outcomes while minimizing mutual information with treatment T, avoiding adversarial training; extends naturally to dynamic settings; shows competitive performance on simulated and real clinical data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counterfactual prediction under assignment bias requires removing dependence between treatment and covariates. The goal is to achieve this without adversarial training, improving stability and reducing tuning burden while maintaining predictive accuracy.

Method: Start from a bound linking the counterfactual-factual risk gap to mutual information; learn a stochastic representation Z predictive of outcomes while minimizing I(Z; T). Derive a tractable variational objective that upper-bounds the information term and couples it with a supervised decoder. Use this as a stable training criterion. Extend naturally to dynamic settings by applying the information penalty to sequential representations at each decision time.

Result: Empirical evaluation on controlled simulations and a real-world clinical dataset shows favorable performance across metrics such as likelihood, counterfactual error, and policy evaluation when compared to state-of-the-art balancing, reweighting, and adversarial baselines. The method avoids training instabilities and tuning burden common to adversarial approaches.

Conclusion: An information-theoretic framework provides a principled, stable approach to counterfactual prediction under assignment bias. The stochastic representation learning with a mutual-information penalty yields competitive results and scales to dynamic decision-making without adversarial training burdens.

Abstract: We study counterfactual prediction under assignment bias and propose a
mathematically grounded, information-theoretic approach that removes
treatment-covariate dependence without adversarial training. Starting from a
bound that links the counterfactual-factual risk gap to mutual information, we
learn a stochastic representation Z that is predictive of outcomes while
minimizing I(Z; T). We derive a tractable variational objective that
upper-bounds the information term and couples it with a supervised decoder,
yielding a stable, provably motivated training criterion. The framework extends
naturally to dynamic settings by applying the information penalty to sequential
representations at each decision time. We evaluate the method on controlled
numerical simulations and a real-world clinical dataset, comparing against
recent state-of-the-art balancing, reweighting, and adversarial baselines.
Across metrics of likelihood, counterfactual error, and policy evaluation, our
approach performs favorably while avoiding the training instabilities and
tuning burden of adversarial schemes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A model-based offline IRL framework (OffSim) learns a high-entropy transition model and IRL-derived reward from expert trajectories to emulate environment dynamics and rewards, enabling offline policy training; OffSim+ adds a marginal reward for multi-dataset exploration, yielding strong MuJoCo performance versus existing offline IRL methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Developers face significant time and labor costs in building simulators and manually designing reward functions for RL. The paper proposes an offline approach that learns both environment dynamics and reward structure directly from expert data to facilitate offline policy training and improve generalization.

Method: Jointly optimize a probabilistic, high-entropy transition model and an IRL-based reward function from expert state-action trajectories. Use these learned components to train policies offline without interacting with the real environment. OffSim+ extends this with a marginal reward to enhance exploration in multi-dataset settings.

Result: In MuJoCo experiments, OffSim achieves substantial performance gains over existing offline IRL methods, demonstrating efficacy and robustness.

Conclusion: OffSim provides an effective model-based offline IRL framework enabling offline policy training with learned dynamics and reward, reducing dependence on hand-crafted simulators; OffSim+ further improves exploration in multi-dataset scenarios.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms typically utilize an interactive simulator
(i.e., environment) with a predefined reward function for policy training.
Developing such simulators and manually defining reward functions, however, is
often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this, we propose an
Offline Simulator (OffSim), a novel model-based offline inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) framework, to emulate environmental dynamics and reward
structure directly from expert-generated state-action trajectories. OffSim
jointly optimizes a high-entropy transition model and an IRL-based reward
function to enhance exploration and improve the generalizability of the learned
reward. Leveraging these learned components, OffSim can subsequently train a
policy offline without further interaction with the real environment.
Additionally, we introduce OffSim$^+$, an extension that incorporates a
marginal reward for multi-dataset settings to enhance exploration. Extensive
MuJoCo experiments demonstrate that OffSim achieves substantial performance
gains over existing offline IRL methods, confirming its efficacy and
robustness.

### [198] [The Road Less Traveled: Enhancing Exploration in LLMs via Sequential Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15502)
*Shijia Kang,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SESA introduces Sequential Sampling to counter exploration issues and policy collapse in RL for LLMs, improving diversity of reasoning paths and overall performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL-based fine-tuning of LLMs often suffers from limited exploration and entropy collapse, which reduces sampling diversity. Parallel sampling can amplify this by yielding similar solutions, hindering further improvement.

Method: SESA (Sequential Sampling) generates diverse solution sketches sequentially, conditioning each new output on previous ones, before expanding them into full reasoning paths. This promotes diversity and prevents policy collapse throughout the reasoning process.

Result: In synthetic tasks, sequential sampling yields higher path diversity and better recovery from collapse than traditional RL. On real tasks, SESA enhances exploration of valid strategies and overall performance. Across three agent benchmarks, it increases absolute success rates by +0.25, +0.42, and +0.07 over the base model, with up to ~211% relative improvement over baseline RL. Code released at GitHub.

Conclusion: SESA offers a structured exploration framework that stabilizes and diversifies RL-driven reasoning in LLMs, enabling more robust and effective decision-making. The approach shows promise for broader RL-assisted LLM improvements.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been pivotal in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it often suffers from limited
exploration and entropy collapse, where models exploit a narrow set of
solutions, leading to a loss of sampling diversity and subsequently preventing
RL from further improving performance. This issue is exacerbated in parallel
sampling methods, where multiple outputs are drawn from the same distribution,
potentially causing the model to converge to similar solutions. We propose
SESA, a novel SEquential SAmpling framework that mitigates this challenge by
generating diverse solution sketches sequentially before expanding them into
full reasoning paths. This approach ensures broader exploration by conditioning
each new output on previous ones, promoting diversity throughout the process
and preventing policy collapse. Our experiments on a synthetic task show that
sequential sampling consistently outperforms traditional RL methods in terms of
path diversity and recovery from collapse. Further evaluations on real-world
tasks demonstrate that SESA improves both the exploration of valid strategies
and the overall performance of LLMs. On three agent benchmarks, SESA lifts
success rates by $+0.25$, $+0.42$, and $+0.07$ absolute over the base model (up
to an additional $211\%$ relative improvement over baseline RL), underscoring
its exploration advantage. This work introduces a structured approach to
exploration, paving the way for more effective and diverse reasoning in
RL-trained LLMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/MuLabPKU/sesa.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KME-CLIP reframes CLIP-like similarity using inner products in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space to align with PMI, claiming both theoretical approximation guarantees and empirical gains over CLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The optimal similarity for paired modalities corresponds to PMI; current CLIP-style models underutilize the PMI’s linear structure, potentially limiting performance. The paper aims to exploit that structure to improve retrieval/classification.

Method: Introduce KME-CLIP, which maps modalities into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and uses the inner product in that space as the similarity measure, enabling PMI-like inner-product structure to influence pretraining.

Result: Theoretical analysis shows PMI can be approximated with arbitrary accuracy via the proposed kernelized inner product; empirical experiments demonstrate superior performance to standard CLIP on multiple retrieval and classification benchmarks.

Conclusion: Leveraging PMI structure through RKHS embedding (KME-CLIP) yields improved multi-modal alignment and downstream task performance compared to vanilla CLIP.

Abstract: In this study, we propose an enhancement to the similarity computation
mechanism in multi-modal contrastive pretraining frameworks such as CLIP. Prior
theoretical research has demonstrated that the optimal similarity metrics
between paired modalities should correspond to the pointwise mutual information
(PMI) between the two modalities. However, the current implementations of CLIP
and its variants fail to fully utilize the underlying linear structure of PMI.
We therefore propose KME-CLIP, which leverages this structure through the inner
product in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We theoretically prove that our
method can approximate PMI with arbitrary accuracy and empirically demonstrate
that our approach overall outperforms the standard CLIP formulation across
several retrieval and classification tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers can be injective with discrete inputs mapping to continuous representations; the paper proves injectivity at initialization and shows it persists during training, supports this with billions of collision tests across six LMs, and introduces SipIt—a linear-time algorithm to reconstruct exact input from hidden activations—implying lossless, invertible language models with implications for transparency, interpretability, and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenging the common belief that transformer activations are inherently non-injective and that inputs cannot be exactly recovered from representations; establish, both theoretically and empirically, that exact input recovery is possible and practically efficient.

Method: Provide a mathematical proof that discrete input sequences map injectively to their continuous hidden representations in transformer language models (at initialization and preserved during training); conduct empirical collision tests across six state-of-the-art LMs totaling billions of checks; develop SipIt, an algorithm with linear-time guarantees that reconstructs exact input from hidden activations.

Result: The experiments report zero collisions across billions of tests, supporting the injectivity claim; SipIt can reconstruct exact input texts from activations with linear-time complexity, demonstrating practical invertibility.

Conclusion: Injectivity is a fundamental property of language models with practical implications for transparency, interpretability, and safe deployment; exact input recoverability from hidden states is achievable, prompting broader considerations of model design, privacy, and trust.

Abstract: Transformer components such as non-linear activations and normalization are
inherently non-injective, suggesting that different inputs could map to the
same output and prevent exact recovery of the input from a model's
representations. In this paper, we challenge this view. First, we prove
mathematically that transformer language models mapping discrete input
sequences to their corresponding sequence of continuous representations are
injective and therefore lossless, a property established at initialization and
preserved during training. Second, we confirm this result empirically through
billions of collision tests on six state-of-the-art language models, and
observe no collisions. Third, we operationalize injectivity: we introduce
SipIt, the first algorithm that provably and efficiently reconstructs the exact
input text from hidden activations, establishing linear-time guarantees and
demonstrating exact invertibility in practice. Overall, our work establishes
injectivity as a fundamental and exploitable property of language models, with
direct implications for transparency, interpretability, and safe deployment.

### [201] [Revisiting Knowledge Distillation: The Hidden Role of Dataset Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15516)
*Giulia Lanzillotta,Felix Sarnthein,Gil Kur,Thomas Hofmann,Bobby He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Distillation becomes more data-efficient as dataset size decreases; dataset size is a fundamental variable in KD, amplifying its benefits in small data regimes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why KD works beyond model size and generalization by examining the role of dataset size and testing competing theories (e.g., label smoothing vs. dark knowledge).

Method: Conducted a broad empirical study across many datasets, tasks, and architectures, varying dataset size and analyzing the impact on KD; tested existing KD theories; examined factors like objective, scale, and sample ratios.

Result: KD's benefits are preserved and amplified in low-data regimes; dataset size is a key factor; evidence contradicts label smoothing as the explanation and supports dark knowledge; results depend on modeling factors.

Conclusion: Dataset size is a fundamental, previously overlooked variable in KD; theory and practice should incorporate data regime effects to fully understand and leverage KD.

Abstract: The concept of knowledge distillation (KD) describes the training of a
student model from a teacher model and is a widely adopted technique in deep
learning. However, it is still not clear how and why distillation works.
Previous studies focus on two central aspects of distillation: model size, and
generalisation. In this work we study distillation in a third dimension:
dataset size. We present a suite of experiments across a wide range of
datasets, tasks and neural architectures, demonstrating that the effect of
distillation is not only preserved but amplified in low-data regimes. We call
this newly discovered property the data efficiency of distillation. Equipped
with this new perspective, we test the predictive power of existing theories of
KD as we vary the dataset size. Our results disprove the hypothesis that
distillation can be understood as label smoothing, and provide further evidence
in support of the dark knowledge hypothesis. Finally, we analyse the impact of
modelling factors such as the objective, scale and relative number of samples
on the observed phenomenon. Ultimately, this work reveals that the dataset size
may be a fundamental but overlooked variable in the mechanisms underpinning
distillation.

### [202] [Compressive Modeling and Visualization of Multivariate Scientific Data using Implicit Neural Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15535)
*Abhay Kumar Dwivedi,Shanu Saklani,Soumya Dutta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A single neural network learns compact, shared representations for all variables of a multivariate dataset via implicit neural representations, achieving state-of-the-art compression while preserving data dependencies and enabling high-quality rendering/visualization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional multivariate scientific data require efficient compression that preserves inter-variable dependencies and supports high-fidelity visualization. Traditional per-variable or separate-model compression struggles with scalability and dependency preservation as the number of variables grows.

Method: Train a single neural network to represent all data variables simultaneously using parameter sharing. The model learns an implicit representation (likely mapping coordinates and possibly variable indices to values) that compresses tens to hundreds of variables into one shared framework, optimizing reconstruction quality and preserving dependencies.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art data compression with superior reconstructed data quality, rendering/visualization quality, and accurate preservation of dependency information among variables, while improving storage efficiency.

Conclusion: A shared-parameter, implicit neural representation is effective for compressing large multivariate datasets, enabling scalable storage and high-fidelity visualization without sacrificing inter-variable relationships.

Abstract: The extensive adoption of Deep Neural Networks has led to their increased
utilization in challenging scientific visualization tasks. Recent advancements
in building compressed data models using implicit neural representations have
shown promising results for tasks like spatiotemporal volume visualization and
super-resolution. Inspired by these successes, we develop compressed neural
representations for multivariate datasets containing tens to hundreds of
variables. Our approach utilizes a single network to learn representations for
all data variables simultaneously through parameter sharing. This allows us to
achieve state-of-the-art data compression. Through comprehensive evaluations,
we demonstrate superior performance in terms of reconstructed data quality,
rendering and visualization quality, preservation of dependency information
among variables, and storage efficiency.

### [203] [An Empirical Study on MC Dropout--Based Uncertainty--Error Correlation in 2D Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15541)
*Saumya B*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MC Dropout uncertainty shows only weak global, and negligible boundary, correlation with segmentation errors in 2D brain tumor MRI; augmentation changes affect correlations statistically but not practically; suggests MC Dropout is limited for boundary error localization and calls for hybrid/alternative uncertainty methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether MC Dropout-based uncertainty can reliably flag segmentation errors, particularly near tumor boundaries, a common claim in uncertainty estimation for medical imaging.

Method: 2D brain tumor MRI segmentation using a U-Net trained with four augmentation settings (none, horizontal flip, rotation, scaling). Uncertainty from 50 stochastic forward passes with MC Dropout. Pixel-wise errors computed and correlated with uncertainty using Pearson and Spearman coefficients. Analyzed overall and boundary-specific correlations.

Result: Global Pearson/Spearman correlations ~0.30–0.38 (weak). Boundary correlations |r|<0.05 (negligible). Differences among augmentation schemes were statistically significant (p<0.001) but lacked practical significance.

Conclusion: MC Dropout uncertainty provides limited cues for localizing boundary errors in brain tumor segmentation; alternative or hybrid uncertainty estimation methods are needed for reliable boundary error detection.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation from MRI is vital for diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout is widely used to
estimate model uncertainty, its effectiveness in identifying segmentation
errors -- especially near tumor boundaries -- remains unclear. This study
empirically examines the relationship between MC Dropout--based uncertainty and
segmentation error in 2D brain tumor MRI segmentation using a U-Net trained
under four augmentation settings: none, horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling.
Uncertainty was computed from 50 stochastic forward passes and correlated with
pixel-wise errors using Pearson and Spearman coefficients. Results show weak
global correlations ($r \approx 0.30$--$0.38$) and negligible boundary
correlations ($|r| < 0.05$). Although differences across augmentations were
statistically significant ($p < 0.001$), they lacked practical relevance. These
findings suggest that MC Dropout uncertainty provides limited cues for boundary
error localization, underscoring the need for alternative or hybrid uncertainty
estimation methods in medical image segmentation.

*Sibo Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Strategic Doubly Robust (SDR) estimator that fuses strategic equilibrium modeling with doubly robust causal estimation to handle endogenous treatment due to strategic agents; achieves consistency and asymptotic normality with bias reduction and scalable performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Endogeneity from strategic agent responses to interventions; need for reliable causal inference in strategic environments.

Method: Combine strategic equilibrium modeling with DR estimation to produce SDR; maintain double robustness under strategic unconfoundedness; derive theoretical properties; empirical evaluation with varying strategic strengths.

Result: Theoretical consistency and asymptotic normality; empirical bias reduction 7.6-29.3% across settings; scalable to larger agent populations; improved performance over baselines.

Conclusion: SDR offers a principled framework for causal inference when agents react strategically; balances robustness and strategic considerations; broad applicability.

Abstract: We introduce the Strategic Doubly Robust (SDR) estimator, a novel framework
that integrates strategic equilibrium modeling with doubly robust estimation
for causal inference in strategic environments. SDR addresses endogenous
treatment assignment arising from strategic agent behavior, maintaining double
robustness while incorporating strategic considerations. Theoretical analysis
confirms SDR's consistency and asymptotic normality under strategic
unconfoundedness. Empirical evaluations demonstrate SDR's superior performance
over baseline methods, achieving 7.6\%-29.3\% bias reduction across varying
strategic strengths and maintaining robust scalability with agent populations.
The framework provides a principled approach for reliable causal inference when
agents respond strategically to interventions.

### [205] [On the Neural Feature Ansatz for Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15563)
*Edward Tansley,Estelle Massart,Coralia Cartis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends the Neural Feature Ansatz (NFA) to deep networks, showing a depth-dependent exponent alpha = 1/L under balanced initialization; with unbalanced initialization and weight decay, NFA holds asymptotically; provides counterexamples for some nonlinear architectures; validated by extensive experiments across optimizers and initializations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the theoretical gap in understanding feature learning for deep nets by generalizing the NFA beyond two-layer linear models and exploring how depth, initialization, and regularization affect the relation between the first-layer Gram matrix and the AGOP.

Method: Theoretical analysis under gradient-flow dynamics for L-layer networks with balanced initialization to derive NFA with alpha = 1/L; extend to unbalanced initialization showing asymptotic NFA with weight decay; construct counterexamples for certain nonlinear architectures; support findings with comprehensive numerical experiments across optimization algorithms, weight decay rates, and initialization schemes.

Result: NFA holds with exponent alpha = 1/L for L ≥ 2 under balanced initialization; with unbalanced initialization, NFA emerges asymptotically when weight decay is applied; counterexamples exist for some networks with nonlinear activations; experiments corroborate (or illustrate the boundaries of) the theory across different training regimes.

Conclusion: Depth modulates the NFA, indicating a depth-dependent feature-learning structure. The NFA is not universal; it depends on initialization and regularization. The work advances the mathematical understanding of feature learning and provides practical validation across training setups.

Abstract: Understanding feature learning is an important open question in establishing
a mathematical foundation for deep neural networks. The Neural Feature Ansatz
(NFA) states that after training, the Gram matrix of the first-layer weights of
a deep neural network is proportional to some power $\alpha>0$ of the average
gradient outer product (AGOP) of this network with respect to its inputs.
Assuming gradient flow dynamics with balanced weight initialization, the NFA
was proven to hold throughout training for two-layer linear networks with
exponent $\alpha = 1/2$ (Radhakrishnan et al., 2024). We extend this result to
networks with $L \geq 2$ layers, showing that the NFA holds with exponent
$\alpha = 1/L$, thus demonstrating a depth dependency of the NFA. Furthermore,
we prove that for unbalanced initialization, the NFA holds asymptotically
through training if weight decay is applied. We also provide counterexamples
showing that the NFA does not hold for some network architectures with
nonlinear activations, even when these networks fit arbitrarily well the
training data. We thoroughly validate our theoretical results through numerical
experiments across a variety of optimization algorithms, weight decay rates and
initialization schemes.

### [206] [Attn-JGNN: Attention Enhanced Join-Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15583)
*Jixin Zhang,Yong Lai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel Attention Enhanced Join-Graph Neural Networks (Attn-JGNN) for solving SAT (#SAT) problems, combining IJGP-inspired join-graph propagation with attention to improve accuracy; encodes CNF via tree decomposition, uses iterative message passing, and learns partition functions; attention between and within clusters focuses on key variables, reducing redundant computations; experiments show superior performance to other neural methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve the accuracy of neural SAT solvers by leveraging join-graph representations and attention to highlight key variables and clusters, while reducing redundant computations.

Method: Encode the CNF formula into a join-graph via tree decomposition, perform iterative message passing on the join-graph, learn partition functions to approximate the model number, and apply attention mechanisms within and between join-graph clusters to emphasize important variables/clusters during inference.

Result: Attn-JGNN achieves better results than other neural network methods on SAT/ #SAT tasks in their experiments.

Conclusion: Attention mechanisms integrated into join-graph neural networks enhance inference accuracy for SAT problems and can outperform existing neural approaches, confirming the effectiveness of Attn-JGNN.

Abstract: We propose an Attention Enhanced Join-Graph Neural Networks(Attn-JGNN) model
for solving #SAT problems, which significantly improves the solving accuracy.
Inspired by the Iterative Join Graph Propagation (IJGP) algorithm, Attn-JGNN
uses tree decomposition to encode the CNF formula into a join-graph, then
performs iterative message passing on the join-graph, and finally approximates
the model number by learning partition functions. In order to further improve
the accuracy of the solution, we apply the attention mechanism in and between
clusters of the join-graphs, which makes Attn-JGNN pay more attention to the
key variables and clusters in probabilistic inference, and reduces the
redundant calculation. Finally, our experiments show that our Attn-JGNN model
achieves better results than other neural network methods.

### [207] [GRATING: Low-Latency and Memory-Efficient Semantic Selection on Device](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15620)
*Jiahao Zhou,Chengliang Lin,Dingji Li,Mingkai Dong,Haibo Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRATING is a training-free inference system for on-device semantic top-K selection that uses a global view of candidates and progressive cluster pruning to drastically reduce latency and memory without sacrificing precision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: On-device cross-encoder rerankers for retrieval-augmented generation, agent memory, and personalized recommendations are bottlenecked by latency and memory. The insight that only relative rankings matter and that rankings stabilize early enables pruning opportunities before full inference.

Method: Monolithic forwarding with a global candidate view and progressive cluster pruning. A training-free inference pipeline that overlaps I/O and computation via a dual-layer sliding window and chunked execution to bound peak memory.

Result: In microbenchmarks, GRATING reduces latency by up to 89% and peak memory by up to 94.9% on rerankers from 0.6B to 8B parameters across Apple M2 and RTX 5070, with no loss in precision. In three real-world on-device AI applications, latency decreases range from 11.6% to 51.0% and peak memory from 18.6% to 77.8%.

Conclusion: GRATING offers substantial efficiency gains for on-device top-K selection with cross-encoder rerankers, improving deployability by delivering large latency and memory reductions without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Semantic top-K selection with cross-encoder rerankers underpins of on-device
AI services, such as retrieval-augmented generation, agent memory, and
personalized recommendation. However, its latency and memory demands dominate
end-to-end budgets on edge hardware. Revisiting the objective of top-K
selection, we reveal that only relative rankings matter, not exact
per-candidate scores. We further observe sequence-level sparsity: relative
rankings stabilize early in intermediate layers, allowing pruning opportunities
prior to completing full inference.
  Building on this insight, we propose monolithic forwarding and develop a
training-free inference system, GRATING. By maintaining a global view of all
candidates, it reduces latency through progressive cluster pruning. It also
bounds peak memory usage by strategically overlapping I/O with computation via
dual-layer sliding window and chunked execution. We evaluate GRATING against
state-of-the-art baselines on rerankers from 0.6B to 8B parameters across Apple
M2 and RTX 5070. GRATING consistently reduces latency by up to 89.0% and peak
memory by up to 94.9% in microbenchmarks, without any loss in precision. Across
three real-world on-device AI applications, GRATING lowers latency by
11.6%-51.0% and peak memory by 18.6%-77.8%, demonstrating substantial
improvements in efficiency and deployability.

### [208] [CQD-SHAP: Explainable Complex Query Answering via Shapley Values](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15623)
*Parsa Abbasi,Stefan Heindorf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CQD-SHAP: an explainable framework for complex query answering that uses Shapley-value attributions to quantify how each query component contributes to an answer’s ranking, improving interpretability of neurosymbolic CQD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CQA neural/neurosymbolic methods are largely black-box; existing interpretable approaches (e.g., CQD) still lack fine-grained explanations of which query parts matter. There is a need for principled, trackable explanations to build user trust.

Method: Apply Shapley-value-based contribution estimation to each query component in a CQD-like framework, attributing each component’s influence on the ranking of a specific answer. The method adheres to Shapley axioms and uses a neural predictor to infer new knowledge from incomplete KGs while providing explanations for the ranking.

Result: Automated evaluation shows that the explanations are effective as necessary and sufficient explanations and outperform various baselines for most query types.

Conclusion: CQD-SHAP offers principled, axiomatic attributions of query-component contributions to answer rankings, improving interpretability and trust in neurosymbolic CQA while leveraging neural inference over incomplete KGs; the approach is effective across most query types.

Abstract: Complex query answering (CQA) goes beyond the well-studied link prediction
task by addressing more sophisticated queries that require multi-hop reasoning
over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). Research on neural and neurosymbolic
CQA methods is still an emerging field. Almost all of these methods can be
regarded as black-box models, which may raise concerns about user trust.
Although neurosymbolic approaches like CQD are slightly more interpretable,
allowing intermediate results to be tracked, the importance of different parts
of the query remains unexplained. In this paper, we propose CQD-SHAP, a novel
framework that computes the contribution of each query part to the ranking of a
specific answer. This contribution explains the value of leveraging a neural
predictor that can infer new knowledge from an incomplete KG, rather than a
symbolic approach relying solely on existing facts in the KG. CQD-SHAP is
formulated based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory and satisfies
all the fundamental Shapley axioms. Automated evaluation of these explanations
in terms of necessary and sufficient explanations, and comparisons with various
baselines, shows the effectiveness of this approach for most query types.

*Ziqian Li,Kang Liu,Yongcun Song,Hangrui Yue,Enrique Zuazua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NODE-ONet introduces a physics-encoded neural ODE operator framework with encoder–latent ODE–decoder architecture for PDE surrogates, achieving accurate, efficient predictions and extrapolation beyond training, demonstrated on nonlinear diffusion–reaction and Navier–Stokes, with theory and flexible encoders/decoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing operator-learning approaches often ignore PDE domain knowledge, struggling to capture temporal dynamics and generalize beyond training time frames; there is a need for physics-informed, efficient surrogates that can generalize across related PDE families.

Method: An encoder–decoder framework: encoder spatially discretizes input functions; a neural ODE models latent temporal dynamics; a decoder reconstructs solutions in physical space. The paper provides encoder–decoder error analysis and introduces physics-encoded neural ODEs to embed PDE-specific physical properties, aiming to reduce complexity and improve numerical efficiency, robustness, and generalization.

Result: Numerical experiments on nonlinear diffusion–reaction and Navier–Stokes equations show high accuracy, computational efficiency, and predictive capability beyond training time frames; the framework is flexible to accommodate diverse encoders/decoders and can generalize across related PDE families.

Conclusion: NODE-ONet is a scalable, physics-encoded operator-learning tool for scientific ML that leverages domain knowledge to improve efficiency, robustness, and generalization across PDEs, with strong potential for broad applicability.

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for developing
efficient surrogate models to solve partial differential equations (PDEs).
However, existing approaches often overlook the domain knowledge inherent in
the underlying PDEs and hence suffer from challenges in capturing temporal
dynamics and generalization issues beyond training time frames. This paper
introduces a deep neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) operator network
framework, termed NODE-ONet, to alleviate these limitations. The framework
adopts an encoder-decoder architecture comprising three core components: an
encoder that spatially discretizes input functions, a neural ODE capturing
latent temporal dynamics, and a decoder reconstructing solutions in physical
spaces. Theoretically, error analysis for the encoder-decoder architecture is
investigated. Computationally, we propose novel physics-encoded neural ODEs to
incorporate PDE-specific physical properties. Such well-designed neural ODEs
significantly reduce the framework's complexity while enhancing numerical
efficiency, robustness, applicability, and generalization capacity. Numerical
experiments on nonlinear diffusion-reaction and Navier-Stokes equations
demonstrate high accuracy, computational efficiency, and prediction
capabilities beyond training time frames. Additionally, the framework's
flexibility to accommodate diverse encoders/decoders and its ability to
generalize across related PDE families further underscore its potential as a
scalable, physics-encoded tool for scientific machine learning.

*Yefan Zeng,Shengyu Duan,Rishad Shafik,Alex Yakovlev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Efficient software TM with bitwise operations and early exit + literal reorder delivers large speedups on ARM-like CPUs (up to 96.71%) while preserving code density.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TM is well-suited for resource-constrained devices, but inference speed can be improved by exploiting CPU bitwise operations and reducing unnecessary computations. The paper aims to accelerate TM inference without changing model accuracy or density.

Method: Implement TM using instruction-level bitwise operations for compact representation; add an early-exit mechanism based on AND-clause evaluation to skip work; introduce a post-training, pre-inference literal reorder strategy via statistical analysis of literals and TA actions, incurring negligible runtime overhead.

Result: In gem5 ARM simulations, the optimized TM reduced inference time by up to 96.71% compared with conventional integer-based TM implementations while maintaining comparable code density.

Conclusion: Hardware-aware optimizations (bitwise ops, early exits, and literal ordering) substantially accelerate TM inference on resource-constrained CPUs without significant density loss, indicating practical viability for deployments on limited hardware.

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) offers high-speed inference on resource-constrained
devices such as CPUs. Its logic-driven operations naturally lend themselves to
parallel execution on modern CPU architectures. Motivated by this, we propose
an efficient software implementation of the TM by leveraging instruction-level
bitwise operations for compact model representation and accelerated processing.
To further improve inference speed, we introduce an early exit mechanism, which
exploits the TM's AND-based clause evaluation to avoid unnecessary
computations. Building upon this, we propose a literal Reorder strategy
designed to maximize the likelihood of early exits. This strategy is applied
during a post-training, pre-inference stage through statistical analysis of all
literals and the corresponding actions of their associated Tsetlin Automata
(TA), introducing negligible runtime overhead. Experimental results using the
gem5 simulator with an ARM processor show that our optimized implementation
reduces inference time by up to 96.71% compared to the conventional
integer-based TM implementations while maintaining comparable code density.

*Lino Gerlach,Liv Våge,Thore Gerlach,Elliott Kauffman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WARP-LUTs: a Walsh-assisted relaxation method for probabilistic LUTs that learns logic gate combinations with far fewer parameters, achieving faster CIFAR-10 convergence with comparable accuracy to DLGNs and enabling scalable FPGA-ready logic blocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome high training cost and limited generalization of differentiable logic gate networks (e.g., DLGNs) while enabling efficient, scalable logic models suitable for FPGA deployment.

Method: Introduce Walsh-Assisted Relaxation for Probabilistic Look-Up Tables (WARP-LUTs): a gradient-based framework that uses Walsh-function-based relaxation to learn combinations of logic gates with substantially fewer trainable parameters, enabling efficient optimization for low-input logic blocks and potential extension to higher-input LUTs.

Result: Faster convergence on CIFAR-10 than DLGNs with comparable accuracy; requires significantly fewer trainable parameters; indicates potential for application to higher-input LUTs and real-time FPGA deployments.

Conclusion: WARP-LUTs offer a more parameter-efficient, scalable approach to differentiable logic learning, with strong hardware deployment potential and avenues for extending to more complex logic blocks.

Abstract: Fast and efficient machine learning is of growing interest to the scientific
community and has spurred significant research into novel model architectures
and hardware-aware design. Recent hard? and software co-design approaches have
demonstrated impressive results with entirely multiplication-free models.
Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs), for instance, provide a
gradient-based framework for learning optimal combinations of low-level logic
gates, setting state-of-the-art trade-offs between accuracy, resource usage,
and latency. However, these models suffer from high computational cost during
training and do not generalize well to logic blocks with more inputs. In this
work, we introduce Walsh-Assisted Relaxation for Probabilistic Look-Up Tables
(WARP-LUTs) - a novel gradient-based method that efficiently learns
combinations of logic gates with substantially fewer trainable parameters. We
demonstrate that WARP-LUTs achieve significantly faster convergence on CIFAR-10
compared to DLGNs, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Furthermore, our
approach suggests potential for extension to higher-input logic blocks,
motivating future research on extremely efficient deployment on modern FPGAs
and its real-time science applications.

### [213] [CarBoN: Calibrated Best-of-N Sampling Improves Test-time Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15674)
*Yung-Chen Tang,Pin-Yu Chen,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Calibrated test-time optimization (CarBoN) improves test-time sampling efficiency for reasoning tasks by adaptively shifting logits via temperature and additive delta, achieving up to 4x fewer rollouts while maintaining or improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diminishing returns of Best-of-N sampling at larger N; need efficient use of compute during inference and improved reasoning without retraining of LLMs.

Method: A two-phase framework: (1) explore the solution space; (2) learn an input-specific calibration of the logits via a temperature T and additive shift vector δ to guide generation toward more reliable reasoning. The approach provides theoretical guarantees on improving the lower bound of expected reward with finite samples and generalizes to step-level strategies like beam search. Evaluation on MATH-500 and AIME-2024.

Result: CarBoN achieves up to 4× fewer rollouts to reach the same accuracy and often yields higher accuracy under fixed budgets. It clarifies the roles of T and δ in balancing diversity and correctness and demonstrates generalization to beam search.

Conclusion: Test-time calibration can materially improve inference efficiency and reasoning accuracy without LLM retraining; the framework is broadly applicable across sampling strategies and aligns with practical computation constraints.

Abstract: Allocating more computation during inference time (test-time scaling)
improves language model performance, especially for reasoning tasks. However,
popular methods like Best-of-$N$ sampling often show diminishing returns as $N$
increases. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a general test-time
calibration framework that adaptively modifies the model toward high-reward
reasoning paths, with theoretical guarantees of improving the lower bound of
expected reward under finite sampling, all without large language model (LLM)
retraining. Within this framework, we propose CarBoN (Calibrated Best-of-$N$),
a two-phase method that first explores the solution space and then learns a
calibration of the logits via an input-specific temperature $T$ and additive
shift vector $\delta$, guiding generation toward more reliable reasoning.
Experiments on MATH-500 and AIME-2024 show that CarBoN improves efficiency,
with up to $4\times$ fewer rollouts to reach the same accuracy, while often
achieving higher accuracy under fixed budgets. We also analyze the
complementary roles of $T$ and $\delta$ in balancing output diversity and
correctness, and demonstrate that the framework also generalizes to step-level
sampling strategies such as beam search. For more information, please refer to

Motivation: Rotor geometry heavily impacts IPMSM performance; FEM is computationally expensive; need fast, accurate, scalable methods for rotor shape identification and related diagnostics.

Method: Use electromagnetic parameters as features; dataset of 9,000 samples; 10-fold cross-validation; compare KS-Net (custom deep model) against Cubic SVM, Quadratic SVM, Fine KNN, Cosine KNN, Fine Tree; target classes: 2D, V, Nabla rotor shapes.

Result: Cubic SVM and Quadratic SVM achieved 100% accuracy; KS-Net achieved 99.98% with two misclassifications; overall competitive, dataset balanced; demonstrates viability of data-driven approach.

Conclusion: Data-driven rotor-shape classification can closely approximate or potentially replace FEM-based analyses for IPMSMs, enabling faster motor design, automated rotor identification, and fault diagnosis.

Abstract: The demand for high efficiency and precise control in electric drive systems
has led to the widespread adoption of Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous
Motors (IPMSMs). The performance of these motors is significantly influenced by
rotor geometry. Traditionally, rotor shape analysis has been conducted using
the finite element method (FEM), which involves high computational costs. This
study aims to classify the rotor shape (2D type, V type, Nabla type) of IPMSMs
using electromagnetic parameters through machine learning-based methods and to
demonstrate the applicability of this approach as an alternative to classical
methods. In this context, a custom deep learning model, KS-Net, developed by
the user, was comparatively evaluated against Cubic SVM, Quadratic SVM, Fine
KNN, Cosine KNN, and Fine Tree algorithms. The balanced dataset, consisting of
9,000 samples, was tested using 10-fold cross-validation, and performance
metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were employed. The
results indicate that the Cubic SVM and Quadratic SVM algorithms classified all
samples flawlessly, achieving 100% accuracy, while the KS-Net model achieved
99.98% accuracy with only two misclassifications, demonstrating competitiveness
with classical methods. This study shows that the rotor shape of IPMSMs can be
predicted with high accuracy using data-driven approaches, offering a fast and
cost-effective alternative to FEM-based analyses. The findings provide a solid
foundation for accelerating motor design processes, developing automated rotor
identification systems, and enabling data-driven fault diagnosis in engineering
applications.

### [215] [Constrained Adversarial Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15699)
*Virendra Nishad,Bhaskar Mukhoty,Hilal AlQuabeh,Sandeep K. Shukla,Sayak Ray Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAP: a constrained universal perturbation method that uses augmented Lagrangian optimization to enforce multiple domain-specific feature constraints, improving attack success and efficiency across finance, IT networks, and CPS, with extension to individual perturbations and a data-driven constraint learning procedure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Universal adversarial perturbations often ignore domain-specific feature relationships, rendering attacks unrealistic in real-world settings. Incorporating constraints aligned with domain structure (e.g., financial ratios, network invariants) is crucial to produce plausible perturbations for robust testing and training.

Method: Formulate a constrained min–max optimization using an augmented Lagrangian to enforce multiple, potentially complex constraints. Solve via a gradient-based alternating optimization algorithm called Constrained Adversarial Perturbation (CAP). Extend to per-instance perturbations and introduce a principled procedure to learn feature constraints directly from data.

Result: CAP achieves higher attack success rates and significantly faster runtimes than existing baselines across diverse domains (finance, IT networks, CPS). It also generalizes to individual adversarial perturbations and provides a data-driven method to learn feature constraints for broad applicability.

Conclusion: CAP advances realistic, scalable adversarial testing and training by respecting domain constraints, enabling broader applicability across structured input spaces and suggesting future work on data-driven constraint discovery.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of
classification tasks. However, they remain highly susceptible to adversarial
examples - inputs that are subtly perturbed to induce misclassification while
appearing unchanged to humans. Among various attack strategies, Universal
Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) have emerged as a powerful tool for both
stress testing model robustness and facilitating scalable adversarial training.
Despite their effectiveness, most existing UAP methods neglect domain specific
constraints that govern feature relationships. Violating such constraints, such
as debt to income ratios in credit scoring or packet flow invariants in network
communication, can render adversarial examples implausible or easily
detectable, thereby limiting their real world applicability.
  In this work, we advance universal adversarial attacks to constrained feature
spaces by formulating an augmented Lagrangian based min max optimization
problem that enforces multiple, potentially complex constraints of varying
importance. We propose Constrained Adversarial Perturbation (CAP), an efficient
algorithm that solves this problem using a gradient based alternating
optimization strategy. We evaluate CAP across diverse domains including
finance, IT networks, and cyber physical systems, and demonstrate that it
achieves higher attack success rates while significantly reducing runtime
compared to existing baselines. Our approach also generalizes seamlessly to
individual adversarial perturbations, where we observe similar strong
performance gains. Finally, we introduce a principled procedure for learning
feature constraints directly from data, enabling broad applicability across
domains with structured input spaces.

### [216] [ProofOptimizer: Training Language Models to Simplify Proofs without Human Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15700)
*Alex Gu,Bartosz Piotrowski,Fabian Gloeckle,Kaiyu Yang,Aram H. Markosyan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First language model trained to simplify Lean proofs without extra supervision; uses expert iteration and reinforcement learning; shortens proofs dramatically and speeds verification, benefiting downstream provers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Formal Lean proofs can be thousands of lines long, making them hard to understand and extract insight from. Training data for simplification is scarce, and existing methods—largely agentic scaffolding with off‑the‑shelf LLMs—struggle with extremely long proofs produced by RL-trained provers.

Method: Train ProofOptimizer via expert iteration and reinforcement learning, using Lean to verify simplifications and provide training signals. It operates in an iterative proof-shortening workflow at inference time, progressively reducing proof length without requiring additional human supervision.

Result: Substantial proof-length reductions across benchmarks: 87% on miniF2F, 57% on PutnamBench, and 49% on Seed-Prover’s IMO 2025 proofs. Simplified proofs check faster in Lean and improve downstream prover performance when used as training data for supervised fine-tuning.

Conclusion: ProofOptimizer demonstrates the feasibility of self-supervised, RL-guided proof simplification, yielding concise, verifiable Lean proofs and enhancing downstream proving performance.

Abstract: Neural theorem proving has advanced rapidly in the past year, reaching IMO
gold-medalist capabilities and producing formal proofs that span thousands of
lines. Although such proofs are mechanically verified by formal systems like
Lean, their excessive length renders them difficult for humans to comprehend
and limits their usefulness for mathematical insight. Proof simplification is
therefore a critical bottleneck. Yet, training data for this task is scarce,
and existing methods -- mainly agentic scaffolding with off-the-shelf LLMs --
struggle with the extremely long proofs generated by RL-trained provers. We
introduce ProofOptimizer, the first language model trained to simplify Lean
proofs without requiring additional human supervision. ProofOptimizer is
trained via expert iteration and reinforcement learning, using Lean to verify
simplifications and provide training signal. At inference time, it operates
within an iterative proof-shortening workflow, progressively reducing proof
length. Experiments show that ProofOptimizer substantially compresses proofs
generated by state-of-the-art RL-trained provers on standard benchmarks,
reducing proof length by 87% on miniF2F, 57% on PutnamBench, and 49% on
Seed-Prover's IMO 2025 proofs. Beyond conciseness, the simplified proofs check
faster in Lean and further improve downstream prover performance when reused as
training data for supervised finetuning.

### [217] [ProSh: Probabilistic Shielding for Model-free Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15720)
*Edwin Hamel-De le Court,Gaspard Ohlmann,Francesco Belardinelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProSh is a model-free safe RL algorithm that augments the Constrained MDP with a risk budget and a learned cost critic to shield the policy, guaranteeing safety in expectation and preserving optimality in deterministic environments, with a training-time cost bound and empirical safety demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety in reinforcement learning is crucial and requires formal guarantees. ProSh addresses safety under cost constraints in a model-free setting, aiming to keep learning safe while providing theoretical bounds.

Method: Extend Constrained MDP with a risk budget. Apply a shield to the policy distribution using a learned cost critic, ensuring all sampled actions are safe in expectation. ProSh provides a tight upper bound on expected cost depending on backup-critic accuracy and preserves optimality in deterministic environments. Training safety is supported under mild assumptions, with model-free dependencies acknowledged.

Result: The approach offers a formal bound on expected cost during training, maintains safety in expectation via the shield, preserves optimality in deterministic settings, and is validated through experiments showing safety during training.

Conclusion: ProSh delivers a practical, model-free safe RL framework that guarantees safety during training under mild assumptions, preserves optimality in deterministic environments, and relies on risk augmentation and a cost critic to shield the policy.

Abstract: Safety is a major concern in reinforcement learning (RL): we aim at
developing RL systems that not only perform optimally, but are also safe to
deploy by providing formal guarantees about their safety. To this end, we
introduce Probabilistic Shielding via Risk Augmentation (ProSh), a model-free
algorithm for safe reinforcement learning under cost constraints. ProSh
augments the Constrained MDP state space with a risk budget and enforces safety
by applying a shield to the agent's policy distribution using a learned cost
critic. The shield ensures that all sampled actions remain safe in expectation.
We also show that optimality is preserved when the environment is
deterministic. Since ProSh is model-free, safety during training depends on the
knowledge we have acquired about the environment. We provide a tight
upper-bound on the cost in expectation, depending only on the backup-critic
accuracy, that is always satisfied during training. Under mild, practically
achievable assumptions, ProSh guarantees safety even at training time, as shown
in the experiments.

*Mahyar Alinejad,Alvaro Velasquez,Yue Wang,George Atia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Automaton-guided preferences learn a reward from a DFA to tackle non-Markovian rewards in RL; static and dynamic variants; outperforms baselines; convergence guarantees near-optimal policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-Markovian rewards are hard to specify with hand-crafted rewards; DFA-based preferences provide a scalable, human-independent way to encode temporal structure and derive a learnable reward function.

Method: Derive trajectory preferences from a deterministic finite automaton; learn a reward function from those preferences; two approaches: static use of the learned reward for policy optimization, and dynamic iterative refinement of reward and policy until convergence.

Result: Empirical success in discrete and continuous environments; outperforms reward machines and LTL-guided baselines; handles non-Markovian rewards; includes convergence guarantee yielding near-optimal policy.

Conclusion: Automaton-based preferences offer a scalable, human-independent alternative to reward engineering for temporally structured tasks; provides theoretical and empirical support for effectiveness and convergence.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in environments with complex, history-dependent
reward structures poses significant challenges for traditional methods. In this
work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages automaton-based feedback to
guide the learning process, replacing explicit reward functions with
preferences derived from a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). Unlike
conventional approaches that use automata for direct reward specification, our
method employs the structure of the DFA to generate preferences over
trajectories that are used to learn a reward function, eliminating the need for
manual reward engineering. Our framework introduces a static approach that uses
the learned reward function directly for policy optimization and a dynamic
approach that involves continuous refining of the reward function and policy
through iterative updates until convergence.
  Our experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that
our approach enables the RL agent to learn effective policies for tasks with
temporal dependencies, outperforming traditional reward engineering and
automaton-based baselines such as reward machines and LTL-guided methods. Our
results highlight the advantages of automaton-based preferences in handling
non-Markovian rewards, offering a scalable, efficient, and human-independent
alternative to traditional reward modeling. We also provide a convergence
guarantee showing that under standard assumptions our automaton-guided
preference-based framework learns a policy that is near-optimal with respect to
the true non-Markovian objective.

*Nayan Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GNNs outperform 3D U-Nets for FEA surrogates on parametric I-beams; PINN-enabled MPNN offers the best practical balance of accuracy, size, and speed, while Graph Transformer is the most accurate but slower.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FEA is computationally expensive in design optimization. Fast, accurate surrogates are needed. The study compares graph-based and voxel-based networks, augmented with physics via PINN, to predict FEA fields for parametric I-beams.

Method: Systematic evaluation of multiple architectures: GCN, MPNN, Graph Transformer (graph-based) and 3D U-Net variants (with/without attention, high-res data). Incorporation of physics through a Navier–Cauchy PINN framework; curriculum learning with pretraining then physics-informed fine-tuning. Metrics include relative L2 error, inference speed, and model size.

Result: GNNs outperform U-Nets across the board. Worst GCN: ~8.7% rel. L2 error; best U-Net (high-res with attention): ~13.0%. Among graph models, MPNN: 3.5% and Graph Transformer: 2.6% relative L2 error. Physics (PINN) improves generalization, reducing error by up to 11.3% on high-signal tasks. Graph Transformer is the most accurate but ~37.5% slower than the second-best model (MPNN PINN). The PINN-enhanced MPNN (MPNN PINN) offers the best practical balance between accuracy, model size, and inference speed.

Conclusion: PINN-augmented graph networks, especially MPNN PINN, provide the most practical surrogate for FEA in parametric I-beams, delivering strong accuracy with efficient inference; physics-informed training is crucial for generalization and stability.

Abstract: Although Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is an integral part of the product
design lifecycle, the analysis is computationally expensive, making it
unsuitable for many design optimization problems. The deep learning models can
be a great solution. However, selecting the architecture that emulates the FEA
with great accuracy is a challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of graph neural networks (GNNs) and 3D U-Nets as surrogates for FEA
of parametric I-beams. We introduce a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)
framework, governed by the Navier Cauchy equations, to enforce physical laws.
Crucially, we demonstrate that a curriculum learning strategy, pretraining on
data followed by physics informed fine tuning, is essential for stabilizing
training. Our results show that GNNs fundamentally outperform the U-Net. Even
the worst performer among GNNs, the GCN framework, achieved a relative L2 error
of 8.7% while the best framework among U Net, U Net with attention mechanism
trained on high resolution data, achieved 13.0% score. Among the graph-based
architectures, the Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN) and Graph
Transformers achieved the highest accuracy, achieving a relative L2 score of
3.5% and 2.6% respectively. The inclusion of physics fundamental laws (PINN)
significantly improved the generalization, reducing error by up to 11.3% on
high-signal tasks. While the Graph Transformer is the most accurate model, it
is more 37.5% slower during inference when compared to second best model, MPNN
PINN. The PINN enhanced MPNN (MPNN PINN) provides the most practical solution.
It offers a good compromise between predictive performance, model size, and
inference speed.

*Trung-Anh Dang,Vincent Nguyen,Ngoc-Son Vu,Christel Vrain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAMix is a Sphere-Adaptive Mixup method for neural collapse-based continual learning that improves calibration, reduces overconfidence and forgetting, and surpasses SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Continual learning models often forget and are poorly calibrated; neural collapse reduces misalignment but calibration remains an issue; need robust regularization aligned with feature geometry.

Method: Introduce SAMix, an adaptive mixup strategy that leverages the geometry of the neural-collapse feature space (sphere-like arrangement of class means) to regularize training.

Result: Empirical results show SAMix outperforms SOTA continual learning methods and improves calibration across tasks.

Conclusion: SAMix provides a robust path to more reliable and accurate continual learning systems by jointly improving accuracy and calibration via geometry-aware mixup.

Abstract: While most continual learning methods focus on mitigating forgetting and
improving accuracy, they often overlook the critical aspect of network
calibration, despite its importance. Neural collapse, a phenomenon where
last-layer features collapse to their class means, has demonstrated advantages
in continual learning by reducing feature-classifier misalignment. Few works
aim to improve the calibration of continual models for more reliable
predictions. Our work goes a step further by proposing a novel method that not
only enhances calibration but also improves performance by reducing
overconfidence, mitigating forgetting, and increasing accuracy. We introduce
Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix), an adaptive mixup strategy tailored for neural
collapse-based methods. SAMix adapts the mixing process to the geometric
properties of feature spaces under neural collapse, ensuring more robust
regularization and alignment. Experiments show that SAMix significantly boosts
performance, surpassing SOTA methods in continual learning while also improving
model calibration. SAMix enhances both across-task accuracy and the broader
reliability of predictions, making it a promising advancement for robust
continual learning systems.

TL;DR: Chronos-2 is a pretrained time-series model that handles univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting in a zero-shot setting using a group attention mechanism for in-context learning, trained on synthetic data and achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To extend pretrained forecasting to multivariate and covariate-informed tasks and enable zero-shot in-context learning across related time series, addressing the limitations of univariate-focused models in real-world forecasting pipelines.

Method: Chronos-2 introduces a group attention mechanism that shares information across a group of time series (related series, multivariate variates, or targets with covariates). It is trained on synthetic datasets designed to impose diverse multivariate structures on univariate series, enabling in-context learning capabilities.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on fev-bench, GIFT-Eval, and Chronos Benchmark II, with substantial improvements in multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting. Case studies in energy and retail demonstrate practical benefits.

Conclusion: Chronos-2 presents a general-purpose forecasting model that can be used as-is in real-world pipelines, thanks to robust ICL capabilities and broad support for univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed tasks.

Abstract: Pretrained time series models have enabled inference-only forecasting systems
that produce accurate predictions without task-specific training. However,
existing approaches largely focus on univariate forecasting, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios where multivariate data and covariates
play a crucial role. We present Chronos-2, a pretrained model capable of
handling univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting tasks in
a zero-shot manner. Chronos-2 employs a group attention mechanism that
facilitates in-context learning (ICL) through efficient information sharing
across multiple time series within a group, which may represent sets of related
series, variates of a multivariate series, or targets and covariates in a
forecasting task. These general capabilities are achieved through training on
synthetic datasets that impose diverse multivariate structures on univariate
series. Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art performance across three
comprehensive benchmarks: fev-bench, GIFT-Eval, and Chronos Benchmark II. On
fev-bench, which emphasizes multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting,
Chronos-2's universal ICL capabilities lead to substantial improvements over
existing models. On tasks involving covariates, it consistently outperforms
baselines by a wide margin. Case studies in the energy and retail domains
further highlight its practical advantages. The in-context learning
capabilities of Chronos-2 establish it as a general-purpose forecasting model
that can be used "as is" in real-world forecasting pipelines.

### [225] [SNOO: Step-K Nesterov Outer Optimizer - The Surprising Effectiveness of Nesterov Momentum Applied to Pseudo-Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15830)
*Dominik Kallusky,Vinay Rao,Vishal Nandavanam,Hao-Jun Michael Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Lookahead variant, Step-K Nesterov Outer Optimizer (SNOO), improves efficiency by applying Nesterov momentum to the pseudo-gradient rather than relying on distributed averaging. It yields 1.5–2.5x compute gains in non-distributed, large-scale training, scales with model size, has minimal overhead, and is compatible with inner optimizers like AdamW and Muon.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify the actual source of DiLoCo/Lookahead gains and determine whether applying Nesterov momentum to the pseudo-gradient—rather than distributed averaging—is the key driver. The goal is to offer a practical, efficient non-distributed optimization variant that preserves benefits across inner optimizers.

Method: Introduce Step-K Nesterov Outer Optimizer (SNOO) by applying Nesterov momentum to the averaged pseudo-gradient produced by inner optimization steps in Lookahead. Evaluate in non-distributed training up to very large FLOPs (1e23), compare against baseline optimizers, and verify compatibility with sharding and inner optimizers.

Result: SNOO achieves compute factor gains of approximately 1.5–2.5× in non-distributed training up to 1e23 FLOPs, with gains increasing with model size. It has minimal compute/memory overhead and is compatible with model sharding; effective with inner optimizers such as AdamW and Muon.

Conclusion: The surprising effectiveness of DiLoCo arises mainly from applying Nesterov momentum to the pseudo-gradient. SNOO provides a practical, lightweight enhancement for Lookahead-based optimization in non-distributed large-scale training, benefiting various inner optimizers.

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has driven the demand
for more efficient optimization techniques. Among these, the Lookahead family
of optimizers employs a two-loop framework, maintaining fast and slow sets of
model weights. Multiple inner optimizer steps on the fast weights produce a
trajectory - the pseudo-gradient - that is used to update the slow weights.
DiLoCo, a notable example originally designed for distributed training, applies
Nesterov momentum to the averaged pseudo-gradient from multiple workers,
claiming to even outperform AdamW in a non-distributed setup. In this paper, we
empirically show that DiLoCo's surprising effectiveness stems primarily from
applying Nesterov momentum to the pseudo-gradient, which improves training in a
non-distributed setting. We call this Lookahead variant the Step-$K$ Nesterov
Outer Optimizer (SNOO). We demonstrate that SNOO achieves compute factor gains
of 1.5 - 2.5$\times$ in a non-distributed setting up to a scale of 1e23
training FLOPs, with improvements that increase with model size. Because of its
minimal compute and memory overhead and compatibility with model sharding, SNOO
is a practical enhancement for a variety of inner optimizers, including AdamW
and Muon.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid solver that uses duality bounds to certify when learned predictions meet a user-defined optimality threshold, defaulting to a classical solver otherwise; shows scalable speedups (>1000x) with a maximum optimality gap of 2% on large-scale transmission problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the trust issue of optimization proxies, where in-distribution queries can incur large optimality gaps, by providing interpretable, speed-optimality tradeoffs and certifiable performance guarantees.

Method: Develop a hybrid solver that leverages duality theory to bound the optimality gap of proxy predictions; fallback to a classical solver when the bound exceeds the threshold. Train proxies using a combined primal-dual objective to improve gap certification. Validate on large-scale transmission systems to demonstrate scalability and guaranteed bounds.

Result: Achieves speedups over 1000x compared to a parallelized simplex-based solver, while guaranteeing a maximum optimality gap of 2%.

Conclusion: The approach offers trustworthy, scalable optimization by combining interpretable bounds with learned proxies, enabling speed-accuracy tradeoffs that are certifiable; demonstrated effectiveness on large-scale transmission problems.

Abstract: Recent research has shown that optimization proxies can be trained to high
fidelity, achieving average optimality gaps under 1% for large-scale problems.
However, worst-case analyses show that there exist in-distribution queries that
result in orders of magnitude higher optimality gap, making it difficult to
trust the predictions in practice. This paper aims at striking a balance
between classical solvers and optimization proxies in order to enable
trustworthy deployments with interpretable speed-optimality tradeoffs based on
a user-defined optimality threshold. To this end, the paper proposes a hybrid
solver that leverages duality theory to efficiently bound the optimality gap of
predictions, falling back to a classical solver for queries where optimality
cannot be certified. To improve the achieved speedup of the hybrid solver, the
paper proposes an alternative training procedure that combines the primal and
dual proxy training. Experiments on large-scale transmission systems show that
the hybrid solver is highly scalable. The proposed hybrid solver achieves
speedups of over 1000x compared to a parallelized simplex-based solver while
guaranteeing a maximum optimality gap of 2%.

### [227] [FIDDLE: Reinforcement Learning for Quantum Fidelity Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15833)
*Hoang M. Ngo,Tamer Kahveci,My T. Thai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FMRS with FIDDLE directly maximizes process fidelity during quantum circuit routing by combining a Gaussian Process surrogate with a reinforcement learning routing optimizer, outperforming depth/gate-count-based baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantum devices are noisy; current transpilation routing often optimizes indirect metrics like depth or gate count, which do not guarantee high process fidelity. Direct fidelity optimization during routing could substantially improve circuit reliability on NISQ hardware.

Method: A two-module framework: (1) a Gaussian Process–based surrogate model to estimate process fidelity from limited training data; (2) a reinforcement learning module that searches routing options to maximize the estimated fidelity, enabling end-to-end fidelity maximization.

Result: The surrogate model yields better fidelity estimates than existing learning approaches, and the end-to-end FIDDLE framework significantly improves process fidelity across various noise models.

Conclusion: FMRS/FIDDLE introduces a novel fidelity-centric routing paradigm, achieving higher process fidelity than traditional methods and showing robustness across noise models; potential for broader applicability in transpilation pipelines.

Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields like quantum
optimization and quantum machine learning. However, current quantum devices are
hindered by noise, reducing their reliability. A key challenge in gate-based
quantum computing is improving the reliability of quantum circuits, measured by
process fidelity, during the transpilation process, particularly in the routing
stage. In this paper, we address the Fidelity Maximization in Routing Stage
(FMRS) problem by introducing FIDDLE, a novel learning framework comprising two
modules: a Gaussian Process-based surrogate model to estimate process fidelity
with limited training samples and a reinforcement learning module to optimize
routing. Our approach is the first to directly maximize process fidelity,
outperforming traditional methods that rely on indirect metrics such as circuit
depth or gate count. We rigorously evaluate FIDDLE by comparing it with
state-of-the-art fidelity estimation techniques and routing optimization
methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed surrogate model is able to
provide a better estimation on the process fidelity compared to existing
learning techniques, and our end-to-end framework significantly improves the
process fidelity of quantum circuits across various noise models.

### [228] [Transfer Orthology Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15837)
*Vikash Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRON is a neural network layer-based cross-species transfer method that uses orthology graphs to map gene-expression features across species, enabling phenotype prediction with interpretable ortholog mappings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage sparse cross-species data and functional orthology to transfer knowledge; improve cross-species predictions; provide interpretable mappings.

Method: Insert a learned linear species-conversion layer before a pre-trained FFN; layer weights are masked by the orthology biadjacency matrix; map source gene-expression space to target; train end-to-end for phenotype prediction.

Result: Proposes a method; no experimental results yet; data collection underway for validation; suggests interpretability of gene mappings as a byproduct.

Conclusion: TRON provides a biologically grounded, interpretable framework for cross-species transfer learning and may improve use of transcriptomic data; experimental validation planned.

Abstract: We present Transfer Orthology Networks (TRON), a novel neural network
architecture designed for cross-species transfer learning. TRON leverages
orthologous relationships, represented as a bipartite graph between species, to
guide knowledge transfer. Specifically, we prepend a learned species conversion
layer, whose weights are masked by the biadjacency matrix of this bipartite
graph, to a pre-trained feedforward neural network that predicts a phenotype
from gene expression data in a source species. This allows for efficient
transfer of knowledge to a target species by learning a linear transformation
that maps gene expression from the source to the target species' gene space.
The learned weights of this conversion layer offer a potential avenue for
interpreting functional orthology, providing insights into how genes across
species contribute to the phenotype of interest. TRON offers a biologically
grounded and interpretable approach to cross-species transfer learning, paving
the way for more effective utilization of available transcriptomic data. We are
in the process of collecting cross-species transcriptomic/phenotypic data to
gain experimental validation of the TRON architecture.

### [229] [Learning Correlated Reward Models: Statistical Barriers and Opportunities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15839)
*Yeshwanth Cherapanamjeri,Constantinos Daskalakis,Gabriele Farina,Sobhan Mohammadpour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pairwise data cannot identify correlations in correlated probit RUMs due to the IIA limitation; using best-of-three preference data enables efficient learning with near-optimal guarantees for the estimator; experiments on real-world datasets show improved personalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) in Random Utility Models oversimplifies human preferences, hindering accurate modeling of correlated utilities. There is a lack of statistical and computational guarantees for non-IIA models. This work investigates learning a correlated probit model and identifies data collection strategies that enable effective learning.

Method: First, prove that pairwise preference data is fundamentally insufficient to learn correlational information in a correlated probit model. Then, show that best-of-three preference data overcomes this limitation and develop a statistically and computationally efficient estimator with near-optimal performance. Provide theoretical guarantees and an algorithm, and validate on real-world datasets.

Result: The study demonstrates the insufficiency of pairwise data to recover correlational structure in correlated probit models. It introduces best-of-three data to recover the correlational information and presents an estimator with provable statistical and computational guarantees that achieves near-optimal performance. Empirical validation on real-world datasets confirms improved personalization.

Conclusion: Higher-order (best-of-three) preference data enables accurate learning of correlated utilities, addressing IIA limitations and enhancing personalization in RLHF contexts. This approach broadens the practical applicability of non-IIA Random Utility Models and suggests directions for broader RUM extensions.

Abstract: Random Utility Models (RUMs) are a classical framework for modeling user
preferences and play a key role in reward modeling for Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, a crucial shortcoming of many of these
techniques is the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption,
which collapses \emph{all} human preferences to a universal underlying utility
function, yielding a coarse approximation of the range of human preferences. On
the other hand, statistical and computational guarantees for models avoiding
this assumption are scarce. In this paper, we investigate the statistical and
computational challenges of learning a \emph{correlated} probit model, a
fundamental RUM that avoids the IIA assumption. First, we establish that the
classical data collection paradigm of pairwise preference data is
\emph{fundamentally insufficient} to learn correlational information,
explaining the lack of statistical and computational guarantees in this
setting. Next, we demonstrate that \emph{best-of-three} preference data
provably overcomes these shortcomings, and devise a statistically and
computationally efficient estimator with near-optimal performance. These
results highlight the benefits of higher-order preference data in learning
correlated utilities, allowing for more fine-grained modeling of human
preferences. Finally, we validate these theoretical guarantees on several
real-world datasets, demonstrating improved personalization of human
preferences.
