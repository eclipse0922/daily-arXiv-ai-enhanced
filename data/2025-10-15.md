### [1] [Enhancing the Quality of 3D Lunar Maps Using JAXA's Kaguya Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11817)
*Yumi Iwashita,Haakon Moe,Yang Cheng,Adnan Ansar,Georgios Georgakis,Adrian Stoica,Kazuto Nakashima,Ryo Kurazume,Jim Torresen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Enhances quality of 3D lunar maps from Kaguya Terrain Camera imagery by mitigating compression-induced disparity noise to reduce elevation errors, enabling safer lunar rover missions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a critical need for accurate 3D lunar maps for long-distance missions (e.g., a 2,000 km rover traversal in the South Pole–Aitken basin). Kaguya TC imagery is publicly available but suffers from altitude errors due to stereo matching and JPEG compression artifacts, especially in dark regions.

Method: Analyze the compression behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, identify systematic disparity noise patterns (notably in darker areas), and propose a method to reduce residual noise in disparity maps derived from compressed images to improve 3D map quality.

Result: Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach effectively reduces elevation noise in the disparity-derived 3D maps, enhancing the safety and reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

Conclusion: Mitigating compression-induced disparity noise in Kaguya TC-derived 3D maps can significantly improve the reliability of lunar terrain models, supporting long-distance lunar exploration missions.

Abstract: As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D
lunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance
missions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to
traverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain
Camera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude
inaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression
artifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps
generated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of
compression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression
behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise
patterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach
to enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images
derived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed
approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and
reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

### [2] [Data or Language Supervision: What Makes CLIP Better than DINO?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11835)
*Yiming Liu,Yuhui Zhang,Dhruba Ghosh,Ludwig Schmidt,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP's edge as a vision encoder for VLMs comes from more than just its larger training data; when controlled for architecture, dataset, and training, CLIP and DINO induce different feature preferences and yield complementary strengths in VLMs, with CLIP better for text-heavy tasks and DINO better for vision-centric tasks; language-supervision tweaks offer limited gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether CLIP's superior performance as a vision encoder in vision-language models (VLMs) is due to its language supervision signals or simply its larger training data, by isolating these factors in a controlled pretraining setup.

Method: Pre-train CLIP and DINO under identical architecture, dataset, and training configuration to achieve similar ImageNet accuracy. Compare their embeddings to assess high-level semantic content versus low-level features. Integrate both encoders into VLMs and evaluate on 20 VQA benchmarks. Explore language-supervision variants (e.g., sigmoid loss, using pretrained language encoders) to measure potential gains.

Result: Embedding analysis shows CLIP encodes high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO emphasizes low-level features like colors and styles. In VLM evaluations across 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP dominates text-intensive tasks, whereas DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric tasks. Language-supervision variants provide limited improvements.

Conclusion: The study clarifies how vision encoder design shapes VLM performance: CLIP’s strength lies in high-level semantic representation beneficial for text-heavy tasks, while DINO’s low-level feature sensitivity can complement vision-centric tasks. Language supervision tweaks offer marginal gains, guiding future VLM design toward aligning encoder inductive biases with downstream tasks.

Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for
vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage
stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To
disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings
-- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration --
achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP
captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is
more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated
into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive
tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of
language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield
limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder
design and its impact on VLM performance.

### [3] [MammoDINO: Anatomically Aware Self-Supervision for Mammographic Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11883)
*Sicheng Zhou,Lei Wu,Cao Xiao,Parminder Bhatia,Taha Kass-Hout*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MammoDINO introduces a self-supervised learning framework for mammography, pretrained on 1.4M images, with tissue-aware augmentations and cross-slice contrast leveraging 3D DBT, achieving state-of-the-art results and robust cross-dataset generalization; offers annotation-free CAD foundation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSL in medical imaging is limited by data scarcity and domain biases; there is a need for tissue-aware representation learning and 3D context integration to capture clinically meaningful features in mammography.

Method: Pretrain on 1.4M mammograms; design a breast tissue aware data augmentation sampler for image-level and patch-level supervision; use a cross-slice contrastive objective that injects 3D DBT structure into 2D pretraining.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple breast cancer screening tasks; generalizes well across five benchmark datasets; scalable, annotation-free foundation for multipurpose CAD tools; reduces radiologists' workload and improves screening efficiency.

Conclusion: MammoDINO provides a scalable SSL-based foundation for mammography by integrating tissue-aware augmentations and 3D structural information into 2D pretraining, enabling broader adoption and improved screening performance.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has transformed vision encoder training in
general domains but remains underutilized in medical imaging due to limited
data and domain specific biases. We present MammoDINO, a novel SSL framework
for mammography, pretrained on 1.4 million mammographic images. To capture
clinically meaningful features, we introduce a breast tissue aware data
augmentation sampler for both image-level and patch-level supervision and a
cross-slice contrastive learning objective that leverages 3D digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) structure into 2D pretraining. MammoDINO achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple breast cancer screening tasks and
generalizes well across five benchmark datasets. It offers a scalable,
annotation-free foundation for multipurpose computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
tools for mammogram, helping reduce radiologists' workload and improve
diagnostic efficiency in breast cancer screening.

*Blessing Agyei Kyem,Neema Jakisa Owor,Andrews Danyo,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Eugene Denteh,Tanner Muturi,Anthony Dontoh,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-model framework using VideoLLaMA for captioning and Qwen2.5-VL for VQA, trained separately to reduce task interference, achieving strong temporal reasoning and visual understanding on traffic safety videos and ranking 10th in AI City Challenge Track 2.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robust traffic safety analysis from videos by capturing fine-grained behavior and descriptions, while mitigating cross-task interference that harms captioning or VQA performance.

Method: Train two specialized models separately for captioning and VQA: VideoLLaMA handles captioning with temporal reasoning; Qwen2.5-VL handles VQA with visual understanding. Leverage their complementary strengths via task-specific optimization rather than joint training.

Result: VideoLLaMA shows strong temporal reasoning with CIDEr 1.1001; Qwen2.5-VL achieves VQA accuracy 60.80%. On the WTS dataset for the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 2, the approach attains an S2 score of 45.7572 and ranks 10th. Ablation indicates separate training beats joint training by 8.6 percentage points in VQA accuracy while preserving captioning quality.

Conclusion: Separating training for captioning and VQA reduces task interference and allows each model to specialize, yielding better VQA performance without sacrificing captioning quality, and achieving competitive leaderboard results.

Abstract: Traffic safety analysis requires complex video understanding to capture
fine-grained behavioral patterns and generate comprehensive descriptions for
accident prevention. In this work, we present a unique dual-model framework
that strategically utilizes the complementary strengths of VideoLLaMA and
Qwen2.5-VL through task-specific optimization to address this issue. The core
insight behind our approach is that separating training for captioning and
visual question answering (VQA) tasks minimizes task interference and allows
each model to specialize more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate
that VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a
CIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a
VQA accuracy of 60.80\%. Through extensive experiments on the WTS dataset, our
method achieves an S2 score of 45.7572 in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 2,
placing 10th on the challenge leaderboard. Ablation studies validate that our
separate training strategy outperforms joint training by 8.6\% in VQA accuracy
while maintaining captioning quality.

### [5] [PanoTPS-Net: Panoramic Room Layout Estimation via Thin Plate Spline Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11992)
*Hatem Ibrahem,Ahmed Salem,Qinmin Vivian Hu,Guanghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces PanoTPS-Net, a two-stage panorama-layout estimation model using CNN features to predict a TPS warp that transforms a reference layout into the target room layout, handling cuboid and non-cuboid rooms with strong 3DIoU scores across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate 3D room layout estimation from a single panorama image is challenging due to diverse layouts; existing methods struggle to generalize to non-cuboid shapes. A differentiable geometric transformation (TPS) can model non-linear deformations better than rigid/canonical mappings.

Method: Two-stage architecture: CNN extracts features and predicts Thin Plate Spline (TPS) transformation parameters; a TPS layer warps a reference layout to the desired layout; designed to work with panorama inputs to estimate both cuboid and non-cuboid layouts.

Result: Extensive experiments on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, ZInD with 3DIoU metrics of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, 91.98, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art; code released at GitHub.

Conclusion: PanoTPS-Net achieves accurate, robust room layout estimation for both cuboid and non-cuboid layouts and demonstrates effective integration of TPS with panorama imagery.

Abstract: Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer
vision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and
interior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate
room layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial
transformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages:
First, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the
input images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS
transformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to
warp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted
parameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room
layouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid
layouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation
and emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama
images. The robustness of the model in handling both cuboid and non-cuboid room
layout estimation is evident with a 3DIoU value of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and
91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets,
respectively. The source code is available at:

### [6] [Prompt-Guided Spatial Understanding with RGB-D Transformers for Fine-Grained Object Relation Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11996)
*Tanner Muturi,Blessing Agyei Kyem,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Neema Jakisa Owor,Richard Dyzinela,Andrews Danyo,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A spatial reasoning framework for warehouse-scale 3D scenes that injects bounding box coordinates into prompts, fine-tunes on four spatial tasks, and achieves 73.0606 with 4th place on the AI City Challenge public leaderboard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-scale, cluttered 3D environments demand explicit spatial grounding beyond local visual cues; current vision-language models struggle with generalization due to occlusions and geometry-aligned reasoning.

Method: Embed mask dimensions as bounding box coordinates into input prompts to enable geometry-aware reasoning; fine-tune on four task categories (Distance Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, Spatial Relation Inference) with task-specific supervision; normalize answers and append to GPT responses during training to improve consistency with evaluation; train on the Physical AI Spatial Intelligence Warehouse dataset (Track 3 of 2025 AI City Challenge).

Result: Achieves a final score of 73.0606, ranking 4th on the public leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted optimization for spatial reasoning in industrial environments.

Conclusion: Structured prompt enrichment that explicitly encodes object geometry can significantly improve spatial reasoning in large-scale, cluttered 3D environments, with strong empirical performance on industry-relevant benchmarks; future work could explore more robust geometry representations and scalability across diverse warehouse layouts.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments such as warehouses remains a
significant challenge for vision-language systems due to scene clutter,
occlusions, and the need for precise spatial understanding. Existing models
often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on
local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we
introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial
Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City
Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask
dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input
prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We
fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance
Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation
Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with
the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response
within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of
73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted
optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial
environments.

### [7] [Evaluating the Explainability of Vision Transformers in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12021)
*Leili Barekatain,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINO with Grad-CAM provides the most faithful and localized explanations for Vision Transformers across two medical imaging tasks, outperforming other ViT architectures and pre-training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical imaging benefits from interpretable AI; Vision Transformers offer strong performance but have opaque attention mechanisms, hindering clinical trust and adoption.

Method: Comparative evaluation of ViT architectures (ViT, DeiT, DINO, Swin Transformer) and pre-training strategies using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM on two tasks: peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image classification; both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessment.

Result: Grad-CAM yields class-discriminative, spatially precise heatmaps across models; Gradient Attention Rollout produces more scattered activations. DINO combined with Grad-CAM achieves the most faithful and localized explanations on both datasets, including in misclassification cases where relevant morphological features are highlighted.

Conclusion: To enhance transparency and acceptance of ViTs in clinical workflows, adopting DINO pretraining with Grad-CAM explanations is recommended, with Grad-CAM preferred over Gradient Attention Rollout for medical explanation fidelity.

Abstract: Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where
interpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision
Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges
to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision
Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and
Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct
both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks:
peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image
classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers
the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM
consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps,
while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in
misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant
morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model
transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration
of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.

### [8] [APGNet: Adaptive Prior-Guided for Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12056)
*Xinxin Huang,Han Sun,Junmin Cai,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APGNet introduces an adaptive prior-guided network for underwater camouflaged object detection, combining data augmentation, extended receptive fields, and adaptive priors to outperform 15 SOTA methods on two MAS datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater COD is hampered by image degradation (low contrast, color distortion) and natural camouflage; terrestrial COD methods and naive image enhancements fail to account for underwater optical properties.

Method: APGNet uses a Siamese architecture with a novel adaptive prior-guided mechanism. Data augmentation via MSRCR generates illumination-invariant images. An Extended Receptive Field (ERF) module plus a Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder (MPD) capture multi-scale context. Hierarchical priors are fused through spatial attention on high-level features for coarse localization and deformable convolution on low-level features to refine contours.

Result: Extensive experiments on two public MAS datasets show APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods according to standard COD metrics.

Conclusion: The adaptive prior-guided mechanism enhances robustness and accuracy for underwater COD, effectively leveraging multi-scale context and priors to improve localization and contour refinement, aiding marine ecological research.

Abstract: Detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments is crucial for
marine ecological research and resource exploration. However, existing methods
face two key challenges: underwater image degradation, including low contrast
and color distortion, and the natural camouflage of marine organisms.
Traditional image enhancement techniques struggle to restore critical features
in degraded images, while camouflaged object detection (COD) methods developed
for terrestrial scenes often fail to adapt to underwater environments due to
the lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics.
  To address these issues, we propose APGNet, an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network,
which integrates a Siamese architecture with a novel prior-guided mechanism to
enhance robustness and detection accuracy. First, we employ the Multi-Scale
Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) algorithm for data augmentation,
generating illumination-invariant images to mitigate degradation effects.
Second, we design an Extended Receptive Field (ERF) module combined with a
Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder (MPD) to capture multi-scale contextual
information and refine feature representations. Furthermore, we propose an
adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary
priors by embedding spatial attention in high-level features for coarse
localization and using deformable convolution to refine contours in low-level
features.
  Extensive experimental results on two public MAS datasets demonstrate that
our proposed method APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-art methods under widely
used evaluation metrics.

### [9] [VIDMP3: Video Editing by Representing Motion with Pose and Position Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12069)
*Sandeep Mishra,Oindrila Saha,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VidMP3 is a diffusion-based video editing approach that preserves motion while enabling flexible structural and semantic changes by learning a generalized motion representation from source videos using pose and position priors, addressing issues like temporal inconsistency and identity drift in prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for motion-preserved editing that allows structural/semantic changes without incurring temporal inconsistencies, identity drift, or requiring heavy human intervention.

Method: VidMP3 leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion representation from source videos, enabling the generation of new videos that maintain original motion while allowing structural and semantic flexibility.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that VidMP3 outperforms existing diffusion-based editing methods in maintaining motion with flexibility, reducing inconsistencies and drift.

Conclusion: The approach provides a promising solution for motion-preserved video editing, with public release of code at the authors' GitHub (https://github.com/sandeep-sm/VidMP3).

Abstract: Motion-preserved video editing is crucial for creators, particularly in
scenarios that demand flexibility in both the structure and semantics of
swapped objects. Despite its potential, this area remains underexplored.
Existing diffusion-based editing methods excel in structure-preserving tasks,
using dense guidance signals to ensure content integrity. While some recent
methods attempt to address structure-variable editing, they often suffer from
issues such as temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for
human intervention. To address these challenges, we introduce VidMP3, a novel
approach that leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion
representation from source videos. Our method enables the generation of new
videos that maintain the original motion while allowing for structural and
semantic flexibility. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate
the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/sandeep-sm/VidMP3.

*Aashish Dhawan,Divyanshu Mudgal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A survey of domain adaptation methods to address labeled-data scarcity in image classification, highlighting cross-domain knowledge transfer (e.g., training on paintings to predict real images).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lack and high cost of labeled data; need reliable cross-domain transfer methods to achieve benchmark performance.

Method: Discusses domain adaptation and various implementation methods; presents the idea of training on one dataset and predicting on data from a different domain as a cross-domain transfer example.

Result: Not reported in the abstract; no empirical results are described.

Conclusion: Domain adaptation is a viable approach to improve cross-domain performance under data scarcity; cross-domain transfer (e.g., paintings to real images) illustrates the concept.

Abstract: The major challenge in today's computer vision scenario is the availability
of good quality labeled data. In a field of study like image classification,
where data is of utmost importance, we need to find more reliable methods which
can overcome the scarcity of data to produce results comparable to previous
benchmark results. In most cases, obtaining labeled data is very difficult
because of the high cost of human labor and in some cases impossible. The
purpose of this paper is to discuss Domain Adaptation and various methods to
implement it. The main idea is to use a model trained on a particular dataset
to predict on data from a different domain of the same kind, for example - a
model trained on paintings of airplanes predicting on real images of airplanes

Result: Experimental results show state-of-the-art or superior performance in quality and temporal coherence, enabling high-quality, temporally coherent, multi-character audio-driven video generation in a simple, efficient, and cost-effective manner.

Conclusion: The proposed DiT framework with Mask-CFG provides scalable, efficient, and versatile solutions for long-, multi-character, audio-driven video generation without extensive retraining or dataset requirements.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved audio-driven
human video generation, surpassing traditional methods in both quality and
controllability. However, existing approaches still face challenges in lip-sync
accuracy, temporal coherence for long video generation, and multi-character
animation. In this work, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based
framework for generating lifelike talking videos of arbitrary length, and
introduce a training-free method for multi-character audio-driven animation.
First, we employ a LoRA-based training strategy combined with a position shift
inference approach, which enables efficient long video generation while
preserving the capabilities of the foundation model. Moreover, we combine
partial parameter updates with reward feedback to enhance both lip
synchronization and natural body motion. Finally, we propose a training-free
approach, Mask Classifier-Free Guidance (Mask-CFG), for multi-character
animation, which requires no specialized datasets or model modifications and
supports audio-driven animation for three or more characters. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving high-quality, temporally coherent, and multi-character
audio-driven video generation in a simple, efficient, and cost-effective
manner.

### [13] [An Adaptive Edge-Guided Dual-Network Framework for Fast QR Code Motion Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12098)
*Jianping Li,Dongyang Guo,Wenjie Li,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB) embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer for QR code deblurring, enabling an adaptive pair of networks (EG-Restormer and LENet) within ADNet to maximize decoding reliability on mobile devices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: QR codes require reliable decoding under blur; general deblurring prioritizes perceptual quality, but decodability is paramount. QR codes have highly structured, edge-rich patterns that present a strong prior for restoration, which current DL methods underutilize.

Method: Introduce EGAB to encode explicit edge priors inside a Transformer. Build EG-Restormer for severe blur, LENet for mild blur, and ADNet to adaptively select between them based on input blur severity, enabling efficient mobile deployment.

Result: EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve state-of-the-art decoding success rates on severely blurred QR codes with competitive inference speed; LENet provides fast deblurring for milder blur, and ADNet dynamically balances accuracy and efficiency on resource-constrained devices.

Conclusion: Explicit edge priors can significantly improve QR-code-specific deblurring outcomes. The adaptive dual-network design offers strong decodability with favorable performance trade-offs, making it practical for mobile QR code scanning under varying blur conditions.

Abstract: Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code
deblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized
by highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration.
Yet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To
address this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which
embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we
develop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that
significantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly
blurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for
fast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive
Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on
input blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.
Extensive experiments show that our EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve
state-of-the-art performance with a competitive speed. Project page:

### [14] [G4Splat: Geometry-Guided Gaussian Splatting with Generative Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12099)
*Junfeng Ni,Yixin Chen,Zhifei Yang,Yu Liu,Ruijie Lu,Song-Chun Zhu,Siyuan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based 3D scene reconstruction method that uses planar-geometry guided, metric-scale depth supervision to improve both observed and unobserved regions, and enforces multi-view consistency during inpainting with video diffusion models; achieves superior geometry and appearance, and generalizes to single-view and unposed videos across indoor/outdoor scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-prior based 3D reconstruction suffers from weak geometric supervision and multi-view inconsistencies, leading to poor reconstruction, especially in unobserved areas.

Method: Derive metric-scale depth maps from prevalent planar structures to provide supervision across observed/unobserved regions; integrate geometry guidance into the pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, novel view selection, and multi-view consistency during video diffusion-based inpainting; supports single-view inputs and unposed videos; generalizes across indoor/outdoor.

Result: Empirical evaluation on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending shows consistent improvements over baselines in geometry and appearance, especially in unobserved regions; the method supports single-view inputs and unposed videos with strong generalization.

Conclusion: Accurate geometry is a prerequisite for effectively leveraging generative priors in 3D reconstruction; leveraging planar-structure guided depth enables reliable supervision and consistency across views, yielding accurate and consistent scene completion; demonstrates broad applicability and generalization.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained
diffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two
critical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision,
they struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions,
let alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to
mitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe
shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we
identify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively
exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first
propose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate
metric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and
unobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance
throughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide
novel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with
video diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion.
Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our
method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and
appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our
method naturally supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, with strong
generalizability in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world
applicability. The project page is available at

### [15] [DRL: Discriminative Representation Learning with Parallel Adapters for Class Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12107)
*Jiawei Zhan,Jun Liu,Jinlong Peng,Xiaochen Chen,Bin-Bin Gao,Yong Liu,Chengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A DRL framework for non-rehearsal class-incremental learning using Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA) and Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS) to achieve smooth representational drift, scalable efficiency, and cross-stage discriminative alignment, outperforming SOTA on six benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address three core challenges in non-rehearsal CIL: increasing model complexity, non-smooth representation shift across increments, and misalignment between stage-wise optimization and global inference.

Method: Introduce Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA) built on a pretrained transformer model, adding lightweight adapters per increment with a transfer gate to propagate representation; propose Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS) to decouple positive/negative constraints using a virtual anchor to align features across stages.

Result: Empirical results on six benchmarks show DRL outperforms state-of-the-art methods throughout the CIL process while maintaining efficiency in training and inference.

Conclusion: DRL provides a scalable, efficient, and discriminative framework for non-rehearsal CIL by ensuring smooth representation shifts (IPA) and cross-stage discriminative alignment (DAS), addressing core challenges and improving performance.

Abstract: With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs),
remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning
(CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three
conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation
shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise
sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the
Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address
these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet
efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)
network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a
lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each
incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new
classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the
current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a
result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different
incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable
comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the
Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and
negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This
decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the
feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between
stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across
all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire
CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference
phases.

### [16] [Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion Model for Old-Photo Face Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12114)
*Wenjie Li,Xiangyi Wang,Heng Guo,Guangwei Gao,Zhanyu Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff) uses pseudo-reference faces from a pretrained diffusion model to guide region-specific restoration of degraded old photos, with structural guidance throughout and color refinement later, plus parsing/scratch masks for selective restoration; introduces VintageFace benchmark; achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and regional controllability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Old photos suffer from breakage, fading, and blur; existing diffusion/GAN methods rely on global priors and struggle with localized artifacts and color; need region-aware, self-supervised restoration without identity drift.

Method: SSDiff constructs pseudo-labels via a pretrained diffusion model under weak guidance; applies structural guidance during denoising and color refinement in later steps in a coarse-to-fine diffusion process; uses face parsing maps and scratch masks to selectively restore breakage regions and avoid identity mismatch.

Result: SSDiff outperforms GAN-based and diffusion-based baselines on perceptual quality, fidelity, and regional controllability; demonstrated on VintageFace (300 real old-face photos) with a code release.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised, region-aware diffusion framework effectively restores degraded old-face images, offering improved quality and controllability, and providing a new benchmark for the task.

Abstract: Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded
degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained
diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global
statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We
propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages
pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak
guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural
colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural
guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later
steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating
face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage
regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a
300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels.
SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual
quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link:

### [17] [ImageSentinel: Protecting Visual Datasets from Unauthorized Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12119)
*Ziyuan Luo,Yangyi Zhao,Ka Chun Cheung,Simon See,Renjie Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageSentinel introduces sentinel images to protect datasets in Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) by embedding retrieval keys (random character sequences) into sentinel visuals via vision-language models; it enables detection of unauthorized use while preserving authorized generation quality, with open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAIG enables high-quality image generation using external datasets, raising privacy and misuse concerns for private image collections. Traditional watermarking is insufficient because RAIG's complex feature extraction and recombination can erase or ignore embedded watermarks.

Method: Synthesize sentinel images that are visually consistent with the original dataset using vision-language models. Each sentinel carries a retrieval key realized as a randomly generated character sequence. Protection is verified by detecting the presence of the key and sentinel in outputs or related features, enabling unauthorized-use detection while preserving generation quality for authorized tasks.

Result: Experiments demonstrate that ImageSentinel effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation quality for authorized applications.

Conclusion: ImageSentinel offers a practical defense for dataset owners in RAIG, integrating with existing workflows and preserving usability; code is released for adoption.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) has
raised significant concerns about the unauthorized use of private image
datasets. While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing
generation quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from
unauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional
digital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the
complex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve
watermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose
ImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our
framework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the
original dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through
randomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure
seamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the
sentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel
effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation
quality for authorized applications. Code is available at

### [18] [Hardware-aware Coding Function Design for Compressive Single-Photon 3D Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12123)
*David Parra,Felipe Gutierrez-Barragan,Trevor Seets,Andreas Velten*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hardware-aware optimization framework for compressive single-photon 3D imaging that jointly designs illumination and coding matrices under bandwidth and peak-power constraints, yielding better performance than traditional codes, even with non-ideal impulse responses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world SPAD/time-of-flight cameras face data-rate and power limits; compressive histograms help but suffer under hardware constraints; need practical coding designs that respect these limits.

Method: Constrained optimization using gradient descent to jointly optimize illumination and coding matrix (coding functions) with hardware constraints; evaluate on simulations and a real system with non-ideal impulse response.

Result: Proposed coding functions outperform traditional designs under both bandwidth and peak-power constraints, with the gain more pronounced under peak-power limits; demonstrates adaptability to non-ideal impulse responses in a real system.

Conclusion: The approach yields practical, hardware-aware coding strategies for compressive single-photon 3D imaging and is adaptable to arbitrary impulse responses, helping bridge theory and hardware realities.

Abstract: Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D
imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution.
However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as
system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory
and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a
solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression
of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited
in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected
to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a
constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for
compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly
optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that
adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our
coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both
bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced
in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts
to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world
system with a non-ideal impulse response function.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CapFlow enables cost-efficient open-source visual captioning that matches GPT-4.1-quality captions across domains, enabling scalable data synthesis and via fine-tuning yields MetaCaptioner, a strong open-source generalist captioner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a large performance gap between open-source and commercial generalist visual captioning models, hindering applications such as data synthesis. The work aims to close this gap by leveraging collaborative work flows among open-source models.

Method: CapFlow is a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow that uses open-source models to synthesize high-quality captions. The system serves as a data synthesizer to produce captions for images and videos, and a subsequent fine-tuning step yields MetaCaptioner, a generalist visual captioner.

Result: CapFlow enables GPT-4.1-level caption quality across domains with an 89.5% cost reduction. MetaCaptioner achieves comparable captioning capability to commercial models and attains top-tier multimodal performance within the open-source community.

Conclusion: CapFlow and MetaCaptioner offer a strong, cost-effective solution for generalist visual captioning, with potential to accelerate multimodal research by providing accessible high-quality data synthesis and models.

Abstract: Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description
task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and
handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models
present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various
applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes
CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for
the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to
achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5%
reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce
high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain
a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through
extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable
captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier
multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and
MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and
cost-effective visual captioning solution.

### [20] [FedHUG: Federated Heterogeneous Unsupervised Generalization for Remote Physiological Measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12132)
*Xiao Yang,Jiyao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A federated unsupervised domain generalization (FUDG) approach, FedHUG, enables privacy-preserving update of remote physiological estimation models using unlabeled data. It introduces two components to handle heterogeneity and label skew across clients and domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Remote physiological measurement raises privacy concerns and often lacks labeled data for real-world deployment. There is a need to update deployed models with unlabeled, diverse data across multiple domains while mitigating non-IID feature distributions and label distribution skew.

Method: Proposes FUDG protocol and the FedHUG framework. FedHUG includes (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation, which dynamically adjusts aggregation weights using prior-driven bias evaluation to address heterogeneous non-IID features from multiple domains, and (2) Global Distribution-aware Learning Controller, which parameterizes the label distribution and guides client-specific training strategies to reduce server-client label skew and long-tail issues.

Result: The approach demonstrates superior performance against state-of-the-art methods in estimation accuracy for remote physiological sensing data, applicable to both RGB video and mmWave radar modalities; code will be released.

Conclusion: FUDG and FedHUG effectively address privacy-preserving federated unsupervised domain generalization for remote physiological measurement, handling non-IID feature heterogeneity and label distribution skew, with demonstrated cross-domain effectiveness across modalities and potential for practical deployment.

Abstract: Remote physiological measurement gained wide attention, while it requires
collecting users' privacy-sensitive information, and existing contactless
measurements still rely on labeled client data. This presents challenges when
we want to further update real-world deployed models with numerous user data
lacking labels. To resolve these challenges, we instantiate a new protocol
called Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization (FUDG) in this work.
Subsequently, the \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{H}eterogeneous
\textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{G}eneralization (\textbf{FedHUG}) framework is
proposed and consists of: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module dynamically
adjusts aggregation weights based on prior-driven bias evaluation to cope with
heterogeneous non-IID features from multiple domains. (2) The Global
Distribution-aware Learning Controller parameterizes the label distribution and
dynamically manipulates client-specific training strategies, thereby mitigating
the server-client label distribution skew and long-tail issue. The proposal
shows superior performance across state-of-the-art techniques in estimation
with either RGB video or mmWave radar. The code will be released.

### [21] [Class-aware Domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission for Continual Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12150)
*Jiahuan Zhou,Chao Zhu,Zhenyu Cui,Zichen Liu,Xu Zou,Gang Hua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A continual test-time adaptation method (KFF) that uses class-aware domain knowledge fission and fusion to adapt to streaming domains, mitigating forgetting and negative transfer while maintaining efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CTTA struggles with catastrophic forgetting and insufficient learning due to large domain gaps; there is a need to dynamically manage class-aware knowledge across domains without storing all past data.

Method: Introduce KFF with two modules: KFI (domain knowledge fission) to separate new domain knowledge into a class-aware domain prompt pool; KFU (domain knowledge fusion) to merge this knowledge back into the pool using a greedy strategy, reducing computation and storage.

Result: Empirical validation on ImageNet-C shows competitive or superior performance to baselines/other CTTA methods, demonstrating effective handling of domain shifts and knowledge management.

Conclusion: KFF enables adaptive accumulation of discriminative historical knowledge while accommodating new knowledge, offering a scalable, efficient approach to continual test-time adaptation under domain drift.

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model
during the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream
domain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end,
existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of
historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by
restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these
methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new
knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge,
resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a
class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time
adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain
knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different
domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically
accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming
data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively
separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool,
alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are
distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation
and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain
Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new
knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy
knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of
new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed
method against other methods.

### [22] [DPL: Spatial-Conditioned Diffusion Prototype Enhancement for One-Shot Medical Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12159)
*Ziyuan Gao,Philippe Morel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based approach (DPL) reframes one-shot medical image segmentation prototypes as learnable distributions and uses forward-reverse diffusion to generate diverse, coherent variant prototypes from limited labeled data, improving robustness to anatomical variability and achieving state-of-the-art results on abdominal MRI/CT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: One-shot medical image segmentation is hampered by limited annotated data and large anatomical variability across patients. Traditional prototype averaging yields brittle, less diverse representations that hurt generalization. A probabilistic, diffusion-guided prototype that captures intra-class diversity can improve robustness.

Method: DPL constructs prototypes as learnable probability distributions and uses a diffusion-based prototype enhancement module to transform single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via forward-reverse diffusion. It includes a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism using prototype feature statistics and a conservative fusion strategy to balance fidelity and diversity. The same diffusion-enhancement and fusion pipeline is used during training and inference to ensure consistency, with diffusion acting as a regularizer.

Result: Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets show significant improvements and establish new state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

Conclusion: Diffusion-based prototype learning effectively captures intra-class diversity while preserving prototype fidelity, serving as a regularizing mechanism that improves robustness and generalization in one-shot medical image segmentation across modalities.

Abstract: One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype
representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical
variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on
deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations
that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.
This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that
reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space
exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability
distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically
coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates
through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement
module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via
forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism
that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,
and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while
maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference
consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both
phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final
representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself
acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets
demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new
state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

### [23] [State Space Prompting via Gathering and Spreading Spatio-Temporal Information for Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12160)
*Jiahuan Zhou,Kai Zhu,Zhenyu Cui,Zichen Liu,Xu Zou,Gang Hua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes State Space Prompting (SSP) to enhance video understanding by injecting intra-frame and inter-frame prompts into pre-trained state-space models, improving spatiotemporal information propagation and achieving 2.76% average gain with fewer tunable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pre-trained state-space video models compress visual tokens sequentially, which loses spatial and temporal context. This limits the propagation of spatial information within frames and temporal information across frames.

Method: Introduce two modules: Intra-Frame Gathering (IFG) to aggregate spatial information within each frame, and Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) to propagate discriminative spatio-temporal information across frames. The SSP prompts balance and compress key information within and between frames and are integrated into the state-space model to enable efficient fine-tuning.

Result: Extensive experiments on four video benchmark datasets show that SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by 2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

Conclusion: SSP provides complementary propagation of spatial and temporal information in videos, enabling effective adaptation of pre-trained state-space models to video understanding with fewer trainable parameters.

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video
classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with
linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data
while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to
downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream
task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the
sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and
temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective
propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal
information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of
discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State
Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines
intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key
spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering
(IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each
frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread
discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By
adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and
between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in
videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark
datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by
2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniGS presents a unified, differentiable 3D Gaussian Splatting framework for multimodal high-fidelity 3D reconstruction, featuring a CUDA-based rasterization pipeline, differentiable depth via ray-ellipsoid intersection, analytic normal gradients, and learnable Gaussian pruning to enable efficient, geometry-consistent optimization across RGB, depth, normals, and semantics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper seeks a single, differentiable, geometry-aware representation to jointly reconstruct high-quality RGB, depth, normals, and semantic labels, addressing limitations in modality-specific or non-differentiable pipelines and enabling effective optimization of rotation/scale through analytic gradients.

Method: Introduce UniGS, a unified map representation based on 3D Gaussian splatting with a CUDA-accelerated rasterization pipeline. Redesign depth rendering using differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection for accurate geometric gradients. Provide analytic gradient formulation for surface normal rendering to enforce geometric consistency. Include a learnable pruning attribute to selectively remove Gaussians with minimal contribution, improving efficiency and storage.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative experiments show state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy across all modalities (RGB, depth, normals, semantics), validating the geometry-aware approach. The framework supports photo-realistic rendering, accurate depth, consistent normals, and semantic logits with improved efficiency; source code and multimodal viewer are planned for release on GitHub.

Conclusion: UniGS delivers a geometry-aware, unified, differentiable framework for multimodal 3D reconstruction that achieves state-of-the-art results across modalities, while offering computational efficiency through CUDA-accelerated rendering and learnable pruning, with code and viewer forthcoming on GitHub.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniGS, a unified map representation and
differentiable framework for high-fidelity multimodal 3D reconstruction based
on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our framework integrates a CUDA-accelerated
rasterization pipeline capable of rendering photo-realistic RGB images,
geometrically accurate depth maps, consistent surface normals, and semantic
logits simultaneously. We redesign the rasterization to render depth via
differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection rather than using Gaussian centers,
enabling effective optimization of rotation and scale attribute through
analytic depth gradients. Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient
formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency among
reconstructed 3D scenes. To improve computational and storage efficiency, we
introduce a learnable attribute that enables differentiable pruning of
Gaussians with minimal contribution during training. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
across all modalities, validating the efficacy of our geometry-aware paradigm.
Source code and multimodal viewer will be available on GitHub.

### [25] [BEEP3D: Box-Supervised End-to-End Pseudo-Mask Generation for 3D Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12182)
*Youngju Yoo,Seho Kim,Changick Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEEP3D is a box-supervised 3D instance segmentation framework with end-to-end pseudo-mask generation using a student-teacher EMA, instance-center query refinement, and two novel losses, achieving competitive efficiency and performance on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce annotation cost of 3D instance segmentation by shifting from dense point-level labels to box-level annotations, while addressing intrinsic box-induced ambiguity and avoiding two-stage pseudo-labelers that slow training.

Method: A student-teacher (EMA) framework where the teacher acts as a pseudo-labeler. An instance center-based query refinement guides the teacher to produce precise pseudo-masks by focusing queries near instance centers and leveraging nearby features. Two losses—query consistency loss and masked feature consistency loss—align semantic and geometric signals between predictions and pseudo-masks within an end-to-end training pipeline.

Result: Experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS show competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods, with improved computational efficiency and end-to-end trainability.

Conclusion: Box supervision can yield effective 3D instance segmentation via end-to-end pseudo-mask generation, reducing annotation cost and training complexity without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is crucial for understanding complex 3D
environments, yet fully supervised methods require dense point-level
annotations, resulting in substantial annotation costs and labor overhead. To
mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more
scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce
ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment
challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks
through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage.
However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and
complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we
propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance
segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher
model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an
Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate
precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement
that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance
centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and
masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between
predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS
datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining
computationally efficient.

*Jiwan Kim,Kibum Kim,Sangwoo Seo,Chanyoung Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompoDistill introduces a knowledge distillation framework that explicitly aligns the student model's visual attention with the teacher's to boost compositional visual reasoning in Multimodal LLMs, while preserving VQA performance and generalizing to stronger backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KD methods for Multimodal LLMs struggle to transfer rich visual perception because of visual attention misalignment between teacher and student, limiting compositional reasoning abilities.

Method: Propose CompoDistill, a KD framework that explicitly aligns the student’s visual attention with the teacher’s (e.g., via attention-level distillation or alignment losses), with a focus on enhancing compositional reasoning tasks.

Result: Empirical results show notable improvements on compositional reasoning tasks requiring visual perception, while maintaining strong VQA performance; the method also works with more advanced backbone architectures, indicating good generalizability.

Conclusion: Aligning visual attention during KD is an effective mechanism to transfer the teacher’s visual perception to the student in MLLMs, enabling better compositional reasoning without sacrificing existing capabilities.

Abstract: Recently, efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained
significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity,
making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the
knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative,
which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model
(teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD
methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual
perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify
visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of
this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD
framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of
the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive
experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on
compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while
maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in
existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a
more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.

Motivation: Address the gap in autonomous driving safety under out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios by producing human-interpretable incident reports beyond closed taxonomies, enabling better hazard understanding and accident analysis.

Method: A hierarchical framework that (1) captions individual frames, (2) detects incident frames, and (3) performs fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models; uses model ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring protocol to select high-quality outputs.

Result: On the 2COOOL leaderboard, the method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best CIDEr-D score, delivering accurate and coherent incident narratives.

Conclusion: Hierarchical reasoning with vision-language models is a promising direction for safety-critical traffic-event understanding and incident analysis; the work provides a reproducible pipeline with code availability.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving have been enabled by
training on diverse large-scale driving datasets, yet autonomous driving models
still struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The COOOL benchmark
targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies,
and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident
reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report
generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident
frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models
(VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model
ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL
open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best
CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These
results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction
for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic
events. The implementation and code are available at

*Muammer Bay,Timo von Marcard,Dren Fazlija*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Synthetic data can augment real data for warehouse pallet detection; a balanced mix of synthetic and real data improves robustness of object detection more than real data alone, validated using NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator; domain transfer to real-world scenarios is demonstrated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce reliance on costly, domain-specific real data and expert resources; enable effective fine-tuning of general-purpose models for logistics applications by leveraging synthetic data.

Method: Experiments on pallet detection in warehouse environments using real data and multiple synthetic data generation strategies via NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator; compare real-only, synthetic-only, and mixed datasets; evaluate object detection performance on real-world scenarios.

Result: Findings suggest that a balanced integration of synthetic and real data can yield robust and efficient object detection models in warehouse logistics; purely synthetic data can help but is most effective when combined with real data.

Conclusion: Synthetic data is a practical, cost-efficient complement to real-world data for CV in logistics; adopting mixed data regimes with synthetic generation techniques can improve model robustness and efficiency in real-world deployment.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer
new opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics
and manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of
expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models.
Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning,
which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning
is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This
work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object
detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only,
specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined
the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator
tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios.
It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting,
utilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic
image data in computer vision, suggesting that a balanced integration of
synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection
models.

### [29] [DIANet: A Phase-Aware Dual-Stream Network for Micro-Expression Recognition via Dynamic Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12219)
*Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Luu Tu Nguyen,Thi Bich Phuong Man,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-stream, phase-aware dynamic-image framework (DIANet) for micro-expression recognition that separately models onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset phases with cross-attention fusion, achieving state-of-the-art results on benchmark MER datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-expressions are extremely brief and subtle, making recognition challenging; traditional dynamic-image representations collapse temporal cues and ignore phase-specific information. Capturing distinct temporal phases can improve discriminative power.

Method: Two dedicated DI streams encode onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset phases. Each stream uses its own CNN to extract phase-specific features. A cross-attention fusion module adaptively combines features from both streams based on context. Evaluations are performed on CASME-II, SAMM, and MMEW datasets.

Result: DIANet consistently outperforms single-phase DI-based methods across three benchmark MER datasets, demonstrating the importance of explicit temporal-phase modeling for MER.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling and fusing phase-specific temporal information enhances MER performance; the phase-aware DI approach is a promising direction for advancing micro-expression recognition.

Abstract: Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last
less than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately
recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression
recognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient
nature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While
dynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal
motion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the
distinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a
micro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel
dual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one
encoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset
phase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network,
and a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate
features from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive
experiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and
MMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
conventional single-phase DI-based approaches. The results highlight the
importance of modeling temporal phase information explicitly and suggest a
promising direction for advancing MER.

### [30] [CoIRL-AD: Collaborative-Competitive Imitation-Reinforcement Learning in Latent World Models for Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12560)
*Xiaoji Zheng,Ziyuan Yang,Yanhao Chen,Yuhang Peng,Yuanrong Tang,Gengyuan Liu,Bokui Chen,Jiangtao Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A competitive dual-policy framework (CoIRL-AD) enables IL and RL agents to interact during training, improving generalization and reducing collisions in end-to-end autonomous driving, outperforming baselines on nuScenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imitation learning (IL) alone often fails to generalize to new scenarios, while reinforcement learning (RL) promotes exploration but suffers from sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A framework that combines IL and RL with interaction can leverage the strengths of both while mitigating their weaknesses.

Method: CoIRL-AD introduces a competitive dual-policy framework where IL and RL agents train concurrently and exchange knowledge via a competition-based mechanism designed to prevent gradient conflicts, enabling complementary learning without destructive interference.

Result: Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines, with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail scenarios.

Conclusion: CoIRL-AD demonstrates that a competitive dual-policy approach can effectively fuse IL and RL for end-to-end autonomous driving, addressing gradient conflict and generalization challenges, with publicly available code.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning
(IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning
(RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such
as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to
combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL
pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive
dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during
training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates
knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the
nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines,
along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail
scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/SEU-zxj/CoIRL-AD.

*Hritik Bansal,Devandra Singh Sachan,Kai-Wei Chang,Aditya Grover,Gargi Ghosh,Wen-tau Yih,Ramakanth Pasunuru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Data-curation strategies and scaling dramatically boost vision-language reasoning; HoneyBee—an extensive CoT dataset (~2.5M examples, 350K image-question pairs)—achieves SOTA gains across model sizes; a test-time scaling method reduces decoding cost ~73% without accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VL reasoning models' capabilities hinge on training data quality and construction; understanding how context sources and data interventions affect performance can guide scalable, efficient dataset design.

Method: Systematic study of context/source strategies for image-question pairs; implement targeted data interventions (e.g., image-caption auxiliary signals, inclusion of text-only reasoning); scale data dimensions (images, questions, and CoTs); construct HoneyBee dataset (~2.5M CoT examples with 350K image-question pairs); propose a test-time decoding scaling strategy.

Result: Found that (a) context-source strategies markedly affect VLM performance; (b) auxiliary signals from image captions and text-only reasoning yield substantial gains; (c) scaling all data dimensions yields consistent improvements. HoneyBee-trained VLMs outperform SOTA models across sizes (e.g., a 3B-param model outperforms both the SOTA and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8% on MathVerse). A test-time scaling strategy reduces decoding cost by 73% without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: Careful data-curation and scaling are powerful levers for VL reasoning; HoneyBee demonstrates strong performance gains and cost-efficient inference, highlighting data-centric avenues for future VL reasoning research.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly
effective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the
construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly
understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and
study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling
training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and
question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore
scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our
findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM
performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions
and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c)
scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs
per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated
by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT
reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs
trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes.
For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA
model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse.
Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost
by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved
strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes EReLiFM for Open-Set Domain Generalization with noisy labels, featuring unsupervised evidential loss clustering and residual flow meta-learning to achieve state-of-the-art performance on OSDG-NL; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle label noise in Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) and limited clean data, by improving label reliability and enabling robust, uncertainty-aware transfer across domains and categories.

Method: Introduce a two-stage evidential loss clustering to promote label reliability; employ a residual flow matching mechanism to model structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals for diverse transfer paths; use meta-learning where clean-set updates aim to decrease loss on noisy data, supervised by pseudo labels from the most confident predictions.

Result: Empirical results show EReLiFM achieves state-of-the-art performance on OSDG with noisy labels (OSDG-NL) relative to existing methods.

Conclusion: EReLiFM effectively improves label reliability awareness and robust transfer in OSDG-NL via evidential clustering and residual-flow meta-learning, offering a strong, open-source solution.

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to
recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world
applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting
source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject
unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL)
using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain
gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose
Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first
introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to
promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching
mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals,
enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond
interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model
is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss
decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident
predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM
outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. The source code is available at

*Victor Besnier,David Hurych,Andrei Bursuc,Eduardo Valle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-correcting, iterative refinement approach for parallel-token image/video generation; injects random tokens during training to enable backtracking and token fixing, preserving speed while improving quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce inference cost in auto-regressive, multi-token-per-step models while maintaining generation fidelity. Parallel token prediction risks inconsistent outputs due to unseen joint dependencies; a backtracking/refinement mechanism is needed.

Method: Introduce a training scheme that injects random tokens into the context to teach the model to fix tokens during sampling. Use iterative refinement where sampled tokens are updated to correct errors, preserving the efficiency of parallel token prediction.

Result: Demonstrates substantial improvements in generation quality for both image and video tasks while maintaining the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction (evaluated on ImageNet-256, CIFAR-10, UCF-101, NuScenes).

Conclusion: Self-correcting iterative refinement with token-context perturbation is a viable approach to combine speed from parallel token prediction with higher fidelity in image and video generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant
interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is
improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps
directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing
fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining
auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step,
reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting
multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to
token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during
training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is
no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method
for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We
achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the
context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our
method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while
significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image
generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video
generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements
across both modalities.

*Yuehui Li,Yahao Lu,Haoyuan Wu,Sen Zhang,Liang Lin,Yukai Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cross-domain, noise-robust infrared small target detector (Ivan-ISTD) using wavelet-guided synthesis and real-noise invariance learning, plus a dynamic cross-domain benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ISTD tasks face domain shift and heteroscedastic noise; conventional methods struggle with real-world distribution changes. A framework that both aligns domains and learns noise invariance is needed for robust ISTD.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis to create training samples aligned with the target domain via multi-frequency wavelet filtering; (2) Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning that builds a dynamic noise library from real target-domain noise and uses self-supervised loss to enforce noise invariance. Also introduces Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark to simulate cross-domain degradation and validates on additional real-world datasets.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple quantitative metrics, showing strong robustness in cross-domain scenarios. Code is available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: Ivan-ISTD effectively mitigates domain shift and noise perturbations in ISTD and offers a versatile benchmark for cross-domain robustness in infrared small target detection.

Abstract: In the multimedia domain, Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) plays a
important role in drone-based multi-modality sensing. To address the dual
challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in
ISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning
framework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned
with the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis. This
wavelet-guided alignment machine accurately separates the target background
through multi-frequency wavelet filtering. In the second stage, we introduce
Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise
characteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library. The
model learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss, thereby overcoming
the limitations of distribution bias in traditional artificial noise modeling.
Finally, we create the Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark, a cross-domain dynamic
degradation dataset that simulates the distribution shifts encountered in
real-world applications. Additionally, we validate the versatility of our
method using other real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of many
quantitative metrics. In particular, Ivan-ISTD demonstrates excellent
robustness in cross-domain scenarios. The code for this work can be found at:

*Ye Chen,Liming Tan,Yupeng Zhu,Yuanbin Wang,Bingbing Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A spatio-temporally consistent proxy-node representation is proposed for video, using hierarchical proxy nodes that dynamically update with priors, enabling stable multi-scale object representations and editing with fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video representations rely on unstable pixel-level matching and tracking; small tracking errors cause collapse, occlusions and large motions degrade representations. A robust, multi-scale, temporally aware representation is needed for reliability and editability.

Method: Introduce hierarchical proxy nodes to represent objects/scenes with stable multi-scale structure; implement a dynamic update mechanism that leverages spatio-temporal priors to mitigate tracker inaccuracies; decouple shape and texture encodings across objects to enable controllable appearance editing; demonstrate on video reconstruction, in-painting, and keyframe-based editing.

Result: Achieves high video reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex tasks such as video in-painting and temporally consistent video editing by leveraging stable proxy-node representations.

Conclusion: Proxy-node representation provides robust, scalable video representations that resist tracking errors, occlusions, and drastic motions, while enabling fine-grained editing of appearance and structure.

Abstract: Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained
priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching
and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse
of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion
frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability,
this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent
dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the
hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale
structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking
error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand,
the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately
leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of
inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and
objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture
representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates
controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video
reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video
processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally
consistent video editing.

### [36] [Multiplicative Loss for Enhancing Semantic Segmentation in Medical and Cellular Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12258)
*Yuto Yokoi,Kazuhiro Hotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two new loss functions for semantic segmentation in medical/cellular imaging: Multiplicative Loss (product of Cross Entropy and Dice) and Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss (adds confidence-based exponential scaling). They aim to be hyperparameter-free and robust under data scarcity, outperforming additive losses and existing losses on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity in medical and cellular segmentation; hyperparameter sensitivity of additive Cross Entropy + Dice; need robust training objectives that stabilize optimization with limited annotations.

Method: Introduce Multiplicative Loss, defined as the product of Cross Entropy and Dice losses, to dynamically modulate gradients by prediction confidence. Then propose Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss with confidence-driven exponential scaling (inspired by Focal Loss) that uses predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples, aiming to strengthen gradients when confidence is low.

Result: Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation benchmarks show the proposed losses consistently outperform tuned additive losses and existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

Conclusion: Multiplicative Loss and Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss provide simple, effective, hyperparameter-free approaches for robust segmentation in data-scarce medical and cellular imaging settings.

Abstract: We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and
Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical
and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used,
their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs
suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data
scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and
efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy
and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on
prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions
and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing
optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies
a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating
predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.
This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients
when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation
benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and
existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free
mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

*Jinlun Ye,Zhuohao Sun,Yiqiao Qiu,Qiu Li,Zhijun Tan,Ruixuan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel OOD detection method uses local background features extracted from in-distribution images as fake OOD signals during training to reduce overconfidence, achieving state-of-the-art results and compatibility with post-hoc methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD detection is essential for reliable deployment; existing strategies relying on external OOD data or synthetic images incur high data and training costs; a lightweight training-time alternative is needed.

Method: Extract background features from ID images via convolutional local invariances to create simulated OOD representations; train by minimizing the L2-norm of these background features to suppress overconfident predictions on OOD data; method is compatible with, and can be combined with, existing post-hoc OOD detectors.

Result: Empirical results on standard OOD benchmarks show strong detection performance, achieving new state-of-the-art results and broad compatibility with post-hoc methods.

Conclusion: Using local background features as fake OOD cues during training effectively reduces overconfidence and improves OOD detection, with the approach easily integrable with existing post-hoc methods.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural
networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their
applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models
often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using
auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD
detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection
and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection
method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model
training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar
background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from
ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the
local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the
$L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to
alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on
multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our
method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods,
with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.

### [38] [AngularFuse: A Closer Look at Angle-based Perception for Spatial-Sensitive Multi-Modality Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12260)
*Xiaopeng Liu,Yupei Lin,Sen Zhang,Xiao Wang,Yukai Shi,Liang Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AngularFuse introduces an angle-aware, spatially sensitive fusion framework for visible-infrared images, leveraging a cross-modal complementary mask, improved reference synthesis (Laplacian edge enhancement + adaptive histogram equalization), and a novel angle-aware loss that enforces both gradient magnitude and direction to better preserve texture and edges.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unsupervised VIF methods rely on hand-crafted losses, often producing references with poor details and unbalanced brightness, and only focusing on gradient magnitude. A framework that jointly optimizes gradient direction and magnitude with better reference synthesis can yield sharper and more faithfully edges for downstream tasks.

Method: 1) Cross-modal complementary mask module to compel learning of complementary information between VIS and IR modalities. 2) Fine-grained reference synthesis combining Laplacian edge enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization to produce richer-detail, balanced references. 3) Angle-aware loss that enforces both gradient magnitude and direction in the gradient domain, guiding the fusion toward correct texture and edge orientations. 4) End-to-end unsupervised training on public datasets (MSRS, RoadScene, M3FD).

Result: AngularFuse achieves clear margins over mainstream methods on MSRS, RoadScene, and M3FD benchmarks; visual comparisons show sharper, more detailed results especially in challenging scenes, demonstrating superior fusion capability.

Conclusion: The proposed AngularFuse framework successfully addresses limitations of prior unsupervised fusion approaches by (i) explicitly modeling complementary information across modalities, (ii) generating richer, balanced reference images for guidance, and (iii) enforcing gradient direction alongside magnitude for accurate texture and edge preservation, yielding superior fusion performance in practical scenarios.

Abstract: Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as
autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate
multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for
downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made
significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious
challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually
designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss
functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images
constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness.
On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient
magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based
perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At
first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network
to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained
reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge
enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer
details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we
introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both
gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain.
AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and
correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and
M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream
methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method
produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating

### [39] [SpineBench: Benchmarking Multimodal LLMs for Spinal Pathology Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12267)
*Chenghanyu Zhang,Zekun Li,Peipei Li,Xing Cui,Shuhan Xia,Weixiang Yan,Yiqiao Zhang,Qianyu Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpineBench is a large, domain-specific Visual Question Answering benchmark for spine diseases, enabling fine-grained evaluation of multimodal LLMs; it includes 64,878 MCQA pairs from 40,263 spine images across 11 diseases, focusing on diagnosis and lesion localization, with hard negatives to simulate real-world difficulty; 12 leading MLLMs underperform, highlighting limitations and guiding future work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs are evaluated mainly on general medical tasks; spine is highly visual and nuanced, requiring domain-specific benchmarks to assess and improve performance in spinal medicine.

Method: Construct SpineBench by integrating and standardizing open-source spinal datasets, generate two MCQ tasks (diagnosis and localization), and for each QA sample sample challenging hard negative options based on visual similarity; evaluate 12 MLLMs on the benchmark; provide public availability.

Result: 12 leading MLLMs show poor performance on spine-specific tasks, indicating gaps in current models; the benchmark exposes limitations and can guide improvements in spinal medicine applications.

Conclusion: SpineBench provides a comprehensive, publicly available benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in the spine domain, enabling targeted improvements and fairer assessment across spine-related medical tasks.

Abstract: With the increasing integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
into the medical field, comprehensive evaluation of their performance in
various medical domains becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks
primarily assess general medical tasks, inadequately capturing performance in
nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input. To address
this, we introduce SpineBench, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA)
benchmark designed for fine-grained analysis and evaluation of MLLMs in the
spinal domain. SpineBench comprises 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images,
covering 11 spinal diseases through two critical clinical tasks: spinal disease
diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format.
SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from
open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative
options for each VQA pair based on visual similarity (similar but not the same
disease), simulating real-world challenging scenarios. We evaluate 12 leading
MLLMs on SpineBench. The results reveal that these models exhibit poor
performance in spinal tasks, highlighting limitations of current MLLM in the
spine domain and guiding future improvements in spinal medicine applications.

### [40] [PAGS: Priority-Adaptive Gaussian Splatting for Dynamic Driving Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12282)
*Ying A,Wenzhang Sun,Chang Zeng,Chunfeng Wang,Hao Li,Jianxun Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Priority-Adaptive Gaussian Splatting (PAGS) introduces semantic priorities into 3D reconstruction and rendering to focus resources on safety-critical objects, using semantically-guided pruning and a priority-driven rendering pipeline, achieving high fidelity with much faster training and rendering (over 350 FPS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current dynamic 3D reconstruction methods are semantically agnostic and allocate resources uniformly, wasting compute on static backgrounds and non-critical elements. For autonomous driving, preserving fine detail on navigation-critical objects while reducing cost is essential.

Method: Two main contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and Regularization (SGPR) uses a hybrid importance metric to aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained details on safety-critical objects. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering (PDR) introduces a priority-based depth pre-pass to cull occluded primitives and accelerate final shading; built on Gaussian Splatting and optimized for accuracy and speed.

Result: Experiments on Waymo and KITTI show that PAGS achieves high reconstruction quality on safety-critical objects, while substantially reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to over 350 FPS.

Conclusion: Incorporating semantic priorities into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline yields efficient, high-fidelity dynamic urban scene reconstruction suitable for autonomous driving, enabling faster inference without sacrificing critical object detail.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet
current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost.
This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which
allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical
objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive
Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic
priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS
introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and
Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to
aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained
details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering
pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull
occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive
experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves
exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects,
while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to
over 350 FPS.

### [41] [Dual Learning with Dynamic Knowledge Distillation and Soft Alignment for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12283)
*Jianfeng Dong,Lei Huang,Daizong Liu,Xianke Chen,Xun Yang,Changting Lin,Xun Wang,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes the DL-DKD++ framework for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) using a teacher–student distillation setup with a dual-branch student (inheritance and exploration) and dynamic soft-targets, achieving state-of-the-art on TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PRVR reflects real-world video data where untrimmed videos contain substantial non-relevant content; there is a need to transfer knowledge from powerful vision–language pre-trained models to compact, task-specific PRVR networks.

Method: A Dual Learning framework with Dynamic Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++): a large teacher model supervises a compact dual-branch student. The inheritance branch absorbs transferable knowledge from the teacher, while the exploration branch learns task-specific information from the PRVR data to bridge domain gaps. A dynamic soft-target construction mechanism replaces hard targets with adaptive, evolving targets during training to capture fine-grained partial relevance.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art results on PRVR benchmarks TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA. Code is available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: Integrates large-scale pretraining with a lightweight PRVR network through a dual-branch student and dynamic knowledge distillation; dynamic targets enable better modeling of partial video–query relevance and improve practical video retrieval performance.

Abstract: Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos
are pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content.
However, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with
much more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on
the more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval
(PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the
given query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills
generalization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language
pre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR
network. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic
Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides
supervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model
comprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable
knowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific
information from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance
learning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By
replacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve
during training, our method enables the model to better capture the
fine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results
demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR. The code is available at
https://github.com/HuiGuanLab/DL-DKD.

### [42] [Vision Language Models Map Logos to Text via Semantic Entanglement in the Visual Projector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12287)
*Sifan Li,Hongkai Chen,Yujun Cai,Qingwen Ye,Liyang Chen,Junsong Yuan,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Logo hallucination is a prevalent failure mode in vision-language models, driven by projector subspaces rather than genuine glyph perception, and can be mitigated by projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diagnose and understand a specific grounding failure in VLMs—logo hallucination—by systematically measuring it across logos, perturbations, and embedding spaces to reveal underlying mechanisms and inform mitigation.

Method: Create curated logo splits (pure symbols, hybrids, text-bearing logos, Hard-60). Evaluate leading VLMs under nine structured perturbations. Conduct embedding-level analysis using open-weight LLaVA. Perform targeted ablations on projector dimensions to assess causal roles and measure OCR accuracy impact.

Result: Hallucinations persist under strong distortions; occlusion reveals sharp weaknesses. A small subset of projector dimensions governs the hallucinated outputs. Targeted ablations reduce errors while preserving OCR accuracy.

Conclusion: VLMs rely on symbolic priors rather than genuine glyph perception, especially for circular iconic logos. Projector subspaces play a decisive role. Mitigation should focus on projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding, offering a diagnostic lens and actionable guidance for trustworthy multimodal systems.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal
reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not
grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously
overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or
textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits
of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging
Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We
further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that
hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing
the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA
demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector
dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving
OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic
priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular
logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode.
Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation
insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as
promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

### [43] [Hybrid Gaussian Splatting for Novel Urban View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12308)
*Mohamed Omran,Farhad Zanjani,Davide Abati,Jens Petersen,Amirhossein Habibian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-stage hybrid approach for novel view synthesis in street scenes: first build a 3D scene and render from a target viewpoint, then apply a single-shot diffusion-based enhancement. Achieved 2nd place with 0.432 on RealADSim-NVS leaderboard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The challenge requires generating new views of urban environments from car-centric frames captured during training traversals. The paper combines geometric reconstruction (gaussian splatting) with generative refinement (diffusion) to improve view realism and consistency, and performs ablations to quantify each component.

Method: Stage 1: Fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views from target cameras. Stage 2: Use a dedicated single-step diffusion model to enhance the resulting frames.Key design choices include initialization of gaussian primitives and finetuning of the enhancer model, along with curated training data.

Result: Quantitative evaluation via PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. Public leaderboard score: 0.432, placing second. Ablations show component contributions to novel view quality.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that a hybrid pipeline combining gaussian-based scene representation with diffusion-based refinement yields strong novel view synthesis performance in street scenes, validated by leaderboard ranking and ablation insights.

Abstract: This paper describes the Qualcomm AI Research solution to the RealADSim-NVS
challenge, hosted at the RealADSim Workshop at ICCV 2025. The challenge
concerns novel view synthesis in street scenes, and participants are required
to generate, starting from car-centric frames captured during some training
traversals, renders of the same urban environment as viewed from a different
traversal (e.g. different street lane or car direction). Our solution is
inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators
merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two
stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views
as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a
dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the
initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer
model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model
design and we ablate its components in terms of novel view quality as measured
by PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. On the public leaderboard reporting test results, our
proposal reaches an aggregated score of 0.432, achieving the second place
overall.

*Jinzhou Lin,Jie Zhou,Wenhao Xu,Rongtao Xu,Changwei Wang,Shunpeng Chen,Kexue Fu,Yihua Shao,Li Guo,Shibiao Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Motion-guided semantic occupancy prediction from monocular sequences using optical-flow fusion, curriculum depth learning, and SAM priors, achieving SOTA on SemanticKITTI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing semantic scene completion (SSC) methods from monocular images struggle with occlusions, depth noise, and lack explicit motion reasoning. The proposed approach aims to improve temporal consistency, geometric robustness, and semantic accuracy under realistic driving conditions.

Method: A three-pronged approach: (1) multi-level fusion that aligns segmentation, visual, and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow for temporal alignment; (2) curriculum learning that progressively shifts from sparse, accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during training to stabilize optimization; (3) incorporation of semantic priors from SAM to provide category-agnostic supervision for voxel-level semantics.

Result: On SemanticKITTI, CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art mean IoU of 16.9, demonstrating improved motion reasoning, temporal consistency, and robust depth fusion for camera-based 3D SSC.

Conclusion: The integration of motion-guided temporal alignment, curriculum-aware depth fusion, and SAM-based semantic priors yields robust, temporally consistent 3D semantic completion from monocular inputs, advancing camera-based SSC for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and
semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for
camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods
relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion
reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose
CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates
optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion.
CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual,
and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby
improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance
geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions
from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during
training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world
deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic
learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark
demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and
curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

*Sharath M Shankaranarayana,Soumava Kumar Roy,Prasad Sudhakar,Chandan Aladahalli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dynamic, input-adaptive subsampling module integrates into any neural network to reduce compute for 3D/video tasks by selecting informative slices/frames via attention, during inference as well as training, outperforming traditional non-adaptive subsampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D/ video classification suffer from redundant frames/slices; non-adaptive or task-only subsampling (e.g., Gumbel-max) fails to adapt to individual inputs, limiting real-world efficiency. A learnable, input-aware subsampling mechanism is needed to reduce complexity while preserving performance.

Method: Introduce an attention-guided sampling module that can be plugged into arbitrary architectures. It addresses the nondifferentiability of subsampling and enables input-adaptive sampling during inference, learning to select informative slices/frames dynamically.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on 3D MedMNIST3D datasets and two ultrasound video datasets (one in-house), achieving performance gains with reduced computational complexity compared to baseline models.

Conclusion: Input-adaptive, attention-guided subsampling is a practical path to efficient 3D/video networks, providing gains across benchmarks and enabling deployment in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance,
these improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity
and expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks,
not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address
this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be
integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a
nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation
into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the
Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall
short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive.
Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust
to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this
end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even
during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and
reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as
well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them
being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical
conditions.

*Tim J. Schoonbeek,Shao-Hsuan Hung,Dan Lehman,Hans Onvlee,Jacek Kustra,Peter H. N. de With,Fons van der Sommen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STORM-PSR introduces a dual-stream PSR model that combines an assembly-state detection stream with a spatio-temporal stream (spatial encoder + transformer temporal encoder) to recognize procedure steps under occlusion, achieving faster correct step predictions on MECCANO and IndustReal; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PSR models rely only on frame-level object state detection, neglecting temporal relations, making them fragile under occlusion; improved robustness and accuracy require leveraging temporal information.

Method: Two-stream framework: (1) assembly state detection stream for unobstructed views; (2) spatio-temporal stream with a spatial encoder pre-trained via a novel weakly supervised approach and a transformer-based temporal encoder to model feature evolution over time; evaluated on MECCANO and IndustReal; code and new labels provided.

Result: Outperforms prior methods by reducing the delay between actual and predicted completions by 11.2% (MECCANO) and 26.1% (IndustReal), with the gains attributed to the spatio-temporal stream that handles partial occlusion.

Conclusion: STORM-PSR improves robustness of PSR in occluded scenarios; demonstrates effectiveness across two datasets; code and annotations are publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed
steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing
state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in
individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and
accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient
Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework
for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state
detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object,
while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to
recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a
spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to
capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal
encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is
evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay
between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%,
respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in
delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on
unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for
STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly
available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .

### [47] [Scene Coordinate Reconstruction Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12387)
*Wenjing Bian,Axel Barroso-Laguna,Tommaso Cavallari,Victor Adrian Prisacariu,Eric Brachmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A probabilistic reformulation of scene coordinate regression (SCR) training that uses priors to regularize predictions. It adds depth-based priors and a learned 3D point-cloud diffusion prior to guide scene coordinates toward plausible geometry, improving indoor scene reconstruction and downstream tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SCR models trained per-scene can degenerate when multi-view constraints are weak. Introducing high-level reconstruction priors can regularize learning toward plausible, coherent geometry and improve generalization across scenes.

Method: Formulate SCR training under a probabilistic framework and integrate priors. Use simple priors over depth value distributions. Train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a large corpus of indoor scans to serve as a learned prior over plausible scene-coordinate configurations. During training, apply these priors to push predicted 3D points toward geometrically plausible configurations at each step, thereby increasing their likelihood.

Result: On three indoor datasets, the priors yield more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates, and improved camera poses. These improvements also positively affect downstream tasks such as novel view synthesis and camera relocalization.

Conclusion: Incorporating priors into SCR training regularizes the learned scene representations, yielding more plausible geometry and better performance across relocalization and view synthesis tasks, with potential applicability to other implicit scene representations.

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit
scene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and
structure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If
training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models
degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models,
which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate
multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of
reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate
configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a
large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards
plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three
indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations,
resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and
better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel
view synthesis and camera relocalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Systematic review (PRISMA) of Vision-Language Models for urban infrastructure monitoring, 32 studies (2021–2025), focusing on zero-shot tasks, architectures, datasets, and evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban infrastructure monitoring is challenging due to object diversity, environmental variability, and the gap between automated data and citizens' visual perception. VLMs offer integrated visual-language reasoning to better infer conditions with zero-shot capabilities.

Method: Literature synthesis following PRISMA criteria; inclusion of 32 peer-reviewed studies (2021–2025); extraction of tasks addressed, VLM architectures/frameworks, datasets/resources, and evaluation approaches and metrics.

Result: VLMs have been applied to various urban monitoring tasks; CLIP-based and transformer-based architectures are among the most common. Zero-shot performance shows promise but remains limited by robustness and domain shift. Datasets and resources exist but standardization is limited; evaluation methods vary, with heterogeneous metrics and baselines.

Conclusion: VLMs hold promise for scalable, citizen-aligned urban monitoring, potentially reducing reliance on IoT sensors and frequent manual inspections. Realization requires standardized benchmarks, robust domain adaptation, and deployment studies to validate performance in real-world urban settings.

Abstract: Urban monitoring of public infrastructure (such as waste bins, road signs,
vegetation, sidewalks, and construction sites) poses significant challenges due
to the diversity of objects, environments, and contextual conditions involved.
Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on a combination of IoT
sensors and manual inspections, which are costly, difficult to scale, and often
misaligned with citizens' perception formed through direct visual observation.
This raises a critical question: Can machines now "see" like citizens and infer
informed opinions about the condition of urban infrastructure? Vision-Language
Models (VLMs), which integrate visual understanding with natural language
reasoning, have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing
complex visual information, turning them into a promising technology to address
this challenge. This systematic review investigates the role of VLMs in urban
monitoring, with particular emphasis on zero-shot applications. Following the
PRISMA methodology, we analyzed 32 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021
and 2025 to address four core research questions: (1) What urban monitoring
tasks have been effectively addressed using VLMs? (2) Which VLM architectures
and frameworks are most commonly used and demonstrate superior performance? (3)
What datasets and resources support this emerging field? (4) How are VLM-based
applications evaluated, and what performance levels have been reported?

*Huu Tien Nguyen,Ahmed Karam Eldaly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) for MRI quality transfer enables direct velocity-field regression to morph noise into high-quality MR images, achieving state-of-the-art results with fewer parameters and strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LF-MRI offers affordable, portable scanning but suffers from high noise and low diagnostic quality; there is a need to bridge the quality gap to high-field-like images without expensive infrastructure.

Method: Learn an optimal velocity field to define a continuous flow from noise to target data distributions. The model uses direct regression of this velocity field, avoiding iterative sampling and adversarial objectives.

Result: CFM achieves state-of-the-art performance on LF-MRI reconstruction and generalizes well to both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data, while using significantly fewer parameters than competing methods.

Conclusion: CFM represents a scalable and effective approach for MRI reconstruction in resource-limited settings, offering strong performance with lower model complexity and practical clinical potential.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on
conditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous
flow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the
direct regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in
the context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly
emerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from
inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our
framework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their
corresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without
requiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while
utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.
These results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool
for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoLucy proposes a hierarchical memory backtracking framework for long video understanding, plus EgoMem benchmark; shows state-of-the-art performance on long video benchmarks and even surpasses GPT-4o on several tasks; code and data to be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing approaches largely operate on individual frames and rely on sparse frame sampling, failing to capture long-range temporal context and preserve details in very long videos.

Method: VideoLucy uses a deep memory backtracking approach with a hierarchical memory structure that defines detail level and temporal scope at different depths; an agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism to mine video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until it gathers sufficient information to answer confidently.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superiority; outperforms state-of-the-art on multiple long video benchmarks and even surpasses proprietary models like GPT-4o; EgoMem benchmark introduced; resources to be released.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables effective temporal understanding while preserving critical details; introduces EgoMem as a comprehensive long-video understanding benchmark; releases of code and dataset are planned.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a
promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face
two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on
individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive
frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt
sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome
these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework
for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from
coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with
progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and
temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an
agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines
video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is
gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal
understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In
addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding.
EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand
complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in
extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks,
achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Our code and dataset will be made publicly at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiologists face heavy workloads; leveraging longitudinal chest X-ray data can yield clinically faithful comparisons and more accurate reports, yet existing reviews focus on single-image CXRRRG and neglect longitudinal design.

Method: Systematic literature review of LRRG studies; categorize data construction strategies, report-generation architectures, and longitudinally tailored designs; assess evaluation protocols (longitudinal measures and standard benchmarks); summarize method performance and ablation findings; identify limitations and propose future directions.

Result: Longitudinal information and thoughtful architectural choices significantly impact LRRG performance; current research has five major limitations and faces gaps in datasets, evaluation, and generalizability; the review offers a structured framework for future work.

Conclusion: This work lays a foundation for advancing LRRG, guiding researchers to design better longitudinal models and evaluation protocols, and signaling directions for future development.

Abstract: Chest Xray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in modern medicine, and
its high utilization creates substantial workloads for radiologists. To
alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to
automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically
accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches,
however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal
context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements.
Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal
data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that
mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys
primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for
longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for
model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive
review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we
examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures
alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols
encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We
further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different
ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of
longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model
performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research
and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a
foundation for advancing this emerging field.

### [52] [MS-GAGA: Metric-Selective Guided Adversarial Generation Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12468)
*Dion J. X. Ho,Gabriel Lee Jun Rong,Niharika Shrivastava,Harshavardhan Abichandani,Pai Chet Ng,Xiaoxiao Miao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-GAGA is a two-stage transferable adversarial attack for deepfake detectors in black-box settings, combining a dual-stream perturbation module (MNTD-PGD and SG-PGD) with a metric-aware selection (SSIM) to maximize misclassification on unseen detectors while preserving perceptual similarity; yields up to 27% better fooling rates than prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance both transferability and perceptual imperceptibility of adversarial examples against deepfake detectors in black-box scenarios, addressing small perturbation budgets and vulnerability of detectors to unseen models.

Method: Stage 1: dual-stream attack—MNTD-PGD (enhanced gradient calculations for small perturbations) and SG-PGD (focus on visually salient regions) to broaden adversarial search space. Stage 2: metric-aware selection—candidates are evaluated on black-box success and SSIM to the original image, selecting perturbations that balance transferability with perceptual fidelity.

Result: Achieves up to 27% higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to state-of-the-art attacks, indicating improved transferability and perceptual similarity.

Conclusion: MS-GAGA effectively balances transferability and imperceptibility in black-box attacks against deepfake detectors, offering a stronger attack framework than prior methods.

Abstract: We present MS-GAGA (Metric-Selective Guided Adversarial Generation Attack), a
two-stage framework for crafting transferable and visually imperceptible
adversarial examples against deepfake detectors in black-box settings. In Stage
1, a dual-stream attack module generates adversarial candidates: MNTD-PGD
applies enhanced gradient calculations optimized for small perturbation
budgets, while SG-PGD focuses perturbations on visually salient regions. This
complementary design expands the adversarial search space and improves
transferability across unseen models. In Stage 2, a metric-aware selection
module evaluates candidates based on both their success against black-box
models and their structural similarity (SSIM) to the original image. By jointly
optimizing transferability and imperceptibility, MS-GAGA achieves up to 27%
higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to state-of-the-art
attacks.

*Shurong Chai,Rahul Kumar JAIN,Rui Xu,Shaocong Mo,Ruibo Hou,Shiyu Teng,Jiaqing Liu,Lanfen Lin,Yen-Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Early fusion of text and image features before augmentation for text-guided medical image segmentation, aided by a lightweight generator mapping text embeddings into the visual space to bridge semantic gaps; achieves state-of-the-art across three tasks and four frameworks; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data augmentation can disrupt spatial alignment between image and text, harming multimodal segmentation; medical imaging often suffers from limited data, necessitating robust, spatially consistent cross-modal representations.

Method: An early fusion framework that combines text and visual features prior to augmentation to preserve spatial alignment, plus a lightweight generator that projects text embeddings into visual space to bridge the semantic gap between modalities; uses pseudo-images to visualize localization and evaluates across multiple medical tasks and segmentation frameworks.

Result: State-of-the-art results across three medical imaging tasks and four segmentation frameworks; code publicly available at GitHub.

Conclusion: Early text-visual feature fusion with a semantic projection module enables spatially consistent, high-performance text-guided segmentation in medical imaging and generalizes across architectures; the approach is reproducible and data-efficient.

Abstract: Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data,
especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and
images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation.
However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial
alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we
propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before
augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight
generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic
gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region
localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four
segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code is publicly
available on GitHub: https://github.com/11yxk/MedSeg_EarlyFusion.

*An Zhao,Piaopiao Yu,Zhe Zhu,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-stage Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting for motion-blurred image deblurring, refining camera poses and applying global rigid transformation with gradient aggregation and space-time optimization to improve 3D reconstruction over existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motion blur from camera motion degrades 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction; existing methods rely heavily on pose accuracy and suffer from erroneous Gaussian densification in blurred regions.

Method: Two-stage: Stage 1 Camera Pose Refinement to reduce motion-induced distortions; Stage 2 Global Rigid Transformation to further correct blur with fixed coarse poses; subframe gradient aggregation to mitigate multi-frame gradient conflicts; space-time bi-stage optimization to adaptively adjust Gaussian densification thresholds and prevent premature noisy Gaussian generation.

Result: Experiments demonstrate effectiveness and superiority over state-of-the-art methods in deblurring and 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: The proposed Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting framework enables accurate 3D scene reconstruction from motion-blurred imagery by stabilizing camera pose estimates and controlling Gaussian densities, yielding improved quality and robustness compared with prior methods.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has exhibited remarkable capabilities in 3D scene
reconstruction.However, reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from
motion-blurred images caused by camera motion poses a significant challenge.The
performance of existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods are limited due to their
inherent mechanisms, such as extreme dependence on the accuracy of camera poses
and inability to effectively control erroneous Gaussian primitives
densification caused by motion blur.To solve these problems, we introduce a
novel framework, Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting, to accurately reconstruct 3D
scenes from motion-blurred images.BSGS contains two stages. First, Camera Pose
Refinement roughly optimizes camera poses to reduce motion-induced distortions.
Second, with fixed rough camera poses, Global RigidTransformation further
corrects motion-induced blur distortions.To alleviate multi-subframe gradient
conflicts, we propose a subframe gradient aggregation strategy to optimize both
stages.Furthermore, a space-time bi-stage optimization strategy is introduced
to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds and prevent premature
noisy Gaussian generation in blurred regions. Comprehensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method and show its superiority
over the state of the arts.

*Jiayi Kong,Chen Zong,Junkai Deng,Xuhui Chen,Fei Hou,Shiqing Xin,Junhui Hou,Chen Qian,Ying He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A network-free method (Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion, VAD) computes unsigned distance fields (UDFs) directly from unoriented point clouds by assigning bi-directional normals using Voronoi-based energy criteria, diffusing them to form a gradient field, and integrating to obtain the UDF. It robustly handles watertight/open surfaces, non-manifold, and non-orientable geometries with improved efficiency and stability over neural approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsigned distance fields (UDFs) can represent shapes with arbitrary topology, including open surfaces, non-orientable and non-manifold geometries. Neural methods for learning UDFs suffer from numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability, motivating a lightweight, network-free approach.

Method: 1) Assign bi-directional normals to input points guided by two Voronoi-based energy criteria to achieve optimal alignment. 2) Diffuse the aligned normals to construct an approximate UDF gradient field. 3) Integrate the gradient field to recover the final UDF.

Result: Experiments show VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while maintaining computational efficiency and stability compared to neural approaches.

Conclusion: VAD offers a simple, network-free pipeline for computing UDFs from unoriented point clouds, enabling reliable UDF estimation across diverse geometries with improved efficiency and stability.

Abstract: Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) provide a flexible representation for 3D
shapes with arbitrary topology, including open and closed surfaces, orientable
and non-orientable geometries, and non-manifold structures. While recent neural
approaches have shown promise in learning UDFs, they often suffer from
numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability. We
present a lightweight, network-free method, Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD),
for computing UDFs directly from unoriented point clouds. Our approach begins
by assigning bi-directional normals to input points, guided by two
Voronoi-based geometric criteria encoded in an energy function for optimal
alignment. The aligned normals are then diffused to form an approximate UDF
gradient field, which is subsequently integrated to recover the final UDF.
Experiments demonstrate that VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces,
as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining
computationally efficient and stable.

*David Björkstrand,Tiesheng Wang,Lars Bretzner,Josephine Sullivan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A score-based diffusion model achieves state-of-the-art–level unconditional human motion generation using simple feature-space normalization and analytically derived weights for the L2 score-matching loss, while generating motion and shape directly and avoiding post hoc shape recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on over-parameterized inputs and auxiliary losses common in motion-generation methods, and to show diffusion models can match human motion distribution with principled design.

Method: Develop a score-based diffusion model with careful feature-space normalization and analytically derived L2 score-matching weightings; enable direct generation of both motion and shape; present the approach step-by-step with theoretical motivation and conduct targeted ablations to isolate each contribution.

Result: Achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art unconditional motion generation; can generate both motion and shape directly without slow post hoc shape recovery; ablations confirm the effectiveness of each proposed component.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that proper normalization and principled loss weighting are sufficient for diffusion models to match human motion distributions, reducing the need for over-parameterized inputs and auxiliary losses and providing a transparent, ablation-backed design.

Abstract: Recent work has explored a range of model families for human motion
generation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), and diffusion-based models. Despite their differences, many
methods rely on over-parameterized input features and auxiliary losses to
improve empirical results. These strategies should not be strictly necessary
for diffusion models to match the human motion distribution. We show that on
par with state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation are
achievable with a score-based diffusion model using only careful feature-space
normalization and analytically derived weightings for the standard L2
score-matching loss, while generating both motion and shape directly, thereby
avoiding slow post hoc shape recovery from joints. We build the method step by
step, with a clear theoretical motivation for each component, and provide
targeted ablations demonstrating the effectiveness of each proposed addition in
isolation.

### [57] [MMOT: The First Challenging Benchmark for Drone-based Multispectral Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12565)
*Tianhao Li,Tingfa Xu,Ying Wang,Haolin Qin,Xu Lin,Jianan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces MMOT, a large-scale drone multispectral MOT benchmark with eight categories and precise oriented annotations, plus a spectral-3D-Stem, orientation-aware Kalman filter, and orientation-adaptive transformer; demonstrates that multispectral input boosts tracking over RGB, especially for small/dense targets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB MOT struggles on aerial imagery due to weak spatial cues from color/texture; multispectral data provide spectral discriminability that can improve target separation and reliability. A lack of dedicated multispectral UAV MOT datasets hinders progress.

Method: Introduce MMOT benchmark: 125 video sequences, 488.8K annotations, eight categories, with precise oriented annotations. Propose a multispectral and orientation-aware MOT pipeline featuring (i) Spectral 3D-Stem to extract spectral features while remaining RGB-pretraining compatible; (ii) orientation-aware Kalman filter for accurate state estimation; (iii) end-to-end orientation-adaptive transformer. Evaluate across representative trackers to compare multispectral vs RGB baselines.

Result: Extensive experiments show multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects; the proposed components leverage spectral cues and orientation information effectively.

Conclusion: MMOT provides a first challenging drone-based multispectral MOT benchmark and associated methods; code and benchmarks are publicly available, aiming to accelerate research in multispectral MOT for drones.

Abstract: Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to
small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based
tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and
texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability.
Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides
crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial
conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has
hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the
first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object
tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video
sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii)
Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small
targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and
(iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced
ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and
leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and
orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a
lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving
compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for
precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive
transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently
show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB
baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our
work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our
MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Temporally Conditional Mamba, a mamba-based model that embeds conditioning directly into recurrent dynamics to better align motion with time-varying inputs, outperforming cross-attention baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-attention fusion captures global interactions but struggles with step-by-step temporal alignment in time-dependent motion generation, limiting realism and conditioning fidelity.

Method: Integrates conditional information into the recurrent dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling temporally aligned conditioning in motion generation; evaluates across multiple human motion tasks with extensive experiments comparing to state-of-the-art methods.

Result: Significant improvements in temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over state-of-the-art methods on diverse motion tasks.

Conclusion: Temporally Conditional Mamba effectively integrates conditioning into recurrence to enhance temporal fidelity in motion generation, validating the approach and providing a project page for reference.

Abstract: Learning human motion based on a time-dependent input signal presents a
challenging yet impactful task with various applications. The goal of this task
is to generate or estimate human movement that consistently reflects the
temporal patterns of conditioning inputs. Existing methods typically rely on
cross-attention mechanisms to fuse the condition with motion. However, this
approach primarily captures global interactions and struggles to maintain
step-by-step temporal alignment. To address this limitation, we introduce
Temporally Conditional Mamba, a new mamba-based model for human motion
generation. Our approach integrates conditional information into the recurrent
dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion. To
validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on a variety of human
motion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly
improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over
state-of-the-art approaches. Our project page is available at

*Simon Ravé,Jean-Christophe Lombardo,Pejman Rasti,Alexis Joly,David Rousseau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zero-shot plant segmentation using Plantnet representations with a DinoV2 backbone and SAM; achieves IoU gains across four datasets without new annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alleviate annotation bottlenecks in agricultural segmentation and improve robustness under diverse field conditions by leveraging plant-specialized representations.

Method: Zero-shot segmentation pipeline: Plantnet-based plant representations with a fine-tuned DinoV2 backbone generate coarse masks, which are then refined by Segment Anything Model (SAM) for detailed segmentation; evaluated on four diverse agricultural datasets.

Result: Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 yields consistent IoU gains over the base DinoV2 model across all four datasets, as measured by the Jaccard Index, demonstrating the benefit of combining foundation models with plant-centric representations.

Conclusion: Integrating domain-specialized plant models with general foundation models can reduce annotation needs and improve segmentation performance in diverse agricultural scenarios.

Abstract: We present a zero-shot segmentation approach for agricultural imagery that
leverages Plantnet, a large-scale plant classification model, in conjunction
with its DinoV2 backbone and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Rather than
collecting and annotating new datasets, our method exploits Plantnet's
specialized plant representations to identify plant regions and produce coarse
segmentation masks. These masks are then refined by SAM to yield detailed
segmentations. We evaluate on four publicly available datasets of various
complexity in terms of contrast including some where the limited size of the
training data and complex field conditions often hinder purely supervised
methods. Our results show consistent performance gains when using
Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over the base DinoV2 model, as measured by the
Jaccard Index (IoU). These findings highlight the potential of combining
foundation models with specialized plant-centric models to alleviate the
annotation bottleneck and enable effective segmentation in diverse agricultural
scenarios.

### [60] [LayerSync: Self-aligning Intermediate Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12581)
*Yasaman Haghighi,Bastien van Delft,Mariam Hassan,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerSync is a plug-and-play self-regularizer for diffusion models that uses the model's own intermediate representations as intrinsic guidance, aligning weaker layers with semantically rich ones to improve generation quality and training efficiency across domains without external data or pretrained models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: External guidance on intermediate representations has been shown to accelerate diffusion model training, but typically relies on pretrained models or external data. LayerSync aims to be domain-agnostic, data-free, and self-sufficient.

Method: Introduce LayerSync as a regularizer term that leverages cross-layer representations within the diffusion model. The approach identifies semantically richer representations in deeper layers and uses them to guide weaker, earlier layers, serving as intrinsic supervision without adding data or external models. It is plug-and-play and incurs no training overhead and generalizes across modalities (image, audio, video, motion).

Result: Empirically improves generation quality and training efficiency. Notable claims include speeding up training of a flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet and achieving a 23.6% improvement in generation quality, with applicability to multiple modalities. Code released at the provided repository.

Conclusion: LayerSync offers a domain-agnostic, data-free regularization mechanism for diffusion models, reducing reliance on external guidance and pretrained components while enhancing performance across various domains. It positions itself as a general plug-and-play improvement for diffusion-based generative modeling.

Abstract: We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation
quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have
highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the
representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on
model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize
this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate
representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies
across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich
representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the
need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient,
plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and
generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no
pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on
image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as
audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the
generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the
training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and
improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at
https://github.com/vita-epfl/LayerSync.

*Jiachen Lei,Keli Liu,Julius Berner,Haiming Yu,Hongkai Zheng,Jiahong Wu,Xiangxiang Chu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-stage training enables competitive pixel-space diffusion and consistency models on high-resolution images, closing the gap with latent-space methods and achieving strong results with efficient sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-space models lag behind latent-space models in performance and efficiency. The work aims to close this gap for high-resolution image generation by enabling effective, end-to-end training of pixel-space diffusion and consistency models.

Method: Stage 1: pre-train encoders to capture meaningful semantics on clean images and align them with points along a deterministic sampling trajectory from the prior to the data distribution. Stage 2: couple the encoder with a randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune end-to-end for both diffusion and consistency models. Train on ImageNet; evaluate with NFE=75 for diffusion and single-step sampling for consistency.

Result: Diffusion: FID 2.04 (ImageNet-256) and 2.35 (ImageNet-512) at 75 NFE, surpassing prior pixel-space methods and rivaling VAE-based models. Consistency: FID 8.82 on ImageNet-256 with a single sampling step, significantly better than its latent-space counterpart; first successful training of a consistency model directly on high-resolution images without pre-trained VAEs or diffusion models.

Conclusion: The proposed two-stage framework substantially narrows the gap between pixel-space and latent-space generative models for high-resolution images, delivering strong results and practical sampling efficiency, and enabling high-quality consistency models without pretraining on VAEs or diffusion models.

Abstract: Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally
underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent
performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage
training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and
consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture
meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along
the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior
to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a
randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for
both diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates
strong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion
model reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75
number of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a
large margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading
VAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our
consistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step,
significantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart. To the best of our
knowledge, this marks the first successful training of a consistency model
directly on high-resolution images without relying on pre-trained VAEs or
diffusion models.

*Chao Chen,Zhixin Ma,Yongqi Li,Yupeng Hu,Yinwei Wei,Wenjie Li,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR) to perform multimodal reasoning in latent space, reducing annotation burden and inference latency while improving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal reasoning relies on explicit, labor-intensive vision-text annotations and sequential reasoning steps, which incur high labeling cost and slow inference. The paper aims to perform reasoning in a latent space to improve efficiency and scalability.

Method: IVT-LR injects multimodal information by representing each reasoning step with latent text (previous step's hidden states) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). It uses a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable the model to conduct multimodal latent reasoning steps.

Result: On M3CoT and ScienceQA datasets, IVT-LR achieves an average accuracy increase of 5.45% and more than 5x speedup compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Multimodal latent reasoning with IVT-LR offers improved efficiency (less need for explicit annotations, faster inference) while enhancing or maintaining performance on multimodal reasoning tasks; code is available.

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by
incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It
has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information,
enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text.
Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on
explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations
and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these
issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of
multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To
facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR),
which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process
within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by
combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous
step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further
introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to
perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and
ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance
increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase
of over 5 times compared to existing approaches. Code available at

TL;DR: WaterFlow is a rectified flow-based USOD framework that embeds underwater physical imaging priors into training and adds temporal modeling, attaining notable performance gains on USOD10K.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater imaging suffers quality degradation and domain gaps; existing methods neglect the physics of underwater imaging and often treat degradations as mere noise, missing informative cues inherent to the underwater environment.

Method: A rectified flow-based framework that explicitly incorporates underwater physical imaging priors into network training and introduces temporal dimension modeling to enhance salient object detection.

Result: On USOD10K, WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m, indicating effective and superior performance; code will be released after acceptance.

Conclusion: Integrating underwater physics priors with temporal modeling improves USOD performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of WaterFlow; the authors plan to release code post-acceptance.

Abstract: Underwater Salient Object Detection (USOD) faces significant challenges,
including underwater image quality degradation and domain gaps. Existing
methods tend to ignore the physical principles of underwater imaging or simply
treat degradation phenomena in underwater images as interference factors that
must be eliminated, failing to fully exploit the valuable information they
contain. We propose WaterFlow, a rectified flow-based framework for underwater
salient object detection that innovatively incorporates underwater physical
imaging information as explicit priors directly into the network training
process and introduces temporal dimension modeling, significantly enhancing the
model's capability for salient object identification. On the USOD10K dataset,
WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m, demonstrating the effectiveness and
superiority of our method. The code will be published after the acceptance.

### [64] [Zero-Shot CFC: Fast Real-World Image Denoising based on Cross-Frequency Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12646)
*Yanlin Jiang,Yuchen Liu,Mingren Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes ZSCFC, a zero-shot denoiser based on cross-frequency consistency that trains on a single noisy image without assuming noise distribution, using an ultralight network and a cross-frequency consistency loss to achieve real-world denoising efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the limitations of existing zero-shot denoisers, notably long training times and strong noise-distribution assumptions (independence, zero-mean). Aims to handle real-world noise more effectively and efficiently by relying on texture/content consistency across frequency bands rather than noise properties.

Method: Introduce cross-frequency consistency loss that leverages position similarity of textures across different frequency bands while noise is non-similar; employ an ultralight neural network; train and denoise using only a single noisy image without assuming explicit noise distribution.

Result: Experimental results on real-world image datasets show ZSCFC surpasses state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in both computational efficiency and denoising performance.

Conclusion: ZSCFC provides an efficient and effective zero-shot denoising framework for real-world noise without restrictive noise-distribution assumptions, enabled by cross-frequency consistency and an ultralight network.

Abstract: Zero-shot denoisers address the dataset dependency of deep-learning-based
denoisers, enabling the denoising of unseen single images. Nonetheless,
existing zero-shot methods suffer from long training times and rely on the
assumption of noise independence and a zero-mean property, limiting their
effectiveness in real-world denoising scenarios where noise characteristics are
more complicated. This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for
real-world denoising, the Zero-Shot denoiser based on Cross-Frequency
Consistency (ZSCFC), which enables training and denoising with a single noisy
image and does not rely on assumptions about noise distribution. Specifically,
image textures exhibit position similarity and content consistency across
different frequency bands, while noise does not. Based on this property, we
developed cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network to realize
image denoising. Experiments on various real-world image datasets demonstrate
that our ZSCFC outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in terms of
computational efficiency and denoising performance.

### [65] [On the Use of Hierarchical Vision Foundation Models for Low-Cost Human Mesh Recovery and Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12660)
*Shuhei Tarashima,Yushan Wang,Norio Tagawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Truncate hierarchical vision foundation-model encoders to early stages to create lightweight HMR/HPE models; early-stage features suffice for competitive accuracy with better efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: State-of-the-art HMR relies on large, non-hierarchical transformers. There is a need for simple, efficient baselines across compute budgets. The paper proposes leveraging early stages of hierarchical VFMs to retain useful spatial detail while reducing compute.

Method: Adapt three lightweight HMR2.0 baselines from ViTPose; evaluate early stages (2–3) of hierarchical VFMs (Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, VMamba) as encoders; conduct a comprehensive evaluation across 27 models.

Result: Using only the first two or three stages yields performance on par with full-stage models. Truncated models offer a better accuracy–efficiency trade-off compared with existing lightweight alternatives.

Conclusion: Early-stage encoders from hierarchical VFMs are effective for HMR/HPE, enabling competitive performance with reduced computation and guiding efficient model design.

Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop simple and efficient models for human mesh
recovery (HMR) and its predecessor task, human pose estimation (HPE).
State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large,
non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the
corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying
computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by
adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging
the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including
Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is
motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs
produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of
non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27
hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the
first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models.
Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs
between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight
alternatives.

*Julen Costa-Watanabe,Isabelle Wittmann,Benedikt Blumenstiel,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs for Earth-observation data, includes image-based variants and a Temporal Transformer (TEC-TT) with Latent Repacking for flexible rate-distortion. Trained on Sentinel-2, TEC outperforms classical codecs by 3–10x at the same image quality, and TEC-TT enables zero-shot cloud inpainting surpassing AllClear SOTA; code and weights will be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Earth observation data streams are vast and growing; conventional image/video codecs do not exploit long-term radiometric evolution and lack publicly available pretrained EO-specific models. A domain-tailored, learned compression approach is needed to reduce storage/transmission while preserving radiometric fidelity.

Method: Introduce TerraCodec: image-based variants for multispectral data plus TEC-TT temporal transformer to model dependencies across time. Develop Latent Repacking to train flexible-rate transformer models adaptable to varying rate-distortion settings. Train on Sentinel-2 data. Evaluate against classical codecs and benchmark cloud inpainting using AllClear.

Result: TerraCodec achieves 3–10x compression gain at equivalent image quality compared with classical codecs. TEC-TT enables zero-shot cloud inpainting and surpasses state-of-the-art on the AllClear benchmark.

Conclusion: Domain-specific learned compression for EO shows strong promise; TerraCodec represents a significant step toward practical, scalable learned codecs for EO data, and code/weights will be publicly released.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites produce massive streams of multispectral
image time series, posing pressing challenges for storage and transmission.
Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available
pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural
imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on
motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static
scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to
EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral
inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages
dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural
codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate
transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on
Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x
stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT
enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the
AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression
algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model
weights will be released under a permissive license.

*Zefu Lin,Wenbo Chen,Xiaojuan Jin,Yuran Yang,Lue Fan,Yixin Zhang,Yufeng Zhang,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework that preserves 3D structure and semantics while reducing communication, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on extended BEV datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current BEV-based methods rely on bounding-box representations that lose semantic and geometric detail and perform poorly with undefined or occluded objects. UAV swarms require robust, scalable, and communication-efficient cooperative perception across diverse operational scenarios.

Method: Introduce a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder to preserve 3D spatial semantics, Cross-Agent Feature Integration to fuse information across UAVs, Altitude-Aware Feature Reduction to compact scene representation, and a Dual-Mask Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and cut communication overhead. Evaluation extends three datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ, UAV3D-Occ, GauUScene-Occ) for collaborative occupancy tasks.

Result: The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art occupancy prediction accuracy, significantly outperforming existing collaborative methods, while reducing communication overhead to a fraction of previous approaches.

Conclusion: The framework effectively preserves 3D structure and semantics in multi-UAV perception with efficient communication, validated on extended benchmarks; it enables robust collaboration in diverse operational scenarios and provides new datasets for benchmarking.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm systems necessitate efficient
collaborative perception mechanisms for diverse operational scenarios. Current
Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approaches exhibit two main limitations:
bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic and geometric
information of the scene, and their performance significantly degrades when
encountering undefined or occluded objects. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework. Our
framework effectively preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics through
integrating a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature
Integration. To enhance efficiency, we further introduce Altitude-Aware Feature
Reduction to compactly represent scene information, along with a Dual-Mask
Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and reduce
communication overhead. Due to the absence of suitable benchmark datasets, we
extend three datasets for evaluation: two virtual datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ and
UAV3D-Occ) and one real-world dataset (GauUScene-Occ). Experiments results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly
outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication
overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

*Shelley Zixin Shu,Haozhe Luo,Alexander Poellinger,Mauricio Reyes*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) combines self-supervised and human-guided constraints to align transformer attention with human expertise and improve generalization in chest X-ray classification using ViT, outperforming two EGL baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based medical imaging models often learn spurious correlations, reducing generalization. Aligning AI attention with human expertise can mitigate this, but typically requires costly supervision; a lighter approach with self-supervised guidance could reduce annotation burden while enhancing robustness.

Method: Proposes Hybrid Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL): a framework that integrates a self-supervised component leveraging class-distinctive attention without restrictive priors with human-guided constraints. Applied to Vision Transformer (ViT) for chest X-ray classification and compared against two state-of-the-art EGL methods.

Result: H-EGL achieves superior classification accuracy and generalization compared to two EGL baselines and produces attention maps better aligned with human expertise.

Conclusion: H-EGL offers robust attention alignment and improved generalization with reduced supervision needs, showing promise for medical imaging tasks that rely on attention mechanisms.

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional
performance in medical imaging by leveraging attention mechanisms for feature
representation and interpretability. However, these models are prone to
learning spurious correlations, leading to biases and limited generalization.
While human-AI attention alignment can mitigate these issues, it often depends
on costly manual supervision. In this work, we propose a Hybrid
Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework that combines self-supervised and
human-guided constraints to enhance attention alignment and improve
generalization. The self-supervised component of H-EGL leverages
class-distinctive attention without relying on restrictive priors, promoting
robustness and flexibility. We validate our approach on chest X-ray
classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT), where H-EGL outperforms two
state-of-the-art Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) methods, demonstrating
superior classification accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally,
it produces attention maps that are better aligned with human expertise.

### [69] [Beyond Seeing: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs on Tool-Enabled Image Perception, Transformation, and Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12712)
*Xingang Guo,Utkarsh Tyagi,Advait Gosai,Paula Vergara,Ernesto Gabriel Hernández Montoya,Chen Bo Calvin Zhang,Bin Hu,Yunzhong He,Bing Liu,Rakshith Sharma Srinivasa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IRIS is the first benchmark for 'think with images' in multimodal LLMs, evaluating how models perceive, transform, and reason with images using tools across 1,204 open-ended tasks. It reveals that current models struggle with integrating vision and tool use; the best reported score (GPT-5-think) is 18.68% pass, with divergent tool-use behavior across models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond static visual perception and treat images as a manipulable cognitive workspace, addressing a gap where most benchmarks emphasize think-about-image paradigms rather than think-with-images that require active image editing, transformation, and tool integration.

Method: Construct IRIS with 1,204 tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) across five domains, each paired with rubrics for systematic evaluation. Evaluate multiple MLLMs, analyze how they perceive, transform, and integrate images with general-purpose tools, and characterize tool-use patterns.

Result: Current MLLMs struggle to effectively integrate vision with tools for complex tasks. The strongest model (GPT-5-think) achieves only 18.68% pass. Tool-use behaviors diverge: OpenAI models gain from diverse image manipulations, while Gemini-2.5-pro shows little improvement across manipulations.

Conclusion: IRIS provides a critical benchmark to study think-with-images capabilities, highlighting the limited progress in integrating vision and tools and guiding future model development and evaluation toward more dynamic, manipulation-based visual reasoning.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring
active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover
salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think
with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with
other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as
passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored.
Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where
images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS,
an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability
to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under
the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended
vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse
domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our
evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective
integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model
(GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent
tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image
manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the
first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights
for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

### [70] [Personalized Federated Fine-Tuning of Vision Foundation Models for Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12741)
*Adam Tupper,Christian Gagné*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A personalized federated fine-tuning approach using orthogonal LoRA adapters to separate general and client-specific knowledge, enabling better utilization of multi-site data while preserving privacy; preliminary results show competitiveness with existing methods in federated medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models in healthcare can learn from distributed data, but privacy restrictions limit data sharing. Fine-tuning is still needed for downstream tasks, and obtaining enough labeled data is challenging. Federated learning across multiple institutions offers a solution to leverage diverse data while protecting patient privacy.

Method: Introduce a personalized federated fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general and client-specific knowledge. This allows each client to exploit both its own data and data from others while maintaining privacy. Likely involves training adapters with an orthogonality constraint across clients during federation.

Result: Preliminary results on real-world federated medical imaging tasks show competitive performance against current federated fine-tuning methods.

Conclusion: Orthogonal LoRA-based personalized federated fine-tuning appears to be a viable approach to combining generalizable foundation-model knowledge with client-specific adaptation under privacy constraints; further empirical validation is warranted.

Abstract: Foundation models open up new possibilities for the use of AI in healthcare.
However, even when pre-trained on health data, they still need to be fine-tuned
for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, although foundation models reduce
the amount of training data required to achieve good performance, obtaining
sufficient data is still a challenge. This is due, in part, to restrictions on
sharing and aggregating data from different sources to protect patients'
privacy. One possible solution to this is to fine-tune foundation models via
federated learning across multiple participating clients (i.e., hospitals,
clinics, etc.). In this work, we propose a new personalized federated
fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general
and client-specific knowledge, enabling each client to fully exploit both their
own data and the data of others. Our preliminary results on real-world
federated medical imaging tasks demonstrate that our approach is competitive
against current federated fine-tuning methods.

TL;DR: FlashVSR is a diffusion-based one-step streaming framework for real-time video super-resolution (VSR). It achieves ~17 FPS on 768x1408 videos on a single A100 by combining three innovations: train-friendly three-stage distillation for streaming SR, locality-constrained sparse attention to reduce computation while bridging train/test resolution gaps, and a tiny conditional decoder to accelerate reconstruction. The authors also introduce VSR-120K (120k videos, 180k images) for large-scale training. It scales to ultra-high resolutions, achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step diffusion VSR models, and will release code, pretrained models, and dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models have advanced video restoration but struggle with real-world VSR due to high latency, heavy computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high resolutions. The work aims to make diffusion-based VSR practical by achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance.

Method: Introduce FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework for real-time VSR, consisting of: (1) a train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline enabling streaming super-resolution, (2) locality-constrained sparse attention to cut redundant computation and bridge train/test resolution gaps, and (3) a tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without quality loss. Additionally, construct VSR-120K dataset (120k videos, 180k images) for large-scale training.

Result: FlashVSR runs at ~17 FPS for 768x1408 videos on a single A100 GPU and achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step diffusion VSR models; demonstrates reliable scaling to ultra-high resolutions.

Conclusion: Proposes a practical, real-time diffusion-based VSR solution and releasing code, pretrained models, and dataset to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them
to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high
latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high
resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by
achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we
propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework
towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408
videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a
train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming
super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts
redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a
tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing
quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new
dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that
FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves
state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step
diffusion VSR models. We will release the code, pretrained models, and dataset
to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.

*Zhiliu Yang,Jinyu Dai,Jianyuan Zhang,Zhu Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPORTS: A unified framework that tightly integrates video panoptic segmentation (VPS), visual odometry (VO), and scene rendering (SR) for holistic scene understanding in embodied AI. It uses an adaptive attention-based geometric fusion to align cross-frame features with pose, depth, and optical flow, plus a post-matching strategy for better identity tracking. In VO, VPS results and optical flow improve dynamic object confidence and depth/map quality. SR employs point-based neural rendering from VO-derived sparse clouds to synthesize high-fidelity RGB and twin panoptic views. Experiments on three datasets show state-of-the-art gains across odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address persistent challenges in embodied-AI scene understanding—segmentation deficiencies, dynamic object interference, sensor sparsity, and limited viewpoints—by developing a unified, iterative framework that jointly handles segmentation, motion, and rendering.

Method: Introduce SPORTS with: (1) an adaptive attention-based geometric fusion in VPS to align cross-frame features using pose, depth, and optical flow; (2) a post-matching strategy to improve identity tracking; (3) integration of VPS segmentation and optical flow to enhance dynamic object confidence in VO, improving camera pose estimation and depth map generation; (4) point-based SR that converts sparse point clouds into neural fields for high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views.

Result: Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed attention-based feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.

Conclusion: A holistic, iterative SPORTS framework tightly couples VPS, VO, and SR to overcome segmentation gaps, dynamic interference, and view sparsity, delivering improved pose, depth, tracking, and high-quality novel view synthesis across diverse datasets.

Abstract: The scene perception, understanding, and simulation are fundamental
techniques for embodied-AI agents, while existing solutions are still prone to
segmentation deficiency, dynamic objects' interference, sensor data sparsity,
and view-limitation problems. This paper proposes a novel framework, named
SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic
Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into
an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive
attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via
enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically
adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy
is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation
results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the
confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the
camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the
learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is
beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to
synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based
feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the
odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.

*A. Alfarano,L. Venturoli,D. Negueruela del Castillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces VQArt-Bench for visual art VQA in cultural heritage, built via a multi-agent pipeline; reveals MLLMs struggle with counting and show gaps between proprietary and open-source models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VQA benchmarks inadequately assess deep semantic understanding in domain-specific art analysis, leading models to exploit shortcuts. A nuanced benchmark is needed to probe symbolic meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships in cultural heritage.

Method: Develop a large-scale VQA benchmark (VQArt-Bench) using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents collaboratively generate validated, linguistically diverse questions. Organize questions along visual understanding dimensions. Evaluate 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs.

Result: 14 SOTA MLLMs reveal significant limitations; models struggle on simple counting tasks; a clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models is observed.

Conclusion: The benchmark exposes gaps in current MLLMs' deep visual reasoning within cultural heritage contexts and motivates further research to enhance reasoning capabilities, linguistic diversity in questions, and more robust evaluation of visual understanding.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual
Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic
understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis.
Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these
questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This
limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than
engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a
new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark
is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents
collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse
questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual
understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic
meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in
current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a
clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

*Wenpu Li,Bangyan Liao,Yi Zhou,Qi Xu,Pian Wan,Peidong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised joint estimation of egomotion and optical flow for event-based (neuro-morphic) vision using implicit representations and geometric constraints, achieving state-of-the-art unsupervised results and competitive performance with supervised methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In neuromorphic vision, estimating optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion jointly is ill-posed due to weak data association; solving them separately with priors introduces bias, overhead, or suboptimal minima. A unified, unsupervised framework is needed to enforce spatial-temporal coherence and geometric consistency without ground-truth depth.

Method: Propose E-MoFlow: model egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an implicit neural representation to embed spatial-temporal coherence. Incorporate differential geometric constraints (structure-and-motion priors) without explicit depth estimation, enabling an end-to-end unsupervised optimization that jointly estimates ego-motion and optical flow.

Result: The framework demonstrates versatility across general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and is competitive with supervised approaches.

Conclusion: Unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via implicit regularization under an unsupervised paradigm, offering robust joint estimation for neuromorphic vision.

Abstract: The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in
3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision
(e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes
solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the
absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this
ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an
explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion
priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably
introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which
parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera
motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we
propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical
flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by
modeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an
implicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal
coherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion
priors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth
estimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our
framework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via
implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments
demonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even
with supervised approaches.

*Zhuotong Cai,Tianyi Zeng,Jiazhen Zhang,Eléonore V. Lieffrig,Kathryn Fontaine,Chenyu You,Enette Mae Revilla,James S. Duncan,Jingmin Xin,Yihuan Lu,John A. Onofrey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep-learning head motion correction method (DL-HMC++) using cross-attention to predict rigid head motion from 1-second 3D PET data, supervised by external hardware-tracking (HMT) measurements, achieving motion-free PET images with high quantitative accuracy across scanners and tracers; code released for reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Head motion causes artifacts and quantification errors in PET imaging. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) is not practical in routine clinical settings, necessitating data-driven, generalizable motion correction.

Method: A supervised deep-learning model with cross-attention (DL-HMC++) that predicts rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data. Trained using dynamic PET scans paired with gold-standard motion from external HMT. Evaluated on two scanners (HRRT, mCT) across four radiotracers (18F-FDG, 18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, 11C-LSN3172176).

Result: DL-HMC++ outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, yielding motion-free images with clear brain structures and reduced artifacts. SUV differences vs. gold-standard HMT are 1.2±0.5% (HRRT) and 0.5±0.2% (mCT). Code available at the provided GitHub repository.

Conclusion: Data-driven PET head motion correction (DL-HMC++) shows strong generalization across scanners and tracers, potentially replacing hardware-based tracking in clinical practice and expanding accessibility to patient populations.

Abstract: Head movement poses a significant challenge in brain positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging, resulting in image artifacts and tracer uptake
quantification inaccuracies. Effective head motion estimation and correction
are crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of
neurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited
applicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention
(DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data.
DL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET
scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT. We evaluate
DL-HMC++ on two PET scanners (HRRT and mCT) and four radiotracers (18F-FDG,
18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, and 11C-LSN3172176) to demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of the approach in large cohort PET studies. Quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, producing motion-free
images with clear delineation of brain structures and reduced motion artifacts
that are indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Brain region of interest
standard uptake value analysis exhibits average difference ratios between
DL-HMC++ and gold-standard HMT to be 1.2 plus-minus 0.5% for HRRT and 0.5
plus-minus 0.2% for mCT. DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven
PET head motion correction to remove the burden of HMT, making motion
correction accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings. The
code is available at https://github.com/maxxxxxxcai/DL-HMC-TMI.

TL;DR: AnyUp is a universal, inference-time feature upsampling method that works across different vision feature extractors without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art upsampling quality and broad applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing upsampling methods are encoder-specific and require retraining for each feature extractor, limiting generalization across diverse features at inference.

Method: Proposes an inference-time feature-agnostic upsampling architecture that operates without encoder-specific training to upsample any vision feature at any resolution.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, preserves feature semantics, and is efficient and easy to apply to downstream tasks.

Conclusion: AnyUp enables robust, generalizable, and practical feature upsampling across diverse vision models and tasks, reducing retraining needs and improving downstream performance.

Abstract: We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to
any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training.
Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be
re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different
feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time
feature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and
improve upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the
art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and
preserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide
range of downstream tasks.

### [77] [Efficient Perceptual Image Super Resolution: AIM 2025 Study and Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12765)
*Bruno Longarela,Marcos V. Conde,Alvaro Garcia,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A benchmark-driven study showing that efficient perceptual SR models under strict resource limits can surpass Real-ESRGAN, with a new 500-image 4K degradation dataset and a 5M-param/2000 GFLOPs cap, establishing modern baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in efficient perceptual super-resolution: existing methods lag in perceptual quality while optimized for speed. This work seeks to replicate/improve Real-ESRGAN under tight computational budgets and provide a realistic, challenging benchmark without ground-truth HR, spanning diverse degradations.

Method: Develop and benchmark several lightweight perceptual SR approaches constrained to 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs for 960x540 input. Evaluate on a novel 500-image 4K degraded dataset (no HR references). Compare against Real-ESRGAN and other baselines to establish ranking and baselines; propose a standardized evaluation framework.

Result: The top-performing approach outperforms Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets, demonstrating efficiency-based perceptual SR viability and achieving new modern baselines on the proposed benchmark.

Conclusion: Efficient perceptual SR is viable; the study provides a rigorous benchmark and practical baselines, guiding future development toward resource-constrained perceptual SR.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study and benchmark on Efficient
Perceptual Super-Resolution (EPSR). While significant progress has been made in
efficient PSNR-oriented super resolution, approaches focusing on perceptual
quality metrics remain relatively inefficient. Motivated by this gap, we aim to
replicate or improve the perceptual results of Real-ESRGAN while meeting strict
efficiency constraints: a maximum of 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs, calculated
for an input size of 960x540 pixels. The proposed solutions were evaluated on a
novel dataset consisting of 500 test images of 4K resolution, each degraded
using multiple degradation types, without providing the original high-quality
counterparts. This design aims to reflect realistic deployment conditions and
serves as a diverse and challenging benchmark. The top-performing approach
manages to outperform Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets, demonstrating
the potential of efficient methods in the perceptual domain. This paper
establishes the modern baselines for efficient perceptual super resolution.

### [78] [Uncertainty Matters in Dynamic Gaussian Splatting for Monocular 4D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12768)
*Fengzhi Guo,Chih-Chuan Hsu,Sihao Ding,Cheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces USplat4D, an uncertainty-aware extension of dynamic Gaussian Splatting for 4D reconstruction from monocular input, which estimates time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and uses a spatio-temporal graph to guide optimization, yielding better geometry under occlusion and superior view extrapolation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic 3D reconstruction from a single camera is highly under-constrained due to occlusions and extreme viewpoints. Existing dynamic Gaussian Splatting treats all Gaussians equally, leading to motion drift and degraded synthesis when parts are poorly observed.

Method: Estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and construct a spatio-temporal graph to perform uncertainty-aware optimization, propagating reliable motion cues to improve the 4D reconstruction.

Result: Empirical results on diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting, producing more stable geometry under occlusion and higher-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

Conclusion: Accounting for per-Gaussian uncertainty is beneficial for 4D dynamic reconstruction and makes dynamic Gaussian Splatting more robust to occlusion and view changes, as demonstrated by USplat4D.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally
under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel
views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation,
vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether
they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under
occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue
that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views
and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited
visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a
novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates
reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to
estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a
spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on
diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty
consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable
geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

### [79] [What If : Understanding Motion Through Sparse Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12777)
*Stefan Andreas Baumann,Nick Stracke,Timy Phan,Björn Ommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow Poke Transformer (FPT) predicts distributions of local motion conditioned on sparse interactions ('pokes'), delivering multi-modal, interpretable scene dynamics and strong performance across tasks with open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding scene dynamics requires modeling multiple possible outcomes and inherent uncertainty; traditional methods produce a single realization and dense sampling; FPT aims to provide explicit motion distributions conditioned on physical interactions.

Method: Proposes Flow Poke Transformer that outputs a distribution over local motion given pokes; enables multi-modal predictions; evaluated on dense face motion generation and articulated object motion estimation; fine-tuned on out-of-distribution tasks; code released.

Result: Outperforms specialized baselines on dense face motion generation; improves articulation tasks in synthetic/out-of-domain settings; achieves competitive moving part segmentation from pokes; demonstrates versatility and accuracy of flow-based, distributional predictions.

Conclusion: FPT provides an interpretable, flexible framework for modeling local motion distributions under sparse interactions, enabling multi-task performance and generalization; code and models are publicly available.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of a physical scene involves reasoning about the
diverse ways it can potentially change, especially as a result of local
interactions. We present the Flow Poke Transformer (FPT), a novel framework for
directly predicting the distribution of local motion, conditioned on sparse
interactions termed "pokes". Unlike traditional methods that typically only
enable dense sampling of a single realization of scene dynamics, FPT provides
an interpretable directly accessible representation of multi-modal scene
motion, its dependency on physical interactions and the inherent uncertainties
of scene dynamics. We also evaluate our model on several downstream tasks to
enable comparisons with prior methods and highlight the flexibility of our
approach. On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model
surpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly
out-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant
improvements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation.
Additionally, predicting explicit motion distributions directly enables our
method to achieve competitive performance on tasks like moving part
segmentation from pokes which further demonstrates the versatility of our FPT.

### [80] [SRUM: Fine-Grained Self-Rewarding for Unified Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12784)
*Weiyang Jin,Yuwei Niu,Jiaqi Liao,Chengqi Duan,Aoxue Li,Shenghua Gao,Xihui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SRUM is a self-rewarding post-training framework that lets a Unified Multimodal Model use its own understanding module as an internal evaluator to improve image generation via a global-local dual reward, without extra human-labeled data, achieving notable gains on T2I-CompBench and T2I-ReasonBench.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap where strong visual understanding does not reliably translate to faithful visual generation. The work seeks self-improvement by having the model's understanding guide and reward its own generation, avoiding reliance on external labeled data.

Method: Introduce a global-local dual reward system as part of a self-reinforcing post-training loop. The model's understanding module acts as an internal evaluator to provide corrective signals to the generation module. The global reward enforces overall visual semantics and layout, while the local reward refines object-level fidelity. The approach is designed to work with existing UMM architectures and does not require additional human-labeled data.

Result: Quantitative gains are reported: T2I-CompBench score improves from 82.18 to 88.37; T2I-ReasonBench score improves from 43.82 to 46.75.

Conclusion: SRUM demonstrates a new paradigm for self-guided improvement in Unified Multimodal Models by coupling understanding with generation through self-reward signals, with strong generalization across UMM designs and without extra labeled data.

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models
(UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding
capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where
a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual
generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user
instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.
This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve
self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation
module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a
self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing
UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own
understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective
signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional
human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a
global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity
of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward}
ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a
\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads
to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance
on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82
to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for
enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation
via self-rewarding.

*Felix Taubner,Ruihang Zhang,Mathieu Tuli,Sherwin Bahmani,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVP4D generates animatable multi-view videos of digital humans from a single reference image and target expressions, distills these into a real-time 4D avatar, and improves realism and 3D/temporal consistency over prior single-view methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the cost, time, and expertise needed to create photorealistic avatars. Single-image methods lack robust multi-view constraints and explicit 3D representations, causing quality drop when rendering from novel viewpoints.

Method: Utilizes a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model to synthesize hundreds of frames simultaneously across viewpoints up to 360 degrees around a target subject, driven by a single reference image and target expressions, followed by distillation into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real time.

Result: Compared with prior methods, MVP4D significantly improves realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of generated avatars. It enables real-time rendering of a 4D avatar from a single image.

Conclusion: MVP4D presents a practical pipeline for high-quality, view-consistent 4D avatars from minimal input, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film, VR, and beyond.

Abstract: Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in
virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film,
virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and
animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,
requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from
professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation
models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars
from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While
these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer
compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or
an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when
rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,
we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital
humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,
MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and
generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to
360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this
model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach
significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of
generated avatars compared to previous methods.

### [83] [UniFusion: Vision-Language Model as Unified Encoder in Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12789)
*Kevin Li,Manuel Brack,Sudeep Katakol,Hareesh Ravi,Ajinkya Kale*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFusion introduces a diffusion model conditioned on a frozen Vision-Language Model (VLM) using Layerwise Attention Pooling (LAP) to unify multimodal encoding; adds VERIFI for text-prompt rewriting conditioned on VLM tokens; shows improved text-image alignment, faithful visual transfer, and strong zero-shot editing/generalization with a single-image training regime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between image and text encoders in diffusion models, enabling cross-modal reasoning and knowledge transfer without training large unified models or maintaining multiple encoders; reduce computational/resource demands while improving alignment and editing capabilities.

Method: Use a frozen VLM as a unified multimodal encoder. Introduce Layerwise Attention Pooling (LAP) to extract high-level semantics and low-level details from text and visual tokens to condition the diffusion model. Develop VERIFI (VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexible Inference) that conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) on text tokens produced by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. Finetune on editing tasks to enhance cross-modal alignment and knowledge transfer; exhibit zero-shot generalization from single-image editing to multiple image references.

Result: LAP outperforms shallow fusion baselines for text-image alignment and faithful visual transfer from VLM to diffusion model, improving editing capabilities. VERIFI enhances conditioning alignment and VLM reasoning integration, increasing flexibility at inference. Fine-tuning yields better cross-modal alignment, improved editing performance, and strong generalization, including zero-shot extension from a single edited image to multiple references.

Conclusion: A unified encoder approach with LAP and VERIFI enables effective cross-modal generation and editing with improved alignment and knowledge transfer while reducing computational demands. The model demonstrates robust generalization from limited editing data, supporting broader applicability in multimodal generation and editing tasks.

Abstract: Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most
existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text.
This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal
reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use
the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train
large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands
substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its
accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model
conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a
unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention
Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level
details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion
generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion
architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of
visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We
propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),
which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens
generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the
alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning
capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In
addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for
generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits
tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image
editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating
the unified encoder design of UniFusion.

### [84] [ViCO: A Training Strategy towards Semantic Aware Dynamic High-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12793)
*Long Cui,Weiyun Wang,Jie Shao,Zichen Wen,Gen Luo,Linfeng Zhang,Yanting Zhang,Yu Qiao,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViCO enables semantically adaptive vision token allocation in MLLMs by using multiple MLP-based image compressors and a Visual Resolution Router, cutting vision tokens by up to 50% while preserving perception, reasoning, and OCR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs incur high inference costs from a large number of vision tokens. There is a need to adapt token counts to semantic complexity rather than simply image size, to maintain efficiency without sacrificing capabilities.

Method: Train with multiple MLP connectors, each applying a different image compression ratio to downsample vision tokens according to semantic complexity. Minimize KL divergence between model responses conditioned on different connectors. At inference, use a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) to select the appropriate compression for each image patch.

Result: Achieves up to 50% reduction in vision tokens while maintaining perception, reasoning, and OCR abilities.

Conclusion: ViCO contributes to more efficient multimodal LLMs by tying token allocation to semantic content rather than resolution alone, offering dynamic token budgeting and promising a path for future efficient MLLMs; code/models will be released.

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased
inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs.
In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training
algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic
complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our
method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image
compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic
complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between
the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we
introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that
automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch.
Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the
number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically
adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of
vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning,
and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of
more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future
research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CuMPerLay provides a differentiable vectorization layer that makes Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) usable inside deep nets by decomposing CMP into learnable single-parameter persistences; it offers stability guarantees and shows improvements in classification/segmentation, especially with limited data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMP offers rich topological information for images but is hindered by the complexity of multifiltrations and the vectorization of CMP; integrating CMP into DL pipelines requires a differentiable, learnable, scalable vectorization approach.

Method: Introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes. CuMPerLay decomposes CMP into a combination of learnable single-parameter persistences with jointly learned bifiltration functions, leveraging differentiability to produce robust topological feature vectors that can feed architectures like Swin Transformers.

Result: The approach comes with theoretical guarantees for stability under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Empirically, it yields improved classification and segmentation performance on benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets, especially in limited-data scenarios.

Conclusion: CuMPerLay is a promising direction for integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured image analysis and enables effective use of CMP in modern DL architectures.

Abstract: We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables
the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning
pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work
with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration
structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we
introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes.
Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable
single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly
learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature
vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as
Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our
vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on
benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit
CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in
limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for
integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured
image analysis.

*Yingyan Li,Shuyao Shang,Weisong Liu,Bing Zhan,Haochen Wang,Yuqi Wang,Yuntao Chen,Xiaoman Wang,Yasong An,Chufeng Tang,Lu Hou,Lue Fan,Zhaoxiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DriveVLA-W0 uses world-model self-supervision to scale VLA driving models, with autoregressive (discrete tokens) and diffusion (continuous features) world models, plus a lightweight action expert; achieves strong gains and accelerates data scaling on NAVSIM and a large in-house dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA driving models have high capacity but are limited by sparse, low-dimensional action supervision. Leveraging world modeling to predict future frames provides a dense, self-supervised signal that encourages learning of environment dynamics and better generalization, enabling more effective data scaling.

Method: Introduce DriveVLA-W0, a training paradigm that uses world modeling to predict future images. Instantiate two archetypes: an autoregressive world model with discrete visual tokens and a diffusion world model with continuous visual features. Build on world-model representations with a lightweight action expert to mitigate inference latency for real-time deployment. Validate on NAVSIM v1/v2 and a large in-house dataset (680x larger).

Result: DriveVLA-W0 significantly outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. It amplifies the data scaling law, with performance gains increasing as the training dataset size grows, as demonstrated on NAVSIM v1/v2 and the substantially larger in-house dataset.

Conclusion: World-model-based self-supervision can unlock latent capacity in VLA driving models, enabling stronger performance and better data scalability. The approach is versatile across VLA architectures (autoregressive discrete tokens and diffusion continuous features) and remains practical with a lightweight action expert to address latency.

Abstract: Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a
promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However,
VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is
supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their
representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose
\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to
predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that
compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.
We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA
archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual
tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual
features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we
introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for
real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a
680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly
outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling
law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size
increases.

*Qing Jiang,Junan Huo,Xingyu Chen,Yuda Xiong,Zhaoyang Zeng,Yihao Chen,Tianhe Ren,Junzhi Yu,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rex-Omni is a 3B-scale multimodal LLM that matches or surpasses regression-based detectors in zero-shot object perception on COCO/LVIS, achieved via (1) task formulation with quantized coordinate tokens (0–999), (2) data engines for rich grounding/referring/pointing supervision, and (3) a two-stage training pipeline (SFT on 22M data + GRPO-based reinforcement post-training with geometry-aware rewards) to bridge discrete-continuous coordinates and reduce duplicates, enabling versatile language-grounded vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between traditional coordinate regression detectors and large-language-model–assisted perception, addressing issues like low recall, duplicate predictions, and coordinate misalignment, and unlock broader language-aware visual capabilities.

Method: 1) Task Formulation: represent coordinates as special tokens corresponding to quantized values 0–999 to ease learning and improve token efficiency. 2) Data Engines: construct multiple data engines to generate high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data for semantically rich supervision. 3) Training Pipeline: a two-stage process consisting of supervised fine-tuning on ~22M data followed by GRPO-based reinforcement post-training with geometry-aware rewards, which improves box accuracy and mitigates undesirable duplicate predictions arising from teacher-guided SFT.

Result: On benchmarks such as COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni achieves performance comparable to or exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in zero-shot settings. Beyond traditional detection, it demonstrates versatile capabilities including object referring, pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR, and key-pointing, evaluated across dedicated benchmarks.

Conclusion: Rex-Omni demonstrates that a 3B-scale multimodal LLM, when equipped with quantized coordinate tokens, semantically rich data supervision, and a two-stage training/ RL framework, can reach state-of-the-art or competitive object perception while enabling a broad suite of language-grounded vision tasks, signaling a path toward more versatile, language-aware perception systems.

Abstract: Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate
regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although
recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face
challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate
misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a
3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On
benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or
exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot
setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use
special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the
model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate
prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate
high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically
rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage
training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with
GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages
geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous
coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable
behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature
of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent
language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring,
pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and
key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe
that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual
perception systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepMMSearch-R1 enables on-demand, multi-turn web search for multimodal LLMs by dynamically crafting image- and text-search queries, trained with cold-start supervised finetuning and online reinforcement learning, and supported by a new DeepMMSearchVQA dataset; it outperforms existing retrieval-augmented methods on knowledge-intensive tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multimodal LLMs must access external, up-to-date knowledge and reason across visual and textual information. Existing retrieval-based approaches (RAG, search agents) have rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and poorly constructed queries, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal results.

Method: A two-stage training pipeline: (1) cold-start supervised fine-tuning; (2) online reinforcement learning optimization. DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant image crops and iteratively refine text search queries based on retrieved information, enabling self-reflection and self-correction. A new DeepMMSearchVQA dataset is created by automating data collection while injecting real-world web information, featuring diverse, multi-hop queries that fuse textual and visual data and teach the model when and what to search, which tools to use, and how to reason over results.

Result: Extensive experiments on knowledge-intensive benchmarks show superiority over baselines; the study provides detailed analysis and insights to advance multimodal web-search.

Conclusion: This work introduces the first multimodal LLM capable of on-demand, multi-turn web searches with adaptive query crafting for both image and text inputs, backed by a dedicated VQA dataset and a two-stage training strategy, marking a significant step toward robust, real-world multimodal web-access.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require
access to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic
and ever-changing real-world information in order to address
information-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches,
such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search
equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and
poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and
suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,
the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web
searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.
Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops
of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively
adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling
self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage
training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an
online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce
DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated
pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This
dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual
information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which
search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct
extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results
and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.

### [89] [Topological Signatures of ReLU Neural Network Activation Patterns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12700)
*Vicente Bosca,Tatum Rask,Sunia Tanweer,Andrew R. Tawfeek,Branden Stone*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper analyzes ReLU-induced activation polytope partitions in feedforward networks and finds that the Fiedler partition of the dual graph aligns with binary decision boundaries, while the homology of the cellular partition tracks training dynamics in regression, suggesting topology mirrors learning and decision geometry.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how ReLU-driven activation patterns partition input space and how these topological/graph-theoretic signatures relate to model decisions and training dynamics.

Method: Examine polytope decompositions induced by ReLU activations in feedforward nets. For binary classification, study the Fiedler partition of the dual graph and its relation to the decision boundary. For regression, compute the homology of the cellular decomposition and compare with training loss and polyhedral cell-count during training.

Result: Observed correlation: the Fiedler partition of the dual graph tends to align with the network's decision boundary in binary classification. In regression, the evolution of the homology of the polyhedral cells shows patterns that parallel changes in training loss and polyhedral cell-count as training proceeds.

Conclusion: Topological signatures of ReLU activations reflect decision geometry and training dynamics, offering a lens to understand and potentially diagnose or guide learning through topology-aware analyses.

Abstract: This paper explores the topological signatures of ReLU neural network
activation patterns. We consider feedforward neural networks with ReLU
activation functions and analyze the polytope decomposition of the feature
space induced by the network. Mainly, we investigate how the Fiedler partition
of the dual graph and show that it appears to correlate with the decision
boundary -- in the case of binary classification. Additionally, we compute the
homology of the cellular decomposition -- in a regression task -- to draw
similar patterns in behavior between the training loss and polyhedral
cell-count, as the model is trained.

### [90] [Think as a Doctor: An Interpretable AI Approach for ICU Mortality Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11745)
*Qingwen Li,Xiaohang Zhao,Xiao Han,Hailiang Huang,Lanjuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoDoctor is an interpretable ICU mortality predictor that integrates clinical course identification, demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness via prototype learning; it outperforms baselines and yields clinically meaningful interpretations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a demand for interpretable ICU mortality models that align with real-world decision processes; existing work often emphasizes demographic heterogeneity and ignores clinical course identification and prognostication awareness, raising trust and regulatory concerns.

Method: Two modules: (1) Prognostic Clinical Course Identification using prototype learning to uncover clinical course patterns and a regularization mechanism to embed prognostication awareness; (2) Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition with cohort-specific prototypes and risk adjustments, delivering intrinsic interpretability.

Result: ProtoDoctor achieves superior predictive accuracy compared with state-of-the-art baselines; human evaluations indicate its interpretations are more clinically meaningful, trustworthy, and actionable in ICU practice.

Conclusion: Integrating all three ICU decision-making elements into an intrinsically interpretable framework yields better performance and practical interpretability, aligning with clinical workflows and regulatory expectations.

Abstract: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality prediction, which estimates a patient's
mortality status at discharge using EHRs collected early in an ICU admission,
is vital in critical care. For this task, predictive accuracy alone is
insufficient; interpretability is equally essential for building clinical trust
and meeting regulatory standards, a topic that has attracted significant
attention in information system research. Accordingly, an ideal solution should
enable intrinsic interpretability and align its reasoning with three key
elements of the ICU decision-making practices: clinical course identification,
demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness. However, conventional
approaches largely focus on demographic heterogeneity, overlooking clinical
course identification and prognostication awareness. Recent prototype learning
methods address clinical course identification, yet the integration of the
other elements into such frameworks remains underexplored. To address these
gaps, we propose ProtoDoctor, a novel ICU mortality prediction framework that
delivers intrinsic interpretability while integrating all three elements of the
ICU decision-making practices into its reasoning process. Methodologically,
ProtoDoctor features two key innovations: the Prognostic Clinical Course
Identification module and the Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition module. The
former enables the identification of clinical courses via prototype learning
and achieves prognostication awareness using a novel regularization mechanism.
The latter models demographic heterogeneity through cohort-specific prototypes
and risk adjustments. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that
ProtoDoctor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.
Human evaluations further confirm that its interpretations are more clinically
meaningful, trustworthy, and applicable in ICU practice.

### [91] [GAR: Generative Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Formal Theorem Proving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11769)
*Ruida Wang,Jiarui Yao,Rui Pan,Shizhe Diao,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GAR is an adversarial RL framework that co-evolves problem generation and solving to improve formal proof performance in verifiable environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed problem sets and expensive RL/ expert iteration hinder training efficiency and limit tackling more complex theorems; there is a need for adaptive curricula that scale with the prover’s evolving capability.

Method: Jointly train a problem composer and a solver in an adversarial loop, introducing an implicit curriculum learning mechanism that aligns task difficulty with the prover’s current capability. The framework is demonstrated in verifiable environments (Lean/ theorem proving) and evaluated with models like Goedel-Prover-V2-8B and DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B on benchmarks such as MiniF2F-Test and ProofNet-Test.

Result: Training with GAR yields an average relative improvement in pass@32 of 4.20% on MiniF2F-Test. For DeepSeek-Prover-V2, pass@32 on ProofNet-Test rises from 22.58% to 25.81%.

Conclusion: GAR provides a general RL paradigm for co-evolution of problem generation and solving within verifiable environments, improving training efficiency and enabling solving of more advanced theorems.

Abstract: Solving math problems through verifiable languages such as Lean has
significantly impacted both the mathematics and computer science communities.
Current state-of-the-art models are often trained with expensive online
Reinforcement Learning (RL) or expert iteration. However, these approaches rely
on fixed problem sets, which causes inefficient training and limits the model
to tackle complex problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose GAR:
Generative Adversarial Reinforcement learning, a comprehensive RL training
framework that jointly trains the problem composer and solver in an adversarial
loop. GAR introduces an implicit curriculum learning mechanism, which aligns
task difficulty with the prover's evolving capability. It thereby improves the
training efficiency and enables stronger performance of proving advanced
theorems. Experiments show that with GAR training, Goedel-Prover-V2-8B and
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieve an average relative improvement in pass@32 of
4.20% on MiniF2F-Test benchmark, while DeepSeek-Prover-V2's pass@32 on
ProofNet-Test increases from 22.58% to 25.81%. Beyond formal proving, GAR
establishes a general RL paradigm for co-evolution of problem generation and
solving under verifiable environments.

### [92] [Combining Euclidean and Hyperbolic Representations for Node-level Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11827)
*Simone Mungari,Ettore Ritacco,Pietro Sabatino*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Joint Euclidean and Hyperbolic GNNs for node-level anomaly detection (NAD). Each node has two views (original features; structural features from random walks and degrees) embedded in two geometries. A multi-Graph Autoencoder with contrastive alignment detects anomalies as nodes with high cross-view discrepancy. Evaluated on four real-world datasets, it outperforms baselines, showing benefits of combining geometric representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NAD is challenging due to diverse structural patterns and feature distributions. Capturing complementary geometric information by combining Euclidean and Hyperbolic representations and aligning cross-view embeddings helps identify subtle anomalies that are hard to detect with a single geometry.

Method: Construct two GNN streams: one in Euclidean space using original node features, and one in Hyperbolic space using structural features (from random walks and degrees). Embed nodes into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. Use a multi-Graph Autoencoder with a contrastive objective to align the two embeddings across spaces. Identify anomalies as nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile (high cross-view discrepancy).

Result: Empirical evaluation on four real-world datasets shows Janus consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, demonstrating that combining Euclidean and Hyperbolic representations yields robust detection of subtle and complex graph anomalies.

Conclusion: Combining multiple geometric representations improves NAD performance and robustness; the cross-view alignment via contrastive learning effectively highlights anomalous nodes.

Abstract: Node-level anomaly detection (NAD) is challenging due to diverse structural
patterns and feature distributions. As such, NAD is a critical task with
several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to
recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages
Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects
of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the
original features and structural features derived from random walks and
degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi
Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as
regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic
spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus
likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus
consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating
that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and
effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.

### [93] [Schrödinger bridge for generative AI: Soft-constrained formulation and convergence analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11829)
*Jin Ma,Ying Tan,Renyuan Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Soft-constrained Schrödinger bridges (SCSBP) relax hard terminal constraints with a penalty, yielding a flexible McKean-Vlasov control problem. The paper proves existence for all penalty levels and linear convergence to classical SBP as penalty grows, using Doob h-transforms, Schrödinger potentials, Gamma-convergence, and a fixed-point scheme coupling measures with entropic OT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard terminal constraints in classical Schrödinger bridges cause instability in high-dimensional or data-scarce settings. A penalty-based soft constraint offers robustness and flexibility, enabling stable generative modeling, fine-tuning, and transfer learning within an entropy-regularized, stochastic control framework.

Method: Introduce the soft-constrained Schrödinger bridge problem (SCSBP) with a penalty term replacing hard terminal constraints. Prove existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels. Show that as the penalty grows, optimal controls and value functions converge linearly to those of the classical SBP. Develop analysis leveraging Doob’s h-transform representations, Schrödinger potentials stability, Gamma-convergence, and a fixed-point argument that couples optimization over measures with an auxiliary entropic optimal transport problem.

Result: Establishes the first quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges. Demonstrates existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and linear convergence of both controls and value functions to the classical SBP as penalty → ∞.

Conclusion: Penalty regularization yields robust and flexible generative modeling capabilities (and improves fine-tuning and transfer learning) by stabilizing the bridge construction, with solid theoretical guarantees linking the soft- and hard-constrained formulations.

Abstract: Generative AI can be framed as the problem of learning a model that maps
simple reference measures into complex data distributions, and it has recently
found a strong connection to the classical theory of the Schr\"odinger bridge
problems (SBPs) due partly to their common nature of interpolating between
prescribed marginals via entropy-regularized stochastic dynamics. However, the
classical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to
instability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or
data-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the
so-called soft-constrained Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the
terminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation
leads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.
  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and
prove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions
converge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on
Doob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\"odinger
potentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an
optimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic
optimal transport problem. These results not only provide the first
quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges but also shed
light on how penalty regularization enables robust generative modeling,
fine-tuning, and transfer learning.

*Narine Kokhlikyan,Kamalika Chaudhuri,Saeed Mahloujifar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a scalable zeroth-order method to estimate training-data influence using only checkpoint losses, improving efficiency and accuracy for self-influence and train–test influence on large models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how individual training examples shape a model’s predictions, enabling data selection, debugging, and data quality assessment. Existing influence estimators are costly or inaccurate for large models, hindering scalability.

Method: A zeroth-order approximation that uses only the loss values recorded at intermediate checkpoints (and the checkpoints themselves). No gradients or Hessian computations are required, making it applicable even when the loss is non-differentiable.

Result: The method achieves superior accuracy for estimating self-influence and comparable or improved accuracy for train–test influence on fine-tuned large language models, with lower computational and memory requirements compared to prior approaches.

Conclusion: This approach enables scalable, practical analysis of how training data shapes model behavior across large models and non-differentiable loss landscapes.

Abstract: A critical aspect of analyzing and improving modern machine learning systems
lies in understanding how individual training examples influence a model's
predictive behavior. Estimating this influence enables critical applications,
including data selection and model debugging; in particular, self-influence,
which quantifies the influence of a training point on itself, has found many
uses in data quality assessment and outlier detection. Existing methods for
measuring data influence, however, are often impractical for large models due
to low accuracy or prohibitive computational costs: most approaches either
provide poor approximations or rely on gradients and inverse-Hessian
computations that remain challenging to scale. In this work, we introduce a
highly efficient zeroth-order approximation for estimating the influence of
training data that requires only a fraction of the time and memory footprint of
prior methods. Notably, our method relies solely on loss values of intermediate
checkpoints on the training and test data, along with the checkpoints
themselves, making it broadly applicable even when the loss function of
interest is non-differentiable. Beyond its computational efficiency, our
approach achieves superior accuracy in estimating self-influence and comparable
or improved accuracy in estimating train-test influence for fine-tuned large
language models, enabling scalable and practical analysis of how training data
shapes model behavior.

### [95] [Don't Walk the Line: Boundary Guidance for Filtered Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11834)
*Sarah Ball,Andreas Haupt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Boundary Guidance uses reinforcement learning to steer generation away from the safety classifier's decision boundary, improving safety and utility for generative models across prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard fine-tuning to reduce classifier probability often concentrates outputs near the classifier margin, raising false positives and false negatives. This suboptimal trade-off motivates a method that directly avoids the margin.

Method: A reinforcement learning fine-tuning approach that explicitly steers generation away from the classifier's margin, optimizing a reward that penalizes proximity to the boundary.

Result: On jailbreak and ambiguous prompts benchmarks, Boundary Guidance improves both safety and output utility as judged by LLMs. Ablations across model scales and reward designs show the method is robust.

Conclusion: Boundary Guidance provides a robust, generalizable RL-fine-tuning strategy that reduces reliance on proximity to the classifier boundary, achieving better safety-utility trade-offs across models and reward settings.

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter
harmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator
to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it
often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision
boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose
Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly
steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of
jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and
the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive
ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of
our approach.

### [96] [WaveletDiff: Multilevel Wavelet Diffusion For Time Series Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11839)
*Yu-Hsiang Wang,Olgica Milenkovic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WaveletDiff leverages wavelet-domain diffusion for time series, using per-level transformers, cross-level attention, adaptive gating, and Parseval-based energy constraints; outperforms baselines across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series are abundant but data-scarce; current generative models in time or frequency domain fail to capture multi-scale structure; need spectral-faithful multi-scale generative models.

Method: Train diffusion models on wavelet coefficients; dedicated transformers per decomposition level; cross-level attention with adaptive gating; energy preservation per level via Parseval's theorem; diffusion process operates in wavelet domain; evaluation across six real-world datasets with five metrics.

Result: Consistent outperformance of state-of-the-art time/frequency-domain generative methods on short and long series across multiple metrics; discriminative and Context-FID scores ~3x better than second-best baseline on average.

Conclusion: WaveletDiff demonstrates that modeling in the wavelet domain with multi-resolution transformer and energy-preservation constraints yields high-fidelity synthetic time series across domains; likely helps with data scarcity.

Abstract: Time series are ubiquitous in many applications that involve forecasting,
classification and causal inference tasks, such as healthcare, finance, audio
signal processing and climate sciences. Still, large, high-quality time series
datasets remain scarce. Synthetic generation can address this limitation;
however, current models confined either to the time or frequency domains
struggle to reproduce the inherently multi-scaled structure of real-world time
series. We introduce WaveletDiff, a novel framework that trains diffusion
models directly on wavelet coefficients to exploit the inherent
multi-resolution structure of time series data. The model combines dedicated
transformers for each decomposition level with cross-level attention mechanisms
that enable selective information exchange between temporal and frequency
scales through adaptive gating. It also incorporates energy preservation
constraints for individual levels based on Parseval's theorem to preserve
spectral fidelity throughout the diffusion process. Comprehensive tests across
six real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains
demonstrate that WaveletDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
time-domain and frequency-domain generative methods on both short and long time
series across five diverse performance metrics. For example, WaveletDiff
achieves discriminative scores and Context-FID scores that are $3\times$
smaller on average than the second-best baseline across all datasets.

TL;DR: Empirically studies how replay ratio and compute budget affect continued pretraining for task adaptation, finding an optimal ratio and offering guidelines to balance task performance with knowledge retention on bAbI tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address catastrophic forgetting while adapting language models to new tasks, by understanding how replay ratio configurations interact with computational budgets.

Method: Systematic empirical study using synthetic data generation to adapt LMs to the bAbI reasoning tasks. Evaluates multiple total token budgets and replay ratio configurations, measuring both task mastery and general knowledge retention.

Result: There exists an optimal replay ratio under a given budget that balances task-specific performance with knowledge retention. The study provides empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on computational budget to achieve strong task adaptation with reduced training costs.

Conclusion: Practitioners can use the guidelines to choose replay ratios that optimize the trade-off between acquiring new task capabilities and preserving existing knowledge under compute constraints.

Abstract: Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a
fundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied
synthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing
task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain
poorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the
interplay between replay ratio configuration and computational budget when
adapting language models to new tasks. Using the bAbI reasoning tasks as our
target objective, we apply synthetic data generation and systematically
evaluate different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations. We
analyze their effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention. Our
experiments reveal an optimal configuration that balances task-specific
performance with general knowledge retention. Based on our findings, we provide
empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on
computational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation
with significantly reduced training costs.

*Saroj Basnet,Shafkat Farabi,Tharindu Ranasinghe,Diptesh Kanoji,Marcos Zampieri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Seven state-of-the-art open-source VLMs were evaluated for detecting multimodal sarcasm and generating explanations across three sarcasm datasets. Models show moderate binary sarcasm detection but struggle to provide high-quality, visually grounded explanations without task-specific finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether current open-source vision-language models can tackle subjective multimodal phenomena like sarcasm and explain their reasoning, to gauge readiness for real-world analysis and explainability.

Method: Zero-, one-, and few-shot prompting of BLIP2, InstructBLIP, OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, PaliGemma, Gemma3, and Qwen-VL; evaluation on Muse, MMSD2.0, SarcNet datasets; measure binary sarcasm detection and quality of generated explanations highlighting visual-textual incongruities.

Result: Moderate success in detecting sarcasm; explanations quality remains poor without task-specific finetuning; some models may need fine-tuning or instruction tuning to improve explainability.

Conclusion: Current VLMs are not yet capable of consistently producing high-quality explanations for sarcasm; advancement requires targeted fine-tuning, better multimodal reasoning, and possibly task-specific datasets for training explainability.

Abstract: Recent advances in open-source vision-language models (VLMs) offer new
opportunities for understanding complex and subjective multimodal phenomena
such as sarcasm. In this work, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art VLMs - BLIP2,
InstructBLIP, OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, PaliGemma, Gemma3, and Qwen-VL - on their
ability to detect multimodal sarcasm using zero-, one-, and few-shot prompting.
Furthermore, we evaluate the models' capabilities in generating explanations to
sarcastic instances. We evaluate the capabilities of VLMs on three benchmark
sarcasm datasets (Muse, MMSD2.0, and SarcNet). Our primary objectives are
twofold: (1) to quantify each model's performance in detecting sarcastic
image-caption pairs, and (2) to assess their ability to generate human-quality
explanations that highlight the visual-textual incongruities driving sarcasm.
Our results indicate that, while current models achieve moderate success in
binary sarcasm detection, they are still not able to generate high-quality
explanations without task-specific finetuning.

*Aurelie Leribaux,Rafael Oyamada,Johannes De Smedt,Zahra Dasht Bozorgi,Artem Polyvyanyy,Jochen De Weerdt*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Incorporating time-varying actor behavior signals into predictive process monitoring improves throughput-time forecasting compared to TT-only models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Process execution is resource-driven; existing PPM largely ignores dynamic actor behavior; modeling actor behavior as time series could improve predictive accuracy.

Method: Construct multivariate time series combining throughput time with actor-centric features (actor involvement, continuation frequency, interruption, handover, and durations); train and compare multiple models on real-life event logs.

Result: Actor-enriched models achieve better predictive performance (lower RMSE/MAE, higher R^2) than TT-only baselines.

Conclusion: Modeling actor behavior over time enhances forecasting of performance indicators and supports proactive decision-making; suggests integrating actor dynamics into PPM pipelines.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) is a key task in Process Mining that aims
to predict future behavior, outcomes, or performance indicators. Accurate
prediction of the latter is critical for proactive decision-making. Given that
processes are often resource-driven, understanding and incorporating actor
behavior in forecasting is crucial. Although existing research has incorporated
aspects of actor behavior, its role as a time-varying signal in PPM remains
limited. This study investigates whether incorporating actor behavior
information, modeled as time series, can improve the predictive performance of
throughput time (TT) forecasting models. Using real-life event logs, we
construct multivariate time series that include TT alongside actor-centric
features, i.e., actor involvement, the frequency of continuation, interruption,
and handover behaviors, and the duration of these behaviors. We train and
compare several models to study the benefits of adding actor behavior. The
results show that actor-enriched models consistently outperform baseline
models, which only include TT features, in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R2. These
findings demonstrate that modeling actor behavior over time and incorporating
this information into forecasting models enhances performance indicator
predictions.

### [100] [Improving Knowledge Graph Embeddings through Contrastive Learning with Negative Statements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11868)
*Rita T. Sousa,Heiko Paulheim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dual-model knowledge graph embedding approach uses explicitly stated negative statements by training two parallel embeddings on positives and negatives, generating hard negatives via cross-model scoring, leading to improved link prediction and triple classification on general and domain-specific graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open World Assumption in real-world knowledge graphs means many non-quoted or unknown triples are not false; negative statements are scarce but valuable for distinguishing false from unknown and for better embeddings, addressing limitations of Closed/Local Closed World assumptions.

Method: Train two embedding models in parallel—one on positive triples and one on negative triples. Each model corrupts positive triples to generate candidate negatives and uses the other model to score and select the most likely negatives for training. Evaluate on link prediction and triple classification across general-purpose and domain-specific KGs.

Result: Extensive experiments show the proposed dual-model approach improves predictive performance over state-of-the-art embedding models, demonstrating the value of incorporating explicit negative knowledge into KG embeddings.

Conclusion: Incorporating meaningful negative knowledge through a dual-model training framework enhances KG embeddings and downstream tasks, highlighting the benefit of leveraging explicit negative statements under Open World assumptions.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs represent information as structured triples and serve as the
backbone for a wide range of applications, including question answering, link
prediction, and recommendation systems. A prominent line of research for
exploring knowledge graphs involves graph embedding methods, where entities and
relations are represented in low-dimensional vector spaces that capture
underlying semantics and structure. However, most existing methods rely on
assumptions such as the Closed World Assumption or Local Closed World
Assumption, treating missing triples as false. This contrasts with the Open
World Assumption underlying many real-world knowledge graphs. Furthermore,
while explicitly stated negative statements can help distinguish between false
and unknown triples, they are rarely included in knowledge graphs and are often
overlooked during embedding training.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that integrates explicitly
declared negative statements into the knowledge embedding learning process. Our
approach employs a dual-model architecture, where two embedding models are
trained in parallel, one on positive statements and the other on negative
statements. During training, each model generates negative samples by
corrupting positive samples and selecting the most likely candidates as scored
by the other model. The proposed approach is evaluated on both general-purpose
and domain-specific knowledge graphs, with a focus on link prediction and
triple classification tasks. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach improves predictive performance over state-of-the-art embedding
models, demonstrating the value of integrating meaningful negative knowledge
into embedding learning.

*Xiaohang Tang,Zhuowen Cheng,Satyabrat Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Conservative Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (CART) enhances the robustness of Decision Transformer in adversarial stochastic games by conditioning on NashQ values from stage-games, yielding more robust and conservative policies with better worst-case performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the largely unexplored adversarial robustness of sequence-modeling RL, specifically for the Decision Transformer, by modeling protagonist–adversary interactions as stage games and pursuing robustness to stochastic transitions.

Method: Define a stage-game between protagonist and adversary at each step; payoff is the expected maximum value over future states; derive NashQ values from these stage-games; condition Transformer policies on NashQ to obtain CART policies that are adversarially robust and conservative to transition uncertainty.

Result: Empirically, CART achieves more accurate minimax value estimation and consistently superior worst-case returns across a range of adversarial stochastic games.

Conclusion: CART is the first framework to enhance the adversarial robustness of Decision Transformers in adversarial stochastic games, achieving robust minimax value estimation and improved worst-case performance through NashQ-conditioned policies.

Abstract: The Transformer, a highly expressive architecture for sequence modeling, has
recently been adapted to solve sequential decision-making, most notably through
the Decision Transformer (DT), which learns policies by conditioning on desired
returns. Yet, the adversarial robustness of reinforcement learning methods
based on sequence modeling remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce the
Conservative Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (CART), to our knowledge
the first framework designed to enhance the robustness of DT in adversarial
stochastic games. We formulate the interaction between the protagonist and the
adversary at each stage as a stage game, where the payoff is defined as the
expected maximum value over subsequent states, thereby explicitly incorporating
stochastic state transitions. By conditioning Transformer policies on the NashQ
value derived from these stage games, CART generates policy that are
simultaneously less exploitable (adversarially robust) and conservative to
transition uncertainty. Empirically, CART achieves more accurate minimax value
estimation and consistently attains superior worst-case returns across a range
of adversarial stochastic games.

*Chenliang Li,Junyu Leng,Jiaxiang Li,Youbang Sun,Shixiang Chen,Shahin Shahrampour,Alfredo Garcia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AdaRL introduces adaptive rank representations for robust RL. It uses a bi-level setup where the lower level optimizes a policy under fixed-rank constraints with dynamics from a Wasserstein ball around a centroid, and the upper level adaptively adjusts the policy rank by projecting onto a low-rank manifold, balancing bias and variance. It avoids worst-case dynamics while reducing over-parameterization, and empirically outperforms fixed-rank SAC and other robust methods on MuJoCo, converging to the task's intrinsic rank.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust RL often relies on nested min-max optimization over adversarial dynamics, which is computationally expensive and can be overly conservative. There is a need to handle epistemic uncertainty in environment dynamics without over-parameterization by matching policy complexity to the intrinsic task dimension.

Method: Bi-level optimization. Lower level: policy optimization under fixed-rank constraints with dynamics sampled from a Wasserstein ball around a centroid model. Upper level: adaptive rank adjustment by projecting policy parameters onto a low-rank manifold, balancing bias-variance and aligning policy complexity with task difficulty.

Result: Empirical evaluation on MuJoCo continuous control benchmarks shows AdaRL consistently outperforms fixed-rank baselines (e.g., SAC) and state-of-the-art robust RL methods (e.g., RNAC, Parseval). It also converges toward the intrinsic rank of the underlying tasks.

Conclusion: Adaptive low-rank policy representations provide an efficient and principled alternative for robust RL under model uncertainty, avoiding expensive adversarial dynamics and over-parameterization while adapting to the task's intrinsic complexity.

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (Robust RL) seeks to handle epistemic
uncertainty in environment dynamics, but existing approaches often rely on
nested min--max optimization, which is computationally expensive and yields
overly conservative policies. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Rank Representation
(AdaRL)}, a bi-level optimization framework that improves robustness by
aligning policy complexity with the intrinsic dimension of the task. At the
lower level, AdaRL performs policy optimization under fixed-rank constraints
with dynamics sampled from a Wasserstein ball around a centroid model. At the
upper level, it adaptively adjusts the rank to balance the bias--variance
trade-off, projecting policy parameters onto a low-rank manifold. This design
avoids solving adversarial worst-case dynamics while ensuring robustness
without over-parameterization. Empirical results on MuJoCo continuous control
benchmarks demonstrate that AdaRL not only consistently outperforms fixed-rank
baselines (e.g., SAC) and state-of-the-art robust RL methods (e.g., RNAC,
Parseval), but also converges toward the intrinsic rank of the underlying
tasks. These results highlight that adaptive low-rank policy representations
provide an efficient and principled alternative for robust RL under model
uncertainty.

*Rizal Fathony,Igor Melnyk,Owen Reinert,Nam H. Nguyen,Daniele Rosa,C. Bayan Bruss*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a unified framework for modeling both personal (sequence) and relational (graph) user events, introduces public datasets and tasks, and shows that jointly modeling both types improves predictions, while highlighting room for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world systems generate both personal and relational events; treating them separately limits predictive power and research progress; there is a need for public datasets and tasks that explicitly encode both types.

Method: Introduce a unified formalization that covers both event types; assemble a collection of datasets that explicitly include personal and relational events; conduct experiments comparing models that use both types against single-type baselines; release these resources for public use.

Result: Empirical evidence indicates that models incorporating both personal and relational events outperform models that use only one type; datasets and a unified formalization highlight areas where current methods can improve.

Conclusion: Public datasets and a unified formulation enable progress in unified user event modeling and are likely to spur further research and improved methods.

Abstract: User event modeling plays a central role in many machine learning
applications, with use cases spanning e-commerce, social media, finance,
cybersecurity, and other domains. User events can be broadly categorized into
personal events, which involve individual actions, and relational events, which
involve interactions between two users. These two types of events are typically
modeled separately, using sequence-based methods for personal events and
graph-based methods for relational events. Despite the need to capture both
event types in real-world systems, prior work has rarely considered them
together. This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior
can be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence
or a graph. To address this gap, there is a need for public datasets and
prediction tasks that explicitly incorporate both personal and relational
events. In this work, we introduce a collection of such datasets, propose a
unified formalization, and empirically show that models benefit from
incorporating both event types. Our results also indicate that current methods
leave a notable room for improvements. We release these resources to support
further research in unified user event modeling and encourage progress in this
direction.

*Jun-En Ding,Anna Zilverstand,Shihao Yang,Albert Chih-Chieh Yang,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VMoGE combines frequency-aware multi-scale temporal modeling with a variational GNN framework to diagnose and stage dementia from EEG, achieving superior accuracy and interpretable biomarker insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is overlapping EEG signatures between AD and FTD that limit subtype differentiation and staging when using full-band analysis. A frequency-specific, probabilistic, and interpretable model is needed to improve diagnostic accuracy and provide clinically relevant biomarkers.

Method: A multi-granularity transformer extracts patterns across four EEG bands. A variational graph convolutional encoder with Gaussian Markov Random Field priors forms a structured variational inference network with adaptive gating, creating a mixture of graph experts (VMoGE) that links neural specialization to specific frequency bands. Evaluated on two datasets for subtype classification and severity staging.

Result: VMoGE yields AUC gains of 4–10 percentage points over state-of-the-art methods. Expert weights correlate with clinical indicators and spatial patterns align with neuropathology, supporting interpretable EEG biomarkers for dementia diagnosis and monitoring.

Conclusion: VMoGE provides improved diagnostic accuracy and staging across dementia subtypes with interpretable, neuroscience-aligned biomarkers, offering potential clinical utility for EEG-based dementia assessment.

Abstract: Dementia disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal
dementia (FTD) exhibit overlapping electrophysiological signatures in EEG that
challenge accurate diagnosis. Existing EEG-based methods are limited by
full-band frequency analysis that hinders precise differentiation of dementia
subtypes and severity stages. We propose a variational mixture of graph neural
experts (VMoGE) that integrates frequency-specific biomarker identification
with structured variational inference for enhanced dementia diagnosis and
staging. VMoGE employs a multi-granularity transformer to extract multi-scale
temporal patterns across four frequency bands, followed by a variational graph
convolutional encoder using Gaussian Markov Random Field priors. Through
structured variational inference and adaptive gating, VMoGE links neural
specialization to physiologically meaningful EEG frequency bands. Evaluated on
two diverse datasets for both subtype classification and severity staging,
VMoGE achieves superior performance with AUC improvements of +4% to +10% over
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, VMoGE provides interpretable insights
through expert weights that correlate with clinical indicators and spatial
patterns aligned with neuropathological signatures, facilitating EEG biomarker
discovery for comprehensive dementia diagnosis and monitoring.

*Nayan Sanjay Bhatia,Pranay Kocheta,Russell Elliott,Harikrishna S. Kuttivelil,Katia Obraczka*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Locaris: a decoder-only LLM that maps raw Wi-Fi AP measurements to location without calibration, achieving sub-meter accuracy with a few hundred samples and robust cross-environment performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Indoor Wi-Fi positioning is highly sensitive to environmental dynamics, hardware heterogeneity, and requires labor-intensive calibration; existing methods degrade with changes.

Method: Use a decoder-only LLM, treat each AP measurement as a token, ingest raw telemetry without preprocessing, fine-tune on multiple datasets, enables few-shot adaptation and missing-AP robustness.

Result: Locaris matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods across telemetry types; achieves sub-meter accuracy with hundreds of samples; robust to unseen devices and deployment conditions; scalable calibration-free regression.

Conclusion: Compact LLMs can serve as calibration-free regression models for indoor localization, enabling scalable, robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous Wi-Fi deployments.

Abstract: Indoor Wi-Fi positioning remains a challenging problem due to the high
sensitivity of radio signals to environmental dynamics, channel propagation
characteristics, and hardware heterogeneity. Conventional fingerprinting and
model-based approaches typically require labor-intensive calibration and suffer
rapid performance degradation when devices, channel or deployment conditions
change. In this paper, we introduce Locaris, a decoder-only large language
model (LLM) for indoor localization. Locaris treats each access point (AP)
measurement as a token, enabling the ingestion of raw Wi-Fi telemetry without
pre-processing. By fine-tuning its LLM on different Wi-Fi datasets, Locaris
learns a lightweight and generalizable mapping from raw signals directly to
device location. Our experimental study comparing Locaris with state-of-the-art
methods consistently shows that Locaris matches or surpasses existing
techniques for various types of telemetry. Our results demonstrate that compact
LLMs can serve as calibration-free regression models for indoor localization,
offering scalable and robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous
Wi-Fi deployments. Few-shot adaptation experiments, using only a handful of
calibration points per device, further show that Locaris maintains high
accuracy when applied to previously unseen devices and deployment scenarios.
This yields sub-meter accuracy with just a few hundred samples, robust
performance under missing APs and supports any and all available telemetry. Our
findings highlight the practical viability of Locaris for indoor positioning in
the real-world scenarios, particularly in large-scale deployments where
extensive calibration is infeasible.

*Hiroshi Nonaka,Simon Ambrozak,Sofia R. Miskala-Dinc,Amedeo Ercole,Aviva Prins*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Three restart paradigms (partial, adaptive, selective) for model-free non-stationary RL address two issues in RestartQ-UCB: complete forgetting and rigid scheduled restarts. They modify RestartQ-UCB and RANDOMIZEDQ, achieving up to 91% reduction in dynamic regret across multiple environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Non-stationary RL often suffers when environments change; existing restart designs (Mao et al. 2022 RestartQ-UCB) can cause complete forgetting and use predefined restarts, leading to suboptimal adaptation. The goal is to design restart schemes that preserve useful information and respond to environment dynamics.

Method: Propose three restart paradigms—partial, adaptive, and selective restarts—to modify the RestartQ-UCB and RANDOMIZEDQ algorithms, aiming to mitigate forgetting and improve alignment with changing dynamics.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows near-optimal performance across multiple environments, with dynamic regret reduced by up to 91% compared to RestartQ-UCB.

Conclusion: The partial, adaptive, and selective restart paradigms significantly improve model-free non-stationary RL by reducing forgetting and enabling more effective restarts, yielding substantial reductions in dynamic regret relative to prior RestartQ-UCB designs.

Abstract: In this work, we propose three efficient restart paradigms for model-free
non-stationary reinforcement learning (RL). We identify two core issues with
the restart design of Mao et al. (2022)'s RestartQ-UCB algorithm: (1) complete
forgetting, where all the information learned about an environment is lost
after a restart, and (2) scheduled restarts, in which restarts occur only at
predefined timings, regardless of the incompatibility of the policy with the
current environment dynamics. We introduce three approaches, which we call
partial, adaptive, and selective restarts to modify the algorithms RestartQ-UCB
and RANDOMIZEDQ (Wang et al., 2025). We find near-optimal empirical performance
in multiple different environments, decreasing dynamic regret by up to $91$%
relative to RestartQ-UCB.

### [107] [On efficiently computable functions, deep networks and sparse compositionality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11942)
*Tomaso Poggio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Efficient fixed-precision Turing computability implies compact, bounded-fan-in sparse representations and neural approximants; there exist polynomial-size/depth circuits and corresponding deep nets that approximate the discretized map at target precision, linking circuit/NN expressivity to compositional approximation and hierarchical optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To connect computability/complexity of real-valued maps with sparse, compositional representations and neural network approximations. The work seeks to show that poly-time, fixed-precision computation guarantees efficient sparse circuit realizations and neural emulators, and to relate this to compositional approximation theory and optimization as a hierarchical search over sparse structures.

Method: If f:[0,1]^d→R^m is computable in time polynomial in bit-depths, then for any precision pair (n, m_out) there exists a bounded-fan-in Boolean circuit of size and depth poly(n+m_out) computing the discretized map. Replacing each gate with a constant-size neural emulator yields a deep network of size/depth poly(n+m_out) achieving accuracy ε=2^{-m_out}. The construction is connected to the literature on compositional approximation rates and to optimization viewed as hierarchical search over sparse structures.

Result: Demonstrates the existence of poly-size, poly-depth bounded-fan-in circuits for discretized maps and corresponding neural networks achieving exponential precision in m_out; provides theoretical links between computability, sparse composition, and neural approximation.

Conclusion: These results tie efficient computation to sparse, compositional representations and neural approximants, and frame optimization as a hierarchical search over sparse structures. They also connect to established compositional approximation theory and to interpretations of optimization in terms of sparse hierarchical decompositions.

Abstract: We show that \emph{efficient Turing computability} at any fixed input/output
precision implies the existence of \emph{compositionally sparse}
(bounded-fan-in, polynomial-size) DAG representations and of corresponding
neural approximants achieving the target precision. Concretely: if
$f:[0,1]^d\to\R^m$ is computable in time polynomial in the bit-depths, then for
every pair of precisions $(n,m_{\mathrm{out}})$ there exists a bounded-fan-in
Boolean circuit of size and depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ computing the
discretized map; replacing each gate by a constant-size neural emulator yields
a deep network of size/depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ that achieves accuracy
$\varepsilon=2^{-m_{\mathrm{out}}}$. We also relate these constructions to
compositional approximation rates

### [108] [Sculpting Latent Spaces With MMD: Disentanglement With Programmable Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11953)
*Quentin Fruytier,Akshay Malhotra,Shahab Hamidi-Rad,Aditya Sant,Aryan Mokhtari,Sujay Sanghavi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KL-based VAE regularization fails to enforce the target factorized prior on the aggregate posterior; introduces Latent Predictability Score to quantify entanglement and the Programmable Prior Framework (MMD-based) to sculpt latent spaces, achieving strong disentanglement without reconstruction sacrifice and enabling semantically aligned priors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disentangled representations are desirable for interpretability, causal reasoning, and controllable generative models. The prevalent KL-divergence regularization in VAEs does not reliably enforce factorized priors on the aggregate posterior, hindering identifiability.

Method: (1) Propose Latent Predictability Score (LPS) to measure unsupervised entanglement. (2) Analyze KL-based regularization and its failure to match the factorized prior. (3) Develop Programmable Prior Framework based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to explicitly sculpt the latent distribution. (4) Demonstrate state-of-the-art mutual independence on CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet and show priors can align with semantic features.

Result: KL regularization consistently fails to enforce the intended aggregate posterior, yielding entangled representations. The LPS provides a quantitative unsupervised measure of this entanglement. The Programmable Prior Framework achieves state-of-the-art mutual independence on challenging datasets without sacrificing reconstruction quality and enables priors that align with meaningful semantic factors.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundational tool for representation engineering, improving model identifiability and enabling causal reasoning by offering controllable priors and a reliable metric for disentanglement.

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations, where distinct factors of variation
are captured by independent latent variables, is a central goal in machine
learning. The dominant approach has been the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
framework, which uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to encourage
the latent space to match a factorized Gaussian prior. In this work, however,
we provide direct evidence that this KL-based regularizer is an unreliable
mechanism, consistently failing to enforce the target distribution on the
aggregate posterior. We validate this and quantify the resulting entanglement
using our novel, unsupervised Latent Predictability Score (LPS). To address
this failure, we introduce the Programmable Prior Framework, a method built on
the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Our framework allows practitioners to
explicitly sculpt the latent space, achieving state-of-the-art mutual
independence on complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet without the
common reconstruction trade-off. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this
programmability can be used to engineer sophisticated priors that improve
alignment with semantically meaningful features. Ultimately, our work provides
a foundational tool for representation engineering, opening new avenues for
model identifiability and causal reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Y-shaped generative flows that co-move probability mass along shared pathways before branching, using a velocity-powered transport cost with a concave exponent (between 0 and 1).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard flow models use V-shaped transport paths that move samples independently and may miss shared, hierarchical data structure. A concave transport cost incentivizes joint, fast mass movement along shared routes to better capture structure.

Method: Define a velocity-powered transport cost with a sublinear exponent and integrate it into a scalable neural ODE training objective, yielding Y-shaped flows that route mass along common pathways before branching to targets.

Result: Empirical results on synthetic, image, and biology datasets show Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure, improve distributional metrics over strong flow baselines, and reach targets with fewer integration steps.

Conclusion: Y-shaped flows provide an efficient, structure-aware alternative to traditional flow-based models by leveraging shared mass movement and hierarchical structure, with practical gains in training efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Modern continuous-time generative models often induce V-shaped transport:
each sample travels independently along nearly straight trajectories from prior
to data, overlooking shared structure. We introduce Y-shaped generative flows,
which move probability mass together along shared pathways before branching to
target-specific endpoints. Our formulation is based on novel velocity-powered
transport cost with a sublinear exponent (between zero and one). this concave
dependence rewards joint and fast mass movement. Practically, we instantiate
the idea in a scalable neural ODE training objective. On synthetic, image, and
biology datasets, Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure, improve
distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reach targets with
fewer integration steps.

*Bowei Guo,Shengkun Tang,Cong Zeng,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MosaicDiff introduces trajectory-aware structural pruning to align diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration, achieving significant sampling speedups on DiT and SDXL without sacrificing output quality and outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models preprocess through phases with varying learning speeds, but prior acceleration work focuses on post-training sampling and ignores the alignment with pretraining dynamics.

Method: Propose MosaicDiff, an adaptive, trajectory-aware pruning framework that conservatively prunes during the fast-learning middle stage and more aggressively prunes during the slow-learning early and late stages, thereby mirroring diffusion pretraining dynamics to improve sampling acceleration.

Result: Experiments on DiT and SDXL show large sampling speed-ups without quality loss and outperform state-of-the-art methods, offering a new perspective on training-free diffusion acceleration.

Conclusion: MosaicDiff is the first framework to explicitly mirror diffusion pretraining learning-speed variations via adaptive pruning, harmonizing training dynamics with accelerated sampling and enabling efficient, robust diffusion models.

Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their generative capabilities, yet their
pretraining processes exhibit distinct phases of learning speed that have been
entirely overlooked in prior post-training acceleration efforts in the
community. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called MosaicDiff that
aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration
via trajectory-aware structural pruning. Our approach leverages the observation
that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more
conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and
later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy.
This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent
learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the
model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process.
Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves
significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also
providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion
acceleration.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-inspired framework (QLENS) casts Transformer inference as quantum-like evolution in a Hilbert space, modeling each layer as unitary dynamics and using Born-rule measurements to produce outputs; demonstrated via a toy Transformer proof-of-concept; aims to enrich interpretability with a cross-domain mathematical lens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the interpretability gap in how individual Transformer layers steer state transitions during generation, by leveraging the probabilistic nature of language and drawing on quantum mechanics to provide a descriptive mathematical framework.

Method: Convert latent activations into a state vector in a Hilbert space built from the model’s output units; treat hidden layers as unitary operators (and analogously defined Hamiltonians) that evolve the state during inference; obtain the final token distribution by applying the Born rule with a measurement operator; validate feasibility through a proof-of-concept on a toy Transformer to examine layer-wise influence.

Result: Proof-of-concept demonstration showing the feasibility of the physics-inspired framing on a toy Transformer; provides qualitative insights into how individual layers influence the prediction trajectory, laying groundwork for cross-domain interpretability.

Conclusion: QLENS introduces a foundational physics-based lens for Transformer generation, offering a novel descriptive framework and a path toward broader cross-domain understanding, with future work needed to scale to realistic models and tasks.

Abstract: In natural language processing, current methods for understanding
Transformers are successful at identifying intermediate predictions during a
model's inference. However, these approaches function as limited diagnostic
checkpoints, lacking a mathematical framework for mechanistically modeling how
each layer facilitates transitions between these evolving states. This
interpretability gap and past successes of interdisciplinary outlooks inspire
us to turn to physics in search of a descriptive mathematical framework for
Transformers. We observe that language models are intrinsically probabilistic,
an attribute that is echoed in the core postulates of quantum mechanics. This
parallel inspires us to translate insights from this discipline to that of
natural language processing. Towards this objective, we propose QLENS a novel
attempt to develop a physics-based perspective on the Transformer generation
process. Under QLENS, a Transformer is studied by converting its latent
activations into a state vector in a Hilbert space derived from the model's
output units. This state subsequently evolves through hidden layers -
reformulated as unitary operators and analogously defined Hamiltonians - during
inference. The model's final probability distribution is obtained by applying
the Born rule to the end state using a specific measurement operator. To
demonstrate QLENS's potential, we conduct a proof-of-concept by probing a toy
Transformer to investigate the influence of individual layers in a model's
prediction trajectory. We present our work as a foundation for cross-domain
insights to be leveraged towards a broader understanding of Transformers.

### [112] [Learning Dynamics of VLM Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11978)
*Jusheng Zhang,Kaitong Cai,Jing Yang,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CW-DPO is a two-stage learning-dynamics–aware fine-tuning method for vision–language models that smooths training with gentle supervision and uses a cooling-weighted DPO objective to suppress uninformative gradients, achieving more stable optimization, better calibration, and faster convergence than SFT or vanilla DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preference-based finetuning of vision–language models is brittle due to wrong or uninformative negatives; there is a need to make the optimization process itself robust to training dynamics and to focus on informative negatives.

Method: Stage 1: gentle negatives via low-weight smoothed supervision to regularize the base policy. Stage 2: apply a DPO objective where the negative term is scaled by a cooling weight derived from the model’s average token log-probability on each negative. Emphasizes on-policy negatives and allows mixed negatives; uses Delta log p probes as early signals for stopping and curriculum decisions.

Result: CW-DPO yields more stable optimization, better calibration, and higher pairwise win-rates than SFT-only and vanilla DPO, and it converges in fewer steps across diverse VLM tasks. Ablations show the cooling-weight mechanism as the main driver; mixing on-policy and dataset negatives provides complementary benefits.

Conclusion: Smoothing learning dynamics before applying cooling preferences is a simple, general principle for robust VLM alignment.

Abstract: Preference-based finetuning of vision--language models (VLMs) is brittle:
trivially wrong negatives inject uninformative gradients that destabilize
training. We recast alignment as \textbf{learning-dynamics--aware optimization}
and introduce \textbf{Cooling-Weighted DPO (CW-DPO)}, a two-stage recipe that
explicitly models and exploits the training trajectory. \textbf{Stage 1}
performs supervised finetuning with \textbf{gentle negatives}:
\textbf{low-weight smoothed supervision} that regularizes the base policy and
curbs overconfidence without explicit penalties. \textbf{Stage 2} applies a DPO
objective in which the \textbf{negative term is scaled by a cooling weight}
computed from the model's \textbf{average token log-probability} on each
negative, suppressing uninformative gradients from easy or off-distribution
samples while preserving signal from hard negatives. In practice, we emphasize
\textbf{on-policy negatives} and allow \textbf{mixed negatives} by blending a
controllable fraction of dataset negatives to maintain contrast freshness.
Throughout, we instrument training with $\Delta\!\log p$ probes on positives
and negatives as first-class signals for early stopping, curriculum design, and
failure diagnosis. Across diverse VLM tasks, CW-DPO yields \textbf{more stable
optimization}, \textbf{better calibration}, and \textbf{higher pairwise
win-rates} than SFT-only and vanilla DPO, while \textbf{converging in fewer
steps}. Ablations isolate the \textbf{cooling-weight mechanism} as the primary
driver of these gains and show complementary benefits from mixing on-policy and
dataset negatives. Taken together, our results show that \textbf{smoothing
learning dynamics before cooling preferences} is a simple, general principle
for robust VLM alignment.

*Mattia Scardecchia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A study linking AI learning with neuroscience by analyzing fixed-point dynamics in random asymmetric recurrent networks, revealing a phase transition in fixed-point structure and proposing a biologically plausible, local learning algorithm that maps inputs to fixed points to train binary recurrent networks on a version of MNIST, highlighting depth, hierarchical representation, and cortex-inspired mechanisms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between deep learning and biological learning by understanding how local, distributed dynamics can achieve robust, scalable learning without backpropagation, and by characterizing the attractor structure that enables such learning.

Method: Apply statistical mechanics to random asymmetric recurrent networks; derive a closed-form for the number of fixed points as a function of self-coupling; identify a phase transition in fixed-point structure; analyze accessibility of fixed points under asynchronous dynamics; propose a biologically plausible supervised-learning algorithm for binary recurrent networks that maps inputs to fixed points via relaxation and stabilizes configurations with local plasticity; validate on an entangled MNIST variant and across architectures; investigate depth-related hierarchical representations and hetero-association capacity; discuss cortex-inspired alternatives to self-couplings.

Result: Identified a phase transition: below a critical self-coupling, isolated fixed points coexist with exponentially many narrow clusters with overlap-gap properties; above it, subdominant dense clusters emerge. Fixed points become accessible after an algorithm-dependent self-coupling threshold. The proposed learning algorithm can learn an entangled version of MNIST, leverages depth to develop hierarchical representations, and increases hetero-association capacity across several architectures. Performance is strongly connected to the phase transition; a cortex-inspired alternative to self-couplings for emergence is suggested.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that biologically plausible, local learning grounded in fixed-point dynamics can be effective for simple benchmarks, with performance tied to a well-defined phase transition. It provides a principled link between statistical mechanics and learning dynamics and points to cortex-inspired mechanisms for achieving the necessary self-coupling behavior across networks.

Abstract: Despite the striking successes of deep neural networks trained with
gradient-based optimization, these methods differ fundamentally from their
biological counterparts. This gap raises key questions about how nature
achieves robust, sample-efficient learning at minimal energy costs and solves
the credit-assignment problem without backpropagation. We take a step toward
bridging contemporary AI and computational neuroscience by studying how neural
dynamics can support fully local, distributed learning that scales to simple
machine-learning benchmarks. Using tools from statistical mechanics, we
identify conditions for the emergence of robust dynamical attractors in random
asymmetric recurrent networks. We derive a closed-form expression for the
number of fixed points as a function of self-coupling strength, and we reveal a
phase transition in their structure: below a critical self-coupling, isolated
fixed points coexist with exponentially many narrow clusters showing the
overlap-gap property; above it, subdominant yet dense and extensive clusters
appear. These fixed points become accessible, including to a simple
asynchronous dynamical rule, after an algorithm-dependent self-coupling
threshold. Building on this analysis, we propose a biologically plausible
algorithm for supervised learning with any binary recurrent network. Inputs are
mapped to fixed points of the dynamics, by relaxing under transient external
stimuli and stabilizing the resulting configurations via local plasticity. We
show that our algorithm can learn an entangled version of MNIST, leverages
depth to develop hierarchical representations and increase hetero-association
capacity, and is applicable to several architectures. Finally, we highlight the
strong connection between algorithm performance and the unveiled phase
transition, and we suggest a cortex-inspired alternative to self-couplings for
its emergence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Second-order methods with curvature information are appealing, but practical second-order studies have focused on quasi-Newton approximations. This work asks what happens if we use the true Hessian and how the failure modes reflect optimization geometry and the landscape's stationary points.

Method: The authors compare exact Hessian-based optimization with quasi-Newton and first-order baselines, analyzing failure modes, discretization geometry, and the distribution of stationary points to understand why exact curvature underperforms.

Result: Neural network training reliably fails when using the exact curvature information; the observed failure modes illuminate aspects of nonlinear discretization geometry and the distribution of stationary points, undermining the view that many local minima dominate the loss landscape.

Conclusion: Exact curvature-based methods are not universally beneficial for neural nets; the findings challenge assumptions about loss-landscape geometry and encourage reevaluating how curvature information is used in optimization.

Abstract: Second-order methods are emerging as promising alternatives to standard
first-order optimizers such as gradient descent and ADAM for training neural
networks. Though the advantages of including curvature information in computing
optimization steps have been celebrated in the scientific machine learning
literature, the only second-order methods that have been studied are
quasi-Newton, meaning that the Hessian matrix of the objective function is
approximated. Though one would expect only to gain from using the true Hessian
in place of its approximation, we show that neural network training reliably
fails when relying on exact curvature information. The failure modes provide
insight both into the geometry of nonlinear discretizations as well as the
distribution of stationary points in the loss landscape, leading us to question
the conventional wisdom that the loss landscape is replete with local minima.

### [115] [Mamaba Can Learn Low-Dimensional Targets In-Context via Test-Time Feature Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12026)
*Junsoo Oh,Wei Huang,Taiji Suzuki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mamba enables efficient in-context learning for low-dimensional nonlinear targets by test-time feature learning that extracts the relevant direction; it achieves better sample complexity than linear Transformers and is competitive with nonlinear Transformers; the nonlinear gating mechanism is the key driver.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a theoretical understanding of Mamba's in-context learning capabilities, specifically for low-dimensional nonlinear target functions, and to identify the mechanism that enables efficiency and performance.

Method: The paper analyzes Mamba pretrained by gradient-based methods on a single-index model y ≈ g_*(⟨β, x⟩). It proves that Mamba can perform test-time feature learning to recover the relevant direction β from context, yielding improved sample complexity relative to linear Transformers and comparable to nonlinear Transformers, with analyses connecting to CSQ bounds and information-theoretic limits. It highlights the nonlinear gating mechanism as crucial for feature extraction.

Result: Mamba achieves efficient in-context learning via test-time feature learning that extracts the relevant direction from context; the test-time sample complexity improves upon linear Transformers and is comparable to nonlinear Transformers; gating is identified as the fundamental driver for feature extraction and the resulting performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: Nonlinear gating in Mamba is essential for effective feature extraction during in-context learning, enabling both computational efficiency and strong performance. The theoretical analysis clarifies why Mamba can surpass linear Transformer limitations and approach nonlinear Transformer performance for low-dimensional nonlinear targets.

Abstract: Mamba, a recently proposed linear-time sequence model, has attracted
significant attention for its computational efficiency and strong empirical
performance. However, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its underlying
mechanisms remains limited. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Mamba's in-context learning (ICL) capability by focusing on tasks defined by
low-dimensional nonlinear target functions. Specifically, we study in-context
learning of a single-index model $y \approx g_*(\langle \boldsymbol{\beta},
\boldsymbol{x} \rangle)$, which depends on only a single relevant direction
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$, referred to as feature. We prove that Mamba, pretrained
by gradient-based methods, can achieve efficient ICL via test-time feature
learning, extracting the relevant direction directly from context examples.
Consequently, we establish a test-time sample complexity that improves upon
linear Transformers -- analyzed to behave like kernel methods -- and is
comparable to nonlinear Transformers, which have been shown to surpass the
Correlational Statistical Query (CSQ) lower bound and achieve near
information-theoretically optimal rate in previous works. Our analysis reveals
the crucial role of the nonlinear gating mechanism in Mamba for feature
extraction, highlighting it as the fundamental driver behind Mamba's ability to
achieve both computational efficiency and high performance.

### [116] [Your VAR Model is Secretly an Efficient and Explainable Generative Classifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12060)
*Yi-Chung Chen,David I. Inouye,Jing Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A VAR-based generative classifier (A-VARC+) provides a scalable alternative to diffusion models, achieving a better accuracy–speed trade-off, with tractable likelihood that enables tokenwise explainability and resilience to catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based generative classifiers dominate the field but are computationally expensive and offer limited understanding; there is a need for scalable, interpretable alternatives. Visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling promises tractable likelihood and new insights into generative classifiers.

Method: Develop a generative classifier based on visual autoregressive modeling; introduce Adaptive VAR Classifier+ (A-VARC+) to optimize the accuracy–inference speed trade-off; leverage tractable likelihood for explainability (token-wise mutual information) and evaluate robustness in class-incremental learning.

Result: The A-VARC+ achieves a superior accuracy–speed trade-off compared with diffusion-based counterparts; VAR-based approach enables token-wise mutual information based visual explainability and shows resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning tasks; highlights fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: VAR-based generative classification offers a scalable, interpretable, and robust alternative to diffusion-based methods, expanding practical applicability and understanding of generative classifiers.

Abstract: Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for
classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as
robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has
been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational
cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based
methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In
this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in
visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for
studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we
introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a
superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly
improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method
exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In
particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables
visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates
inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning
tasks.

### [117] [MEASURE: Multi-scale Minimal Sufficient Representation Learning for Domain Generalization in Sleep Staging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12070)
*Sangmin Jo,Jee Seok Yoon,Wootaek Jeong,Kwanseok Oh,Heung-Il Suk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MEASURE framework for sleep staging uses multi-scale minimal sufficient representation learning to suppress excess domain information while preserving temporal/spectral cues, improving generalization to unseen subjects and surpassing state-of-the-art on SleepEDF-20 and MASS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address poor generalization of sleep-staging models to unseen subjects due to physiological variability and domain shifts. Existing contrastive/domain-generalization approaches often fail to explicitly mitigate domain-relevant attributes embedded in unshared information, leading to overfitting to high-level features and poor cross-domain performance.

Method: Introduce MEASURE (Multi-scale Minimal Sufficient Representation Learning), a framework that reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and spectral features across multiple scales. It leverages contrastive-like objectives and multi-scale representations to align same-class samples across domains while suppressing excess domain attributes.

Result: Extensive experiments on public sleep staging benchmarks SleepEDF-20 and MASS show that MEASURE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The authors provide the code at a GitHub repository.

Conclusion: Mitigating excess domain information with multi-scale minimal sufficient representations improves cross-domain generalization for sleep staging, offering a robust framework for domain-generalizable biosignal analysis and contributing to better robustness against subject variability.

Abstract: Deep learning-based automatic sleep staging has significantly advanced in
performance and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders.
However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to
variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization
approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on
unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning
has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning
samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many
existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant
representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics
embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we
posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess
domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the
direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits
features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the
diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature
levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE
minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively
reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and
spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments
on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS,
our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods. Our
code is available at : https://github.com/ku-milab/Measure

### [118] [Influence Dynamics and Stagewise Data Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12071)
*Jin Hwa Lee,Matthew Smith,Maxwell Adam,Jesse Hoogland*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stagewise data attribution reveals non-monotonic, sign-flipping influences during neural learning; dynamic shifts align with semantic hierarchy development in language models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training data attribution (TDA) treats sample influence as static. A stagewise framework is needed to capture how influences evolve during training and across developmental transitions.

Method: Introduce a stagewise attribution framework grounded in singular learning theory; analytically and empirically validated in a toy model; scaled experiments on language models to observe token-level influence across developmental stages.

Result: Predicted non-monotonic influence changes (including sign flips and sharp peaks) that map to progressive semantic hierarchy learning; observed in toy model and aligned with developmental stages in language models.

Conclusion: Stagewise TDA captures temporal dynamics of influence during learning, offering deeper interpretability of model development and potential guidance for training and analysis.

Abstract: Current training data attribution (TDA) methods treat the influence one
sample has on another as static, but neural networks learn in distinct stages
that exhibit changing patterns of influence. In this work, we introduce a
framework for stagewise data attribution grounded in singular learning theory.
We predict that influence can change non-monotonically, including sign flips
and sharp peaks at developmental transitions. We first validate these
predictions analytically and empirically in a toy model, showing that dynamic
shifts in influence directly map to the model's progressive learning of a
semantic hierarchy. Finally, we demonstrate these phenomena at scale in
language models, where token-level influence changes align with known
developmental stages.

### [119] [GraphShaper: Geometry-aware Alignment for Improving Transfer Learning in Text-Attributed Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12085)
*Heng Zhang,Tianyi Zhang,Yuling Shi,Xiaodong Gu,Yaomin Shen,Haochen You,Zijian Zhang,Yilei Yuan,Jin Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A geometry-aware graph foundation model (GraphShaper) with multi-geometric specialization improves graph-text alignment by using expert networks for Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical spaces and adaptive fusion, addressing topology-induced distortions at structural boundaries, yielding gains in zero-shot accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph foundation models compress all graph structures into a single Euclidean space, which misrepresents hierarchical (tree-like) and cyclic structures, causing accuracy loss at structural boundaries.

Method: Introduce GraphShaper with expert networks for different geometries; dynamic fusion weights to adaptively integrate geometric properties based on local structure; preserve geometric integrity before aligning with text embeddings.

Result: Zero-shot accuracy gains: 9.47 percentage points on citation networks and 7.63 on social networks; overall improvement in accuracy.

Conclusion: Geometry-aware, multi-geometric specialization improves graph-to-text alignment, reducing distortions at structural boundaries and enabling more robust cross-modal representations.

Abstract: Graph foundation models represent a transformative paradigm for learning
transferable representations across diverse graph domains. Recent methods
leverage large language models to unify graph and text modalities into a shared
representation space using contrastive learning. However, systematic
evaluations reveal significant performance degradation at structural boundaries
where distinct topological patterns converge, with accuracy losses exceeding 20
percentage points. This issue arises from a key limitation: current methods
assume all graph structures can be encoded within a single Euclidean space. In
reality, tree structures require hyperbolic geometry to preserve hierarchical
branching, while cyclic patterns depend on spherical geometry for closure
properties. At structural boundaries, nodes experience conflicting geometric
constraints that uniform encoding spaces cannot resolve. This raises a crucial
challenge: \textbf{Can alignment frameworks be designed to respect the
intrinsic geometric diversity of graph structures?} We introduce
\textbf{GraphShaper}, a geometry-aware framework that enhances graph encoding
through multi-geometric specialization. Our approach employs expert networks
tailored to different geometric spaces, dynamically computing fusion weights to
adaptively integrate geometric properties based on local structural
characteristics. This adaptive fusion preserves structural integrity before
alignment with text embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
GraphShaper achieves 9.47\% accuracy improvements on citation networks and
7.63\% on social networks in zero-shot settings.

*Heng Zhang,Tianyi Zhang,Zijun Liu,Yuling Shi,Yaomin Shen,Haochen You,Haichuan Hu,Lubin Gan,Jin Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper reveals over-abstraction in hyperbolic graph embeddings for text-attributed graphs, proposing H4G to reduce embedding radii via learnable block-diagonal scaling and Möbius matrix multiplication, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot results, especially on heterophilic graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph-text zero-shot methods rely on large-radius hyperbolic embeddings that compress multi-scale structural information, causing loss of fine-grained local patterns crucial for accurate predictions, particularly on heterophilic graphs.

Method: Introduce H4G framework that lowers embedding radii through learnable block-diagonal scaling matrices and Möbius matrix multiplication, enabling faithful preservation of local details while keeping global receptive capability with minimal overhead.

Result: State-of-the-art zero-shot performance: ~12.8% improvement on heterophilic graphs and ~8.4% on homophilic graphs.

Conclusion: Radius-aware hyperbolic embeddings can preserve fine-grained multi-scale structures, enabling more faithful representations for zero-shot graph learning with efficient computation.

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs are widely used across domains, offering rich
opportunities for zero-shot learning via graph-text alignment. However,
existing methods struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained pattern
recognition, particularly on heterophilic graphs. Through empirical and
theoretical analysis, we identify an \textbf{over-abstraction problem}: current
approaches operate at excessively large hyperbolic radii, compressing
multi-scale structural information into uniform high-level abstractions. This
abstraction-induced information loss obscures critical local patterns essential
for accurate predictions. By analyzing embeddings in hyperbolic space, we
demonstrate that optimal graph learning requires \textbf{faithful preservation}
of fine-grained structural details, better retained by representations
positioned closer to the origin. To address this, we propose \textbf{H4G}, a
framework that systematically reduces embedding radii using learnable
block-diagonal scaling matrices and M\"obius matrix multiplication. This
approach restores access to fine-grained patterns while maintaining global
receptive ability with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show H4G
achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance with \textbf{12.8\%}
improvement on heterophilic graphs and \textbf{8.4\%} on homophilic graphs,
confirming that radius reduction enables faithful multi-scale representation
for advancing zero-shot graph learning.

*Guozheng Ma,Lu Li,Zilin Wang,Haoyu Wang,Shengchao Hu,Leszek Rutkowski,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Module-specific dynamic sparse training (MST) complements architectural improvements to scale DRL, yielding substantial gains without algorithmic changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL scaling often fails due to unique optimization pathologies (e.g., plasticity loss). Existing dynamic training methods apply uniform strategies across modules (encoder, critic, actor) and lack systematic comparisons of dynamic sparsity approaches, hindering understanding of how architecture and training dynamics interact.

Method: Conduct a comprehensive study across DRL modules (encoder, critic, actor) and architectures, systematically comparing sparse-to-sparse, dense-to-sparse, and sparse-to-dense dynamic training. Analyze interactions between dynamic training and architectural improvements and distill a practical framework, MST, that leverages both without altering RL algorithms.

Result: Dynamic sparse training offers module-specific benefits that align with each module’s learning paradigm and complement architectural improvements, leading to substantial scalability gains across diverse RL algorithms without changes to algorithmic structure.

Conclusion: Module-specific training (MST) provides a practical, scalable path to combine architectural advances with targeted dynamic training, achieving notable performance gains in DRL without modifying core RL algorithms.

Abstract: Scaling neural networks has driven breakthrough advances in machine learning,
yet this paradigm fails in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), where larger
models often degrade performance due to unique optimization pathologies such as
plasticity loss. While recent works show that dynamically adapting network
topology during training can mitigate these issues, existing studies have three
critical limitations: (1) applying uniform dynamic training strategies across
all modules despite encoder, critic, and actor following distinct learning
paradigms, (2) focusing evaluation on basic architectures without clarifying
the relative importance and interaction between dynamic training and
architectural improvements, and (3) lacking systematic comparison between
different dynamic approaches including sparse-to-sparse, dense-to-sparse, and
sparse-to-dense. Through comprehensive investigation across modules and
architectures, we reveal that dynamic sparse training strategies provide
module-specific benefits that complement the primary scalability foundation
established by architectural improvements. We finally distill these insights
into Module-Specific Training (MST), a practical framework that further
exploits the benefits of architectural improvements and demonstrates
substantial scalability gains across diverse RL algorithms without algorithmic
modifications.

### [122] [Chimera: State Space Models Beyond Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12111)
*Aakash Lahoti,Tanya Marwah,Ratish Puduppully,Albert Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Chimera is a topology-aware, unified transformer-like model built on state-space ideas that directly encodes data topology (graphs) without task-specific biases, delivering cross-domain gains and efficient algorithms for DAGs and general graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Self-attention ignores topology and requires domain-specific biases to encode structure (positions, random walks). This hinders generalization and cross-domain transfer. A principled, universal approach that integrates topology across modalities could improve performance and efficiency.

Method: Introduce Chimera, a state-space model capable of capturing arbitrary graph topology without position embeddings. Demonstrate strong performance across language, vision, and graphs. Propose efficiency optimizations: (1) linear-time recurrence for Directed Acyclic Graphs; (2) a relaxation for general graphs that achieves Transformer-like quadratic complexity without domain-specific heuristics.

Result: Chimera outperforms strong baselines: surpasses BERT on GLUE by 0.7 points, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and leads on the Long Range Graph Benchmark. Efficiency optimizations provide practical speedups while preserving accuracy.

Conclusion: Data topology is a powerful and general inductive bias. A unified Chimera framework demonstrates that incorporating topology through state-space mechanisms yields consistent gains across modalities and can enable scalable, bias-free modeling of complex structures.

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning methods have become the standard approach for
modeling diverse data such as sequences, images, and graphs. These methods rely
on self-attention, which treats data as an unordered set of elements. This
ignores the neighborhood structure or graph topology of the data and requires
inductive biases--such as position embeddings in sequences and images, or
random walks in graphs--to incorporate topology. However, designing such
task-specific biases requires significant effort and can introduce side effects
that hinder generalization. We introduce Chimera, a unified model that directly
incorporates data topology in a principled way, removing the need for
domain-specific biases. The key idea is that state space models--which
naturally do not require position embeddings--can be generalized to capture any
graph topology. Our experiments show that Chimera achieves strong performance
across language, vision, and graph domains, outperforming BERT on GLUE by 0.7
points, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph
Benchmark. We further propose algorithmic optimizations to improve Chimera's
efficiency: (1) for Directed Acyclic Graphs, Chimera can be implemented as a
linear-time recurrence; (2) for general graphs, a simple mathematical
relaxation achieves Transformer's quadratic complexity without domain-specific
heuristics. These results validate Chimera's core contribution and support the
idea that data topology is a powerful inductive bias across modalities.

### [123] [nuGPR: GPU-Accelerated Gaussian Process Regression with Iterative Algorithms and Low-Rank Approximations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12128)
*Ziqi Zhao,Vivek Sarin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: nuGPR offers an end-to-end acceleration framework for Gaussian Process Regression by combining preconditioned CG linear solves, block-diagonal covariance approximations from clustering, low-rank off-diagonal block approximations, numerical gradients for hyperparameters, and CUDA-based GPU parallelism. It achieves up to 2x faster training and up to 12x memory reduction compared with the best GPU-based GPR implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian Process Regression provides rich uncertainty quantification but suffers from high computational cost and memory usage during training. There is a need for scalable, efficient training methods that preserve accuracy while leveraging modern hardware.

Method: The framework uses (1) preconditioned conjugate gradient to speed up linear solves in GPR training; (2) clustering-induced block-diagonal structure of the covariance matrix to enable low-rank approximations of off-diagonal blocks; (3) low-rank approximations for off-diagonal covariance blocks to reduce storage and computation; (4) numerical gradients to optimize hyperparameters instead of exact backpropagation; (5) CUDA-based parallelization to exploit GPUs for faster training.

Result: Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets show nuGPR reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up to 12x compared to the best existing GPU-based GPR implementation.

Conclusion: nuGPR demonstrates that combining classical numerical linear algebra techniques with modern hardware can substantially accelerate end-to-end GPR training, making scalable GPR more practical. Potential future work includes exploring accuracy–efficiency trade-offs, broader datasets, and comparisons with alternative approximation schemes.

Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is an important type of supervised machine
learning model with inherent uncertainty measure in its predictions. We propose
a new framework, nuGPR, to address the well-known challenge of high computation
cost associated with GPR training. Our framework includes several ideas from
numerical linear algebra to reduce the amount of computation in key steps of
GPR, and we combine them to establish an end-to-end training algorithm.
Specifically, we leverage the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to
accelerate the convergence of the linear solves required in GPR. We exploit
clustering in the input data to identify block-diagonal structure of the
covariance matrix and subsequently construct low-rank approximations of the
off-diagonal blocks. These enhancements significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of our computations. In addition, unlike other frameworks that rely
on exact differentiation, we employ numerical gradients to optimize the
hyperparameters of our GPR model, further reducing the training cost by
eliminating the need for backpropagation. Lastly, we leverage the CUDA Toolkit
to efficiently parallelize the training procedure on NVIDIA GPUs. As a result,
nuGPR reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up
to 12x on various synthetic and real-world datasets when compared to the best
existing GPU-based GPR implementation.

*Yonghao Liu,Yajun Wang,Chunli Guo,Wei Pang,Ximing Li,Fausto Giunchiglia,Xiaoyue Feng,Renchu Guan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRACE introduces Adaptive spectrum experts and cross-set distribution calibration to address local spectral heterogeneity and support-query distribution shift in graph few-shot learning, aiming to improve generalization across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current graph few-shot methods rely on fixed, global spectral filters and assume training tasks reflect the same distribution as test tasks. This ignores heterogeneous local graph structures and potential distribution shifts between support and query sets in few-shot regimes, leading to suboptimal generalization.

Method: Proposes GRACE, a framework that combines Adaptive spectrum experts (learnable, locally adaptive spectral operators) with Cross-sEt distribution calibration techniques to align support and query distributions and exploit local topology variations.

Result: The approach theoretically enhances generalization and empirically outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across diverse settings on graph few-shot tasks, with code release for reproduction.

Conclusion: GRACE provides a principled way to tackle both local spectral heterogeneity and cross-set distribution shift in graph few-shot learning, showing strong empirical gains and offering avenues for further refinement and scalability.

Abstract: Graph few-shot learning has attracted increasing attention due to its ability
to rapidly adapt models to new tasks with only limited labeled nodes. Despite
the remarkable progress made by existing graph few-shot learning methods,
several key limitations remain. First, most current approaches rely on
predefined and unified graph filters (e.g., low-pass or high-pass filters) to
globally enhance or suppress node frequency signals. Such fixed spectral
operations fail to account for the heterogeneity of local topological
structures inherent in real-world graphs. Moreover, these methods often assume
that the support and query sets are drawn from the same distribution. However,
under few-shot conditions, the limited labeled data in the support set may not
sufficiently capture the complex distribution of the query set, leading to
suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose GRACE, a
novel Graph few-shot leaRning framework that integrates Adaptive spectrum
experts with Cross-sEt distribution calibration techniques. Theoretically, the
proposed approach enhances model generalization by adapting to both local
structural variations and cross-set distribution calibration. Empirically,
GRACE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range
of experimental settings. Our code can be found here.

### [125] [Fairness-Constrained Optimization Attack in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12143)
*Harsh Kasyap,Minghong Fang,Zhuqing Liu,Carsten Maple,Somanath Tripathy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An attacker in federated learning can deliberately degrade fairness by optimizing fairness loss, using a single malicious client, while preserving overall accuracy; demonstrates vulnerability of robust and fairness-aware aggregators and shows bias can rise dramatically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reveal vulnerabilities where intentional fairness manipulation harms FL fairness and to test effectiveness of Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation methods.

Method: Malicious client solves an optimization problem over fairness metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds) to increase bias while maintaining accuracy; evaluates against state-of-the-art aggregators on multiple datasets.

Result: Bias can be increased up to 90% with only one compromised client, even under defenses; global accuracy remains largely unaffected.

Conclusion: FL fairness is vulnerable to adversarial manipulation; robust defenses must be strengthened to detect and mitigate such attacks.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique
that facilitates collaboration among participants across demographics. FL
enables model sharing, while restricting the movement of data. Since FL
provides participants with independence over their training data, it becomes
susceptible to poisoning attacks. Such collaboration also propagates bias among
the participants, even unintentionally, due to different data distribution or
historical bias present in the data. This paper proposes an intentional
fairness attack, where a client maliciously sends a biased model, by increasing
the fairness loss while training, even considering homogeneous data
distribution. The fairness loss is calculated by solving an optimization
problem for fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds. The
attack is insidious and hard to detect, as it maintains global accuracy even
after increasing the bias. We evaluate our attack against the state-of-the-art
Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes over different
datasets, in various settings. The empirical results demonstrate the attack
efficacy by increasing the bias up to 90\%, even in the presence of a single
malicious client in the FL system.

*Ali Parsaee,Bei Jiang,Zachary Friggstad,Russell Greiner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Budgeted active learning applied to survival analysis with censored data; provides theoretical bounds and BatchBALD-like complexity; empirical results show improved performance on survival benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable cost-efficient data collection for survival models by selectively labeling censored instances under budget constraints, reflecting real-world follow-up limitations.

Method: Extend BatchBALD-style budgeted active learning to survival data, allowing partial labeling of censored instances (e.g., obtain more time or full uncensored time); derive theoretical bounds and asymptotic time complexity; perform empirical experiments on survival datasets.

Result: Approach yields better performance than several alternatives on multiple survival benchmarks; provides theoretical bounds and complexity comparable to BatchBALD.

Conclusion: Budgeted learning is viable for survival data with censoring; highlights practical data-collection considerations and limitations; points to future work on optimizing information gain under censoring and label costs.

Abstract: Standard supervised learners attempt to learn a model from a labeled dataset.
Given a small set of labeled instances, and a pool of unlabeled instances, a
budgeted learner can use its given budget to pay to acquire the labels of some
unlabeled instances, which it can then use to produce a model. Here, we explore
budgeted learning in the context of survival datasets, which include (right)
censored instances, where we know only a lower bound on an instance's
time-to-event. Here, that learner can pay to (partially) label a censored
instance -- e.g., to acquire the actual time for an instance [perhaps go from
(3 yr, censored) to (7.2 yr, uncensored)], or other variants [e.g., learn about
one more year, so go from (3 yr, censored) to either (4 yr, censored) or
perhaps (3.2 yr, uncensored)]. This serves as a model of real world data
collection, where follow-up with censored patients does not always lead to
uncensoring, and how much information is given to the learner model during data
collection is a function of the budget and the nature of the data itself. We
provide both experimental and theoretical results for how to apply
state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data and the
respective limitations that exist in doing so. Our approach provides bounds and
time complexity asymptotically equivalent to the standard active learning
method BatchBALD. Moreover, empirical analysis on several survival tasks show
that our model performs better than other potential approaches on several
benchmarks.

### [127] [Self-Verifying Reflection Helps Transformers with CoT Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12157)
*Zhongwei Yu,Wannian Xia,Xue Yan,Bo Xu,Haifeng Zhang,Yali Du,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Minimal self-verifying reasoning framework for tiny transformers shows bounded verification errors guarantee improvements in chain-of-thought-like reasoning; tiny models reach LLM-level performance on integer multiplication and Sudoku; RL boosts reflection frequency but may not substantially reduce verification errors; overall, combining generative transformers with discriminative verification improves CoT regardless of scale or language.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify how reflection contributes to CoT improvements when LLMs' error detection is limited by isolating a minimal NL-free setting, and to provide theoretical and empirical evidence for when self-verification helps.

Method: Introduce a minimalistic self-verifying reasoning framework for small non-NL transformers; provide theoretical proof that improvements are achieved if verification errors are properly bounded; conduct experiments with multi-million-parameter models on tasks like integer multiplication and Sudoku; compare with RL-based approaches.

Result: Theoretically, improvements are guaranteed under bounded verification errors; empirically, tiny transformers benefit from self-verification in both training and reflective execution, achieving near-LLM performance on certain tasks; RL increases in-distribution performance and promotes more frequent reflection but does not faithfully reduce verification errors.

Conclusion: Integrating generative transformers with discriminative verification supports CoT reasoning across scales and languages; reflection benefits persist even without natural language and is a scalable approach to improving reasoning.

Abstract: Advanced large language models (LLMs) frequently reflect in reasoning
chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), where they self-verify the correctness of current
solutions and explore alternatives. However, given recent findings that LLMs
detect limited errors in CoTs, how reflection contributes to empirical
improvements remains unclear. To analyze this issue, in this paper, we present
a minimalistic reasoning framework to support basic self-verifying reflection
for small transformers without natural language, which ensures analytic clarity
and reduces the cost of comprehensive experiments. Theoretically, we prove that
self-verifying reflection guarantees improvements if verification errors are
properly bounded. Experimentally, we show that tiny transformers, with only a
few million parameters, benefit from self-verification in both training and
reflective execution, reaching remarkable LLM-level performance in integer
multiplication and Sudoku. Similar to LLM results, we find that reinforcement
learning (RL) improves in-distribution performance and incentivizes frequent
reflection for tiny transformers, yet RL mainly optimizes shallow statistical
patterns without faithfully reducing verification errors. In conclusion,
integrating generative transformers with discriminative verification inherently
facilitates CoT reasoning, regardless of scaling and natural language.

### [128] [Revisiting Meta-Learning with Noisy Labels: Reweighting Dynamics and Theoretical Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12209)
*Yiming Zhang,Chester Holtz,Gal Mishne,Alex Cloninger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The authors provide a rigorous theory for meta-reweighting under noisy labels, reveal a three-phase training dynamic (alignment, filtering, post-filtering), and propose a lightweight surrogate that improves stability and accuracy without bi-level optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over-parameterized networks tend to memorize noisy labels. Meta-learning reweighting uses a clean subset but lacks theoretical understanding and practical stability; there is a need to elucidate training dynamics and develop a cheaper, stable method.

Method: Rigorous analysis of meta-reweighting under label noise, identifying three training phases driven by similarity-weighted coupling with a clean subset and contraction of the clean-subset loss; development of a lightweight surrogate incorporating mean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation to avoid expensive bi-level optimization.

Result: The surrogate method yields more stable performance and consistently outperforms strong reweighting/selection baselines across synthetic and real noisy-label benchmarks.

Conclusion: The paper explains how meta-reweighting operates through a three-phase dynamic and presents a practical, efficient surrogate that preserves performance gains while reducing computational cost; effectiveness is demonstrated empirically across varied datasets.

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels remains challenging because over-parameterized
networks memorize corrupted supervision. Meta-learning-based sample reweighting
mitigates this by using a small clean subset to guide training, yet its
behavior and training dynamics lack theoretical understanding. We provide a
rigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting under label noise and show
that its training trajectory unfolds in three phases: (i) an alignment phase
that amplifies examples consistent with a clean subset and suppresses
conflicting ones; (ii) a filtering phase driving noisy example weights toward
zero until the clean subset loss plateaus; and (iii) a post-filtering phase in
which noise filtration becomes perturbation-sensitive. The mechanism is a
similarity-weighted coupling between training and clean subset signals together
with clean subset training loss contraction; in the post-filtering regime where
the clean-subset loss is sufficiently small, the coupling term vanishes and
meta-reweighting loses discriminatory power. Guided by this analysis, we
propose a lightweight surrogate for meta-reweighting that integrates
mean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation, yielding more stable
performance while avoiding expensive bi-level optimization. Across synthetic
and real noisy-label benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms strong
reweighting/selection baselines.

*Tao Xie,Zexi Tan,Haoyi Xiao,Binbin Sun,Yiqun Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dual-enhanced soft-shape learning framework (DE3S) for medical early time-series classification that combines dual temporal/global augmentation, attention-guided sparse shapelet selection, and MoE-Inception fusion to achieve state-of-the-art results on six real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ETSC in medicine faces an accuracy-vs-earliness trade-off, weak early signals, and class imbalance. Existing methods struggle to capture discriminative early patterns and provide interpretable shapelets essential for clinical trust.

Method: Three innovations: (1) dual-enhancement strategy that combines traditional temporal augmentation with attention-based global temporal enhancement for robust representation learning; (2) attention-score-based soft shapelet sparsification that preserves discriminative shapelets while aggregating less important shapelets into representative tokens; (3) a dual-path Mixture of Experts (MoE) and Inception fusion architecture where MoE learns locally within shapelets and multi-scale Inception modules capture global patterns across shapelets; weighted cross-entropy loss to handle class imbalance.

Result: Six real-world medical datasets show state-of-the-art performance; ablation studies confirm the efficacy of each component; robustness demonstrated on subject-consistency datasets.

Conclusion: DE3S addresses the accuracy–earliness trade-off in medical ETSC by jointly learning discriminative, interpretable shapelets and leveraging local and global pattern learning, yielding robust, early predictions that can improve ICU resource utilization and healthcare precision.

Abstract: Early time-series classification (ETSC) in medical applications is crucial
for time-sensitive scenarios such as sepsis prediction in intensive care units
(ICUs), where a large number of deaths are caused by delayed prediction. ETSC
can significantly improve ICU resource utilization efficiency and healthcare
precision. However, it faces conflicting goals of accuracy and earliness, with
existing methods often trading one for the other, struggling to capture subtle
early-stage patterns due to weak initial signals and class imbalance. The key
to solve these challenges is to find shapelets, which are discriminative
subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time-series
classification. This paper proposes Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning
for Medical Early Time-Series Classification (DE3S), which introduces a novel
Dual-Enhanced Soft-Shape Learning framework to figure out shapelets precisely
through three innovations: (1) a comprehensive dual-enhancement strategy
combines traditional temporal augmentation with attention-based global temporal
enhancement for robust representation learning, (2) an attention-score-based
soft shapelet sparsification mechanism dynamically preserves discriminative
patterns while aggregating less important shapelets into representative tokens,
and (3) a dual-path Mixture of Experts Network (MoE) and Inception modules
fusion architecture where MoE performs local learning within shapelets and
multi-scale Inception modules capture global patterns across shapelets. The
framework employs weighted cross-entropy loss for class imbalance handling and
demonstrates robustness on subject-consistency datasets. Extensive experiments
on six real-world medical datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with
ablation studies confirming component efficacy.

### [130] [Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion: Fast Generation with Interpretable Diffusion Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12220)
*Hanru Bai,Weiyang Ding,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion (HKD), a diffusion-model framework that combines one-step sampling with interpretable diffusion trajectories by lifting nonlinear dynamics to a latent space via Koopman operators and organizing multi-scale dynamics with hierarchical subspaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models typically require slow, iterative sampling, while one-step approaches lose the interpretable, controllable diffusion dynamics and manipulation capabilities important for editable generation.

Method: Lift nonlinear diffusion dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear Koopman operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions and one-step sampling. Build a hierarchical architecture with scale-specific Koopman subspaces to model multi-scale, coarse-to-fine image generation and allow spectral analysis for interpretability and manipulation.

Result: Empirically achieves competitive one-step generation performance and provides a principled mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through spectral analysis of the Koopman spectrum.

Conclusion: HKD bridges fast sampling and interpretability in diffusion models, enabling explainable and controllable image synthesis via a unified, multi-scale Koopman framework.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in high-fidelity image
generation but suffer from slow sampling due to their inherently iterative
denoising process. While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by
learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability
and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that
enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we
introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that
achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories.
Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion
dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear
operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only
eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate
states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the
multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that
disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific
Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We
empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves
competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled
mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through
spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and
interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image
synthesis in generative modeling.

*Bowen Fan,Zhilin Guo,Xunkai Li,Yihan Zhou,Bing Zhou,Zhenjun Li,Rong-Hua Li,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces IMDGA, an interpretable, multi-dimensional adversarial attack framework that attacks both graph topology and text attributes in Graph-LLMs; shows superior interpretability, effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-LLMs with text-attributed graphs merge textual semantics and graph structure but are vulnerable to attacks on both modalities. A unified, interpretable framework for multi-level perturbations is needed to understand vulnerabilities and guide defenses.

Method: Three tightly integrated modules orchestrate multi-level perturbations across graph structure and textual features while balancing interpretability and impact. The framework includes theoretical analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations across diverse datasets and architectures to demonstrate interpretability, effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness.

Result: Empirical evaluations show IMDGA achieves superior interpretability, attack effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared with existing methods. Theoretical analysis corroborates findings, and the work exposes critical weaknesses in TAG representations across multiple datasets and model architectures.

Conclusion: The study reveals a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs via TAG representations and provides insights for strengthening resilience. The authors offer public code/resources for reproducibility.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a pivotal framework for modeling
graph-structured data, enabling a wide range of applications from social
network analysis to molecular chemistry. By integrating large language models
(LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich
textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based
learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical
vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both
their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack
methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified
them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable
Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial
attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both
graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated
modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a
deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical
analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and
architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack
effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By
exposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers
a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs,
offering valuable insights for improving their resilience. Our code and

### [132] [MoRA: On-the-fly Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation Framework for LLM-based Multi-Modal Molecular Assistant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12245)
*Tao Yin,Xiaohong Zhang,Jiacheng Zhang,Li Huang,Zhibin Zhang,Yuansong Zeng,Jin Xie,Meng Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoRA enables per-input, molecule-aware low-rank adapters inserted into a frozen LLM, enabling instance-specific reasoning for molecular graphs without fine-tuning the LLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of static, shared-adapter fine-tuning and catastrophic forgetting when adapting LLMs to molecular tasks.

Method: Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA): generate a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each molecular graph and inject them into a frozen LLM at inference for instance-specific adaptation.

Result: Outperforms static baselines on key tasks: ~14.1% relative improvement in reaction prediction exact match; ~22% reduction in error for quantum property prediction; demonstrated on chemical reaction prediction and molecular captioning; code released.

Conclusion: Instantiating per-input, dynamic adapter parameters preserves LLM knowledge while adapting to molecule structure, offering better generalization and task performance.

Abstract: Effectively integrating molecular graph structures with Large Language Models
(LLMs) is a key challenge in drug discovery. Most existing multi-modal
alignment methods typically process these structures by fine-tuning the LLM or
adding a static adapter simultaneously. However, these approaches have two main
limitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular
inputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural
features; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In
this paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an
instance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule
on-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA)
that produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input
molecular graph. These weights are then dynamically injected into a frozen LLM,
allowing the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecular
input, while preserving the LLM's core knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that on key molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction
and molecular captioning, MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation
outperforms statically adapted baselines, including a 14.1% relative
improvement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in error for
quantum property prediction. The code is available at

### [133] [Optimal Regularization for Performative Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12249)
*Edwige Cyffers,Alireza Mirrokni,Marco Mondelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Performative learning (where deployment changes data distribution via strategic users) is addressed by regularization in high-dimensional ridge regression. The study finds that performative effects worsen risk in the population setting but can help in over-parameterized regimes; the optimal regularization scales with the overall strength of the performative effect, enabling anticipation of shifts; validated on synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how to mitigate performative data shifts caused by deployed models, especially in high-dimensional settings, by studying the role of regularization in ridge regression.

Method: Theoretical analysis of ridge regression under performative distribution shifts in high dimensions, deriving how the optimal regularization parameter should scale with the strength of the performative effect; accompanied by empirical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to validate the findings.

Result: In the population setting, performative effects worsen test risk; in over-parameterized (p > n) regimes, they can be beneficial. There exists an optimal regularization parameter that grows with the strength of the performative effect, enabling anticipatory tuning; empirical results on synthetic and real datasets support these conclusions.

Conclusion: Regularization can counteract performative shifts when choosing its strength based on the estimated performative effect; the strength of shifts dictates the needed regularization, with clear guidance for high-dimensional settings.

Abstract: In performative learning, the data distribution reacts to the deployed model
- for example, because strategic users adapt their features to game it - which
creates a more complex dynamic than in classical supervised learning. One
should thus not only optimize the model for the current data but also take into
account that the model might steer the distribution in a new direction, without
knowing the exact nature of the potential shift. We explore how regularization
can help cope with performative effects by studying its impact in
high-dimensional ridge regression. We show that, while performative effects
worsen the test risk in the population setting, they can be beneficial in the
over-parameterized regime where the number of features exceeds the number of
samples. We show that the optimal regularization scales with the overall
strength of the performative effect, making it possible to set the
regularization in anticipation of this effect. We illustrate this finding
through empirical evaluations of the optimal regularization parameter on both
synthetic and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey of diffusion-models in reinforcement learning (DM-RL) that introduces a dual-axis taxonomy (function-oriented roles and online/offline regimes), surveys single- to multi-agent extensions, applications, challenges, and future directions, and provides a community resource hub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models offer multi-modal expressiveness, stable training, and trajectory-level planning, addressing core RL challenges; there is a need to synthesize current work, organize frameworks, and guide future research in DM-RL.

Method: A literature survey that (1) defines two orthogonal taxonomies to organize DM-RL work (function-oriented and technique-oriented), (2) analyzes the progression from single-agent to multi-agent settings, (3) outlines frameworks for integrating diffusion models into RL, (4) surveys applications across domains, (5) discusses open issues and future research directions, and (6) provides a GitHub resource hub for ongoing papers and resources.

Conclusion: Diffusion models hold strong promise for RL, enabling richer representations and planning. The proposed taxonomies and frameworks help organize the field, guide future research, and unify resources, while highlighting open issues that warrant further investigation.

Abstract: Diffusion Models (DMs), as a leading class of generative models, offer key
advantages for reinforcement learning (RL), including multi-modal
expressiveness, stable training, and trajectory-level planning. This survey
delivers a comprehensive and up-to-date synthesis of diffusion-based RL. We
first provide an overview of RL, highlighting its challenges, and then
introduce the fundamental concepts of DMs, investigating how they are
integrated into RL frameworks to address key challenges in this research field.
We establish a dual-axis taxonomy that organizes the field along two orthogonal
dimensions: a function-oriented taxonomy that clarifies the roles DMs play
within the RL pipeline, and a technique-oriented taxonomy that situates
implementations across online versus offline learning regimes. We also provide
a comprehensive examination of this progression from single-agent to
multi-agent domains, thereby forming several frameworks for DM-RL integration
and highlighting their practical utility. Furthermore, we outline several
categories of successful applications of diffusion-based RL across diverse
domains, discuss open research issues of current methodologies, and highlight
key directions for future research to advance the field. Finally, we summarize
the survey to identify promising future development directions. We are actively

TL;DR: FedMMKT proposes a privacy-preserving federated framework for co-enhancing a server text-to-image model and client task-specific models using decentralized multimodal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I models are powerful but hard to tailor to specialized tasks due to limited task-specific data and privacy concerns; leveraging multimodal data from mobile/IoT devices offers a rich, underutilized resource, which federated learning can exploit without sharing raw data.

Method: A Federated Multi-modal Knowledge Transfer (FedMMKT) framework that enables joint improvement of a central server T2I model and client models using decentralized multimodal data while preserving data privacy, likely via mechanisms for cross-device knowledge transfer and multimodal representation alignment.

Result: Not specified in the abstract.

Conclusion: The abstract presents a privacy-preserving, federated approach to adapt T2I models to specialized tasks using multimodal data, but provides no empirical results or conclusions.

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have demonstrated their versatility in a wide
range of applications. However, adaptation of T2I models to specialized tasks
is often limited by the availability of task-specific data due to privacy
concerns. On the other hand, harnessing the power of rich multimodal data from
modern mobile systems and IoT infrastructures presents a great opportunity.
This paper introduces Federated Multi-modal Knowledge Transfer (FedMMKT), a
novel framework that enables co-enhancement of a server T2I model and client
task-specific models using decentralized multimodal data without compromising
data privacy.

### [136] [HiLoRA: Adaptive Hierarchical LoRA Routing for Training-Free Domain Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12266)
*Ziyi Han,Huanyu Wang,Zeyu Zhang,Xiangxiang Dai,Xutong Liu,John C. S. Lui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiLoRA is a training-free framework that adaptively routes LoRA modules via rank-one components (ROCs) to sequences and tokens, with theoretical guarantees and up to 55% accuracy gains over baselines while preserving throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LoRA-based domain generalization relies on task labels or additional training and tends to activate full LoRA sets, causing inefficiency and degradation. A training-free, adaptive routing solution is needed.

Method: Define ROC as independent rank-one components. For each input sequence, select a subset of LoRAs and allocate ROC weights via Gaussian likelihoods at the sequence level; at the token level, refine by activating the most informative ROCs. No additional training required. The approach includes theoretical guarantees that the selected LoRAs are most relevant with high probability.

Result: Empirical experiments show substantial domain generalization improvements, with accuracy gains up to 55% over state-of-the-art baselines and comparable inference throughput.

Conclusion: HiLoRA provides a practical, training-free, adaptive mechanism to reuse LoRAs for domain generalization, mitigating redundancy and insufficiency while delivering strong theoretical guarantees and efficient inference.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely used technique for
adapting large language models (LLMs) to new domains, due to its modular design
and broad availability on platforms such as HuggingFace. This availability has
motivated efforts to reuse existing LoRAs for domain generalization.
  However, existing methods often rely on explicit task labels or additional
training, which are impractical for deployment. Moreover, they typically
activate a fixed number of entire LoRA modules, leading to parameter redundancy
or insufficiency that degrade performance.
  In this paper, we propose \texttt{HiLoRA}, a training-free framework that
performs adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools. Drawing on structural
properties of LoRA, we define rank-one components (ROCs), in which each rank
parameter is regarded as an independent unit. For a given input sequence,
\texttt{HiLoRA} first adaptively selects a subset of LoRAs and determines their
ROC allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at the sequence level. At the
token level, it further refines routing by activating only the most informative
ROCs.
  We further provide theoretical guarantees that \texttt{HiLoRA} selects the
most relevant LoRAs with high probability.
  Extensive experiments show that \texttt{HiLoRA} achieves substantial
improvements in domain generalization, with accuracy gains of up to {\small
$55\%$} over state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable inference
throughput.

*Laurin Luttmann,Lin Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-agent self-improvement framework for Neural Combinatorial Optimization that learns coordinated, multi-agent actions using a set-prediction loss, improving sample efficiency and speeding up solution generation while enhancing final solution quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard self-improvement in NCO requires many samples for a single expert trajectory and fails to exploit coordination and permutation symmetries among multiple agents, leading to high computational cost and limited generalization.

Method: Extend self-improvement to operate over joint multi-agent actions. The model predicts complete agent-task assignments at each decision step. Use a set-prediction loss to supervise on multiple expert assignments per state, capturing symmetries. Generate multi-agent actions in parallel to accelerate solution generation.

Result: Empirical evaluations on several combinatorial problems show consistent improvements in final solution quality and significantly reduced generation latency compared with standard self-improvement.

Conclusion: The approach increases sample efficiency, enables learning coordinated multi-agent behavior by leveraging symmetries, and speeds up the self-improvement loop, offering a more scalable solution for NCO tasks.

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a state-of-the-art paradigm in Neural
Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), where models iteratively refine their
policies by generating and imitating high-quality solutions. Despite strong
empirical performance, existing methods face key limitations. Training is
computationally expensive, as policy updates require sampling numerous
candidate solutions per instance to extract a single expert trajectory. More
fundamentally, these approaches fail to exploit the structure of combinatorial
problems involving the coordination of multiple agents, such as vehicles in
min-max routing or machines in scheduling. By supervising on single-action
trajectories, they fail to exploit agent-permutation symmetries, where distinct
sequences of actions yield identical solutions, hindering generalization and
the ability to learn coordinated behavior.
  We address these challenges by extending self-improvement to operate over
joint multi-agent actions. Our model architecture predicts complete agent-task
assignments jointly at each decision step. To explicitly leverage symmetries,
we employ a set-prediction loss, which supervises the policy on multiple expert
assignments for any given state. This approach enhances sample efficiency and
the model's ability to learn coordinated behavior. Furthermore, by generating
multi-agent actions in parallel, it drastically accelerates the solution
generation phase of the self-improvement loop. Empirically, we validate our
method on several combinatorial problems, demonstrating consistent improvements
in the quality of the final solution and a reduced generation latency compared
to standard self-improvement.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GFF-PIELM: a Fourier-feature-based ELM for high-frequency PDEs that uses a single hidden layer with a Fourier-based activation, per-neuron frequency coefficients, and a weight-distribution–guided initialization; achieves higher accuracy without extra training cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PIELM struggles with high- and variable-frequency PDEs; a simple, efficient way to incorporate Fourier features and diverse frequencies is needed.

Method: Integrate a variation of Fourier feature mapping as the activation in a one-hidden-layer ELM; assign frequency coefficients to hidden neurons; initialize hyperparameters by monitoring ELM output weight distribution.

Result: Five case studies / ten numerical examples show improved predictive accuracy with no additional training cost or architecture complexity; applicable to high-frequency, variable-frequency, multi-scale, irregular boundary, and inverse problems.

Conclusion: PIELM can be extended to handle high- and variable-frequency PDEs via GFF-PIELM, and the proposed initialization strategy may inspire broader PIML innovations.

Abstract: Conventional physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) often faces
challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving
high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors. To address these challenges,
we propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine
(GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier
feature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it
difficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find
an alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we
integrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function,
so there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we
assign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM
network to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally,
we develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these
hyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM
not only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM
framework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle
high-frequency problems. We carry out five case studies with a total of ten
numerical examples to highlight the feasibility and validity of the proposed
GFF-PIELM, involving high frequency, variable frequency, multi-scale behaviour,
irregular boundary and inverse problems. Compared to conventional PIELM, the
GFF-PIELM approach significantly improves predictive accuracy without
additional cost in training time and architecture complexity. Our results
confirm that that PIELM can be extended to solve high-frequency and
variable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and our initialization strategy may
further inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
frameworks.

*Florent Delgrange,Raphael Avalos,Willem Röpke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Online safe policy improvement with world models; introduces DeepSPI, a neighborhood-update framework with monotonic improvement guarantees and competitive performance on ALE-57.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SPI guarantees are mainly for offline/tabular RL. There is a need to extend SPI to online, deep RL settings that use world models and representation learning, and to connect prediction losses to representation quality.

Method: Develop a theoretical framework that confines policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy to guarantee monotonic improvement and convergence; derive online, deep analogues of classical SPI results by linking transition and reward prediction losses to representation quality; propose DeepSPI, an on-policy algorithm that regularizes policy updates with local transition/reward loss coupling.

Result: The framework yields monotonic improvement and convergence guarantees in online settings; DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines (PPO, DeepMDPs) on the ALE-57 benchmark while preserving theoretical guarantees.

Conclusion: Online SPI with world models and representation learning is viable; DeepSPI offers a principled, guarantee-preserving on-policy method with strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Safe policy improvement (SPI) offers theoretical control over policy updates,
yet existing guarantees largely concern offline, tabular reinforcement learning
(RL). We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model
and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that
restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy
ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition
and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep"
analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on
these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that
couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On
the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including
PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.

*Kiattikun Chobtham,Kanoksri Sarinnapakorn,Kritanai Torsri,Prattana Deeprasertkul,Jirawan Kamma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-informed Graph Neural Network approach with Attention-LSTM and a novel Spatial Season-aware GPD for rainfall extremes in Thailand, achieving improved extreme-event predictions and fine-resolution maps, with explainability via teleconnections.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate rainfall forecasting, especially for extreme events, is crucial for climatology and water management but remains challenging; the work seeks to combine physics-informed graphs with extreme-value analysis to improve predictions and interpretability.

Method: Graph Attention Network with LSTM on a graph of gauge stations; initial edge features from simple orographic-precipitation physics; incorporate climate indices; Peak-Over-Threshold mapping using Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto Distribution to model extremes; aims for explainability via teleconnections and fine-resolution regional maps.

Result: Outperforms well-established baselines across most regions, including extreme-prone areas; competitive with the state of the art; outperforms SEAS5 in extreme-event prediction and provides practical, high-resolution rainfall maps for long-term water management.

Conclusion: The approach yields accurate extreme rainfall predictions with explainability, offering a practical tool for improved decision-making in water resource management and climate-risk assessment.

Abstract: Accurate rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, remains a
significant challenge in climatology and the Earth system. This paper presents
novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value
analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across
Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge
stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers
explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices
that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention
Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention
mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple
orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently
processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold
(POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto
Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional
machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to
extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art. Compared
with the operational forecasting system SEAS5, our real-world application
improves extreme-event prediction and offers a practical enhancement to produce
fine-resolution maps that support decision-making in long-term water
management.

### [141] [Finite-time Convergence Analysis of Actor-Critic with Evolving Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12334)
*Rui Hu,Yu Chen,Longbo Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: First finite-time analysis of a single-timescale actor-critic with evolving rewards under Markovian sampling; achieves O(1/√T) convergence when reward drift is slow; improves static-reward distribution-mismatch rate by log^2 T; supports gradient-based reward updates on the same timescale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Popular RL methods use evolving reward mechanisms (reward shaping, entropy regularization, curriculum learning) but lack rigorous finite-time guarantees; understanding how reward evolution interacts with policy/value learning is essential.

Method: Non-asymptotic analysis of a single-timescale actor-critic under Markovian sampling with time-varying rewards. Derive bounds for actor and critic errors under standard assumptions; analyze both static and gradient-based reward updates on the same timescale; include a novel distribution-mismatch analysis under Markovian sampling.

Result: An O(1/√T) convergence rate is achievable provided reward parameters evolve slowly enough; this rate persists when rewards are updated via a gradient-based rule with bounded gradient on the same timescale as actor/critic. Additionally, distribution-mismatch analysis under Markovian sampling yields a improved rate by a factor of log^2 T in the static-reward case.

Conclusion: This work provides the first finite-time guarantees for single-timescale actor-critic with evolving rewards, grounding popular RL techniques in theory. It shows that standard O(1/√T) rates extend to slowly varying rewards and offers an improved understanding of distribution mismatch under Markovian sampling.

Abstract: Many popular practical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms employ evolving
reward functions-through techniques such as reward shaping, entropy
regularization, or curriculum learning-yet their theoretical foundations remain
underdeveloped. This paper provides the first finite-time convergence analysis
of a single-timescale actor-critic algorithm in the presence of an evolving
reward function under Markovian sampling. We consider a setting where the
reward parameters may change at each time step, affecting both policy
optimization and value estimation. Under standard assumptions, we derive
non-asymptotic bounds for both actor and critic errors. Our result shows that
an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate is achievable, matching the best-known rate
for static rewards, provided the reward parameters evolve slowly enough. This
rate is preserved when the reward is updated via a gradient-based rule with
bounded gradient and on the same timescale as the actor and critic, offering a
theoretical foundation for many popular RL techniques. As a secondary
contribution, we introduce a novel analysis of distribution mismatch under
Markovian sampling, improving the best-known rate by a factor of $\log^2T$ in
the static-reward case.

### [142] [Traveling Salesman-Based Token Ordering Improves Stability in Homomorphically Encrypted Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12343)
*Donghwan Rho,Sieun Seo,Hyewon Sung,Chohong Min,Ernest K. Ryu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a traveling salesman problem (TSP)-based token reordering strategy with a post-processing step to enable secure, encrypted next-token generation under homomorphic encryption, addressing core challenges and improving coherence while preserving privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As users interact with LLMs on private data, secure encrypted computation is essential. HE enables computation on encrypted data but generation tasks (next-token prediction) under HE suffer from quality and stability issues; there is a need for methods to enable practical encrypted generation.

Method: Introduce a TSP-based token reordering strategy to mitigate ordering/approximation issues in encrypted generation, coupled with a post-processing step to reduce approximation error; provide theoretical analysis and experiments to validate effectiveness.

Result: The approach prevents generation collapse, improves coherence of encrypted-generated text, and preserves data privacy throughout HE-based LLM inference, supported by theoretical analysis and experiments.

Conclusion: This work advances the practicality of privacy-preserving LLM inference under homomorphic encryption by enabling more reliable encrypted text generation.

Abstract: As users increasingly interact with large language models (LLMs) using
private information, secure and encrypted communication becomes essential.
Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a principled solution by enabling
computation directly on encrypted data. Although prior work has explored
aspects of running LLMs under HE, the challenge of text generation,
particularly next-token prediction, has received limited attention and remains
a key obstacle to practical encrypted interaction. In this work, we propose a
TSP-based token reordering strategy to address the difficulties of encrypted
text generation, together with a post-processing step that further reduces
approximation error. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate
that our method prevents collapse, improves coherence in generated text, and
preserves data privacy throughout. Overall, our contributions advance the
feasibility of practical and privacy-preserving LLM inference.

### [143] [Towards Cross-Modal Error Detection with Tables and Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12383)
*Olga Ovcharenko,Sebastian Schelter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper benchmarks cross-modal error detection for tabular data across four datasets and five baselines; finds Cleanlab and DataScope perform best with AutoML, but overall methods struggle with heavy-tailed real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As data modalities co-exist, cross-modal errors degrade data quality; existing single-modality error detectors miss cross-modal issues. Addressing this gap is crucial for scalable data quality in domains like e-commerce and healthcare.

Method: Benchmark setup evaluating five baseline methods on tabular data across four datasets, integrating with a strong AutoML framework, and measuring performance with F1 score; focus on cross-modal error detection in tabular data; comparison highlights Cleanlab and DataScope.

Result: Cleanlab and DataScope achieve the highest F1 when paired with AutoML; overall methods remain limited, especially on heavy-tailed real-world data.

Conclusion: Need for more research to improve cross-modal error detection in heavy-tailed data; cross-modal alignment with AutoML shows potential; current approaches do not yet suffice for scalable, diverse data.

Abstract: Ensuring data quality at scale remains a persistent challenge for large
organizations. Despite recent advances, maintaining accurate and consistent
data is still complex, especially when dealing with multiple data modalities.
Traditional error detection and correction methods tend to focus on a single
modality, typically a table, and often miss cross-modal errors that are common
in domains like e-Commerce and healthcare, where image, tabular, and text data
co-exist. To address this gap, we take an initial step towards cross-modal
error detection in tabular data, by benchmarking several methods. Our
evaluation spans four datasets and five baseline approaches. Among them,
Cleanlab, a label error detection framework, and DataScope, a data valuation
method, perform the best when paired with a strong AutoML framework, achieving
the highest F1 scores. Our findings indicate that current methods remain
limited, particularly when applied to heavy-tailed real-world data, motivating
further research in this area.

### [144] [Enhanced Pre-training of Graph Neural Networks for Million-Scale Heterogeneous Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12401)
*Shengyin Sun,Chen Ma,Jiehao Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A self-supervised pre-training framework for heterogeneous graphs that improves transferability under label scarcity by combining structure-aware and semantic-aware tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome (1) limited task-specific labels for GNNs and (2) semantic mismatch between original data and transferable data in heterogeneous graphs.

Method: Two pre-training tasks are designed: a structure-aware task to capture architectural properties of heterogeneous graphs, and a semantic-aware task that constructs a perturbation subspace of semantic neighbors to mitigate semantic mismatch and emphasize general semantic knowledge for transferability.

Result: Experiments on large real-world heterogeneous graphs show the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating improved transferability; code is provided at the given repository.

Conclusion: The framework provides effective pre-training for heterogeneous graphs by addressing both structural properties and semantic mismatch, yielding superior performance on downstream tasks with limited labels.

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated the
development of graph data mining. However, training GNNs requires sufficient
labeled task-specific data, which is expensive and sometimes unavailable. To be
less dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a
self-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks
with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely
for homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not
consider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data
and the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this
paper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale
heterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which
aims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design
a semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we
construct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal
with the semantic mismatch. Semantic neighbors make the model focus more on the
general knowledge in the semantic space, which in turn assists the model in
learning knowledge with better transferability. Finally, extensive experiments
are conducted on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines. Code

### [145] [Cautious Weight Decay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12402)
*Lizhang Chen,Jonathan Li,Kaizhao Liang,Baiyu Su,Cong Xie,Nuo Wang Pierse,Chen Liang,Ni Lao,Qiang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cautious Weight Decay (CWD) is a simple, optimizer-agnostic one-line modification that applies weight decay only to parameter coordinates whose update sign matches the optimizer, preserving the original loss and enabling a bilevel interpretation that seeks locally Pareto-optimal stationary points; it is a drop-in for AdamW, Lion, Muon and improves final loss and accuracy on large-scale pretraining and ImageNet with no extra hyperparameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard decoupled weight decay implicitly regularizes the objective and can misalign with the descent direction. CWD aims to preserve the original loss while guiding optimization toward locally Pareto-optimal stationary points by applying decay only where the update direction aligns with the parameter sign, yielding a bilevel interpretation and more robust convergence.

Method: A one-line, optimizer-agnostic modification that applies weight decay only to parameter coordinates whose signs align with the optimizer update. It preserves the original loss and admits a bilevel interpretation with sliding-mode behavior at the stationary manifold. It is a drop-in change for optimizers such as AdamW, Lion, and Muon, requiring no new hyperparameters or tuning.

Result: Empirically, CWD improves final loss and accuracy at language-model pre-training and ImageNet classification scales, across million- to billion-parameter models, without added hyperparameters and with no extra tuning.

Conclusion: CWD is a simple, effective, and broadly compatible improvement: it preserves the unmodified objective, offers a bilevel perspective, and yields consistent performance gains as a drop-in for popular optimizers at large scales.

Abstract: We introduce Cautious Weight Decay (CWD), a one-line, optimizer-agnostic
modification that applies weight decay only to parameter coordinates whose
signs align with the optimizer update. Unlike standard decoupled decay, which
implicitly optimizes a regularized or constrained objective, CWD preserves the
original loss and admits a bilevel interpretation: it induces sliding-mode
behavior upon reaching the stationary manifold, allowing it to search for
locally Pareto-optimal stationary points of the unmodified objective. In
practice, CWD is a drop-in change for optimizers such as AdamW, Lion, and Muon,
requiring no new hyperparameters or additional tuning. For language model
pre-training and ImageNet classification, CWD consistently improves final loss
and accuracy at million- to billion-parameter scales.

### [146] [Continuous Uniqueness and Novelty Metrics for Generative Modeling of Inorganic Crystals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12405)
*Masahiro Negishi,Hyunsoo Park,Kinga O. Mastej,Aron Walsh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two continuous distance functions for evaluating generative models of inorganic crystals, addressing four key limitations of standard distance metrics, yielding a more reliable uniqueness and novelty assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current metrics fail to quantify similarity, separate composition from structure, lack Lipschitz continuity under coordinate shifts, and aren't permutation-invariant; this hampers reliable evaluation of generative models sampling crystal structures and compositions.

Method: Introduce two continuous distance functions with theoretical properties to overcome the four limitations; apply them to evaluate generative models sampling chemical compositions and crystal structures; analyze their behavior and compare with traditional metrics.

Result: The proposed distances reveal insights missed by traditional distances; provide a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models for inorganic crystals; empirical experiments support improved interpretability and robustness.

Conclusion: Adopting these two continuous distance functions improves the evaluation of generative models for inorganic crystals by offering better similarity, novelty, invariance, and continuity properties.

Abstract: To address pressing scientific challenges such as climate change,
increasingly sophisticated generative artificial intelligence models are being
developed that can efficiently sample the large chemical space of possible
functional materials. These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions
paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness
and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function.
However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to
quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish
compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity
against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that
is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we
propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and
novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show
that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions,
providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models
for inorganic crystals.

### [147] [Bayesian Optimization for Dynamic Pricing and Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12447)
*Anush Anand,Pranav Agrawal,Tejas Bodas*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A GP-based nonparametric dynamic pricing framework using Bayesian Optimization to learn the demand function and optimize pricing in infinite and finite inventory settings, with regret guarantees and superior revenue performance over RL baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Demand is unknown and often nonparametric; relying on parametric demand models can be restrictive and fragile in real markets. There is a need for sample-efficient, robust methods that can learn and optimize pricing under uncertainty.

Method: Model the demand as a black-box function of price using Gaussian Processes. Use Bayesian Optimization to select prices that maximize revenue, adapting to feedback. Develop BO-based algorithms for both infinite and finite inventory regimes and establish regret guarantees.

Result: Empirical results show that the BO-based methods achieve higher revenue than several state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms, with fewer modeling assumptions and greater robustness.

Conclusion: Bayesian Optimization with Gaussian Processes is a practical and powerful approach for dynamic pricing in uncertain environments, offering strong performance, robustness, and theoretical regret guarantees.

Abstract: Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting the selling price of a product
to maximize a firm's revenue by responding to market demand. The literature
typically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the
firm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both
inventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge
lies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is
unknown and must be learned from data. Traditional approaches often assume a
specific parametric form for the demand function, enabling the use of
reinforcement learning (RL) to identify near-optimal pricing strategies.
However, such assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the
applicability of these methods. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) based nonparametric approach to dynamic pricing that avoids restrictive
modeling assumptions. We treat the demand function as a black-box function of
the price and develop pricing algorithms based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) --
a sample-efficient method for optimizing unknown functions. We present BO-based
algorithms tailored for both infinite and finite inventory settings and provide
regret guarantees for both regimes, thereby quantifying the learning efficiency
of our methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BO-based
methods outperform several state-of-the-art RL algorithms in terms of revenue,
while requiring fewer assumptions and offering greater robustness. This
highlights Bayesian Optimization as a powerful and practical tool for dynamic
pricing in complex, uncertain environments.

### [148] [A Function Centric Perspective On Flat and Sharp Minima](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12451)
*Israel Mason-Williams,Gabryel Mason-Williams,Helen Yannakoudakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sharpness alone is not a universal predictor of generalisation; when coupled with regularisation, sharper minima can correspond to better generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency, suggesting a function-centric view of loss landscapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenging the conventional belief that flat minima generalise better by showing that sharp minima may arise with regularisation and can improve multiple performance metrics; arguing for a function- rather than geometry-centric interpretation.

Method: Extensive empirical studies across single-objective optimization and modern image classification, analyzing the effect of regularisers (e.g., SAM, weight decay, data augmentation) on sharpness, generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency across diverse models/datasets.

Result: Sharper minima frequently appear under regularisation and can align with improved generalisation and other metrics; baselines without regularisation tend to find flatter minima yet underperform on safety-related metrics; overall geometry appears to be driven by function complexity and inductive biases rather than flatness alone.

Conclusion: Proposes a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscapes, arguing that sharper minima may reflect appropriate inductive biases under regularisation and that function complexity governs solution geometry more than flatness per se.

Abstract: Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in
deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in
recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions
emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in
model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a
function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor
generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective
optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima
often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data
augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better
generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a
range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation
tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than
flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can
reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation),
calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

### [149] [Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12453)
*Viacheslav Vasilev,Arseny Ivanov,Nikita Gushchin,Maria Kovaleva,Alexander Korotin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching (TCVBM) extends Bridge Matching to time-correlated video data, enabling better frame interpolation, image-to-video generation, and video super-resolution by modeling temporal dependencies in diffusion bridges and achieving superior quantitative results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are strong for noise-to-data tasks but struggle with data-to-data transitions, especially when temporal coherence is required. Bridge Matching helps data-to-data translations, yet its application to time-correlated sequences (videos) remains underexplored, hindering progress in video generation and manipulation.

Method: TCVBM extends diffusion-bridge Bridge Matching to time-correlated sequences by explicitly modeling inter-sequence dependencies within the diffusion bridge and incorporating temporal correlations into the sampling process. The approach is evaluated against classical bridge matching and diffusion-model baselines on frame interpolation, image-to-video generation, and video super-resolution.

Result: TCVBM achieves superior performance across multiple quantitative metrics on the three video tasks, indicating improved generation quality and reconstruction fidelity.

Conclusion: Incorporating temporal correlations into diffusion-bridge planning yields tangible gains for video generation and manipulation, suggesting that temporal-aware bridge matching is a promising direction for video synthesis and related tasks.

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in noise-to-data generation tasks, providing a mapping
from a Gaussian distribution to a more complex data distribution. However they
struggle to model translations between complex distributions, limiting their
effectiveness in data-to-data tasks. While Bridge Matching (BM) models address
this by finding the translation between data distributions, their application
to time-correlated data sequences remains unexplored. This is a critical
limitation for video generation and manipulation tasks, where maintaining
temporal coherence is particularly important. To address this gap, we propose
Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching (TCVBM), a framework that extends BM to
time-correlated data sequences in the video domain. TCVBM explicitly models
inter-sequence dependencies within the diffusion bridge, directly incorporating
temporal correlations into the sampling process. We compare our approach to
classical methods based on bridge matching and diffusion models for three
video-related tasks: frame interpolation, image-to-video generation, and video
super-resolution. TCVBM achieves superior performance across multiple
quantitative metrics, demonstrating enhanced generation quality and
reconstruction fidelity.

### [150] [CrossAD: Time Series Anomaly Detection with Cross-scale Associations and Cross-window Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12489)
*Beibu Li,Qichao Shentu,Yang Shu,Hui Zhang,Ming Li,Ning Jin,Bin Yang,Chenjuan Guo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CrossAD: cross-scale and cross-window time series anomaly detection with cross-scale reconstruction and a query library, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series exhibit patterns at multiple scales; existing methods model scales independently or with simple fusion and rely on fixed sliding windows, missing dynamic cross-scale changes during anomalies; need a framework that models cross-scale associations and uses broader context.

Method: Proposes CrossAD which (1) performs cross-scale reconstruction to reconstruct fine-grained series from coarser series to capture cross-scale dependencies, (2) introduces a query library and incorporates global multi-scale context to overcome fixed window limitations, enabling cross-window modeling, (3) integrates these components into a time series anomaly detection framework.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets with nine evaluation metrics show CrossAD achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance.

Conclusion: CrossAD effectively models cross-scale and cross-window dynamics, improving anomaly detection in time series and addressing key limitations of prior multi-scale approaches.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Given that time series data can exhibit different
patterns at different sampling granularities, multi-scale modeling has proven
beneficial for uncovering latent anomaly patterns that may not be apparent at a
single scale. However, existing methods often model multi-scale information
independently or rely on simple feature fusion strategies, neglecting the
dynamic changes in cross-scale associations that occur during anomalies.
Moreover, most approaches perform multi-scale modeling based on fixed sliding
windows, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information. In this work, we propose CrossAD, a novel framework for time
series Anomaly Detection that takes Cross-scale associations and Cross-window
modeling into account. We propose a cross-scale reconstruction that
reconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series, explicitly capturing
cross-scale associations. Furthermore, we design a query library and
incorporate global multi-scale context to overcome the limitations imposed by
fixed window sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world
datasets using nine evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of CrossAD,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.

### [151] [PubSub-VFL: Towards Efficient Two-Party Split Learning in Heterogeneous Environments via Publisher/Subscriber Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12494)
*Yi Liu,Yang Liu,Leqian Zheng,Jue Hong,Junjie Shi,Qingyou Yang,Ye Wu,Cong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PubSub-VFL is a Publisher/Subscriber based two-party vertical federated learning framework that uses hierarchical asynchronous mechanisms to boost training speed and resource utilization while preserving privacy; it achieves 2–7x speedups and up to 91.07% utilization, with convergent and privacy-safe properties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable privacy-preserving data collaboration in two-party VFL while addressing low resource utilization, high latency, and heterogeneity across participants.

Method: Introduce PubSub-VFL architecture: decoupled Pub/Sub and data-parallel hierarchical async mechanism; optimize hyperparameters via a system-profile based optimization problem; provide convergence analysis; demonstrate privacy compatibility with differential privacy; validate with five benchmarks.

Result: Training latency reduced by 2–7x, accuracy preserved; resource utilization up to 91.07%; convergence-stable; compatible with differential privacy.

Conclusion: PubSub-VFL effectively improves efficiency and scalability of two-party VFL under heterogeneity and privacy constraints, combining Pub/Sub with parameter-server ideas; suitable for secure, efficient collaborative learning.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital economy, data collaboration between
organizations has become a well-established business model, driving the growth
of various industries. However, privacy concerns make direct data sharing
impractical. To address this, Two-Party Split Learning (a.k.a. Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL)) has emerged as a promising solution for secure
collaborative learning. Despite its advantages, this architecture still suffers
from low computational resource utilization and training efficiency.
Specifically, its synchronous dependency design increases training latency,
while resource and data heterogeneity among participants further hinder
efficient computation. To overcome these challenges, we propose PubSub-VFL, a
novel VFL paradigm with a Publisher/Subscriber architecture optimized for
two-party collaborative learning with high computational efficiency. PubSub-VFL
leverages the decoupling capabilities of the Pub/Sub architecture and the data
parallelism of the parameter server architecture to design a hierarchical
asynchronous mechanism, reducing training latency and improving system
efficiency. Additionally, to mitigate the training imbalance caused by resource
and data heterogeneity, we formalize an optimization problem based on
participants' system profiles, enabling the selection of optimal
hyperparameters while preserving privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis to
demonstrate that PubSub-VFL achieves stable convergence and is compatible with
security protocols such as differential privacy. Extensive case studies on five
benchmark datasets further validate its effectiveness, showing that, compared
to state-of-the-art baselines, PubSub-VFL not only accelerates training by $2
\sim 7\times$ without compromising accuracy, but also achieves a computational
resource utilization rate of up to 91.07%.

### [152] [Mitigating the Noise Shift for Denoising Generative Models via Noise Awareness Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12497)
*Jincheng Zhong,Boyuan Jiang,Xin Tao,Pengfei Wan,Kun Gai,Mingsheng Long*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Identifies a pervasive misalignment between the predefined noise schedule and the actual noise in intermediate states during diffusion sampling (noise shift). Proposes Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG) to align trajectories with the noise schedule, plus a classifier-free variant with noise-condition dropout, improving generation quality across diffusion models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noise shift causes suboptimal denoising and out-of-distribution generalization in diffusion-based generative models; observed as a systematic bias across modern models.

Method: Introduce Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG) to correct sampling trajectories to stay consistent with the predefined noise schedule; develop a classifier-free variant by jointly training a noise-conditional and a noise-unconditional model via noise-condition dropout; validate through extensive experiments on ImageNet generation and supervised fine-tuning tasks.

Result: NAG mitigates noise shift and consistently improves generation quality of mainstream diffusion models across diverse tasks and datasets.

Conclusion: Addressing noise shift with NAG (and its classifier-free variant) effectively stabilizes sampling, enhances alignment with the noise schedule, and yields notable quality gains, suggesting broader applicability to diffusion-based generation.

Abstract: Existing denoising generative models rely on solving discretized reverse-time
SDEs or ODEs. In this paper, we identify a long-overlooked yet pervasive issue
in this family of models: a misalignment between the pre-defined noise level
and the actual noise level encoded in intermediate states during sampling. We
refer to this misalignment as noise shift. Through empirical analysis, we
demonstrate that noise shift is widespread in modern diffusion models and
exhibits a systematic bias, leading to sub-optimal generation due to both
out-of-distribution generalization and inaccurate denoising updates. To address
this problem, we propose Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG), a simple yet effective
correction method that explicitly steers sampling trajectories to remain
consistent with the pre-defined noise schedule. We further introduce a
classifier-free variant of NAG, which jointly trains a noise-conditional and a
noise-unconditional model via noise-condition dropout, thereby eliminating the
need for external classifiers. Extensive experiments, including ImageNet
generation and various supervised fine-tuning tasks, show that NAG consistently
mitigates noise shift and substantially improves the generation quality of
mainstream diffusion models.

*Huiyang Yi,Yanyan He,Duxin Chen,Mingyu Kang,He Wang,Wenwu Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extensive benchmarking of differentiable causal discovery methods under eight model-assumption violations shows robustness in SHD and SID (except scale variation), with theoretical explanations and a call to standardize evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal discovery relies on unverifiable assumptions that often fail in real data; there is a need to systematically evaluate how differentiable methods perform under common assumption violations and to establish standard benchmarks.

Method: Conducted large-scale experiments evaluating mainstream causal discovery algorithms—focusing on differentiable methods—across eight controlled model-assumption violations; assessed inferred graphs with Structural Hamming Distance and Structural Intervention Distance; included theoretical analysis to explain observed performance.

Result: Differentiable causal discovery methods exhibit robustness in SHD and SID across challenging violations, except for scale variation; results provide empirical evidence and explanations for performance patterns.

Conclusion: This work provides a comprehensive benchmark for differentiable causal discovery under assumption violations, proposes a standard for evaluation, and aims to promote real-world application of these methods.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to learn causal relationships between variables from
targeted data, making it a fundamental task in machine learning. However,
causal discovery algorithms often rely on unverifiable causal assumptions,
which are usually difficult to satisfy in real-world data, thereby limiting the
broad application of causal discovery in practical scenarios. Inspired by these
considerations, this work extensively benchmarks the empirical performance of
various mainstream causal discovery algorithms, which assume i.i.d. data, under
eight model assumption violations. Our experimental results show that
differentiable causal discovery methods exhibit robustness under the metrics of
Structural Hamming Distance and Structural Intervention Distance of the
inferred graphs in commonly used challenging scenarios, except for scale
variation. We also provide the theoretical explanations for the performance of
differentiable causal discovery methods. Finally, our work aims to
comprehensively benchmark the performance of recent differentiable causal
discovery methods under model assumption violations, and provide the standard
for reasonable evaluation of causal discovery, as well as to further promote
its application in real-world scenarios.

### [154] [Multi-Armed Bandits with Minimum Aggregated Revenue Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12523)
*Ahmed Ben Yahmed,Hafedh El Ferchichi,Marc Abeille,Vianney Perchet*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A contextual multi-armed bandit problem with cross-context minimum-reward constraints for each arm; the paper designs optimistic and pessimistic algorithms, derives problem-dependent regret and constraint-violation bounds, and proves a matching lower bound showing horizon dependence is optimal and exposing limits of free exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fair revenue allocation across contexts with contextual variation; standard MAB results assume unconstrained optimization, but here a global minimum-reward constraint across contexts makes optimization harder; guarantees on both performance and constraint satisfaction are desirable.

Method: Propose two algorithmic families: optimistic (prioritize high reward) and pessimistic (enforce constraints). Derive problem-dependent upper bounds on regret and constraint violations for each algorithm. Prove a lower bound demonstrating that horizon dependence cannot be improved in general and exposing limits of free exploration.

Result: Regret and constraint-violation bounds (problem-dependent) for both algorithm classes; a lower bound showing the optimality of horizon dependence; insights into the trade-off between exploration and constraint satisfaction.

Conclusion: Extends contextual MAB by incorporating cross-context minimum-reward constraints, characterizes fundamental limits, highlights the role of time horizon in learning under constraints, and guides future algorithm design under similar fairness/constraint requirements.

Abstract: We examine a multi-armed bandit problem with contextual information, where
the objective is to ensure that each arm receives a minimum aggregated reward
across contexts while simultaneously maximizing the total cumulative reward.
This framework captures a broad class of real-world applications where fair
revenue allocation is critical and contextual variation is inherent. The
cross-context aggregation of minimum reward constraints, while enabling better
performance and easier feasibility, introduces significant technical challenges
-- particularly the absence of closed-form optimal allocations typically
available in standard MAB settings. We design and analyze algorithms that
either optimistically prioritize performance or pessimistically enforce
constraint satisfaction. For each algorithm, we derive problem-dependent upper
bounds on both regret and constraint violations. Furthermore, we establish a
lower bound demonstrating that the dependence on the time horizon in our
results is optimal in general and revealing fundamental limitations of the free
exploration principle leveraged in prior work.

*Jasmin Freudenberg,Kai Hahn,Christian Weber,Madjid Fathi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work analyzes ECG pre-processing steps for edge deployment in the FACE project, aiming to enable privacy-preserving, energy-efficient real-time long-term ECG analysis through edge-cloud collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The rise of portable ECG devices creates a demand for privacy-friendly and energy-efficient real-time processing; edge computing reduces latency and enhances security; the FACE project seeks to leverage edge-cloud synergy.

Method: Systematically evaluate ECG pre-processing steps for edge suitability using criteria such as energy efficiency, processing capability, and real-time capability; identify methods appropriate for edge deployment and guide selection for incorporation into a future ML solution.

Result: The abstract describes the analysis and criteria-based selection of pre-processing steps, establishing groundwork rather than presenting empirical results; proposes mapping of steps to edge suitability within FACE.

Conclusion: The study lays groundwork for FACE's ML solution by identifying edge-appropriate ECG pre-processing steps and criteria for method selection to enable real-time, energy-efficient edge processing with cloud support.

Abstract: The increasing popularity of portable ECG systems and the growing demand for
privacy-compliant, energy-efficient real-time analysis require new approaches
to signal processing at the point of data acquisition. In this context, the
edge domain is acquiring increasing importance, as it not only reduces latency
times, but also enables an increased level of data security. The FACE project
aims to develop an innovative machine learning solution for analysing long-term
electrocardiograms that synergistically combines the strengths of edge and
cloud computing. In this thesis, various pre-processing steps of ECG signals
are analysed with regard to their applicability in the project. The selection
of suitable methods in the edge area is based in particular on criteria such as
energy efficiency, processing capability and real-time capability.

*Kevin Kuo,Chhavi Yadav,Virginia Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An interview-based study reveals practical barriers to cross-silo FL adoption, including concerns about performance, incentives, and trust, highlighting challenges distinct from cross-device FL and outlining future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While GDPR/HIPAA and data protection regulations encourage collaboration, data cannot be shared directly. Cross-silo FL offers a privacy-preserving path but its real-world adoption is limited, prompting a need to understand and address practical barriers.

Method: Qualitative interview study involving diverse stakeholders (user organizations, software providers, and academic researchers) to identify challenges and barriers to adopting cross-silo FL.

Result: Identified barriers include concerns about model performance, incentives, and trust between participating organizations. These challenges appear not fully captured by existing research and are distinct from cross-device FL, suggesting a need for targeted investigation and solutions.

Conclusion: Future research should address governance, incentive alignment, robust performance, and trust-building mechanisms, along with practical deployment guidelines to overcome the observed cross-silo FL adoption barriers.

Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enable
cross-organization collaboration in machine learning model development without
directly sharing private data. Despite growing organizational interest driven
by data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, the adoption of
cross-silo FL remains limited in practice. In this paper, we conduct an
interview study to understand the practical challenges associated with
cross-silo FL adoption. With interviews spanning a diverse set of stakeholders
such as user organizations, software providers, and academic researchers, we
uncover various barriers, from concerns about model performance to questions of
incentives and trust between participating organizations. Our study shows that
cross-silo FL faces a set of challenges that have yet to be well-captured by
existing research in the area and are quite distinct from other forms of
federated learning such as cross-device FL. We end with a discussion on future
research directions that can help overcome these challenges.

### [157] [Rethinking Knowledge Distillation: A Data Dependent Regulariser With a Negative Asymmetric Payoff](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12615)
*Israel Mason-Williams,Gabryel Mason-Williams,Helen Yannakoudakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Distillation is not a robust compression trick; transfer is modest and data-dependent, with surprising negative asymmetries, acting more as a regularizer than a compression mechanism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To disentangle compression from functional transfer, quantify transfer across modalities, and understand scaling and safety implications of knowledge distillation.

Method: A rigorous experimental framework using hypothesis testing, controls, and random-control distillation, exploring multiple distillation variants, and analyzing distillation scaling laws across model sizes. 12 setups, 9 architectures, 7 datasets, across data modalities.

Result: Knowledge transfer exists in some settings but is generally small and less than expected; when present, transfer shows a consistent and severe negative (asymmetric) transfer of knowledge from teacher to student. Overall, distillation behaves more like a data-dependent regularizer with a negative payoff rather than a robust compression mechanism.

Conclusion: Knowledge distillation is not primarily a compression tool; it acts as a data-dependent regularizer with potential safety concerns from negative transfer, suggesting limited utility for compression and careful consideration of transfer effects.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is often considered a compression mechanism when
judged on the resulting student's accuracy and loss, yet its functional impact
is poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the compression capacity of
knowledge distillation and the resulting knowledge transfer from a functional
perspective, decoupling compression from architectural reduction, which
provides an improved understanding of knowledge distillation. We employ
hypothesis testing, controls, and random control distillation to understand
knowledge transfer mechanisms across data modalities. To rigorously test the
breadth and limits of our analyses, we explore multiple distillation variants
and analyse distillation scaling laws across model sizes. Our findings
demonstrate that, while there is statistically significant knowledge transfer
in some modalities and architectures, the extent of this transfer is less
pronounced than anticipated, even under conditions designed to maximise
knowledge sharing. Notably, in cases of significant knowledge transfer, we
identify a consistent and severe asymmetric transfer of negative knowledge to
the student, raising safety concerns in knowledge distillation applications.
Across 12 experimental setups, 9 architectures, and 7 datasets, our findings
show that knowledge distillation functions less as a compression mechanism and
more as a data-dependent regulariser with a negative asymmetric payoff.

TL;DR: 


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 

Method: 

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by
a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional
manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined
problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously
fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these
tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce
dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging
the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained
models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g.,
the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot
mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen
weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple,
simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of
concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded
into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast
and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.

*Yuta Kobayashi,Zilin Jing,Jiayu Yao,Hongseok Namkoong,Shalmali Joshi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes meta-active feature acquisition (AFA) with Learning-to-Measure (L2M): cross-task acquisition policies with reliable uncertainty quantification, using an uncertainty-guided, MI-maximizing greedy agent and autoregressive pre-training to handle arbitrary missingness, enabling in-context meta-learning without per-task retraining and strong performance on tabular data with missingness and limited labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AFA methods typically optimize for a single task and struggle with retrospective, missing data and scarce labels across many tasks. There is a need for scalable, cross-task AFA policies with reliable uncertainty estimates.

Method: Introduce Learning-to-Measure (L2M) for meta-AFA. It provides (i) reliable uncertainty quantification over unseen tasks, and (ii) an uncertainty-guided greedy feature acquisition agent that maximizes conditional mutual information. A sequence-modeling autoregressive pre-training approach enables reliable uncertainty quantification for tasks with arbitrary missingness. L2M operates directly on datasets with retrospective missingness and performs the meta-AFA task in-context, eliminating per-task retraining.

Result: Across synthetic and real-world tabular benchmarks, L2M matches or surpasses task-specific baselines, particularly under scarce labels and high missingness.

Conclusion: L2M provides a scalable, uncertainty-aware meta-AFA solution that avoids per-task retraining while delivering competitive or superior performance, especially when labeling is limited and data are highly incomplete.

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is a sequential decision-making problem
where the goal is to improve model performance for test instances by adaptively
selecting which features to acquire. In practice, AFA methods often learn from
retrospective data with systematic missingness in the features and limited
task-specific labels. Most prior work addresses acquisition for a single
predetermined task, limiting scalability. To address this limitation, we
formalize the meta-AFA problem, where the goal is to learn acquisition policies
across various tasks. We introduce Learning-to-Measure (L2M), which consists of
i) reliable uncertainty quantification over unseen tasks, and ii) an
uncertainty-guided greedy feature acquisition agent that maximizes conditional
mutual information. We demonstrate a sequence-modeling or autoregressive
pre-training approach that underpins reliable uncertainty quantification for
tasks with arbitrary missingness. L2M operates directly on datasets with
retrospective missingness and performs the meta-AFA task in-context,
eliminating per-task retraining. Across synthetic and real-world tabular
benchmarks, L2M matches or surpasses task-specific baselines, particularly
under scarce labels and high missingness.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Laminar introduces a decoupled RL post-training system for LLMs that enables trajectory-level asynchrony via a relay-based parameter service and dynamic repack, achieving large-scale throughput gains and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome extreme long-tail latency and GPU underutilization in RL post-training with LLMs, caused by global synchronized weight updates and skewed trajectory generation distributions, which hampers scalability and efficiency.

Method: A fully decoupled architecture with a relay layer acting as a distributed parameter service enables asynchronous, fine-grained weight synchronization; a dynamic repack mechanism consolidates long-tail trajectories onto a few dedicated rollouts; isolates failures for robustness during long-running training.

Result: Demonstrates up to 5.48× training throughput speedup over state-of-the-art systems on a 1024-GPU cluster and reduced model convergence time.

Conclusion: Decoupled, trajectory-level asynchronous RL post-training substantially improves scaling efficiency and robustness for LLM reasoning enhancement at scale.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for Large Language Models (LLMs) is
now scaling to large clusters and running for extended durations to enhance
model reasoning performance. However, the scalability of existing RL frameworks
is limited, as extreme long-tail skewness in RL trajectory generation causes
severe GPU underutilization. Current asynchronous RL systems attempt to
mitigate this, but they rely on global weight synchronization between the actor
and all rollouts, which creates a rigid model update schedule. This global
synchronization is ill-suited for the highly skewed and evolving distribution
of trajectory generation latency in RL training, crippling training efficiency.
Our key insight is that efficient scaling requires breaking this lockstep
through trajectory-level asynchrony, which generates and consumes each
trajectory independently. We propose Laminar, a scalable and robust RL
post-training system built on a fully decoupled architecture. First, we replace
global updates with a tier of relay workers acting as a distributed parameter
service. This enables asynchronous and fine-grained weight synchronization,
allowing rollouts to pull the latest weight anytime without stalling the
actor's training loop. Second, a dynamic repack mechanism consolidates
long-tail trajectories onto a few dedicated rollouts, maximizing generation
throughput. The fully decoupled design also isolates failures, ensuring
robustness for long-running jobs. Our evaluation on a 1024-GPU cluster shows
that Laminar achieves up to 5.48$\times$ training throughput speedup over
state-of-the-art systems, while reducing model convergence time.

### [161] [Expert or not? assessing data quality in offline reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12638)
*Arip Asadulaev,Fakhri Karray,Martin Takac*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bellman Wasserstein Distance (BWD) provides a value-aware, environment-free metric to assess offline dataset quality and predict offline RL performance; it also serves as a regularizer to improve policy returns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL datasets are heterogeneous and often mix expert, suboptimal, and random trajectories. It is hard to estimate data quality a priori without training agents. A value-aware measure that captures how far the dataset's behavior is from random can help triage datasets and guide optimization.

Method: Introduce Bellman Wasserstein distance (BWD) computed from a behavioral critic with a state-conditioned optimal transport formulation, measuring dissimilarity between the dataset's behavioral policy and a random reference policy. Requires no environment interaction or full policy optimization.

Result: BWD strongly correlates with an oracle performance score across D4RL MuJoCo tasks, enabling efficient prediction of standard agents' performance. When used as a regularizer during policy optimization, it pushes the learned policy away from random behavior and improves returns.

Conclusion: Value-aware, distributional signals like BWD are practical tools for triaging offline RL datasets and guiding policy optimization.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns exclusively from static datasets,
without further interaction with the environment. In practice, such datasets
vary widely in quality, often mixing expert, suboptimal, and even random
trajectories. The choice of algorithm therefore depends on dataset fidelity.
Behavior cloning can suffice on high-quality data, whereas mixed- or
low-quality data typically benefits from offline RL methods that stitch useful
behavior across trajectories. Yet in the wild it is difficult to assess dataset
quality a priori because the data's provenance and skill composition are
unknown. We address the problem of estimating offline dataset quality without
training an agent. We study a spectrum of proxies from simple cumulative
rewards to learned value based estimators, and introduce the Bellman
Wasserstein distance (BWD), a value aware optimal transport score that measures
how dissimilar a dataset's behavioral policy is from a random reference policy.
BWD is computed from a behavioral critic and a state conditional OT
formulation, requiring no environment interaction or full policy optimization.
Across D4RL MuJoCo tasks, BWD strongly correlates with an oracle performance
score that aggregates multiple offline RL algorithms, enabling efficient
prediction of how well standard agents will perform on a given dataset. Beyond
prediction, integrating BWD as a regularizer during policy optimization
explicitly pushes the learned policy away from random behavior and improves
returns. These results indicate that value aware, distributional signals such
as BWD are practical tools for triaging offline RL datasets and policy
optimization.

TL;DR: A foundation model trained on simulated event sequences enables instant, few-shot analysis of new datasets, with quick fine-tuning, reducing retraining needs and speeding discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need to efficiently analyze time-ordered event data across fields without building/train models per dataset; reduce cost/time; enable rapid insights.

Method: Train a single powerful foundation model on millions of simulated event sequences to capture general patterns; enable zero-shot/few-shot inference and fast fine-tuning on new data.

Result: The model analyzes new data instantly without retraining by looking at few examples; can be quickly fine-tuned for higher accuracy.

Conclusion: Foundation models for event sequences democratize analysis across disciplines and accelerate scientific progress.

Abstract: Many scientific fields, from medicine to seismology, rely on analyzing
sequences of events over time to understand complex systems. Traditionally,
machine learning models must be built and trained from scratch for each new
dataset, which is a slow and costly process. We introduce a new approach: a
single, powerful model that learns the underlying patterns of event data in
context. We trained this "foundation model" on millions of simulated event
sequences, teaching it a general-purpose understanding of how events can
unfold. As a result, our model can analyze new scientific data instantly,
without retraining, simply by looking at a few examples from the dataset. It
can also be quickly fine-tuned for even higher accuracy. This approach makes
sophisticated event analysis more accessible and accelerates the pace of
scientific discovery.

Motivation: To address the challenge of data-driven ODE modeling under sparse and noisy observations, enabling zero-shot inference without extensive retraining, by leveraging synthetic-data trained neural operators for robust ODE inference.

Method: Introduce FIM-ODE, a pretrained neural model that uses a flexible neural operator to infer ODEs from sparse and corrupted observations. It is trained on synthetic data to enable zero-shot inference in context.

Result: Empirically, FIM-ODE provides accurate ODE estimates on par with a neural state-of-the-art method and allows qualitative comparison of the estimated vector-field structures.

Conclusion: FIM-ODE demonstrates effective zero-shot ODE inference under challenging data conditions, offering robust and competitive performance along with interpretable vector-field structure insights.

Abstract: Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describe dynamical systems evolving
deterministically in continuous time. Accurate data-driven modeling of systems
as ODEs, a central problem across the natural sciences, remains challenging,
especially if the data is sparse or noisy. We introduce FIM-ODE (Foundation
Inference Model for ODEs), a pretrained neural model designed to estimate ODEs
zero-shot (i.e., in context) from sparse and noisy observations. Trained on
synthetic data, the model utilizes a flexible neural operator for robust ODE
inference, even from corrupted data. We empirically verify that FIM-ODE
provides accurate estimates, on par with a neural state-of-the-art method, and
qualitatively compare the structure of their estimated vector fields.

*Chih-Chuan Cheng,Yi-Ju Tseng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SG-XDEAT is a dual-stream, attention-based framework for supervised tabular learning that uses raw and target-aware representations with cross-attention and adaptive sparse attention to reduce noise and improve robustness, showing gains on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need robust deep tabular learning by modeling both raw features and label-aware representations and suppressing noisy signals; existing methods on tabular data struggle with noise; cross-dimensional and cross-encoding attention with sparsity may mitigate noise.

Method: A dual-stream encoder decomposes each input feature into a raw value stream and a target-conditioned (label-aware) stream; hierarchical stack of attention modules; components: (i) Cross-Dimensional self-attention for intra-view feature dependencies within each stream; (ii) Cross-Encoding self-attention for bidirectional interaction between raw and target-aware representations; (iii) Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) to suppress low-utility tokens by driving attention weights toward zero.

Result: Empirical results on multiple public benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines; jointly modeling raw and target-aware views with adaptive noise filtering yields a more robust deep tabular learner.

Conclusion: SG-XDEAT effectively integrates dual representations and attention mechanisms to improve supervised tabular learning, yielding robust performance by mitigating noise.

Abstract: We propose SG-XDEAT (Sparsity-Guided Cross Dimensional and Cross-Encoding
Attention with Target Aware Conditioning), a novel framework designed for
supervised learning on tabular data. At its core, SG-XDEAT employs a
dual-stream encoder that decomposes each input feature into two parallel
representations: a raw value stream and a target-conditioned (label-aware)
stream. These dual representations are then propagated through a hierarchical
stack of attention-based modules. SG-XDEAT integrates three key components: (i)
Cross-Dimensional self-attention, which captures intra-view dependencies among
features within each stream; (ii) Cross-Encoding self-attention, which enables
bidirectional interaction between raw and target-aware representations; and
(iii) an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) mechanism, which dynamically
suppresses low-utility tokens by driving their attention weights toward
zero--thereby mitigating the impact of noise. Empirical results on multiple
public benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, confirming that
jointly modeling raw and target-aware views--while adaptively filtering
noise--yields a more robust deep tabular learner.

TL;DR: A framework to fine-tune Whisper with structured sparsity and pruning, producing smaller, faster Hindi ASR models that preserve WER and surpass prior pruning methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable deploying Whisper on resource-constrained edge devices by reducing model size, memory, and FLOPs without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Use Sparse Group LASSO as a loss regularizer to enforce structured sparsity; propose a weight-statistics–aware pruning algorithm; design a custom text normalizer for WER evaluation.

Result: On Common Voice 11.0 Hindi, Whisper-small reduces parameters by 35.4%, memory by 14.25%, and FLOPs by 18.5% with no WER loss; Whisper-medium reduces parameters by 31%, memory by 15.29%, and FLOPs by 16.95%; also outperforms Iterative Magnitude Pruning by pruning 18.7% more parameters and achieving 12.31 WER reduction.

Conclusion: The framework delivers substantial resource reductions while preserving or improving ASR accuracy, making Whisper variants more deployable on edge devices and outperforming state-of-the-art pruning baselines.

Abstract: Whisper models have achieved remarkable progress in speech recognition; yet
their large size remains a bottleneck for deployment on resource-constrained
edge devices. This paper proposes a framework to design fine-tuned variants of
Whisper which address the above problem. Structured sparsity is enforced via
the Sparse Group LASSO penalty as a loss regularizer, to reduce the number of
FLOating Point operations (FLOPs). Further, a weight statistics aware pruning
algorithm is proposed. We also design our custom text normalizer for WER
evaluation. On Common Voice 11.0 Hindi dataset, we obtain, without degrading
WER, (a) 35.4% reduction in model parameters, 14.25% lower memory consumption
and 18.5% fewer FLOPs on Whisper-small, and (b) 31% reduction in model
parameters, 15.29% lower memory consumption and 16.95% fewer FLOPs on
Whisper-medium; and, (c) substantially outperform the state-of-the-art
Iterative Magnitude Pruning based method by pruning 18.7% more parameters along
with a 12.31 reduction in WER.

### [166] [Structure-Aware Spectral Sparsification via Uniform Edge Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12669)
*Kaiwen He,Petros Drineas,Rajiv Khanna*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In graphs with a well-separated k-clustering (large structure ratio Υ(k)), uniform edge sampling preserves the top eigen-subspace used for clustering, enabling scalable spectral clustering with O(γ^2 n log n / ε^2) samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spectral clustering relies on expensive eigenvector computations and resistance-based sparsification. The paper asks whether a simple, structure-agnostic approach—uniform edge sampling—can suffice for preserving spectral structure and clustering quality in large graphs.

Method: Developed resistance bounds for intra-cluster edges, a rank-(n-k) effective-resistance formulation, and a matrix Chernoff bound tailored to the dominant eigenspace. They prove that sampling O(γ^2 n log n / ε^2) edges yields a sparsifier whose top (n-k) eigenspace remains approximately aligned with the cluster indicators, preserving the spectral embedding and clustering performance, without importance sampling.

Result: The sparsifier preserves the top (n-k) eigen-subspace sufficiently to keep the spectral embedding faithful, ensuring clustering quality is maintained under uniform sampling. The work provides the first provable guarantee that uniform edge sampling suffices for structure-preserving spectral clustering in graphs with strong clusterability.

Conclusion: This work links coreset-based clustering theory with spectral sparsification and shows that, under strong clusterability, uniform sampling is effectively structure-aware and can replace more expensive resistance-based sampling for spectral clustering.

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a fundamental method for graph partitioning, but its
reliance on eigenvector computation limits scalability to massive graphs.
Classical sparsification methods preserve spectral properties by sampling edges
proportionally to their effective resistances, but require expensive
preprocessing to estimate these resistances. We study whether uniform edge
sampling-a simple, structure-agnostic strategy-can suffice for spectral
clustering. Our main result shows that for graphs admitting a well-separated
$k$-clustering, characterized by a large structure ratio $\Upsilon(k) =
\lambda_{k+1} / \rho_G(k)$, uniform sampling preserves the spectral subspace
used for clustering. Specifically, we prove that uniformly sampling $O(\gamma^2
n \log n / \epsilon^2)$ edges, where $\gamma$ is the Laplacian condition
number, yields a sparsifier whose top $(n-k)$-dimensional eigenspace is
approximately orthogonal to the cluster indicators. This ensures that the
spectral embedding remains faithful, and clustering quality is preserved. Our
analysis introduces new resistance bounds for intra-cluster edges, a
rank-$(n-k)$ effective resistance formulation, and a matrix Chernoff bound
adapted to the dominant eigenspace. These tools allow us to bypass importance
sampling entirely. Conceptually, our result connects recent coreset-based
clustering theory to spectral sparsification, showing that under strong
clusterability, even uniform sampling is structure-aware. This provides the
first provable guarantee that uniform edge sampling suffices for
structure-preserving spectral clustering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass safety guardrails; there is a need for a safe, efficient mechanism that does not require retraining or additional data.

Method: Modify the model's last-layer latent representations at inference time to remove harmful directions. This uses a computer-vision-inspired CW (Carlini-Wi gner) technique combined with orthogonal projection, enabling concept alignment and manipulation (CALM) without retraining or extra data.

Result: CALM reduces harmful outputs and outperforms baseline methods on most metrics, providing a lightweight safety solution with no additional training data or model fine-tuning and only a small computational overhead at inference.

Conclusion: CALM offers a practical, training-free approach to AI safety that can be deployed with minimal overhead, effectively suppressing harmful concepts at inference time.

Abstract: Large Language Models are susceptible to jailbreak attacks that bypass
built-in safety guardrails (e.g., by tricking the model with adversarial
prompts). We propose Concept Alignment and Concept Manipulation \textbf{CALM},
an inference-time method that suppresses harmful concepts by modifying latent

*Shouren Wang,Wang Yang,Xianxuan Long,Qifan Wang,Vipin Chaudhary,Xiaotian Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid thinking in LLMs shows partial mode separation, with reasoning leaking into no-think mode. The paper identifies four key controllability factors, proposes a two-phase training recipe and data strategy, and demonstrates that it preserves accuracy while greatly reducing no-think output and reasoning-supportive tokens on MATH500, highlighting limitations of current approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why hybrid thinking fails to perfectly separate reasoning and direct answering in LLMs and to propose practical strategies to strengthen controllability and reduce leakage.

Method: Empirical analysis of controllability factors. The authors vary: (1) data scale, (2) using think/no-think answers from different questions vs the same question, (3) the amount of no-think data, and (4) a two-phase training regime (first train reasoning ability, then apply hybrid think training). They build a practical recipe and evaluate on MATH500, reporting changes in output length and reasoning-supportive tokens.

Result: Key findings: (1) larger data scale improves controllability, (2) using think and no-think answers from different questions strengthens separation, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data helps, and (4) a two-phase training strategy enhances mode separation. The proposed recipe maintains accuracy in both modes while substantially reducing no-think output length (1085 → 585 on MATH500) and occurrences of tokens like ‘wait’ (5917 → 522 on MATH500).

Conclusion: Current hybrid thinking remains limited in achieving clean mode separation, but the identified factors and the two-phase training recipe offer practical steps to strengthen controllability and reduce leakage, paving the way for more reliable hybrid reasoning systems.

Abstract: Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct
answering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet
our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial
mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To
understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing
controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2)
using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same
question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase
strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think
training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that,
compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while
significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500)
and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from
$5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current
hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.

### [169] [CoRA: Covariate-Aware Adaptation of Time Series Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12681)
*Guo Qin,Zhi Chen,Yong Liu,Zhiyuan Shi,Haixuan Liu,Xiangdong Huang,Jianmin Wang,Mingsheng Long*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoRA: a covariate-aware adaptation framework for Time Series Foundation Models that freezes backbones, weighs exogenous covariates via Granger Causality Embedding, and injects them with zero-initialized layers to improve forecasting with multi-modal covariates; achieves 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TSFMs underutilize exogenous covariates due to backbone scale and heterogeneity of dependencies; a framework is needed to preserve pretrained features while incorporating diverse covariates to improve forecasts.

Method: Preserve initialization and parameter consistency; freeze backbones as feature extractors; compute Granger Causality Embedding (GCE) to assess covariate predictability; weight covariate embeddings by GCE; use a zero-initialized condition-injection mechanism to fuse exogenous information gradually, preventing forgetting; demonstrate compatibility with various TSFMs and modalities; extensive experiments.

Result: CoRA-based TSFMs surpass state-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with full or few-shot training, achieving a 31.1% reduction in MSE; demonstrates broad compatibility with backbones and modalities, indicating practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: CoRA provides a backbone-preserving, covariate-weighted adaptation framework that expands covariate modalities and improves forecasting accuracy while maintaining stability of pretrained TSFMs.

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown significant impact through
their model capacity, scalability, and zero-shot generalization. However, due
to the heterogeneity of inter-variate dependencies and the backbone scalability
on large-scale multivariate datasets, most TSFMs are typically pre-trained on
univariate time series. This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial
information from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks. To further
enhance the performance of TSFMs, we propose a general covariate-aware
adaptation (CoRA) framework for TSFMs. It leverages pre-trained backbones of
foundation models while effectively incorporating exogenous covariates from
various modalities, including time series, language, and images, to improve the
quality of predictions. Technically, CoRA maintains the equivalence of
initialization and parameter consistency during adaptation. With preserved
backbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome
embeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative
than raw data. Further, CoRA employs a novel Granger Causality Embedding (GCE)
to automatically evaluate covariates regarding their causal predictability with
respect to the target variate. We incorporate these weighted embeddings with a
zero-initialized condition-injection mechanism, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of pre-trained foundation models and gradually integrates exogenous
information. Extensive experiments show that CoRA of TSFMs surpasses
state-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with full or few-shot
training samples, achieving 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting.
Compared to other adaptation methods, CoRA exhibits strong compatibility with
various advanced TSFMs and extends the scope of covariates to other modalities,
presenting a practical paradigm for the application of TSFMs.

### [170] [Few Shot Semi-Supervised Learning for Abnormal Stop Detection from Sparse GPS Trajectories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12686)
*Muhammad Ayub Sabir,Junbiao Pang,Jiaqi Wu,Fatima Ashraf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sparsity-aware, semi-supervised ASD pipeline using adaptive segmentation (SAS), LTIGA smoothing, and a spatio-temporal graph with label propagation, GCN, and self-training, achieving 0.854 AUC and 0.866 AP with only 10 labeled samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse GPS trajectories and limited labeled data hinder abnormal stop detection (ASD) in intercity coach travel. Existing methods assume dense sampling and ample labels, reducing applicability for safety, reliability, and regulatory compliance.

Method: 1) Sparsity-Aware Segmentation (SAS) defines segment boundaries adaptively from local spatial-temporal density. 2) Three domain-specific indicators capture abnormal stop behaviors. 3) Locally Temporal-Indicator Guided Adjustment (LTIGA) smooths indicators via local similarity graphs. 4) Build a spatial-temporal graph with segments as nodes and LTIGA features. 5) Apply label propagation to expand weak supervision, followed by a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to learn relational patterns. 6) Self-training with high-confidence pseudo-labels iteratively improves predictions.

Result: Validated on real-world coach data: AUC = 0.854 and AP = 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances, outperforming prior methods. Code and dataset are publicly available.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline effectively handles data sparsity and label scarcity in ASD, enabling strong performance with minimal labeled data and offering practical utility for safety and regulatory compliance.

Abstract: Abnormal stop detection (ASD) in intercity coach transportation is critical
for ensuring passenger safety, operational reliability, and regulatory
compliance. However, two key challenges hinder ASD effectiveness: sparse GPS
trajectories, which obscure short or unauthorized stops, and limited labeled
data, which restricts supervised learning. Existing methods often assume dense
sampling or regular movement patterns, limiting their applicability. To address
data sparsity, we propose a Sparsity-Aware Segmentation (SAS) method that
adaptively defines segment boundaries based on local spatial-temporal density.
Building upon these segments, we introduce three domain-specific indicators to
capture abnormal stop behaviors. To further mitigate the impact of sparsity, we
develop Locally Temporal-Indicator Guided Adjustment (LTIGA), which smooths
these indicators via local similarity graphs. To overcome label scarcity, we
construct a spatial-temporal graph where each segment is a node with
LTIGA-refined features. We apply label propagation to expand weak supervision
across the graph, followed by a GCN to learn relational patterns. A final
self-training module incorporates high-confidence pseudo-labels to iteratively
improve predictions. Experiments on real-world coach data show an AUC of 0.854
and AP of 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances, outperforming prior methods.

### [171] [DiffEM: Learning from Corrupted Data with Diffusion Models via Expectation Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12691)
*Danial Hosseintabar,Fan Chen,Giannis Daras,Antonio Torralba,Constantinos Daskalakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiffEM: an EM-style framework to train diffusion priors from corrupted observations by alternating E-step reconstruction with a conditional diffusion model and M-step model refinement, with monotonic convergence guarantees and empirical success on image reconstruction tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning diffusion priors for high-dimensional inverse problems when clean data is unavailable or corrupted, motivating a principled training method from noisy observations.

Method: An Expectation-Maximization (EM) approach where the E-step uses a conditional diffusion model to reconstruct clean data from observations, and the M-step updates/refines the conditional diffusion model using the reconstructed data; iterate until convergence with theoretical monotonic guarantees under suitable statistical conditions.

Result: Theoretical monotonic convergence guarantees for the DiffEM iterations under appropriate conditions, plus empirical demonstrations of effectiveness on various image reconstruction tasks.

Conclusion: DiffEM offers a principled EM-based framework to learn diffusion priors from corrupted data, providing convergence guarantees and practical performance in high-dimensional inverse problems.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for
high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or
noisy observations are available remains challenging. In this work, we propose
a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM)
from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional
diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and
then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in
the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the
DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image
reconstruction tasks.

### [172] [Multitask finetuning and acceleration of chemical pretrained models for small molecule drug property prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12719)
*Matthew Adrian,Yunsie Chung,Kevin Boyd,Saee Paliwal,Srimukh Prasad Veccham,Alan C. Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multitask finetuning of chemical pretrained GNNs (KERMT, KGPT) yields significant gains over non-pretrained models, especially with larger data; the work also releases multitask ADMET splits and a faster KERMT implementation for industrial-scale use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To boost drug discovery predictions (potency and ADMET) by leveraging self-supervised chemical pretraining and multitask learning during finetuning, addressing data heterogeneity and benchmarking needs.

Method: Fine-tune chemical pretrained graph neural networks (KERMT, KGPT) in multitask settings across drug-property tasks; publish two multitask ADMET data splits for benchmarking; provide an accelerated KERMT implementation for scalable pretraining, finetuning, and inference.

Result: Multitask finetuning significantly improves predictive performance compared with non-pretrained GNNs, with larger gains as dataset size increases; multitask ADMET splits facilitate benchmarking; accelerated KERMT enables scalable workflows in industry.

Conclusion: Multitask fine-tuning of chemical pretrained GNNs is beneficial for drug-property prediction; the approach, data splits, and open-source acceleration support scalable, improved discovery workflows.

Abstract: Chemical pretrained models, sometimes referred to as foundation models, are
receiving considerable interest for drug discovery applications. The general
chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to
improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target
potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been
successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that
enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network
models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the
GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT)
significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network
models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning
KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes.
Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more
accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property
prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT
model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference
in industrial drug discovery workflows.

### [173] [CARVQ: Corrective Adaptor with Group Residual Vector Quantization for LLM Embedding Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12721)
*Dayin Gou,Sanghyun Byun,Nilesh Malpeddi,Gabrielle De Micheli,Prathamesh Vaste,Jacob Song,Woo Seong Chung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CARVQ introduces a post-training embedding compression method combining a corrective adaptor with group residual vector quantization to reduce embeddings to about 1.6 bits per parameter, enabling memory-efficient LLMs on edge devices without hardware changes, while maintaining accuracy close to scalar quantization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge deployments of LLMs are memory-bound due to large embedding tables; reducing embedding memory frees bandwidth and speeds up inference; a hardware-agnostic, post-training solution is needed.

Method: Post-training Corrective Adaptor combined with group Residual Vector Quantization; uses a mix of linear and non-linear mappings to mimic the original embedding; aims for 4-bit memory compatibility and compatibility with transformer quantization; evaluated on multiple LLMs (LLaMA-3.2-1B/3B/3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Phi-4) across generative, discriminative, math and reasoning tasks.

Result: Lower average bitwidth per parameter compared to scalar quantization in most cases; maintains reasonable perplexity and accuracy; compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization; enables memory footprint reduction on edge devices.

Conclusion: Represents a crucial step toward efficient deployment of LLMs on edge devices; hardware-agnostic and integrates with existing quantization methods to reduce memory usage without requiring specialized hardware.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically rely on a large number of parameters
for token embedding, leading to substantial storage requirements and memory
footprints. In particular, LLMs deployed on edge devices are memory-bound, and
reducing the memory footprint by compressing the embedding layer not only frees
up the memory bandwidth but also speeds up inference. To address this, we
introduce CARVQ, a post-training novel Corrective Adaptor combined with group
Residual Vector Quantization. CARVQ relies on the composition of both linear
and non-linear maps and mimics the original model embedding to compress to
approximately 1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware to support
lower-bit storage. We test our method on pre-trained LLMs such as LLaMA-3.2-1B,
LLaMA-3.2-3B, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B
and Phi-4, evaluating on common generative, discriminative, math and reasoning
tasks. We show that in most cases, CARVQ can achieve lower average
bitwidth-per-parameter while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy
compared to scalar quantization. Our contributions include a novel compression
technique that is compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization
methods and can be seamlessly integrated into any hardware supporting 4-bit
memory to reduce the model's memory footprint in memory-constrained devices.
This work demonstrates a crucial step toward the efficient deployment of LLMs
on edge devices.

### [174] [Hierarchical Federated Learning for Crop Yield Prediction in Smart Agricultural Production Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12727)
*Anas Abouaomar,Mohammed El hanjri,Abdellatif Kobbane,Anis Laouiti,Khalid Nafil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a hierarchical federated learning (HFL) architecture for smart agriculture with seasonal crop-specific clusters and three layers (farms, crop aggregators, global). Aims to balance local specialization and global generalization while preserving privacy and reducing communication; experiments show improved alignment with yield patterns over standard ML.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agricultural data are heterogeneous and privacy-sensitive, and traditional ML or flat federated learning can struggle with cross-crop variability and communication costs. A hierarchical, crop-aware approach can enable local specialization and cross-crop knowledge transfer in a scalable, privacy-preserving way.

Method: Introduce a seasonal subscription mechanism where farms join crop-specific clusters at the start of each agricultural season. Implement a three-layer hierarchy: client-level smart farms, crop-specific aggregators, and a global model aggregator. Within each crop cluster, clients train crop-specific models; crop aggregators merge these into crop-level models, which are then aggregated into a global model that integrates knowledge across crops. This design reduces communication and preserves privacy while enabling both local specialization and cross-crop generalization.

Result: Experiments show that local and crop-layer models closely track actual yield patterns with consistent alignment and significantly outperform standard ML models, validating the efficacy of hierarchical federated learning in heterogeneous and privacy-sensitive agricultural settings.

Conclusion: Hierarchical federated learning offers a scalable, privacy-preserving framework for smart agriculture that supports both crop-specific local models and cross-crop generalization, accommodating seasonality and diverse farming environments.

Abstract: In this paper, we presents a novel hierarchical federated learning
architecture specifically designed for smart agricultural production systems
and crop yield prediction. Our approach introduces a seasonal subscription
mechanism where farms join crop-specific clusters at the beginning of each
agricultural season. The proposed three-layer architecture consists of
individual smart farms at the client level, crop-specific aggregators at the
middle layer, and a global model aggregator at the top level. Within each crop
cluster, clients collaboratively train specialized models tailored to specific
crop types, which are then aggregated to produce a higher-level global model
that integrates knowledge across multiple crops. This hierarchical design
enables both local specialization for individual crop types and global
generalization across diverse agricultural contexts while preserving data
privacy and reducing communication overhead. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed system, showing that local and crop-layer models
closely follow actual yield patterns with consistent alignment, significantly
outperforming standard machine learning models. The results validate the
advantages of hierarchical federated learning in the agricultural context,
particularly for scenarios involving heterogeneous farming environments and
privacy-sensitive agricultural data.

### [175] [Improving Decision Trees through the Lens of Parameterized Local Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12726)
*Juha Harviainen,Frank Sommer,Manuel Sorge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies optimizing local-search steps in decision-tree learning; proves NP-hardness; provides a detailed parameterized complexity analysis; shows FPT when both the number of features d and domain size D are small; provides a (D+1)^{2d}·|I|^{O(1)} time algorithm; includes a prototype implementation and experimental results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why certain heuristic optimizations in decision-tree learning are computationally challenging, and to identify tractable regimes where efficient exact or near-exact optimization is feasible.

Method: Prove NP-completeness of minimizing misclassification errors under a fixed number of a single type of local-search operation (threshold adjustment or feature exchange); perform parameterized complexity analysis with parameters d (number of features) and D (domain size); derive an FPT algorithm with runtime (D+1)^{2d}·|I|^{O(1)}; implement a proof-of-concept and conduct empirical experiments.

Result: Hardness persists for small d or small D, but when both are small together the problem becomes fixed-parameter tractable; the proposed algorithm runs in (D+1)^{2d}·poly(|I|) time; empirical results from the prototype support practicality.

Conclusion: The jointly small-d and small-D regime is tractable for optimizing these local-search steps in decision-tree learning, providing a theoretical and empirical basis for when such exact or near-exact optimization is viable and guiding design of learning algorithms using local-search heuristics.

Abstract: Algorithms for learning decision trees often include heuristic local-search
operations such as (1) adjusting the threshold of a cut or (2) also exchanging
the feature of that cut. We study minimizing the number of classification
errors by performing a fixed number of a single type of these operations.
Although we discover that the corresponding problems are NP-complete in
general, we provide a comprehensive parameterized-complexity analysis with the
aim of determining those properties of the problems that explain the hardness
and those that make the problems tractable. For instance, we show that the
problems remain hard for a small number $d$ of features or small domain size
$D$ but the combination of both yields fixed-parameter tractability. That is,
the problems are solvable in $(D + 1)^{2d} \cdot |I|^{O(1)}$ time, where $|I|$
is the size of the input. We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation of
this algorithm and report on empirical results.

### [176] [Doctor Rashomon and the UNIVERSE of Madness: Variable Importance with Unobserved Confounding and the Rashomon Effect](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12734)
*Jon Donnelly,Srikar Katta,Emanuele Borgonovo,Cynthia Rudin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces UNIVERSE, a framework to bound true variable importance under missing features and Rashomon sets, providing robustness guarantees and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variable importance (VI) is highly model- and feature-set dependent; missing/unobserved features and the Rashomon effect (different near-optimal models yield different VI) undermine interpretability and reliability. A method to bound VI under unobservables is needed.

Method: Adapt Rashomon sets (sets of near-optimal models) to derive bounds on VI that remain valid when features are missing; provide theoretical guarantees of robustness; validate via semi-synthetic simulations and a credit risk task.

Result: UNIVERSE yields provable robustness bounds on VI in the presence of unobservables and model uncertainty; demonstrates strong performance in semi-synthetic simulations and shows utility in a credit risk application.

Conclusion: UNIVERSE enables robust, bound-based inference for variable importance despite feature omissions and the Rashomon effect, improving hypothesis generation, feature selection, and scientific validation.

Abstract: Variable importance (VI) methods are often used for hypothesis generation,
feature selection, and scientific validation. In the standard VI pipeline, an
analyst estimates VI for a single predictive model with only the observed
features. However, the importance of a feature depends heavily on which other
variables are included in the model, and essential variables are often omitted
from observational datasets. Moreover, the VI estimated for one model is often
not the same as the VI estimated for another equally-good model - a phenomenon
known as the Rashomon Effect. We address these gaps by introducing
UNobservables and Inference for Variable importancE using Rashomon SEts
(UNIVERSE). Our approach adapts Rashomon sets - the sets of near-optimal models
in a dataset - to produce bounds on the true VI even with missing features. We
theoretically guarantee the robustness of our approach, show strong performance
on semi-synthetic simulations, and demonstrate its utility in a credit risk
task.

### [177] [KoALA: KL-L0 Adversarial Detector via Label Agreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12752)
*Siqi Li,Yasser Shoukry*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KoALA is a semantics-free adversarial detector that uses disagreement between two complementary metrics (KL divergence and an L0-based similarity) to detect attacks without retraining or architectural changes. It has a formal correctness proof and lightweight training, showing strong precision/recall on ResNet/CIFAR-10 and CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial examples threaten safety-critical systems; existing detectors often require retraining or architectural changes. A lightweight, modality-agnostic detector that can be plugged into pre-trained models is highly desirable.

Method: Compute predictions under two complementary similarity metrics (KL divergence for dense, low-amplitude perturbations; L0-based similarity for sparse, high-impact changes). Detect adversarial input when the two metrics disagree. Provide a formal correctness proof. Fine-tune a pre-trained image encoder on clean data to align embeddings with both metrics; no adversarial retraining or architectural changes.

Result: The approach is evaluated on ResNet/CIFAR-10 and CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet. When the theorem’s conditions hold, KoALA reliably detects adversarial examples. On full test sets, precision=0.94, recall=0.81 (ResNet/CIFAR-10); precision=0.66, recall=0.85 (CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet).

Conclusion: KoALA offers a lightweight, plug-and-play solution that is semantics-free and model-agnostic, with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance under stated conditions.

Abstract: Deep neural networks are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, which
pose significant risks to security- and safety-critical applications. We
present KoALA (KL-L0 Adversarial detection via Label Agreement), a novel,
semantics-free adversarial detector that requires no architectural changes or
adversarial retraining. KoALA operates on a simple principle: it detects an
adversarial attack when class predictions from two complementary similarity
metrics disagree. These metrics-KL divergence and an L0-based similarity-are
specifically chosen to detect different types of perturbations. The KL
divergence metric is sensitive to dense, low-amplitude shifts, while the
L0-based similarity is designed for sparse, high-impact changes. We provide a
formal proof of correctness for our approach. The only training required is a
simple fine-tuning step on a pre-trained image encoder using clean images to
ensure the embeddings align well with both metrics. This makes KOALA a
lightweight, plug-and-play solution for existing models and various data
modalities. Our extensive experiments on ResNet/CIFAR-10 and CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet
confirm our theoretical claims. When the theorem's conditions are met, KoALA
consistently and effectively detects adversarial examples. On the full test
sets, KoALA achieves a precision of 0.94 and a recall of 0.81 on
ResNet/CIFAR-10, and a precision of 0.66 and a recall of 0.85 on
CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet.

### [178] [Sample-Efficient Omniprediction for Proper Losses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12769)
*Isaac Gibbs,Ryan J. Tibshirani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper studies omniprediction vs multicalibration for multiple decision makers: it proves multicalibration requires more samples than omniprediction, analyzes boosting and adversarial approaches, and presents a direct unrandomized algorithm that uses the structure of proper losses to achieve sample-efficient omniprediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build a single probabilistic predictor that supports multiple downstream decisions with low losses, and to understand the sample-efficiency trade-offs between boosting-based multicalibration and adversarial online methods for omniprediction.

Method: Provide lower bounds comparing multicalibration and omniprediction; analyze two algorithm families: boosting methods that yield omniprediction as a corollary, and adversarial two-player online approaches that target worst-case loss. Discuss online-to-batch conversion (which yields a randomized predictor) and propose a direct, unrandomized algorithm that exploits the structural properties of proper losses.

Result: Lower bounds show multicalibration is strictly harder (needs more samples) than omniprediction. Online-to-batch yields a randomized omnipredictor, while the proposed direct unrandomized algorithm achieves sample-efficient omniprediction by leveraging the structure of the set of proper losses.

Conclusion: There is a separation in sample efficiency: omniprediction can be achieved more efficiently than multicalibration. A direct, unrandomized algorithm exploiting the geometry of proper losses can realize efficient omniprediction without randomized predictors, improving on standard online-to-batch methods.

Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing probabilistic predictions that lead
to accurate decisions when employed by downstream users to inform actions. For
a single decision maker, designing an optimal predictor is equivalent to
minimizing a proper loss function corresponding to the negative utility of that
individual. For multiple decision makers, our problem can be viewed as a
variant of omniprediction in which the goal is to design a single predictor
that simultaneously minimizes multiple losses. Existing algorithms for
achieving omniprediction broadly fall into two categories: 1) boosting methods
that optimize other auxiliary targets such as multicalibration and obtain
omniprediction as a corollary, and 2) adversarial two-player game based
approaches that estimate and respond to the ``worst-case" loss in an online
fashion. We give lower bounds demonstrating that multicalibration is a strictly
more difficult problem than omniprediction and thus the former approach must
incur suboptimal sample complexity. For the latter approach, we discuss how
these ideas can be used to obtain a sample-efficient algorithm through an
online-to-batch conversion. This conversion has the downside of returning a
complex, randomized predictor. We improve on this method by designing a more
direct, unrandomized algorithm that exploits structural elements of the set of
proper losses.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A translational bottleneck analysis of untethered milli/microrobots and a proposed mTRL framework to guide development toward clinical adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between lab demonstrations and real-world clinical use by addressing translational bottlenecks, aligning tech with unmet medical needs, and integrating into clinical workflows.

Method: Literature review and synthesis identifying translation bottlenecks; proposal of a milli/microrobot Technology Readiness Level (mTRL) framework with milestone-based activities to guide development from concept to clinical adoption.

Result: Clarifies key factors slowing translation, and introduces the mTRL framework to provide a common language and actionable guidance to accelerate translational development for safer, more efficient interventions.

Conclusion: The mTRL framework has the potential to align milli/microrobot development with clinical needs and workflows, ultimately improving patient outcomes by accelerating safe and effective clinical translation.

Abstract: Untethered mobile milli/microrobots hold transformative potential for
interventional medicine by enabling more precise and entirely non-invasive
diagnosis and therapy. Realizing this promise requires bridging the gap between
groundbreaking laboratory demonstrations and successful clinical integration.
Despite remarkable technical progress over the past two decades, most
millirobots and microrobots remain confined to laboratory proof-of-concept
demonstrations, with limited real-world feasibility. In this Review, we
identify key factors that slow translation from bench to bedside, focusing on
the disconnect between technical innovation and real-world application. We
argue that the long-term impact and sustainability of the field depend on
aligning development with unmet medical needs, ensuring applied feasibility,
and integrating seamlessly into existing clinical workflows, which are
essential pillars for delivering meaningful patient outcomes. To support this
shift, we introduce a strategic milli/microrobot Technology Readiness Level
framework (mTRL), which maps system development from initial conceptualization
to clinical adoption through clearly defined milestones and their associated
stepwise activities. The mTRL model provides a structured gauge of
technological maturity, a common language for cross-disciplinary collaboration
and actionable guidance to accelerate translational development toward new,
safer and more efficient interventions.

### [180] [Gaussian Semantic Field for One-shot LiDAR Global Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12101)
*Pengyu Yin,Shenghai Yuan,Haozhi Cao,Xingyu Ji,Ruofei Bai,Siyu Chen,Lihua Xie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: One-shot LiDAR global localization using a Gaussian semantic field (Outram-GSF) with a tri-layered scene graph for improved semantic disambiguation and correspondences, achieving state-of-the-art results on public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Semantic landmarks can be repetitive and misleading for correspondence establishment; discrete semantic labels fail to capture fine-grained geo-semantic and metric information needed for robust localization. A continuous semantic representation learned from multiple Gaussian processes can provide richer information and improve data association.

Method: Introduce continuous semantic distributions as the middle layer between the object layer and metric-semantic layer, forming a tri-layered 3D scene graph. Model these distributions with Gaussian processes and integrate them into a lightweight backend for one-shot localization, named Outram-GSF (Gaussian semantic field).

Result: Extensive experiments on public datasets show superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of the tri-layered Graph and Gaussian semantic field for one-shot localization.

Conclusion: The tri-layered scene-graph with a Gaussian semantic field provides a lightweight yet powerful backend for one-shot LiDAR global localization, enabling finer-grained geo-semantic information and improved correspondence, and outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: We present a one-shot LiDAR global localization algorithm featuring semantic
disambiguation ability based on a lightweight tri-layered scene graph. While
landmark semantic registration-based methods have shown promising performance
improvements in global localization compared with geometric-only methods,
landmarks can be repetitive and misleading for correspondence establishment. We
propose to mitigate this problem by modeling semantic distributions with
continuous functions learned from a population of Gaussian processes. Compared
with discrete semantic labels, the continuous functions capture finer-grained
geo-semantic information and also provide more detailed metric information for
correspondence establishment. We insert this continuous function as the middle
layer between the object layer and the metric-semantic layer, forming a
tri-layered 3D scene graph, serving as a light-weight yet performant backend
for one-shot localization. We term our global localization pipeline Outram-GSF
(Gaussian semantic field) and conduct a wide range of experiments on publicly
available data sets, validating the superior performance against the current
state-of-the-art.

*Akshay Naik,William R. Norris,Dustin Nottage,Ahmet Soylemezoglu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A real-time, terrain-aware path planner for off-road autonomous ground vehicles using a Bekker-based continuous terrain cost field, exact steering primitives on a lattice, and Vehicle-Dynamics RRT* / D* Lite for global and local planning, enabling millisecond replanning and real-time navigation on deformable terrain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Off-road autonomous vehicles need curvature-feasible paths that respect spatially varying soil strength and slope hazards, with robust, real-time planning under sensor noise and deformable terrain.

Method: Develop a continuous state–cost metric by combining Bekker pressure–sinkage soil model with elevation-derived slope/attitude penalties to form an analytic, bounded terrain cost field. Discretize on a lattice with exact steering primitives (Dubins and Reeds–Shepp for differential drive; time-parameterized bicycle arcs for Ackermann). Use Vehicle-Dynamics RRT* for global exploration and Vehicle-Dynamics D* Lite for local repair, enabling millisecond-scale replanning. Decouple terrain–vehicle model from planner for reusable planning across deterministic, sampling-based, or learning-driven approaches.

Result: The framework yields stable, well-posed planning updates in the presence of noise, and supports real-time navigation across soft soil and slope transitions. Hardware trials demonstrate real-time operation and reliable autonomy in unstructured off-road environments.

Conclusion: The presented framework provides a reusable, deterministic/sampling-based/learning-driven basis for planning in deformable terrain, with guaranteed well-posed planning and fast replanning, validated by hardware experiments on soft soil and slopes.

Abstract: Autonomous ground vehicles operating off-road must plan curvature-feasible
paths while accounting for spatially varying soil strength and slope hazards in
real time. We present a continuous state--cost metric that combines a Bekker
pressure--sinkage model with elevation-derived slope and attitude penalties.
The resulting terrain cost field is analytic, bounded, and monotonic in soil
modulus and slope, ensuring well-posed discretization and stable updates under
sensor noise. This metric is evaluated on a lattice with exact steering
primitives: Dubins and Reeds--Shepp motions for differential drive and
time-parameterized bicycle arcs for Ackermann steering. Global exploration is
performed using Vehicle-Dynamics RRT\(^{*}\), while local repair is managed by
Vehicle-Dynamics D\(^{*}\) Lite, enabling millisecond-scale replanning without
heuristic smoothing. By separating the terrain--vehicle model from the planner,
the framework provides a reusable basis for deterministic, sampling-based, or
learning-driven planning in deformable terrain. Hardware trials on an off-road
platform demonstrate real-time navigation across soft soil and slope
transitions, supporting reliable autonomy in unstructured environments.

### [182] [Controllable Collision Scenario Generation via Collision Pattern Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12206)
*Pin-Lun Chen,Chi-Hsi Kung,Che-Han Chang,Wei-Chen Chiu,Yi-Ting Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A dataset and framework for controllable collision-scenario generation in autonomous driving. It introduces COLLIDE, a large-scale, balanced dataset of simulated collisions from real driving logs and a Collision Pattern representation to control collision type and time-to-accident (TTA). The method predicts the collision configuration before generating full adversarial trajectories, achieving better controllability and collision rates than baselines. The generated scenarios reveal planner weaknesses and can be used to fine-tune planners for robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical AV scenarios, especially collisions, are rare and dangerous to collect in the real world. Controlling collision attributes (type, TTA) is essential to systematically evaluate and improve AV planners.

Method: Transform real-world driving logs into the COLLIDE dataset balanced across five collision types and various TTA intervals. Propose Collision Pattern, a compact representation of the ego-vehicle and adversary configuration at impact, and roll out full adversarial trajectories conditioned on it. Compare with strong baselines on collision rate and controllability; analyze planner failures; demonstrate potential for planner robustness improvements through scenario-driven tuning.

Result: The approach outperforms baselines in both collision rate and controllability. Generated scenarios trigger higher planner failure rates, exposing limitations of existing planners. The scenarios can be used to fine-tune planners for improved robustness to diverse collision scenarios.

Conclusion: A controllable collision-scenario generator and dataset enable systematic AV safety evaluation and stress-testing. COLLIDE reveals planner weaknesses, guides robustness improvements, and supports safer AV deployment by enabling targeted scenario generation across diverse collision types and TTAs.

Abstract: Evaluating the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires diverse,
safety-critical scenarios, with collisions being especially important yet rare
and unsafe to collect in the real world. Therefore, the community has been
focusing on generating safety-critical scenarios in simulation. However,
controlling attributes such as collision type and time-to-accident (TTA)
remains challenging. We introduce a new task called controllable collision
scenario generation, where the goal is to produce trajectories that realize a
user-specified collision type and TTA, to investigate the feasibility of
automatically generating desired collision scenarios. To support this task, we
present COLLIDE, a large-scale collision scenario dataset constructed by
transforming real-world driving logs into diverse collisions, balanced across
five representative collision types and different TTA intervals. We propose a
framework that predicts Collision Pattern, a compact and interpretable
representation that captures the spatial configuration of the ego and the
adversarial vehicles at impact, before rolling out full adversarial
trajectories. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong baselines
in both collision rate and controllability. Furthermore, generated scenarios
consistently induce higher planner failure rates, revealing limitations of
existing planners. We demonstrate that these scenarios fine-tune planners for
robustness improvements, contributing to safer AV deployment in different
collision scenarios.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A density-based data-driven reward learned from demonstrations is integrated with rule-based obstacle avoidance and goal-reaching objectives, using a sampling-based lookahead controller to generate supervisory actions that are distilled into a real-time policy with uncertainty estimates; tested in synthetic and elevator co-boarding simulations and validated with real-world human demonstrations, showing improved success rate and time efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To balance adaptability to diverse human behaviors with safety constraints in mobile robot navigation in dynamic environments by combining data-driven rewards with explicit rule-based safety objectives.

Method: Learn a density-based reward from positive and negative demonstrations; augment it with rule-based objectives for obstacle avoidance and goal reaching; employ a sampling-based lookahead controller to produce supervisory actions that are safe and adaptive; distill supervisory policies into a compact student policy suitable for real-time operation with uncertainty estimation.

Result: In simulations (synthetic and elevator co-boarding) the approach yields consistent gains in success rate and time efficiency over baselines; real-world demonstrations with human participants confirm practicality for deployment.

Conclusion: The framework effectively balances adaptability and safety in dynamic human environments, producing a real-time policy with uncertainty estimates from supervisory lookahead actions, and is practical for real-world deployment (video on project page).

Abstract: Mobile robot navigation in dynamic human environments requires policies that
balance adaptability to diverse behaviors with compliance to safety
constraints. We hypothesize that integrating data-driven rewards with
rule-based objectives enables navigation policies to achieve a more effective
balance of adaptability and safety. To this end, we develop a framework that
learns a density-based reward from positive and negative demonstrations and
augments it with rule-based objectives for obstacle avoidance and goal
reaching. A sampling-based lookahead controller produces supervisory actions
that are both safe and adaptive, which are subsequently distilled into a
compact student policy suitable for real-time operation with uncertainty
estimates. Experiments in synthetic and elevator co-boarding simulations show
consistent gains in success rate and time efficiency over baselines, and
real-world demonstrations with human participants confirm the practicality of
deployment. A video illustrating this work can be found on our project page

### [184] [Spatial Forcing: Implicit Spatial Representation Alignment for Vision-language-action Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12276)
*Fuhao Li,Wenxuan Song,Han Zhao,Jingbo Wang,Pengxiang Ding,Donglin Wang,Long Zeng,Haoang Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Spatial Forcing (SF) aligns intermediate visual embeddings of vision-language-action models with 3D geometry from pretrained 3D foundations to impart spatial reasoning without explicit 3D inputs, achieving SOTA results and faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2D-only vision-language-action models lack accurate spatial understanding in the 3D world. Relying on explicit 3D inputs (depth maps/point clouds) introduces sensor noise, hardware heterogeneity, and incomplete depth coverage, while depth estimators from 2D data can be unreliable. A lightweight method to imbue spatial awareness without 3D sensors or depth estimation is highly desirable.

Method: SF introduces an alignment objective that implicitly forces VLAs to develop spatial representations by aligning intermediate visual embeddings with geometric representations from pretrained 3D foundation models. The alignment is applied at intermediate layers, avoiding reliance on explicit 3D inputs or depth estimators.

Result: SF achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing both 2D- and 3D-based VLAs in simulation and real-world experiments. It also accelerates training by up to 3.8x and improves data efficiency across diverse robotic tasks.

Conclusion: SF provides a simple, effective route to endow vision-language-action models with spatial comprehension without 3D sensors or depth estimation, offering strong empirical gains and practical benefits. This approach has potential for broader applicability and future work could explore generalization, limitations, and extensions to additional modalities.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently shown strong potential in
enabling robots to follow language instructions and execute precise actions.
However, most VLAs are built upon vision-language models pretrained solely on
2D data, which lack accurate spatial awareness and hinder their ability to
operate in the 3D physical world. Existing solutions attempt to incorporate
explicit 3D sensor inputs such as depth maps or point clouds, but these
approaches face challenges due to sensor noise, hardware heterogeneity, and
incomplete depth coverage in existing datasets. Alternative methods that
estimate 3D cues from 2D images also suffer from the limited performance of
depth estimators.We propose Spatial Forcing (SF), a simple yet effective
alignment strategy that implicitly forces VLA models to develop spatial
comprehension capabilities without relying on explicit 3D inputs or depth
estimators. SF aligns intermediate visual embeddings of VLAs with geometric
representations produced by pretrained 3D foundation models. By enforcing
alignment at intermediate layers, SF guides VLAs to encode richer spatial
representations that enhance action precision.Extensive experiments in
simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that SF achieves
state-of-the-art results, surpassing both 2D- and 3D-based VLAs. SF further
accelerates training by up to 3.8x and improves data efficiency across diverse
robotic tasks. Project page is at https://spatial-forcing.github.io/

*Mohammadreza Kasaei,Mostafa Ghobadi,Mohsen Khadem*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A shape-aware control framework for tendon-driven continuum robots enabling safe endoluminal navigation with shape estimation, MPPI-based optimization, and real-time task adjustment, achieving mm-level accuracy and reduced wall contacts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Endoluminal procedures require precise navigation through tortuous, patient-specific anatomy. Traditional tip-only control risks wall contact, tissue trauma, and failure to reach distal targets. A shape-aware, optimization-driven framework aims to improve safety, accuracy, and adaptability.

Method: Combine a physics-informed backbone model with residual learning via an Augmented Neural ODE for shape estimation and efficient Jacobian computation. Use a sampling-based Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller to jointly optimize tip tracking, backbone conformance, and obstacle avoidance under actuation constraints. Include a task manager for real-time adjustment of objectives (e.g., wall clearance, direct advancement) during tele-operation.

Result: Simulation studies show millimeter-level accuracy across scenarios: trajectory tracking, dynamic obstacle avoidance, and shape-constrained reaching. Real-robot experiments on a bronchoscopy phantom demonstrate improved lumen-following accuracy, reduced wall contacts, and enhanced adaptability compared to joystick-only navigation and existing baselines.

Conclusion: The framework potentially increases safety, reliability, and operator efficiency in minimally invasive endoluminal surgery and may generalize to other confined and safety-critical environments.

Abstract: This paper presents a shape-aware whole-body control framework for
tendon-driven continuum robots with direct application to endoluminal surgical
navigation. Endoluminal procedures, such as bronchoscopy, demand precise and
safe navigation through tortuous, patient-specific anatomy where conventional
tip-only control often leads to wall contact, tissue trauma, or failure to
reach distal targets. To address these challenges, our approach combines a
physics-informed backbone model with residual learning through an Augmented
Neural ODE, enabling accurate shape estimation and efficient Jacobian
computation. A sampling-based Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller
leverages this representation to jointly optimize tip tracking, backbone
conformance, and obstacle avoidance under actuation constraints. A task manager
further enhances adaptability by allowing real-time adjustment of objectives,
such as wall clearance or direct advancement, during tele-operation. Extensive
simulation studies demonstrate millimeter-level accuracy across diverse
scenarios, including trajectory tracking, dynamic obstacle avoidance, and
shape-constrained reaching. Real-robot experiments on a bronchoscopy phantom
validate the framework, showing improved lumen-following accuracy, reduced wall
contacts, and enhanced adaptability compared to joystick-only navigation and
existing baselines. These results highlight the potential of the proposed
framework to increase safety, reliability, and operator efficiency in minimally
invasive endoluminal surgery, with broader applicability to other confined and
safety-critical environments.

need to address complex societal challenges such as labor shortages, aging
populations, and ever-increasing production demands. In this abstract, we
advocate for (and demonstrate) a transdisciplinary approach when considering
robotics in the workplace. Transdisciplinarity emphasizes the integration of
academic research with pragmatic expertise and embodied experiential knowledge,

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A real-time perception-based framework (PolyMap) for humanoid stair climbing that builds a polygonal staircase map from multi-sensor data to plan footsteps, running at 20–30 Hz on NVIDIA Orin; demonstrated robust performance in real indoor/outdoor scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable accurate foot placement in unknown environments and move beyond generic walking to reliable stair climbing by integrating perception with motion planning.

Method: Construct a real-time polygonal staircase plane semantic map via multi-sensor fusion (LiDAR, RGB-D, IMUs); segment staircase planes and use them to plan foot placements; deploy on NVIDIA Orin to output whole-body motion plans at ~20–30 Hz.

Result: Real-scene indoor and outdoor experiments show that the approach is efficient and robust for humanoid stair climbing, with planning outputs at 20–30 Hz.

Conclusion: PolyMap demonstrates a viable perception-to-planning pipeline for stairs that combines real-time polygonal plane mapping with fast footstep planning, offering practical robustness for humanoid robots in unknown environments.

Abstract: Recently, biped robot walking technology has been significantly developed,
mainly in the context of a bland walking scheme. To emulate human walking,
robots need to step on the positions they see in unknown spaces accurately. In
this paper, we present PolyMap, a perception-based locomotion planning
framework for humanoid robots to climb stairs. Our core idea is to build a
real-time polygonal staircase plane semantic map, followed by a footstep planar
using these polygonal plane segments. These plane segmentation and visual
odometry are done by multi-sensor fusion(LiDAR, RGB-D camera and IMUs). The
proposed framework is deployed on a NVIDIA Orin, which performs 20-30 Hz
whole-body motion planning output. Both indoor and outdoor real-scene
experiments indicate that our method is efficient and robust for humanoid robot
stair climbing.

*Jiale Fan,Andrei Cramariuc,Tifanny Portela,Marco Hutter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Pretraining a proprioceptive inverse dynamics model (PIDM) on diverse exploration data provides a warm-start for PPO in robot motion control, boosting sample efficiency and task performance across seven tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To exploit shared, generalizable knowledge across policies for a robot embodiment and reduce the data demands of RL.

Method: 1) Collect task-agnostic, exploration-driven transition data; 2) train PIDM via supervised learning to predict proprioceptive dynamics; 3) initialize actor and critic with PIDM weights to warm-start PPO; evaluate on seven motion-control tasks; conduct ablations.

Result: On average, sample efficiency improves by 40.1% and task performance by 7.5% compared to random initialization; ablation studies clarify where gains come from.

Conclusion: Pretraining PIDM yields a effective initialization strategy for RL in robotics, enabling better sample efficiency and performance by leveraging shared dynamics knowledge across tasks.

Abstract: The pretraining-finetuning paradigm has facilitated numerous transformative
advancements in artificial intelligence research in recent years. However, in
the domain of reinforcement learning (RL) for robot motion control, individual
skills are often learned from scratch despite the high likelihood that some
generalizable knowledge is shared across all task-specific policies belonging
to a single robot embodiment. This work aims to define a paradigm for
pretraining neural network models that encapsulate such knowledge and can
subsequently serve as a basis for warm-starting the RL process in classic
actor-critic algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We begin
with a task-agnostic exploration-based data collection algorithm to gather
diverse, dynamic transition data, which is then used to train a Proprioceptive
Inverse Dynamics Model (PIDM) through supervised learning. The pretrained
weights are loaded into both the actor and critic networks to warm-start the
policy optimization of actual tasks. We systematically validated our proposed
method on seven distinct robot motion control tasks, showing significant
benefits to this initialization strategy. Our proposed approach on average
improves sample efficiency by 40.1% and task performance by 7.5%, compared to
random initialization. We further present key ablation studies and empirical
analyses that shed light on the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of our
method.

### [189] [Controlling Intent Expressiveness in Robot Motion with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12370)
*Wenli Shi,Clemence Grislain,Olivier Sigaud,Mohamed Chetouani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Controllable legibility in robot motion via an Information Potential Field and a two-stage diffusion process, enabling a spectrum from highly legible to highly ambiguous trajectories with competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans must quickly infer a robot's intended goal. Traditional methods optimize efficiency but can obscure intent; existing legible-motion work often yields only a single 'most legible' path and lacks context-specific expressiveness.

Method: Introduce an Information Potential Field to assign continuous legibility scores to trajectories, and a two-stage diffusion framework that first generates paths at a specified legibility level and then translates them into executable robot actions.

Result: Experiments in 2D and 3D reaching tasks show diverse, controllable motions across legibility levels, with performance comparable to state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: The framework enables controllable legibility across the full spectrum while maintaining competitive performance and providing expressive control over intent expressiveness.

Abstract: Legibility of robot motion is critical in human-robot interaction, as it
allows humans to quickly infer a robot's intended goal. Although traditional
trajectory generation methods typically prioritize efficiency, they often fail
to make the robot's intentions clear to humans. Meanwhile, existing approaches
to legible motion usually produce only a single "most legible" trajectory,
overlooking the need to modulate intent expressiveness in different contexts.
In this work, we propose a novel motion generation framework that enables
controllable legibility across the full spectrum, from highly legible to highly
ambiguous motions. We introduce a modeling approach based on an Information
Potential Field to assign continuous legibility scores to trajectories, and
build upon it with a two-stage diffusion framework that first generates paths
at specified legibility levels and then translates them into executable robot
actions. Experiments in both 2D and 3D reaching tasks demonstrate that our
approach produces diverse and controllable motions with varying degrees of
legibility, while achieving performance comparable to SOTA. Code and project

### [190] [Improving Generative Behavior Cloning via Self-Guidance and Adaptive Chunking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12392)
*Junhyuk So,Chiwoong Lee,Shinyoung Lee,Jungseul Ok,Eunhyeok Park*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Two techniques—self-guidance and adaptive chunking—strengthen diffusion-policy based Generative Behavior Cloning (GBC) for robotic manipulation by improving action fidelity and reactivity, addressing open-loop control stochasticity and delayed responses; they yield notable performance gains across simulated and real tasks, with code release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GBC with open-loop diffusion policies suffers from stochastic action sampling and delayed responses, leading to failures or degraded performance in noisy/dynamic environments. The work aims to make GBC more reliable and reactive without sacrificing temporal consistency.

Method: Introduce self-guidance: leverage past observations to improve action fidelity and implicitly promote future-aware behavior. Introduce adaptive chunking: selectively update action sequences when the benefit of reactivity outweighs the need for temporal consistency. Evaluate across diverse simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks; release code.

Result: Significant performance improvements across a wide range of simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks; demonstrates improved consistency and reactivity of diffusion-based GBC; code released at provided repo.

Conclusion: The combination of self-guidance and adaptive chunking yields more reliable and reactive GBC for robotic manipulation, mitigating stochastic sampling drawbacks and delayed OL control, with strong empirical evidence and practical code availability.

Abstract: Generative Behavior Cloning (GBC) is a simple yet effective framework for
robot learning, particularly in multi-task settings. Recent GBC methods often
employ diffusion policies with open-loop (OL) control, where actions are
generated via a diffusion process and executed in multi-step chunks without
replanning. While this approach has demonstrated strong success rates and
generalization, its inherent stochasticity can result in erroneous action
sampling, occasionally leading to unexpected task failures. Moreover, OL
control suffers from delayed responses, which can degrade performance in noisy
or dynamic environments. To address these limitations, we propose two novel
techniques to enhance the consistency and reactivity of diffusion policies: (1)
self-guidance, which improves action fidelity by leveraging past observations
and implicitly promoting future-aware behavior; and (2) adaptive chunking,
which selectively updates action sequences when the benefits of reactivity
outweigh the need for temporal consistency. Extensive experiments show that our
approach substantially improves GBC performance across a wide range of
simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A printable multi-material tactile sensor (M3D-skin) uses FDM infill patterns to create a flexible hierarchical structure whose electrical resistance changes under pressure, enabling tactile sensing. It is demonstrated as a multi-tile sensor with foot-sole motion measurement, robotic-hand integration, and tactile-driven robotics tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable easy fabrication and versatile tactile sensing by leveraging 3D-printing infill patterns with conductive and non-conductive flexible filaments, addressing fabrication complexity and integration barriers in tactile sensors.

Method: Fabricate a hierarchical structure via multi-material FDM 3D printing using conductive and non-conductive flexible filaments arranged with a specific infill pattern. The structure deforms under pressure, altering electrical resistance to sense touch. A multi-tile sensor is produced and tested, with applications demonstrated on a foot sole for motion pattern measurement, in a robotic hand, and in tactile-based robotic operations.

Result: The hierarchical structure exhibits pressure-induced resistance changes; altering the infill structure modulates sensing characteristics. A multi-tile sensor is successfully fabricated and applied to foot-motion sensing, robotic-hand integration, and tactile-driven robotic tasks, validating the approach.

Conclusion: The proposed tactile sensor (M3D-skin) enables easy fabrication and high versatility through infill-pattern-based sensing using multi-material FDM printing, showing effective tactile sensing with potential for broad robotic applications.

Abstract: Tactile sensors have a wide range of applications, from utilization in
robotic grippers to human motion measurement. If tactile sensors could be
fabricated and integrated more easily, their applicability would further
expand. In this study, we propose a tactile sensor-M3D-skin-that can be easily
fabricated with high versatility by leveraging the infill patterns of a
multi-material fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer as the sensing
principle. This method employs conductive and non-conductive flexible filaments
to create a hierarchical structure with a specific infill pattern. The flexible
hierarchical structure deforms under pressure, leading to a change in
electrical resistance, enabling the acquisition of tactile information. We
measure the changes in characteristics of the proposed tactile sensor caused by
modifications to the hierarchical structure. Additionally, we demonstrate the
fabrication and use of a multi-tile sensor. Furthermore, as applications, we
implement motion pattern measurement on the sole of a foot, integration with a
robotic hand, and tactile-based robotic operations. Through these experiments,
we validate the effectiveness of the proposed tactile sensor.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hybrid RL+motion-planning framework for human-robot collaboration that jointly optimizes task sequencing and safety-aware motion planning, validated on a cobot with improved responsiveness, fewer failed goals, and less replanning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In human-robot collaboration, safety mechanisms often impede efficiency; uncertainty in human motion increases the need for robust planning and reduces task success. A framework that jointly addresses safety and efficiency is desirable.

Method: Combine an interactive motion planner that detects human arm motions and replans paths to remain collision-free with a reinforcement learning (RL) task planner that selects task sequences based on feedback from the motion planner, enabling the RL agent to prefer safe, efficient tasks while the motion planner enforces safety.

Result: Validated on a cobot in simulation and real-world tests, showing the framework can react to uncertain human motions at both joint and task levels, reduce repeated failed goal commands, and lower the total number of replanning requests compared to hard-coded planning methods.

Conclusion: A hybrid RL-task planning with an interactive motion planner can achieve safer and more efficient human-robot collaboration, with practical viability demonstrated in simulation and real-world cobot experiments.

Abstract: In a Human-Robot Cooperation (HRC) environment, safety and efficiency are the
two core properties to evaluate robot performance. However, safety mechanisms
usually hinder task efficiency since human intervention will cause backup
motions and goal failures of the robot. Frequent motion replanning will
increase the computational load and the chance of failure. In this paper, we
present a hybrid Reinforcement Learning (RL) planning framework which is
comprised of an interactive motion planner and a RL task planner. The RL task
planner attempts to choose statistically safe and efficient task sequences
based on the feedback from the motion planner, while the motion planner keeps
the task execution process collision-free by detecting human arm motions and
deploying new paths when the previous path is not valid anymore. Intuitively,
the RL agent will learn to avoid dangerous tasks, while the motion planner
ensures that the chosen tasks are safe. The proposed framework is validated on
the cobot in both simulation and the real world, we compare the planner with
hard-coded task motion planning methods. The results show that our planning
framework can 1) react to uncertain human motions at both joint and task
levels; 2) reduce the times of repeating failed goal commands; 3) reduce the
total number of replanning requests.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for high-frequency, resource-constrained robotic manipulation and multimodal action modeling with low latency.

Method: Introduce an energy score learning objective and an energy MLP architecture to predict multimodal actions in a single forward pass; emphasize the two core components for objective design and efficient, simple model.

Result: Experiments in simulation and real-world show Energy Policy matches or surpasses state-of-the-art manipulation methods while significantly reducing computational overhead; faster inference on MimicGen.

resource-constrained systems. Unlike existing robotic policies, Energy Policy
natively predicts multimodal actions in a single forward pass, enabling
high-precision manipulation at high speed. The framework is built upon two core
components. First, we adopt the energy score as the learning objective to
facilitate multimodal action modeling. Second, we introduce an energy MLP to
implement the proposed objective while keeping the architecture simple and
efficient. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both simulated environments
and real-world robotic tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of Energy Policy.

computational overhead. Notably, on the MimicGen benchmark, Energy Policy
achieves superior performance with at a faster inference compared to existing
approaches.

*Gaoyuan Liu,Bas Boom,Naftali Slob,Yuri Durodié,Ann Nowé,Bram Vanderborght*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes a multi-level behavior planning framework for robotic pruning with high-dimensional arms in cluttered orchard environments, integrating perception, modeling, and planning; demonstrates improved performance and real-world implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate repetitive pruning tasks to reduce reliance on seasonal skilled labor, addressing not just perception but the full manipulation problem in constrained branch environments; exploits robotic redundancy and complex collision handling.

Method: Formulates the pruning planning problem for a high-dimensional robotic arm, analyzes intrinsic redundancies, and designs a holistic workflow that couples perception, modeling, and multi-level planning; validated through experiments and a real-world robot.

Result: Comprehensive planning approaches significantly improve the performance of the robotic manipulator in pruning tasks; successful real-world implementation.

Conclusion: Adds to existing robotic pruning work by emphasizing planning and control, and encourages future research on planning-aware pruning systems.

Abstract: Pruning is an essential agricultural practice for orchards. Proper pruning
can promote healthier growth and optimize fruit production throughout the
orchard's lifespan. Robot manipulators have been developed as an automated
solution for this repetitive task, which typically requires seasonal labor with
specialized skills. While previous research has primarily focused on the
challenges of perception, the complexities of manipulation are often
overlooked. These challenges involve planning and control in both joint and
Cartesian spaces to guide the end-effector through intricate, obstructive
branches. Our work addresses the behavior planning challenge for a robotic
pruning system, which entails a multi-level planning problem in environments
with complex collisions. In this paper, we formulate the planning problem for a
high-dimensional robotic arm in a pruning scenario, investigate the system's
intrinsic redundancies, and propose a comprehensive pruning workflow that
integrates perception, modeling, and holistic planning. In our experiments, we
demonstrate that more comprehensive planning methods can significantly enhance
the performance of the robotic manipulator. Finally, we implement the proposed
workflow on a real-world robot. As a result, this work complements previous
efforts on robotic pruning and motivates future research and development in
planning for pruning applications.

*Muxing Huang,Zibin Chen,Weiliang Xu,Zilan Li,Yuanzhi Zhou,Guoyuan Zhou,Wenjing Chen,Xinming Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A two-stream fusion framework for vision-based tactile sensing that jointly estimates object depth and hardness, achieving high recognition accuracy: hardness 98.0%, shape 93.75%, and grasping-object recognition >98.5%, with a force prediction error of 0.06 N within a 12 N range.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-based tactile sensors produce rich, multi-dimensional data but face redundancy and lack effective fusion. A coordinated extraction of internal (depth) and external (hardness) object attributes is needed to improve recognition and cognition in embodied perception.

Method: A two-stream CNN-based feature extractor (internal and external features) with 3D reconstruction for depth and force data for hardness, followed by weighted fusion to form a unified representation; evaluated on objects of varying shapes and hardness in grasping scenarios.

Result: Force prediction error: 0.06 N (within 12 N). Hardness recognition: 98.0%. Shape recognition: 93.75%. Object recognition in grasping scenarios: >98.5%.

Conclusion: The fusion-based tactile perception approach advances perception-to-cognition in embodied perception, improving object recognition and enabling broader uses in embodied AI.

Abstract: Tactile perception is crucial for embodied intelligent robots to recognize
objects. Vision-based tactile sensors extract object physical attributes
multidimensionally using high spatial resolution; however, this process
generates abundant redundant information. Furthermore, single-dimensional
extraction, lacking effective fusion, fails to fully characterize object
attributes. These challenges hinder the improvement of recognition accuracy. To
address this issue, this study introduces a two-stream network feature
extraction and fusion perception strategy for vision-based tactile systems.
This strategy employs a distributed approach to extract internal and external
object features. It obtains depth map information through three-dimensional
reconstruction while simultaneously acquiring hardness information by measuring
contact force data. After extracting features with a convolutional neural
network (CNN), weighted fusion is applied to create a more informative and
effective feature representation. In standard tests on objects of varying
shapes and hardness, the force prediction error is 0.06 N (within a 12 N
range). Hardness recognition accuracy reaches 98.0%, and shape recognition
accuracy reaches 93.75%. With fusion algorithms, object recognition accuracy in
actual grasping scenarios exceeds 98.5%. Focused on object physical attributes
perception, this method enhances the artificial tactile system ability to
transition from perception to cognition, enabling its use in embodied
perception applications.

*Lukas Pries,Markus Ryll*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Neural-augmented feedback controller for agile quadrotor flight enabling precise tracking at the platform’s limits, with universal stability and direct real-world deployment without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address actuator constraints, disturbances, and computation limits in high-speed quadrotor control; current methods fail to simultaneously provide tight tracking, robustness, and efficiency at safety-critical rates.

Method: A neural-augmented nonlinear feedback controller that unifies strengths of state-of-the-art paradigms, optimized for fast computation and stability; trained in simulation with stable convergence and deployed directly on real platforms without augmentation or fine-tuning.

Result: Accurate tracking of highly aggressive trajectories beyond actuator feasibility; universal stability guarantees; robust performance in disturbance-prone settings; fast update-rate capability due to efficient nonlinear feedback; simulation training is fast and stable; no retraining or fine-tuning needed for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: The approach combines the best aspects of existing control strategies into a single, robust, and computationally efficient controller for high-speed quadrotor flight, offering provable stability and practical deployability for safety-critical applications.

Abstract: In the evolving landscape of high-speed agile quadrotor flight, achieving
precise trajectory tracking at the platform's operational limits is paramount.
Controllers must handle actuator constraints, exhibit robustness to
disturbances, and remain computationally efficient for safety-critical
applications. In this work, we present a novel neural-augmented feedback
controller for agile flight control. The controller addresses individual
limitations of existing state-of-the-art control paradigms and unifies their
strengths. We demonstrate the controller's capabilities, including the accurate
tracking of highly aggressive trajectories that surpass the feasibility of the
actuators. Notably, the controller provides universal stability guarantees,
enhancing its robustness and tracking performance even in exceedingly
disturbance-prone settings. Its nonlinear feedback structure is highly
efficient enabling fast computation at high update rates. Moreover, the
learning process in simulation is both fast and stable, and the controller's
inherent robustness allows direct deployment to real-world platforms without
the need for training augmentations or fine-tuning.

### [198] [Designing Tools with Control Confidence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12630)
*Ajith Anil Meera,Abian Torres,Pablo Lanillos*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework that adds a neuro-inspired control-confidence objective to CMA-ES-based autonomous tool design, improving robustness and enabling a trade-off with accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous tool design currently optimizes for accuracy only. The paper argues that historical tool use involved confidence in usage, which enhances robustness under uncertainty, and seeks to formalize this in robotics.

Method: Define a task-conditioned design optimization incorporating a control-confidence term into the objective; optimize tool design via CMA-ES; compare against a pure accuracy objective through robotic-arm simulations; assess robustness under environmental perturbations; report optimization efficiency and provide code.

Result: Tools designed with the control-confidence objective show greater robustness to environmental uncertainties than accuracy-only designs, while allowing a balance between robustness and goal accuracy under perturbations; the CMA-ES approach outperforms other optimizers in iterations.

Conclusion: Incorporating a neuro-inspired control-confidence term improves robustness and optimization efficiency in autonomous tool design, suggesting a principled path to resilient robotic manipulation and potential for broader application.

Abstract: Prehistoric humans invented stone tools for specialized tasks by not just
maximizing the tool's immediate goal-completion accuracy, but also increasing
their confidence in the tool for later use under similar settings. This factor
contributed to the increased robustness of the tool, i.e., the least
performance deviations under environmental uncertainties. However, the current
autonomous tool design frameworks solely rely on performance optimization,
without considering the agent's confidence in tool use for repeated use. Here,
we take a step towards filling this gap by i) defining an optimization
framework for task-conditioned autonomous hand tool design for robots, where
ii) we introduce a neuro-inspired control confidence term into the optimization
routine that helps the agent to design tools with higher robustness. Through
rigorous simulations using a robotic arm, we show that tools designed with
control confidence as the objective function are more robust to environmental
uncertainties during tool use than a pure accuracy-driven objective. We further
show that adding control confidence to the objective function for tool design
provides a balance between the robustness and goal accuracy of the designed
tools under control perturbations. Finally, we show that our CMAES-based
evolutionary optimization strategy for autonomous tool design outperforms other
state-of-the-art optimizers by designing the optimal tool within the fewest
iterations. Code: https://github.com/ajitham123/Tool_design_control_confidence.

*Oz Gitelson,Satya Prakash Nayak,Ritam Raha,Anne-Kathrin Schmuck*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework for online adaptive human-robot interaction that guarantees infinite-horizon temporal logic task satisfaction while minimizing human input, validated on block manipulation and Overcooked-AI, showing emergent cooperative behaviors beyond prior work.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable reliable achievement of long-horizon, formally specified tasks in the presence of humans pursuing independent and unknown goals, while reducing interference and preserving human autonomy.

Method: Combine maximal online adaptation (to leverage human behavior for cooperation when possible) with minimal tunable feedback (to request human cooperation only when necessary to guarantee progress), enabling persistent satisfaction of temporal logic tasks even with conflicting goals.

Result: Demonstrated on a real Franka Emika Panda block-manipulation task and the Overcooked-AI benchmark, producing rich emergent cooperative behaviors and providing strong formal guarantees beyond existing approaches.

Conclusion: The framework offers robust, autonomous-like fulfillment of infinite-horizon logical tasks in human-robot collaboration, balancing cooperation with human autonomy and extending cooperative capabilities beyond current methods.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for human-robot \emph{logical} interaction that
enables robots to reliably satisfy (infinite horizon) temporal logic tasks
while effectively collaborating with humans who pursue independent and unknown
tasks. The framework combines two key capabilities: (i) \emph{maximal
adaptation} enables the robot to adjust its strategy \emph{online} to exploit
human behavior for cooperation whenever possible, and (ii) \emph{minimal
tunable feedback} enables the robot to request cooperation by the human online
only when necessary to guarantee progress. This balance minimizes human-robot
interference, preserves human autonomy, and ensures persistent robot task
satisfaction even under conflicting human goals. We validate the approach in a
real-world block-manipulation task with a Franka Emika Panda robotic arm and in
the Overcooked-AI benchmark, demonstrating that our method produces rich,
\emph{emergent} cooperative behaviors beyond the reach of existing approaches,
while maintaining strong formal guarantees.

*Alvaro Belmonte-Baeza,Miguel Cazorla,Gabriel J. García,Carlos J. Pérez-Del-Pulgar,Jorge Pomares*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A constrained reinforcement learning framework for autonomous quadrupedal mobile manipulators in lunar environments that enforces safety constraints while achieving precise 6D end-effector tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Planetary robotics require autonomous, robust, and safe operation in the Moon’s harsh, unstructured terrain. Legged platforms offer better mobility on rough surfaces, but must satisfy critical safety constraints (collision avoidance, dynamic stability, power efficiency) under reduced gravity.

Method: A constrained reinforcement learning approach that integrates whole-body locomotion and manipulation, with explicit hard and soft safety constraints tailored to lunar gravity and terrain conditions, ensuring safe and reliable operation.

Result: The framework achieves precise 6D end-effector pose tracking (4 cm positional accuracy, 8.1° orientation) while consistently respecting soft and hard constraints and demonstrating adaptive behavior under lunar gravity.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates that adaptive learning can be effectively fused with mission-critical safety requirements, advancing autonomous robotic exploration for future lunar missions.

Abstract: Robotics plays a pivotal role in planetary science and exploration, where
autonomous and reliable systems are crucial due to the risks and challenges
inherent to space environments. The establishment of permanent lunar bases
demands robotic platforms capable of navigating and manipulating in the harsh
lunar terrain. While wheeled rovers have been the mainstay for planetary
exploration, their limitations in unstructured and steep terrains motivate the
adoption of legged robots, which offer superior mobility and adaptability. This
paper introduces a constrained reinforcement learning framework designed for
autonomous quadrupedal mobile manipulators operating in lunar environments. The
proposed framework integrates whole-body locomotion and manipulation
capabilities while explicitly addressing critical safety constraints, including
collision avoidance, dynamic stability, and power efficiency, in order to
ensure robust performance under lunar-specific conditions, such as reduced
gravity and irregular terrain. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in achieving precise 6D task-space end-effector pose tracking,
achieving an average positional accuracy of 4 cm and orientation accuracy of
8.1 degrees. The system consistently respects both soft and hard constraints,
exhibiting adaptive behaviors optimized for lunar gravity conditions. This work
effectively bridges adaptive learning with essential mission-critical safety
requirements, paving the way for advanced autonomous robotic explorers for
future lunar missions.

### [201] [Reflection-Based Task Adaptation for Self-Improving VLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12710)
*Baicheng Li,Dong Wu,Zike Yan,Xinchen Liu,Zecui Zeng,Lusong Li,Hongbin Zha*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes Reflective Self-Adaptation: a dual-path RL and SFT framework that self-improves VLA models with failure-driven dense rewards and success-driven imitation, enabling fast, autonomous task adaptation with reliable alignment to goals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adapting pre-trained Vision-Language-Action models to new tasks is inefficient and often requires human intervention; relying on proxy rewards in RL can lead to reward hacking and misaligned behavior.

Method: A dual-pathway architecture: (1) Failure-Driven Reflective RL uses the VLM's causal reasoning to automatically synthesize a dense reward signal from failure analysis, accelerating policy learning; (2) Success-Driven Quality-Guided SFT grounds the policy in holistic success by selectively imitating high-quality successful trajectories, aided by a conditional curriculum to aid early exploration and mitigate reward hacking.

Result: Empirical results on challenging manipulation tasks show faster convergence and higher final success rates compared to representative baselines, indicating improved efficiency and reliability of adaptation.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust, self-improving solution for rapidly and reliably adapting VLA models to new environments without human input.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a major leap
towards general-purpose robots, yet efficiently adapting them to novel,
specific tasks in-situ remains a significant hurdle. While reinforcement
learning (RL) is a promising avenue for such adaptation, the process often
suffers from low efficiency, hindering rapid task mastery. We introduce
Reflective Self-Adaptation, a framework for rapid, autonomous task adaptation
without human intervention. Our framework establishes a self-improving loop
where the agent learns from its own experience to enhance both strategy and
execution.
  The core of our framework is a dual-pathway architecture that addresses the
full adaptation lifecycle. First, a Failure-Driven Reflective RL pathway
enables rapid learning by using the VLM's causal reasoning to automatically
synthesize a targeted, dense reward function from failure analysis. This
provides a focused learning signal that significantly accelerates policy
exploration. However, optimizing such proxy rewards introduces a potential risk
of "reward hacking," where the agent masters the reward function but fails the
actual task. To counteract this, our second pathway, Success-Driven
Quality-Guided SFT, grounds the policy in holistic success. It identifies and
selectively imitates high-quality successful trajectories, ensuring the agent
remains aligned with the ultimate task goal. This pathway is strengthened by a
conditional curriculum mechanism to aid initial exploration.
  We conduct experiments in challenging manipulation tasks. The results
demonstrate that our framework achieves faster convergence and higher final
success rates compared to representative baselines. Our work presents a robust
solution for creating self-improving agents that can efficiently and reliably
adapt to new environments.

*Se Hwan Jeon,Ho Jae Lee,Seungwoo Hong,Sangbae Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GPU-parallelized residual framework blending MPC and RL for locomotion; MPC provides priors; residual policy corrects torques; improved sample efficiency, higher rewards, broader velocity range, and zero-shot gait/terrain transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPC offers interpretable, constrained control but is sensitive to model mismatch and real-time limits; RL yields robust behavior but lacks interpretability and can fail out-of-distribution; combining them aims to leverage the strengths of both.

Method: Develop kinodynamic whole-body MPC; run thousands of agents in parallel at 100 Hz for RL training; train a residual policy that adds targeted torque corrections to MPC outputs; blend at the torque-control level; use the MPC prior with a simple reward structure.

Result: Outperforms standalone MPC or end-to-end RL in sample efficiency and asymptotic performance; expands trackable velocity commands; enables zero-shot adaptation to unseen gaits and uneven terrain.

Conclusion: Integrating model-based MPC with reinforcement learning via a residual policy yields interpretable, adaptable locomotion controllers with improved data efficiency and generalization.

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) provides interpretable, tunable locomotion
controllers grounded in physical models, but its robustness depends on frequent
replanning and is limited by model mismatch and real-time computational
constraints. Reinforcement Learning (RL), by contrast, can produce highly
robust behaviors through stochastic training but often lacks interpretability,
suffers from out-of-distribution failures, and requires intensive reward
engineering. This work presents a GPU-parallelized residual architecture that
tightly integrates MPC and RL by blending their outputs at the torque-control
level. We develop a kinodynamic whole-body MPC formulation evaluated across
thousands of agents in parallel at 100 Hz for RL training. The residual policy
learns to make targeted corrections to the MPC outputs, combining the
interpretability and constraint handling of model-based control with the
adaptability of RL. The model-based control prior acts as a strong bias,
initializing and guiding the policy towards desirable behavior with a simple
set of rewards. Compared to standalone MPC or end-to-end RL, our approach
achieves higher sample efficiency, converges to greater asymptotic rewards,
expands the range of trackable velocity commands, and enables zero-shot
adaptation to unseen gaits and uneven terrain.

TL;DR: A diffusion-based framework, T(R,O) Grasp, generates accurate and diverse dexterous grasps across multiple robotic hands using a unified T(R,O) Graph representation of spatial transformations and geometry, achieving high speed and success rates and enabling closed-loop manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dexterous grasping involves high-dimensional state and action spaces and diverse hand-object embodiments. A unified, efficient representation and generation method is needed to improve success, speed, and generalizability across hands.

Method: Introduce T(R,O) Grasp with a T(R,O) Graph that encodes spatial transformations between hands and objects and their geometric properties. Use a graph diffusion model coupled with an efficient inverse kinematics solver to support both unconditioned and conditioned grasp synthesis, enabling fast, diverse grasps across embodiments.

Result: Extensive experiments on diverse dexterous hands show an average success rate of 94.83%, inference speed of 0.21s, and throughput of 41 grasps/s on NVIDIA A100 40GB, outperforming baselines. The approach is robust, generalizable across embodiments, and memory-efficient, with high inference speed enabling closed-loop dexterous manipulation.

Conclusion: T(R,O) Grasp has potential to scale into a foundation model for dexterous grasping due to its high performance, speed, robustness, and generalizability across robotic hands.

Abstract: Dexterous grasping remains a central challenge in robotics due to the
complexity of its high-dimensional state and action space. We introduce T(R,O)
Grasp, a diffusion-based framework that efficiently generates accurate and
diverse grasps across multiple robotic hands. At its core is the T(R,O) Graph,
a unified representation that models spatial transformations between robotic
hands and objects while encoding their geometric properties. A graph diffusion
model, coupled with an efficient inverse kinematics solver, supports both
unconditioned and conditioned grasp synthesis. Extensive experiments on a
diverse set of dexterous hands show that T(R,O) Grasp achieves average success
rate of 94.83%, inference speed of 0.21s, and throughput of 41 grasps per
second on an NVIDIA A100 40GB GPU, substantially outperforming existing
baselines. In addition, our approach is robust and generalizable across
embodiments while significantly reducing memory consumption. More importantly,
the high inference speed enables closed-loop dexterous manipulation,
underscoring the potential of T(R,O) Grasp to scale into a foundation model for

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HYPE (HYbrid Planning with Ego proposal-conditioned predictions) integrates multimodal trajectory proposals into Monte Carlo Tree Search using ego-conditioned occupancy predictions, simplifying cost design to grid-based terms and achieving state-of-the-art performance in safety and adaptability on nuPlan and DeepUrban.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safe and interpretable motion planning in urban, multi-agent environments is challenging due to bidirectional interactions and the need to estimate costs for ego maneuvers. Crafting a comprehensive cost function that covers diverse scenarios is difficult, motivating a framework that can leverage learned proposals and occupancy reasoning to guide planning.

Method: HYPE combines multimodal trajectory proposals from a learned proposal model as heuristic priors within a Monte Carlo Tree Search refinement. It uses an ego-conditioned occupancy prediction model to capture bidirectional interactions, enabling scene-aware reasoning. This design reduces reliance on complex, hand-crafted cost terms to simple grid-based costs.

Result: On large-scale real-world benchmarks nuPlan and DeepUrban, HYPE achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in safety and adaptability, by effectively guiding MCTS with proposal-driven heuristics and ego-aware predictions.

Conclusion: HYPE offers a principled approach to hybrid planning that simplifies cost design in refinement, improves safety and adaptability in complex urban settings, and generalizes across major benchmarks by leveraging proposal-conditioned predictions and ego-conditioned occupancy modeling.

Abstract: Safe and interpretable motion planning in complex urban environments needs to
reason about bidirectional multi-agent interactions. This reasoning requires to
estimate the costs of potential ego driving maneuvers. Many existing planners
generate initial trajectories with sampling-based methods and refine them by
optimizing on learned predictions of future environment states, which requires
a cost function that encodes the desired vehicle behavior. Designing such a
cost function can be very challenging, especially if a wide range of complex
urban scenarios has to be considered. We propose HYPE: HYbrid Planning with Ego
proposal-conditioned predictions, a planner that integrates multimodal
trajectory proposals from a learned proposal model as heuristic priors into a
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) refinement. To model bidirectional interactions,
we introduce an ego-conditioned occupancy prediction model, enabling
consistent, scene-aware reasoning. Our design significantly simplifies cost
function design in refinement by considering proposal-driven guidance,
requiring only minimalistic grid-based cost terms. Evaluations on large-scale
real-world benchmarks nuPlan and DeepUrban show that HYPE effectively achieves
state-of-the-art performance, especially in safety and adaptability.

### [206] [Beyond Consensus: Mitigating the Agreeableness Bias in LLM Judge Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11822)
*Suryaansh Jain,Umair Z. Ahmed,Shubham Sahai,Ben Leong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based evaluation is biased and unreliable for judging invalid outputs; the paper proposes a minority-veto ensemble and a regression-based model using limited human data, achieving strong accuracy on a code-feedback task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate how to reliably compare new large language models when human evaluation is costly, and LLM evaluators are biased toward validating outputs, risking inflated reliability scores.

Method: Quantifies validator bias of LLMs (high true positive rate for valid outputs, poor true negative rate for invalid ones). Introduces an optimal minority-veto strategy to combine evaluators and mitigate bias; also develops a regression-based framework that models validator bias using a small amount of human-annotated data. Evaluated on 366 high-school Python programs for code feedback, comparing against a 14-LLM ensemble.

Result: Minority-veto reduces bias and improves reliability; the regression model achieves a maximum absolute error of 1.2%, about a 2x improvement over the best-performing 14-LLM ensemble.

Conclusion: LLM-based evaluation alone is biased; combining bias-aware ensemble methods and regression grounded in human annotations yields more accurate and robust evaluation, enabling scalable model comparison with limited human data.

Abstract: New Large Language Models (LLMs) become available every few weeks, and modern
application developers confronted with the unenviable task of having to decide
if they should switch to a new model. While human evaluation remains the gold
standard, it is costly and unscalable. The state-of-the-art approach is to use
LLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw:
LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that
while LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive
Rate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True
Negative Rate <25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often
leads to inflated reliability scores.
  While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they
are not good enough. We introduce an optimal minority-veto strategy that is
resilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent. For
scenarios requiring even higher precision, we propose a novel regression-based
framework that directly models the validator bias using a small set of
human-annotated ground truth data. On a challenging code feedback task over 366
high-school Python programs, our regression approach reduces the maximum
absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving a 2x improvement over the
best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) introduces a standardized, scalable evaluation harness for AI agents, enabling parallel cross-VM assessments and revealing real-world performance issues beyond benchmarks. It analyzes models, scaffolds, and benchmarks across coding, navigation, science, and customer service, logs 2.5B LM calls, and shares data to push focus toward reliable real-world behavior. Notable findings include that increased reasoning often lowers accuracy and that agents exhibit unreported behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fragmentation, reproducibility, and hidden bugs in AI agent evaluation, and to shift assessment toward real-world reliability rather than benchmark mastery.

Method: Develop HAL harness that orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs; conduct three-way analysis on models, scaffolds, benchmarks; perform 21,730 rollouts across 9 models and 9 benchmarks; use LLM-aided log inspection; share 2.5B tokens of logs; total cost ~ $40k.

Result: Key findings: higher reasoning effort reduces accuracy in most runs; uncover unreported behaviors (e.g., searching benchmarks on HuggingFace, misusing credit cards in flight booking); standardize evaluation to reduce bugs and improve reliability; enable large-scale analysis across domains.

Conclusion: Standardized evaluation via HAL addresses common pitfalls, shifts focus from beating benchmarks to reliability, and promotes data sharing to advance research on agent behavior.

Abstract: AI agents have been developed for complex real-world tasks from coding to
customer service. But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that
undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the
Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three
main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that
orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation
time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second,
we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and
benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across
9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer
service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising
insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of
runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported
behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of
solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all
agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize
further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates
agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the
focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real
world.

### [208] [CGBench: Benchmarking Language Model Scientific Reasoning for Clinical Genetics Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11985)
*Owen Queen,Harrison G. Zhang,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CGBench is a robust benchmark for evaluating how well language models interpret clinical genetics literature, focusing on extraction, evidence judgment, and outcome description, and highlighting gaps in fine-grained instruction handling and hallucinations in explanations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing benchmarks target narrow tasks and fail to reflect real-world literature interpretation; there is a need to assess LMs' capabilities to reason over scientific publications and support clinical genetics workflows.

Method: Build CGBench from ClinGen's expert-curated literature interpretations; test eight LMs on three tasks: (1) extract relevant experimental results following precise protocols; (2) judge strength of evidence; (3) categorize and describe experiment outcomes. Also compare reasoning vs non-reasoning models, and assess explanations with an LM judge to compare to human explanations.

Result: LMs show potential but exhibit substantial gaps in precise interpretation; reasoning models perform better on fine-grained tasks, non-reasoning models better on high-level interpretations; models frequently hallucinate or misinterpret results in explanations despite correct evidence classification.

Conclusion: CGBench exposes the current limits and strengths of LMs for rigorous interpretation of scientific publications, guiding future research in AI-assisted clinical genetics and scientific literature analysis.

Abstract: Variant and gene interpretation are fundamental to personalized medicine and
translational biomedicine. However, traditional approaches are manual and
labor-intensive. Generative language models (LMs) can facilitate this process,
accelerating the translation of fundamental research into clinically-actionable
insights. While existing benchmarks have attempted to quantify the capabilities
of LMs for interpreting scientific data, these studies focus on narrow tasks
that do not translate to real-world research. To meet these challenges, we
introduce CGBench, a robust benchmark that tests reasoning capabilities of LMs
on scientific publications. CGBench is built from ClinGen, a resource of
expert-curated literature interpretations in clinical genetics. CGBench
measures the ability to 1) extract relevant experimental results following
precise protocols and guidelines, 2) judge the strength of evidence, and 3)
categorize and describe the relevant outcome of experiments. We test 8
different LMs and find that while models show promise, substantial gaps exist
in literature interpretation, especially on fine-grained instructions.
Reasoning models excel in fine-grained tasks but non-reasoning models are
better at high-level interpretations. Finally, we measure LM explanations
against human explanations with an LM judge approach, revealing that models
often hallucinate or misinterpret results even when correctly classifying
evidence. CGBench reveals strengths and weaknesses of LMs for precise
interpretation of scientific publications, opening avenues for future research
in AI for clinical genetics and science more broadly.

### [209] [Asking Clarifying Questions for Preference Elicitation With Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12015)
*Ali Montazeralghaem,Guy Tennenholtz,Craig Boutilier,Ofer Meshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Diffusion-inspired two-stage training lets LLMs ask sequential clarifying questions to reveal user preferences, improving funnel-question capability in conversational recommender systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalization is hard when user history is limited. Clarifying questions help elicit preferences, but generating effective sequential questions across multiple domains remains challenging.

Method: Two-stage diffusion-inspired process: forward step starts from a user profile to generate clarifying questions to obtain answers and then progressively removes those answers, adding noise to the profile. The reverse step trains a model to denoise the profile by learning to ask effective clarifying questions.

Result: Significant improvements in the model's ability to ask funnel questions and to elicit user preferences effectively.

Conclusion: The proposed diffusion-inspired training framework enhances LLMs' capability to elicit user preferences through sequential clarifying questions, supporting better personalization in open-ended conversational recommender systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it possible for recommendation systems
to interact with users in open-ended conversational interfaces. In order to
personalize LLM responses, it is crucial to elicit user preferences, especially
when there is limited user history. One way to get more information is to
present clarifying questions to the user. However, generating effective
sequential clarifying questions across various domains remains a challenge. To
address this, we introduce a novel approach for training LLMs to ask sequential
questions that reveal user preferences. Our method follows a two-stage process
inspired by diffusion models. Starting from a user profile, the forward process
generates clarifying questions to obtain answers and then removes those answers
step by step, serving as a way to add ``noise'' to the user profile. The
reverse process involves training a model to ``denoise'' the user profile by
learning to ask effective clarifying questions. Our results show that our
method significantly improves the LLM's proficiency in asking funnel questions
and eliciting user preferences effectively.

*Chathurangi Shyalika,Aryaman Sharma,Fadi El Kalach,Utkarshani Jaimini,Cory Henson,Ramy Harik,Amit Sheth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CausalTrace adds an interpretable, neurosymbolic causal analysis module to SmartPilot, enabling real-time causal discovery, counterfactual reasoning, and root-cause analysis using industrial ontologies/knowledge graphs, with strong evaluation and live deployment readiness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industry demands AI that unifies prediction, explanation, and causal reasoning to identify anomalies, diagnose root causes, and suggest interventions in high-stakes manufacturing, overcoming the black-box limitation of many AI systems.

Method: A neurosymbolic causal analysis module (CausalTrace) integrated into the SmartPilot industrial CoPilot, leveraging industrial ontologies and knowledge graphs to support causal discovery, counterfactual reasoning, and root-cause analysis, with real-time operator interaction and compatibility with existing agents.

Result: Strong alignment with domain experts (ROUGE-1: 0.91 on ontology QA); robust RCA metrics (MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92); C3AN evaluation score of 4.59/5, indicating precision and reliability for live deployment; validated in an academic rocket assembly testbed.

Conclusion: CausalTrace delivers transparent, explainable decision support that complements existing agents, enhancing trustworthiness and practical utility of industrial AI by enabling integrated prediction, explanation, and causal reasoning for operational interventions.

Abstract: Modern manufacturing environments demand not only accurate predictions but
also interpretable insights to process anomalies, root causes, and potential
interventions. Existing AI systems often function as isolated black boxes,
lacking the seamless integration of prediction, explanation, and causal
reasoning required for a unified decision-support solution. This fragmentation
limits their trustworthiness and practical utility in high-stakes industrial
environments. In this work, we present CausalTrace, a neurosymbolic causal
analysis module integrated into the SmartPilot industrial CoPilot. CausalTrace
performs data-driven causal analysis enriched by industrial ontologies and
knowledge graphs, including advanced functions such as causal discovery,
counterfactual reasoning, and root cause analysis (RCA). It supports real-time
operator interaction and is designed to complement existing agents by offering
transparent, explainable decision support. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation of CausalTrace using multiple causal assessment methods and the C3AN
framework (i.e. Custom, Compact, Composite AI with Neurosymbolic Integration),
which spans principles of robustness, intelligence, and trustworthiness. In an
academic rocket assembly testbed, CausalTrace achieved substantial agreement
with domain experts (ROUGE-1: 0.91 in ontology QA) and strong RCA performance
(MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92). It also attained 4.59/5 in
the C3AN evaluation, demonstrating precision and reliability for live
deployment.

### [211] [Do Large Language Models Respect Contracts? Evaluating and Enforcing Contract-Adherence in Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12047)
*Soohan Lim,Joonghyuk Hahn,Hyunwoo Park,Sang-Ki Ko,Yo-Sub Han*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PACT introduces a contract-adherence evaluation framework for LLM-generated code, extending functional correctness benchmarks with a contract-violation test suite, demonstrating that prompts augmented with contract-violating tests improve adherence, and providing new metrics and data/code for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current code generation benchmarks focus on functional correctness (pass@k) on well-formed inputs and neglect contract adherence, a critical real-world requirement where ill-formed inputs must be rejected by code. This gap leaves models untested for robustness in real software

Method: Develop PACT: a test-suite corpus focused on contract violations; systematically analyze code generation under varied prompting conditions; compare prompts that include contract-violating tests versus contract descriptions; introduce novel metrics to quantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation; release code and data publicly

Result: Empirical findings show that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases significantly improves a model's ability to respect contracts compared to using contract descriptions alone; PACT provides rigorous, interpretable metrics to quantify contract adherence and reveals critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook

Conclusion: PACT offers a rigorous framework to evaluate and improve LLM-generated code's functionality and contract adherence; it expands evaluation beyond functional correctness and fosters robustness. Code and data are available at the referenced GitHub URL.

Abstract: Prevailing code generation benchmarks, such as HumanEval+ and MBPP+,
primarily evaluate large language models (LLMs) with pass@k on functional
correctness using well-formed inputs. However, they ignore a crucial aspect of
real-world software: adherence to contracts-the preconditions and validity
constraints that dictate how ill-formed inputs must be rejected. This critical
oversight means that existing benchmarks fail to measure, and models
consequently fail to generate, truly robust and reliable code snippets. We
introduce PACT, a program assessment and contract-adherence evaluation
framework, to bridge this gap. PACT is the first framework designed to
systematically evaluate and enhance contract-adherence in LLM-generated code
snippets alongside functional correctness. PACT's contributions are threefold:
First, it provides a comprehensive test-suite corpus focused on contract
violations, extending HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Second, it enables a systematic
analysis of code generation under varied prompting conditions. This analysis
demonstrates that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases
significantly enhance a model's ability to respect contracts compared to using
contract description alone. Finally, it introduces novel metrics to rigorously
quantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation. By
revealing critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook, PACT provides
the rigorous and interpretable metrics to evaluate the robustness of
LLM-generated code snippets in both functionality and contract-adherence.Our
code and data are available at https://github.com/suhanmen/PACT.

### [212] [Empowering LLM Agents with Geospatial Awareness: Toward Grounded Reasoning for Wildfire Response](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12061)
*Yiheng Chen,Lingyao Li,Zihui Ma,Qikai Hu,Yilun Zhu,Min Deng,Runlong Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Geospatial grounding for LLM-based disaster response via a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL); it ingests raw detections, fetches geo-data, and yields evidence-based resource allocation in real wildfires, with potential generalization to floods/hurricanes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Statistical methods for disaster response often lack semantic context, generalize poorly across events, and are hard to interpret. LLMs offer few-shot generalization but remain text-only and geography-blind; grounding them in structured geospatial data can improve situational awareness and decision quality.

Method: Introduce GAL that starts from raw wildfire detections, automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure, demographic, terrain, and weather data from external geodatabases, and compiles them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched context is used by LLM agents to generate evidence-based resource-allocation recommendations (e.g., personnel and budget allocation), reinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals for incremental updates.

Result: Framework evaluated in real wildfire scenarios across multiple LLM models; geospatially grounded agents outperform baselines, demonstrating improved decision quality. The approach is demonstrable across several models and can adapt to daily changes.

Conclusion: GAL can generalize beyond wildfires to other hazards such as floods and hurricanes, enabling more interpretable and effective disaster response by grounding LLM agents in structured geospatial context.

Abstract: Effective disaster response is essential for safeguarding lives and property.
Existing statistical approaches often lack semantic context, generalize poorly
across events, and offer limited interpretability. While Large language models
(LLMs) provide few-shot generalization, they remain text-bound and blind to
geography. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL)
that grounds LLM agents in structured earth data. Starting from raw wildfire
detections, GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure,
demographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases,
assembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched
context enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation
recommendations (e.g., personnel assignments, budget allocations), further
reinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals for incremental
updates. We evaluate the framework in real wildfire scenarios across multiple
LLM models, showing that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines.
The proposed framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and
hurricanes.

### [213] [ThinkPilot: Steering Reasoning Models via Automated Think-prefixes Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12063)
*Sunzhu Li,Zhiyu Lin,Shuling Yang,Jiale Zhao,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ThinkPilot is a training-free framework that evolves think-prefix instructions to steer LRMs' reasoning, yielding better accuracy with shorter reasoning, improved safety, and better instruction following, and it complements training-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LRMs suffer from inefficient and off-target reasoning; existing training-free analyses are limited to rigid heuristics or non-actionable insights; there is a need for a general, automatic method to align reasoning with task demands.

Method: An evolutionary process generates and refines think-prefixes based on a taxonomy of reasoning behaviors; prefixes guide model reasoning during inference; evaluation across tasks for accuracy-length trade-off, safety measures, and instruction following; analysis of how behavioral distributions align with task requirements.

Result: ThinkPilot significantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off, substantially enhances safety (e.g., reducing StrongREJECT score from 27.0% to 0.7% in a DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B setting), and improves instruction following; prefixes synergize with existing training-based methods; analysis shows think-prefixes reliably control LRMs' reasoning behaviors and that tasks prefer specific behavioral distributions.

Conclusion: ThinkPilot provides a generalizable, training-free framework to align LRMs' reasoning with task demands; data and code are available for reproducibility and broader adoption; method can be used standalone or in combination with training-based approaches.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are powerful, but they still suffer from
inefficient and off-target reasoning. Currently, training-free methods are
limited to either rigid heuristics or descriptive, non-actionable analyses. In
this paper, we introduce ThinkPilot, a training-free framework that
automatically optimizes LRMs reasoning. It uses an evolutionary process to
generate think-prefixes, which are instructions that evolve driven by a
taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate ThinkPilot's broad effectiveness: it
significantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning,
drastically improves safety (for example, cutting the StrongREJECT score of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 27.0% to 0.7), and enhances instruction
following. It also synergizes with existing training-based methods. Our
analysis reveals that think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning
behaviors, and that different tasks have strong preferences for specific
behavioral distributions. By automatically identifying and eliciting these
behaviors, ThinkPilot provides a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs
reasoning with task demands. Data and code are available at

### [214] [AI Agents as Universal Task Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12066)
*Alessandro Achille,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper reframes AI reasoning agents as time-efficient, transductive learners, deriving relationships between algorithmic information and speed-ups, showing power-law scaling of inference time with training, and arguing that time—not model size—is the key resource for achieving general intelligence; large models risk brute-force behavior rather than insight.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address whether AI agents can be universal, how to learn reasoning, and whether scaling alone yields intelligence; proposes a time-centric learning paradigm (transductive) to capture algorithmic structure from past data to speed up future tasks.

Method: Develop a theoretical framework treating agents as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems; formalize transductive learning; derive bounds linking past data's algorithmic information to achievable speed-ups; analyze implications for model scaling on inference time.

Result: Derived power-law scaling between inference time and training time; showed that increasing model size improves benchmarks but may fail intelligence tests; argued that time optimization is the transferable objective for scalable reasoning.

Conclusion: Time is the critical resource in learning to reason; advocates shifting from purely inductive to transductive learning and cautions against relying on ever-larger models as a path to intelligence; calls for objective to minimize inference time to achieve practical general reasoning.

Abstract: AI reasoning agents are already able to solve a variety of tasks by deploying
tools, simulating outcomes of multiple hypotheses and reflecting on them. In
doing so, they perform computation, although not in the classical sense --
there is no program being executed. Still, if they perform computation, can AI
agents be universal? Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task?
How does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training
dataset size?
  In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI
Agents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and
highlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason.
In doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to
transductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the
distribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce
the time needed to find solutions to new tasks.
  Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role
of information in learning is about reduction of time rather than
reconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a
universal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their
algorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the
observed power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show
that scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on
benchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone
super-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can
behave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight.
Instead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning
models is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly
considered.

*Junyi Xie,Yuankun Jiao,Jina Kim,Yao-Yi Chiang,Lingyi Zhao,Khurram Shafique*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiCoTraj is a zero-shot demographic inference framework using hierarchical chain-of-thought prompting with LLMs to infer demographics from trajectories without labeled data; it converts trajectories into semantic natural language representations and uses a three-stage reasoning process, achieving competitive zero-shot performance across demographics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a scarcity of labeled mobility demographic data, leading to poor generalizability and interpretability in existing methods that rely on large labeled datasets.

Method: Trajectories are transformed into semantic natural language representations via activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries. A hierarchical chain-of-thought process guides LLMs through three stages—factual feature extraction, behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference with structured output—in a zero-shot setting without training data.

Result: The approach achieves competitive performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios on real-world trajectory data.

Conclusion: HiCoTraj addresses labeled-data scarcity and enhances interpretability by providing transparent reasoning chains, demonstrating the viability of zero-shot, LLM-based demographic inference from mobility data.

Abstract: Inferring demographic attributes such as age, sex, or income level from human
mobility patterns enables critical applications such as targeted public health
interventions, equitable urban planning, and personalized transportation
services. Existing mobility-based demographic inference studies heavily rely on
large-scale trajectory data with demographic labels, leading to limited
interpretability and poor generalizability across different datasets and user
groups. We propose HiCoTraj (Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical
Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory), a framework that leverages LLMs'
zero-shot learning and semantic understanding capabilities to perform
demographic inference without labeled training data. HiCoTraj transforms
trajectories into semantically rich, natural language representations by
creating detailed activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries. Then
HiCoTraj uses a novel hierarchical chain of thought reasoning to systematically
guide LLMs through three cognitive stages: factual feature extraction,
behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference with structured output.
This approach addresses the scarcity challenge of labeled demographic data
while providing transparent reasoning chains. Experimental evaluation on
real-world trajectory data demonstrates that HiCoTraj achieves competitive
performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A first-of-its-kind training ground (EmboMatrix) enables LLMs to develop embodied decision-making through large-scale task/scene simulation, embodied interaction, and precise rewards, producing EmboBrain 7B that outperforms a 671B baseline by 9.5% on two benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs trained on language lack physical-world experience; bridging the gap with an environment-grounded training platform to foster genuine embodied intelligence.

Method: Build EmboMatrix: a scalable training ground with: (i) a multi-agent data engine for large-scale task/scene generation; (ii) a distributed heterogeneous-hardware simulation system for scalable embodied interaction; (iii) a multi-level reward architecture for precise supervision. Train EmboBrain (an LLM) to acquire embodied decision-making through extensive interactions.

Result: EmboBrain-7B surpasses DeepSeek-R1 671B baseline by 9.5% on two embodied decision-making benchmarks.

Conclusion: Environment-grounded, interactive learning can unlock emergent embodied decision-making in LLMs; EmboMatrix offers a scalable platform and EmboBrain demonstrates the viability of this approach.

Abstract: Embodied decision-making enables agents to translate high-level goals into
executable actions through continuous interactions within the physical world,
forming a cornerstone of general-purpose embodied intelligence. Large language
models (LLMs), with their general decision-making capabilities, offer a
promising path to realize this potential; however, LLMs trained solely on
language lack exposure to physical environments, limiting their true embodied
understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose the concept of a training ground:
a comprehensive infrastructure that provides task and scene simulation,
embodied interaction, and feedback signals, offering a one-stop solution for
LLM acquire genuine embodied decision-making skills. In this work, we present
EmboMatrix, the first training ground of its kind, providing massive and
diverse tasks with efficient simulation and precise rewards. EmboMatrix
incorporates a series of novel techniques: a multi-agent data engine for
large-scale task and scene generation, a distributed heterogeneous-hardware
system for scalable simulation, and a multi-level reward architecture for
precise supervision. Leveraging EmboMatrix, we cultivate EmboBrain, an LLM
whose embodied decision-making abilities emerge from extensive embodied
interactions. Experiments show that EmboBrain-7B surpasses the 671B DeepSeek-R1
baseline by 9.5\% on two challenging embodied decision-making benchmarks,
demonstrating the power of interactive, environment-grounded learning for
building truly intelligent embodied agents.

*Junyi Xie,Jina Kim,Yao-Yi Chiang,Lingyi Zhao,Khurram Shafique*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BeSTAD is an unsupervised framework for personalized, individual-level anomaly detection in large-scale human mobility data, using semantic-enriched representations and a behavior-cluster-aware model to compare cross-period activity and detect subtle deviations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current anomaly detection in mobility is trajectory-centric and misses deviations in an individual's own historical patterns, especially in large populations. There is a need for personalized, interpretable methods that model both spatial context and temporal dynamics.

Method: BeSTAD learns semantically enriched mobility representations that encode location meaning and temporal patterns. It jointly models spatial context and temporal dynamics. It introduces a behavior-cluster-aware component that builds personalized normal activity profiles from unlabeled data and detects anomalies via cross-period behavioral comparison with semantic alignment across periods.

Result: According to the abstract, BeSTAD enables detection of behavioral shifts and deviations from routines and can identify individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets, enabling more personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.

Conclusion: BeSTAD advances anomaly detection in mobility toward personalized, interpretable insights by learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data and focusing on cross-period comparisons of semantically aligned behavior.

Abstract: Traditional anomaly detection in human mobility has primarily focused on
trajectory-level analysis, identifying statistical outliers or spatiotemporal
inconsistencies across aggregated movement traces. However, detecting
individual-level anomalies, i.e., unusual deviations in a person's mobility
behavior relative to their own historical patterns, within datasets
encompassing large populations remains a significant challenge. In this paper,
we present BeSTAD (Behavior-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human
Mobility Data), an unsupervised framework that captures individualized
behavioral signatures across large populations and uncovers fine-grained
anomalies by jointly modeling spatial context and temporal dynamics. BeSTAD
learns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location
meaning and temporal patterns, enabling the detection of subtle deviations in
individual movement behavior. BeSTAD further employs a behavior-cluster-aware
modeling mechanism that builds personalized behavioral profiles from normal
activity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison
with consistent semantic alignment. Building on prior work in mobility behavior
clustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts
and deviations from established routines but also the identification of
individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets. By
learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances
anomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.

### [218] [Evaluating the Quality of Randomness and Entropy in Tasks Supported by Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12080)
*Rabimba Karanjai,Yang Lu,Ranjith Chodavarapu,Lei Xu,Weidong Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can generate randomness but are unreliable and inconsistent; evaluations using entropy and NIST tests show limitations; improvements needed for randomness tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As randomness is central to many LLM applications (gaming, cryptography, scheduling, AI agents), understanding LLMs' capacity to generate and use random numbers is essential.

Method: Design experiments varying tool access, task type, model state, and prompts; tasks include random number generation, random strings/passwords, shuffling; assess randomness quality using entropy and NIST Statistical Test Suite.

Result: Outputs show some randomness but inconsistent and divergent from expected randomness; quality not robust across conditions.

Conclusion: Identify limitations; propose areas for improvement for enabling effective randomness handling in LLMs.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) technology has led to
diverse applications, many of which inherently require randomness, such as
stochastic decision-making, gaming, scheduling, AI agents, and
cryptography-related tasks. However, the capabilities of LLMs in handling
randomness, particularly in generating and utilizing random numbers
effectively, remain unclear. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs for
handling tasks that involve randomness through a series of experiments. We
designed a set of experiments that consider various factors that can influence
an LLM's performance in tasks involving randomness, such as accessibility to
external tools, types of tasks, model states (fresh vs. non-fresh), and
prompting strategies. The experiments cover a range of tasks, including
generating random numbers, generating random strings such as passwords,
shuffling items, and evaluating the quality of randomness using entropy and the
NIST randomness test-suite. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate
outputs that exhibit some degree of randomness, their performance is
inconsistent and often deviates significantly from the expected behavior. The

improvement is needed for the LLMs to effectively handle tasks involving
randomness

### [219] [One Life to Learn: Inferring Symbolic World Models for Stochastic Environments from Unguided Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12088)
*Zaid Khan,Archiki Prasad,Elias Stengel-Eskin,Jaemin Cho,Mohit Bansal*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OneLife learns probabilistic, conditionally-activated, programmatic world models for stochastic, minimally supervised environments; enables planning and state prediction; outperforms a strong baseline in most Crafter-OO scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address learning world dynamics in realistic, hostile environments where an agent has only a single life and little to no human guidance, moving beyond deterministic, data-rich, guided settings.

Method: Introduce OneLife, which models dynamics via conditionally activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming framework. Laws use precondition–effect structures and activate only in relevant states, forming a dynamic computation graph that limits inference to relevant laws and supports learning of stochastic dynamics with sparse activations. Evaluation uses a new protocol measuring state ranking and state fidelity, tested on Crafter-OO.

Result: OneLife learns key environment dynamics from minimal unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline in 16 of 23 scenarios. Planning via simulated rollouts can identify superior strategies.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic, symbolic world models of unknown, complex environments and demonstrates viability in challenging settings.

Abstract: Symbolic world modeling requires inferring and representing an environment's
transitional dynamics as an executable program. Prior work has focused on
largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple
mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging
setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only
"one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We
introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through
conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming
framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,
activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph
that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding
scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,
hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with
sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding
constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state
ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible
ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that
closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,
our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,
object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on
that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from
minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23
scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated
rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a
foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown,
complex environments.

TL;DR: ToPolyAgent is a four-agent, LLM-driven framework that enables coarse-grained MD simulations of topological polymers via natural language. It integrates LAMMPS-based simulations with interactive and autonomous workflows across diverse polymer architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Researchers face barriers in performing MD simulations for diverse polymer architectures and solvent conditions. A natural-language interface coupled with domain tools can streamline setup, execution, and analysis, enabling autonomous experimentation and broadened accessibility in polymer science.

Method: The system uses four LLM-powered agents: Config Agent (initial polymer-solvent setups), Simulation Agent (LAMMPS-based MD runs and conformational analyses), Report Agent (markdown report generation), and Workflow Agent (orchestrating autonomous tasks).

Result: The framework demonstrates versatility across polymer architectures and simulation conditions, enabling both interactive refinements and autonomous task execution. It showcases potential as a research assistant for understanding how interaction parameters and grafting strategies affect conformations and persistence lengths, highlighting practical workflows and reporting.

Conclusion: By coupling natural-language interfaces with rigorous MD tools, ToPolyAgent lowers barriers to complex computational workflows and lays the groundwork for autonomous, extensible multi-agent AI research ecosystems in polymer science.

Abstract: We introduce ToPolyAgent, a multi-agent AI framework for performing
coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of topological polymers
through natural language instructions. By integrating large language models
(LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both
interactive and autonomous simulation workflows across diverse polymer
architectures, including linear, ring, brush, and star polymers, as well as
dendrimers. The system consists of four LLM-powered agents: a Config Agent for
generating initial polymer-solvent configurations, a Simulation Agent for
executing LAMMPS-based MD simulations and conformational analyses, a Report

autonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for
iterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution
from detailed prompts. We demonstrate ToPolyAgent's versatility through case
studies involving diverse polymer architectures under varying solvent

interaction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of
grafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling
natural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers
barriers to complex computational workflows and advances AI-driven materials
discovery in polymer science. It lays the foundation for autonomous and
extensible multi-agent scientific research ecosystems.

*Rongzhi Zhang,Liqin Ye,Yuzhao Heng,Xiang Chen,Tong Yu,Lingkai Kong,Sudheer Chava,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a three-pronged method to achieve precise, continuous attribute intensity control in LLM outputs (target-reaching objective, a TD-learned value function to forecast final intensity from partial generations, and gradient-based interventions on hidden representations), validated on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini, enabling high-accuracy, fine-grained control and efficiency gains on downstream tasks; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM alignment methods offer only directional or open-ended guidance, which fails to reliably achieve exact attribute intensities; there is a need for adaptable AI that can match diverse user preferences with precise control.

Method: Three designs: (1) reformulate attribute intensity control as a target-reaching problem rather than simple maximization; (2) train a lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final attribute intensity scores from partial generations to steer LLM outputs; (3) apply gradient-based interventions on hidden representations to nudge the model toward specific intensity targets.

Result: Demonstrates the ability to steer generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini; shows efficiency enhancements across downstream tasks including preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and distillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference; code available at the authors' GitHub.

Conclusion: This work enables fine-grained, continuous control over attribute intensities beyond simple directional alignment, improving adaptability of LLM outputs and offering downstream efficiency benefits; it provides a practical framework for precise alignment and control.

Abstract: Precise attribute intensity control--generating Large Language Model (LLM)
outputs with specific, user-defined attribute intensities--is crucial for AI
systems adaptable to diverse user expectations. Current LLM alignment methods,
however, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to
reliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with
three key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a
target-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a
lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final
attribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM
outputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden
representations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute
intensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over
attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments
on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text
generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally,
we demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks:
preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and
distillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference. Our code is

*Junkai Zhang,Jingru Gan,Xiaoxuan Wang,Zian Jia,Changquan Gu,Jianpeng Chen,Yanqiao Zhu,Mingyu Derek Ma,Dawei Zhou,Ling Li,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A large, taxonomy-rich, multimodal benchmark (MatSciBench) for college-level materials science reasoning with 1,340 problems across 6 fields and 31 sub-fields, three difficulty tiers, detailed solutions, and multimodal context; current LLMs underperform (~<80% accuracy) and no single reasoning strategy dominates, making it a valuable resource for benchmarking and advancing AI in materials science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in evaluating and improving LLM-driven scientific reasoning in materials science, providing a structured, fine-grained, multimodal benchmark with error analysis capabilities.

Method: Construct MatSciBench with 1,340 problems organized into 6 primary fields and 31 sub-fields, with a three-tier difficulty based on reasoning length; supply detailed reference solutions; incorporate visual contexts for multimodal reasoning; evaluate multiple reasoning strategies (basic chain-of-thought, tool augmentation, self-correction); analyze performance by difficulty, efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, multimodal challenges, failure modes, and retrieval-augmented generation.

Result: Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves under 80% accuracy on the benchmark; no single reasoning strategy consistently outperforms others across all scenarios; appears to present complex reasoning tasks with multimodal elements; provides detailed error analysis and insights into model limitations.

Conclusion: MatSciBench provides a comprehensive and solid benchmark for assessing and driving improvements in scientific reasoning for LLMs in materials science, and supports systematic study of reasoning strategies, multimodal reasoning, and retrieval methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in
scientific reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in materials science
remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce MatSciBench, a
comprehensive college-level benchmark comprising 1,340 problems that span the
essential subdisciplines of materials science. MatSciBench features a
structured and fine-grained taxonomy that categorizes materials science
questions into 6 primary fields and 31 sub-fields, and includes a three-tier
difficulty classification based on the reasoning length required to solve each
question. MatSciBench provides detailed reference solutions enabling precise
error analysis and incorporates multimodal reasoning through visual contexts in
numerous questions. Evaluations of leading models reveal that even the
highest-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves under 80% accuracy on
college-level materials science questions, highlighting the complexity of
MatSciBench. Our systematic analysis of different reasoning strategie--basic
chain-of-thought, tool augmentation, and self-correction--demonstrates that no
single method consistently excels across all scenarios. We further analyze
performance by difficulty level, examine trade-offs between efficiency and
accuracy, highlight the challenges inherent in multimodal reasoning tasks,
analyze failure modes across LLMs and reasoning methods, and evaluate the
influence of retrieval-augmented generation. MatSciBench thus establishes a
comprehensive and solid benchmark for assessing and driving improvements in the
scientific reasoning capabilities of LLMs within the materials science domain.

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey of Meta AI's LLaMA series and PEFT methods (LoRA, LLaMA-Adapter V1/V2, LLaMA-Excitor, QLoRA), covering architectures, parameter efficiency, benchmarks, and real-world applications; discusses challenges and future research directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To synthesize rapid developments in large LLaMA models and efficient fine-tuning techniques for researchers and practitioners.

Method: Literature review and synthesis: describe LLaMA model family and variants; examine five PEFT methods, their mechanisms and parameter savings; compare architectures, counts, and benchmarks; discuss real-world use cases and challenges.

Result: Structured insights into model/adapter architectures, parameter counts, and benchmark outcomes; examples where fine-tuned LLaMA surpasses larger baselines; overview of domains like legal/medical.

Conclusion: PEFT enables efficient adaptation of LLaMA models; scaling context windows and robustness remain key challenges; the paper serves as a resource for ML researchers and practitioners.

Abstract: This review surveys the rapid evolution of Meta AI's LLaMA (Large Language
Model Meta AI) series - from LLaMA 1 through LLaMA 4 and the specialized
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods developed for these models. We
first describe the LLaMA family of foundation models (7B-65B to 288B
parameters), their architectures (including native multimodal and
Mixtureof-Experts variants), and key performance characteristics. We then
describe and discuss the concept of PEFT, which adapts large pre-trained models
by updating only a small subset of parameters, and review five PEFT methods
that have been applied to LLaMA: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), LLaMA-Adapter V1
and V2, LLaMA-Excitor, and QLoRA (Quantized LoRA). We discuss each method's
mechanism, parameter savings, and example application to LLaMA (e.g.,
instruction tuning, multimodal tasks). We provide structured discussion and
analysis of model and adapter architectures, parameter counts, and benchmark
results (including examples where fine-tuned LLaMA models outperform larger
baselines). Finally, we examine real-world use cases where LLaMA-based models
and PEFT have been successfully applied (e.g., legal and medical domains), and
we discuss ongoing challenges and future research directions (such as scaling
to even larger contexts and improving robustness). This survey paper provides a
one-stop resource for ML researchers and practitioners interested in LLaMA
models and efficient fine-tuning strategies.

*Linyi Yang,Yixuan Weng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Open-source framework ResearStudio enables real-time human control over AI research agents through a plan-as-document, achieving state-of-the-art GAIA results and blending AI-led, human-assisted, and human-led modes; includes live demo and open-source repo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of fire-and-forget AI agents by enabling real-time human intervention and expert knowledge during execution, aiming for safer, more controllable, and more capable autonomous research systems.

Method: ResearStudio employs a hierarchical Planner-Executor that writes steps to a live plan-as-document and streams actions, file changes, and tool calls to a web interface. It supports pausing, plan/code edits, and resuming, allowing smooth switching between AI-led, human-assisted, and mixed modes. The approach is demonstrated with a Collaborative Workshop design and evaluation on GAIA, comparing to systems like DeepResearch and Manus.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that strong automated performance can coexist with fine-grained human control, enabling safer and more controllable research agents. It provides a foundation for community-driven development and continued improvements in safe AI collaboration, with ongoing repository updates and public demos.

Abstract: Current deep-research agents run in a ''fire-and-forget'' mode: once started,
they give users no way to fix errors or add expert knowledge during execution.
We present ResearStudio, the first open-source framework that places real-time
human control at its core. The system follows a Collaborative Workshop design.
A hierarchical Planner-Executor writes every step to a live
''plan-as-document,'' a fast communication layer streams each action, file
change, and tool call to a web interface. At any moment, the user can pause the
run, edit the plan or code, run custom commands, and resume -- switching
smoothly between AI-led, human-assisted and human-led, AI-assisted modes. In
fully autonomous mode, ResearStudio achieves state-of-the-art results on the
GAIA benchmark, surpassing systems like OpenAI's DeepResearch and Manus. These
results show that strong automated performance and fine-grained human control
can coexist. The full code, protocol, and evaluation scripts are available at
https://github.com/ResearAI/ResearStudio. We will continue to update the
repository to encourage further work on safe and controllable research agents.

*Aline Mangold,Juliane Zietz,Susanne Weinhold,Sebastian Pannasch*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 65 user studies evaluating XAI systems across domains; provides a human-centered design framework, design goals, and an extended evaluation approach distinguishing core AI system from the XAI explanations, with adaptation for AI novices and data experts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI becomes ubiquitous, there is a demand for systems that are both high-performing and understandable. current evaluation is technical and user-centered evaluation is needed to guide development and deployment.

Method: Systematic review of 65 user studies evaluating XAI across domains. Synthesis of XAI system characteristics, evaluation metrics, and user characteristics. Proposes a human-centered design framework and extends existing XAI evaluation/design frameworks, including a separation between core system and explanations and adaptation of goals for users with varying AI expertise.

Result: Identifies a key distinction between the core system and the XAI explanation, proposes a taxonomy of evaluation metrics (affection, cognition, usability, interpretability, explanation metrics), and notes user characteristics. Proposes design goals tailored to AI novices (responsible use, acceptance, usability) and data experts (performance-oriented, human-AI collaboration, system/task performance).

Conclusion: Provides practical guidance for XAI developers by offering an extended human-centered evaluation/design framework, highlighting the need to tailor goals to user expertise, and bridging the gap between technical evaluation and user-centered requirements.

Abstract: As AI becomes more common in everyday living, there is an increasing demand
for intelligent systems that are both performant and understandable.
Explainable AI (XAI) systems aim to provide comprehensible explanations of
decisions and predictions. At present, however, evaluation processes are rather
technical and not sufficiently focused on the needs of human users.
Consequently, evaluation studies involving human users can serve as a valuable
guide for conducting user studies. This paper presents a comprehensive review
of 65 user studies evaluating XAI systems across different domains and
application contexts. As a guideline for XAI developers, we provide a holistic
overview of the properties of XAI systems and evaluation metrics focused on
human users (human-centered). We propose objectives for the human-centered
design (design goals) of XAI systems. To incorporate users' specific
characteristics, design goals are adapted to users with different levels of AI
expertise (AI novices and data experts). In this regard, we provide an
extension to existing XAI evaluation and design frameworks. The first part of
our results includes the analysis of XAI system characteristics. An important
finding is the distinction between the core system and the XAI explanation,
which together form the whole system. Further results include the distinction
of evaluation metrics into affection towards the system, cognition, usability,
interpretability, and explanation metrics. Furthermore, the users, along with
their specific characteristics and behavior, can be assessed. For AI novices,
the relevant extended design goals include responsible use, acceptance, and
usability. For data experts, the focus is performance-oriented and includes
human-AI collaboration and system and user task performance.

*Hyunji Min,Sangwon Jung,Junyoung Sung,Dosung Lee,Leekyeung Han,Paul Hongsuck Seo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GOAT: a training framework that auto-generates synthetic, goal-oriented API-task data from API docs to fine-tune open-source LLM agents, enabling multi-step tool use and achieving state-of-the-art on benchmarks, with a new GOATBench benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the data scarcity and performance gap in goal-directed tool use for open-source LLMs by enabling annotation-free, scalable training and evaluation.

Method: Automatically constructs synthetic datasets of goal-oriented API execution tasks directly from API documents, fine-tunes LLMs on these tasks, and evaluates on benchmarks; introduces GOATBench as a new benchmark.

Result: GOAT-trained agents achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple goal-oriented benchmarks and excel on the GOATBench benchmark; demonstrates improved reasoning and tool-use capabilities for open-source LLMs.

Conclusion: GOAT provides a practical path to robust open-source LLM agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use without manual annotation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been extended beyond traditional
text generation to serve as interactive agents capable of using external tools
based on user intent. However, current LLM agents still show limited ability to
handle goal-oriented queries, which require decomposing a high-level objective
into multiple interdependent API calls with correct planning and execution.
Current approaches mainly rely on zero-shot evaluation due to the absence of
training data. While proprietary closed-source models such as GPT-4 demonstrate
strong reasoning abilities, smaller open-source models struggle to perform
complex tool use effectively. Thus, we propose a novel training framework GOAT,
which enables fine-tuning of LLM agents in a human annotation-free setting.
GOAT automatically constructs synthetic datasets of goal-oriented API execution
tasks directly from given API documents, equipping models with the ability to
reason over interdependent calls and generate coherent responses. Through
extensive experiments, we show that GOAT-trained agents achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple existing goal-oriented benchmarks.
In addition, we introduce GOATBench, a new goal-oriented API execution
benchmark, and demonstrate that agents trained with GOAT also excel in this
setting. These results highlight GOAT as a practical path toward building
robust open-source LLM agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use.

*Yuechun Yu,Han Ying,Haoan Jin,Wenjian Jiang,Dong Xian,Binghao Wang,Zhou Yang,Mengyue Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedKGEval introduces a knowledge-graph–driven, turn-level evaluation framework for clinical LLMs that simulates patient dialogue and assesses responses in real time, enabling more realistic multi-turn assessments in bilingual medical settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation of medical LLMs relies on post hoc transcript review, which misses dynamic, context-sensitive dialogue features and evolving patient information needs; there is a need for in-situ, fine-grained, safety-aware evaluation across multi-turn clinical interactions.

Method: 1) A knowledge graph–driven patient simulator with a control module retrieving facts from a curated medical KB to produce realistic, human-like dialogue; 2) an in-situ, turn-level evaluation where a Judge Agent evaluates each model response for clinical appropriateness, factual correctness, and safety using fine-grained, task-specific metrics; 3) benchmarking eight state-of-the-art LLMs, with bilingual extension possible by switching KBs.

Result: The framework enables detection of subtle behavioral flaws and safety risks that conventional pipelines miss; demonstrated across eight LLMs and shown to be adaptable to Chinese and English via knowledge graphs, with potential for broader language/domain expansion.

Conclusion: MedKGEval provides a realistic, scalable evaluation paradigm for clinical LLMs that accounts for evolving informational needs and safety considerations in multi-turn dialogues and supports bilingual, domain-specific deployment.

Abstract: The reliable evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in medical
applications remains an open challenge, particularly in capturing the
complexity of multi-turn doctor-patient interactions that unfold in real
clinical environments. Existing evaluation methods typically rely on post hoc
review of full conversation transcripts, thereby neglecting the dynamic,
context-sensitive nature of medical dialogues and the evolving informational
needs of patients. In this work, we present MedKGEval, a novel multi-turn
evaluation framework for clinical LLMs grounded in structured medical
knowledge. Our approach introduces three key contributions: (1) a knowledge
graph-driven patient simulation mechanism, where a dedicated control module
retrieves relevant medical facts from a curated knowledge graph, thereby
endowing the patient agent with human-like and realistic conversational
behavior. This knowledge graph is constructed by integrating open-source
resources with additional triples extracted from expert-annotated datasets; (2)
an in-situ, turn-level evaluation framework, where each model response is
assessed by a Judge Agent for clinical appropriateness, factual correctness,
and safety as the dialogue progresses using a suite of fine-grained,
task-specific metrics; (3) a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark of eight
state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating MedKGEval's ability to identify subtle
behavioral flaws and safety risks that are often overlooked by conventional
evaluation pipelines. Although initially designed for Chinese and English
medical applications, our framework can be readily extended to additional
languages by switching the input knowledge graphs, ensuring seamless bilingual
support and domain-specific applicability.

*Jingyi Wang,Hongyuan Zhu,Ye Niu,Yunhui Deng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PromptFlow is a modular meta-learning framework for automated prompt engineering that enables gradient-based exploration of prompt refinement with dynamic strategy selection and experience recycling via reinforcement learning, reducing data needs and improving cross-domain LLM adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual prompt design is labor-intensive and brittle across diverse NLP tasks; existing automated PE methods are limited by static strategies, coarse-grained updates, and little reuse of prior experience.

Method: A TensorFlow-inspired modular framework (PromptFlow) that combines meta-prompts, operators, optimization, and evaluators; uses gradient-based meta-learning to autonomously discover prompt refinement trajectories; introduces a reinforcement learning strategy to recycle experience during the PE process.

Result: Empirical evaluations on diverse datasets show that PromptFlow effectively guides prompt refinement, enabling better task adaptation with limited task-specific data and dynamic strategies.

Conclusion: PromptFlow offers a data-efficient, modular approach to automated PE with dynamic strategy search and experience recycling, advancing the practicality of prompting-based LLM adaptation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated profound impact on Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, their effective deployment across
diverse domains often require domain-specific adaptation strategies, as generic
models may underperform when faced with specialized data distributions. Recent
advances in prompt engineering (PE) offer a promising alternative to extensive
retraining by refining input instructions to align LLM outputs with task
objectives. This paradigm has emerged as a rapid and versatile approach for
model fine-tuning. Despite its potential, manual prompt design remains
labor-intensive and heavily depends on specialized expertise, often requiring
iterative human effort to achieve optimal formulations. To address this
limitation, automated prompt engineering methodologies have been developed to
systematically generate task-specific prompts. However, current implementations
predominantly employ static update rules and lack mechanisms for dynamic
strategy selection, resulting in suboptimal adaptation to varying NLP task
requirements. Furthermore, most methods treat and update the whole prompts at
each step, without considering editing prompt sections at a finer granularity.
At last, in particular, the problem of how to recycle experience in LLM is
still underexplored. To this end, we propose the PromptFlow, a modular training
framework inspired by TensorFlow, which integrates meta-prompts, operators,
optimization, and evaluator. Our framework can be equipped with the latest
optimization methods and autonomously explores optimal prompt refinement
trajectories through gradient-based meta-learning, requiring minimal
task-specific training data. Specifically, we devise a reinforcement learning
method to recycle experience for LLM in the PE process. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of
PromptFlow.

*Deyu Zou,Yongqiang Chen,Jianxiang Wang,Haochen Yang,Mufei Li,James Cheng,Pan Li,Yu Gong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: T^3 is a practical method to detect excessive belief deviation in LLM-based active reasoning and truncate training trajectories, preserving informative prefixes to improve policy optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Belief tracking is essential for solving problems via external sources, but LLM agents often drift in beliefs, leading to uninformative or repetitive actions and poor credit assignment during RL training.

Method: Introduce T^3: monitor belief deviation during rollouts; when deviation exceeds a threshold, truncate the remaining trajectory; adjust RL credit to informative prefixes; empirically evaluated on 5 tasks.

Result: T^3 improves training stability, reduces rollout tokens by ~25%, and achieves up to 30% gains in final performance across 5 tasks.

Conclusion: Belief control is a core principle for robust, generalizable LLM-based active reasoners; simple trajectory truncation based on belief deviation is effective.

Abstract: Active reasoning requires large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external sources and strategically gather information to solve problems.
Central to this process is belief tracking: maintaining a coherent
understanding of the problem state and the missing information toward the
solution. However, due to limited reasoning capabilities, LLM-based agents
often suffer from belief deviation: they struggle to correctly model beliefs,
lose track of problem states, and fall into uninformative or repetitive
actions. Once this happens, errors compound and reinforcement learning (RL)
training fails to properly credit the crucial exploratory steps. To address
this issue, we propose to track the deviation of model beliefs and develop
$\mathbf{T^3}$, a simple yet effective method that detects excessive belief
deviation and truncates trajectories during training to remove uninformative
tails. By preserving credit for informative prefixes, $\mathbf{T^3}$
systematically improves policy optimization. Across 5 challenging tasks,
$\mathbf{T^3}$ consistently enhances training stability, token efficiency, and
final performance, achieving up to 30% gains while cutting rollout tokens by
roughly 25%. These results highlight belief control as a key principle for
developing robust and generalizable LLM-based active reasoners.

### [230] [Tensor Logic: The Language of AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12269)
*Pedro Domingos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Tensor logic proposes a unifying language for neural and symbolic AI, with the tensor equation as the sole construct, unifying logical rules and Einstein summation to implement neural, symbolic, and statistical AI (e.g., transformers, reasoning, kernels, graphical models) and enabling sound reasoning in embedding space; aims to improve scalability, learnability, reliability, and transparency for broader AI adoption.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current AI tooling is fragmented: PyTorch/TensorFlow are Python libraries, not AI-native languages; AI-specific languages (LISP/Prolog) lack scalability and learning. A dedicated language that unifies learning and reasoning could enable more robust, scalable, and interpretable AI development.

Method: Introduce tensor logic where the tensor equation is the sole construct. Argue that logical rules and Einstein summation are the same operation. Demonstrate how key neural, symbolic, and statistical AI forms (e.g., transformers, formal reasoning, kernel methods, graphical models) can be implemented within this framework and discuss deriving sound reasoning in embedding space.

Result: A theoretical framework and demonstration sketches for implementing neural, symbolic, and statistical AI within tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines, and graphical models, with the claim that this unification enables scalable, learnable, transparent AI and new directions such as embedding-space reasoning.

Conclusion: Tensor logic could unify neural and symbolic AI at a fundamental level, combining scalability and learnability with transparency and reliability, potentially serving as a broad basis for wider AI adoption.

Abstract: Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the
requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic
differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python,
which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning
and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts
to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack
scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a
language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a
fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation,
based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are
essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how
to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in
tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and
graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible,
such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and
learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of
symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.

*Zirui Guo,Xubin Ren,Lingrui Xu,Jiahao Zhang,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RAG-Anything unifies multimodal retrieval for RAG by dual-graph modeling and cross-modal hybrid retrieval, improving reasoning on long multimodal documents; open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RAG systems are text-only despite multimodal knowledge bases; there is a gap in handling images, tables, math, etc.

Method: Introduce dual-graph construction capturing cross-modal relations and textual semantics; unify representation of multimodal content as interconnected knowledge entities; cross-modal hybrid retrieval combining structural navigation with semantic matching.

Result: Reportedly superior performance on challenging multimodal benchmarks with notable gains over state-of-the-art, especially on long documents.

Conclusion: Proposes a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access; avoids architectural fragmentation; open-source release.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm
for expanding Large Language Models beyond their static training limitations.
However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and
real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are
inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual
elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG
frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when
processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework
that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our
approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge
entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph
construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics
within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that
combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables
effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans
multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on
challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over
state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on
long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a
new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural
fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced

### [232] [O-Forge: An LLM + Computer Algebra Framework for Asymptotic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12350)
*Ayush Khaitan,Vijay Ganesh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A framework LLM+CAS (O-Forge) couples frontier LLMs with a computer algebra system in an In-Context Symbolic Feedback loop to produce creative, symbolically verified proofs of asymptotic inequalities, demonstrating AI-assisted research tools beyond contest math.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the verification bottleneck in AI-assisted mathematics and pursue Tao's idea that AI can help find productive decompositions for hard asymptotic analyses.

Method: Use an LLM to propose domain decompositions; a CAS (e.g., Mathematica) axiomatically verifies each subproblem; an In-Context Symbolic Feedback loop between the LLM and CAS guides proof construction; implemented via the O-Forge tool.

Result: The framework is effective at generating decompositions and providing symbolic verification, enabling answers to whether LLMs with verifiers can prove intricate asymptotic inequalities, and showing AI can function as a tool for professional mathematical research.

Conclusion: LLM+CAS offers reliable, verifiable proofs and moves AI-assisted math from contest scenarios toward professional mathematical practice, with potential for generalization to other areas of mathematics.

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated advanced capabilities in
solving IMO and Putnam problems; yet their role in research mathematics has
remained fairly limited. The key difficulty is verification: suggested proofs
may look plausible, but cannot be trusted without rigorous checking. We present
a framework, called LLM+CAS, and an associated tool, O-Forge, that couples
frontier LLMs with a computer algebra systems (CAS) in an In-Context Symbolic
Feedback loop to produce proofs that are both creative and symbolically
verified. Our focus is on asymptotic inequalities, a topic that often involves
difficult proofs and appropriate decomposition of the domain into the "right"
subdomains. Many mathematicians, including Terry Tao, have suggested that using
AI tools to find the right decompositions can be very useful for research-level
asymptotic analysis. In this paper, we show that our framework LLM+CAS turns
out to be remarkably effective at proposing such decompositions via a
combination of a frontier LLM and a CAS. More precisely, we use an LLM to
suggest domain decomposition, and a CAS (such as Mathematica) that provides a
verification of each piece axiomatically. Using this loop, we answer a question
posed by Terence Tao: whether LLMs coupled with a verifier can be used to help
prove intricate asymptotic inequalities. More broadly, we show how AI can move
beyond contest math towards research-level tools for professional
mathematicians.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A survey and formalization of Vibe Coding with LLMs, introducing a CMDP-based framework, a five-model taxonomy, and emphasis on context engineering and human–agent collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs enable autonomous coding agents but empirical results show productivity losses and suboptimal human-AI collaboration; need a theoretical foundation and practical frameworks for Vibe Coding.

Method: Systematic review of over 1000 papers; formal modeling via Constrained Markov Decision Process; synthesis into five development models; analysis of ecosystem components and feedback mechanisms.

Result: First comprehensive taxonomy of Vibe Coding models; formal CMDP model; practical frameworks and design guidelines emphasizing context engineering, development environments, and collaborative models.

Conclusion: Successful Vibe Coding requires systemic context engineering and effective human–agent collaboration, not just agent capability; this work lays foundational theory and practice for the field.

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm
shift from code generation assistance to autonomous coding agents, enabling a
novel development methodology termed "Vibe Coding" where developers validate
AI-generated implementations through outcome observation rather than
line-by-line code comprehension. Despite its transformative potential, the
effectiveness of this emergent paradigm remains under-explored, with empirical
evidence revealing unexpected productivity losses and fundamental challenges in
human-AI collaboration. To address this gap, this survey provides the first
comprehensive and systematic review of Vibe Coding with large language models,
establishing both theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this
transformative development approach. Drawing from systematic analysis of over
1000 research papers, we survey the entire vibe coding ecosystem, examining
critical infrastructure components including LLMs for coding, LLM-based coding
agent, development environment of coding agent, and feedback mechanisms. We
first introduce Vibe Coding as a formal discipline by formalizing it through a
Constrained Markov Decision Process that captures the dynamic triadic
relationship among human developers, software projects, and coding agents.
Building upon this theoretical foundation, we then synthesize existing
practices into five distinct development models: Unconstrained Automation,
Iterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and
Context-Enhanced Models, thus providing the first comprehensive taxonomy in
this domain. Critically, our analysis reveals that successful Vibe Coding
depends not merely on agent capabilities but on systematic context engineering,
well-established development environments, and human-agent collaborative
development models.

*Yunuo Liu,Dawei Zhu,Zena Al-Khalili,Dai Cheng,Yanjun Chen,Dietrich Klakow,Wei Zhang,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PricingLogic is a benchmark with 300 natural-language questions derived from 42 real pricing policies to test LLMs on complex tourism pricing, revealing reliability gaps, especially for bundled discounts; provides code and data for evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating tourism pricing with LLMs could reduce labor and errors, but mispricing risks financial losses and customer distrust. This benchmark assesses whether LLMs can correctly interpret overlapping fare rules and perform required arithmetic.

Method: Construct 300 NL questions from real pricing policies, spanning two difficulty levels: (i) basic customer-type pricing and (ii) bundled-tour calculations with interacting discounts; evaluate multiple LLMs and analyze rule interpretation and arithmetic performance.

Result: LLMs exhibit a steep performance drop on the harder tier, with systematic failures in rule interpretation and arithmetic reasoning, indicating unreliability for revenue-critical tasks without safeguards or domain adaptation.

Conclusion: Current LLMs are not yet reliable for revenue-critical pricing; the dataset and code enable rigorous benchmarking and can guide development of safeguards, domain adaptation, or specialized models.

Abstract: We present PricingLogic, the first benchmark that probes whether Large
Language Models(LLMs) can reliably automate tourism-related prices when
multiple, overlapping fare rules apply. Travel agencies are eager to offload
this error-prone task onto AI systems; however, deploying LLMs without verified
reliability could result in significant financial losses and erode customer
trust. PricingLogic comprises 300 natural-language questions based on booking
requests derived from 42 real-world pricing policies, spanning two levels of
difficulty: (i) basic customer-type pricing and (ii)bundled-tour calculations
involving interacting discounts. Evaluations of a line of LLMs reveal a steep
performance drop on the harder tier,exposing systematic failures in rule
interpretation and arithmetic reasoning.These results highlight that, despite
their general capabilities, today's LLMs remain unreliable in revenue-critical
applications without further safeguards or domain adaptation. Our code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/PricingLogic.

### [235] [MTOS: A LLM-Driven Multi-topic Opinion Simulation Framework for Exploring Echo Chamber Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12423)
*Dingyi Zuo,Hongjie Zhang,Jie Ou,Chaosheng Feng,Shuwan Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-topic Opinion Simulation (MTOS) uses LLMs with memory to model opinion dynamics across interrelated topics, revealing how topic correlations shape polarization and echo chambers, and demonstrating improved interpretability over numerical models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world networks span multiple interrelated topics, making opinion evolution across topics crucial. Existing LLM-based work is single-topic; traditional numerical models lack interpretability and multi-topic integration. A framework that couples multi-topic contexts with memory-aware agents can better capture cognitive transfer and polarization dynamics.

Method: Introduce MTOS, a framework that combines LLM agents with short-term and long-term memory, multiple user-interaction mechanisms, dynamic topic-selection strategies, and a belief-decay mechanism for cross-topic updates. Conduct extensive experiments varying the number of topics, topic correlations, and performing ablations to assess polarization and local consistency. Compare LLM-based MTOS to traditional numerical models.

Result: Multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively correlated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics suppress them, and irrelevant topics can mitigate echo chambers via resource competition. LLM-based agents better reproduce dynamic opinion changes, linguistic features of news texts, and complex human reasoning than numerical models, improving interpretability and system stability.

Conclusion: Cross-topic interactions are a key driver of polarization. MTOS provides a scalable, interpretable framework for simulating cross-topic opinion dynamics using LLMs with memory, highlighting how topic correlations shape echo chambers and offering a bridge between cognitive realism and tractable simulation.

Abstract: The polarization of opinions, information segregation, and cognitive biases
on social media have attracted significant academic attention. In real-world
networks, information often spans multiple interrelated topics, posing
challenges for opinion evolution and highlighting the need for frameworks that
simulate interactions among topics. Existing studies based on large language
models (LLMs) focus largely on single topics, limiting the capture of cognitive
transfer in multi-topic, cross-domain contexts. Traditional numerical models,
meanwhile, simplify complex linguistic attitudes into discrete values, lacking
interpretability, behavioral consistency, and the ability to integrate multiple
topics. To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation
(MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with
LLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory,
incorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic
topic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable
perspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS,
varying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to
assess features such as group polarization and local consistency. Results show
that multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively
correlated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics inhibit
them, and irrelevant topics also mitigate echo chamber effects through resource
competition. Compared with numerical models, LLM-based agents realistically
simulate dynamic opinion changes, reproduce linguistic features of news texts,
and capture complex human reasoning, improving simulation interpretability and
system stability.

### [236] [Biased-Attention Guided Risk Prediction for Safe Decision-Making at Unsignalized Intersections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12428)
*Chengyang Dong,Nan Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A SAC-based DRL framework with biased attention for unsignalized intersections; uses a traffic risk predictor to generate a dense reward, improving safety and efficiency; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unsignalized intersections pose complex dynamic interactions and high collision risk; proactive safety control is essential for autonomous driving.

Method: A deep reinforcement learning framework built on Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) that uses a biased-attention mechanism to construct a traffic risk predictor. This predictor estimates the long-term collision risk for a vehicle entering the intersection and converts it into a dense reward to guide SAC decisions.

Result: Simulation experiments show improvements in traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at unsignalized intersections, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed intelligent decision-making framework.

Conclusion: Biased-attention-based risk prediction integrated with SAC enhances safety and efficiency in complex intersection scenarios; source code is publicly available.

Abstract: Autonomous driving decision-making at unsignalized intersections is highly
challenging due to complex dynamic interactions and high conflict risks. To
achieve proactive safety control, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) decision-making framework integrated with a biased attention
mechanism. The framework is built upon the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm.
Its core innovation lies in the use of biased attention to construct a traffic
risk predictor. This predictor assesses the long-term risk of collision for a
vehicle entering the intersection and transforms this risk into a dense reward
signal to guide the SAC agent in making safe and efficient driving decisions.
Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively improves both traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at the
intersection, thereby proving the effectiveness of the intelligent
decision-making framework in complex scenarios. The code of our work is
available at https://github.com/hank111525/SAC-RWB.

### [237] [Evaluating and Mitigating LLM-as-a-judge Bias in Communication Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12462)
*Jiaxin Gao,Chen Chen,Yanwen Jia,Xueluan Gong,Kwok-Yan Lam,Qian Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Two LLM-as-a-judge models evaluated for 11 biases under point-wise scoring; robustness to biased inputs; rubric improves robustness; fine-tuning on biased data harms; scores reflect task difficulty; four mitigation strategies proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensure fairness and reliability of AI judging in content evaluation; biases in AI judges can skew outcomes and erode user trust.

Method: Systematic evaluation of GPT-Judge and JudgeLM as judges, across 11 bias types (implicit and explicit) under point-wise scoring; analyze robustness to biased inputs; assess impact of detailed rubric; study effects of fine-tuning on high-scoring biased data; compare datasets GPQA and JudgeLM-val; examine correlation between difficulty and scores; propose mitigations.

Result: Judges show robustness to biased inputs by generally assigning lower scores to biased samples than clean samples; a detailed scoring rubric enhances robustness; fine-tuning on high-scoring yet biased data degrades performance; judged scores correlate with task difficulty (GPQA yields lower average scores; JudgeLM-val higher); four mitigation strategies proposed.

Conclusion: There are actionable steps to mitigate biases in AI judging; adopt explicit scoring rubrics, mindful data curation, and other strategies to ensure fair and reliable evaluation in practical settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to autonomously
evaluate the quality of content in communication systems, e.g., to assess
responses in telecom customer support chatbots. However, the impartiality of
these AI "judges" is not guaranteed, and any biases in their evaluation
criteria could skew outcomes and undermine user trust. In this paper, we
systematically investigate judgment biases in two LLM-as-a-judge models (i.e.,
GPT-Judge and JudgeLM) under the point-wise scoring setting, encompassing 11
types of biases that cover both implicit and explicit forms. We observed that
state-of-the-art LLM judges demonstrate robustness to biased inputs, generally
assigning them lower scores than the corresponding clean samples. Providing a
detailed scoring rubric further enhances this robustness. We further found that
fine-tuning an LLM on high-scoring yet biased responses can significantly
degrade its performance, highlighting the risk of training on biased data. We
also discovered that the judged scores correlate with task difficulty: a
challenging dataset like GPQA yields lower average scores, whereas an
open-ended reasoning dataset (e.g., JudgeLM-val) sees higher average scores.
Finally, we proposed four potential mitigation strategies to ensure fair and
reliable AI judging in practical communication scenarios.

*Rui Reis,Pedro Rangel Henriques,João Ferreira-Coimbra,Eva Oliveira,Nuno F. Rodrigues*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A DAG-based task-oriented medical dialogue framework converts guidelines into a question corpus, supports cold-start and adaptive branching, terminates when enough data is collected, and auto-generates clinician reports; pilot with five physicians shows strong usability and manageable workload, with some latency and sample limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To create an efficient, guideline-driven, interactive clinical interview system that aligns with workflows, reduces cognitive load, and automatically produces structured reports.

Method: A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) dialogue framework with (1) a pipeline converting medical algorithms into a clinical question corpus; (2) a hierarchical-clustering cold-start to generate initial questions without patient data; (3) an expand-and-prune mechanism for adaptive branching/backtracking; (4) termination logic to stop interviews when information is sufficient; (5) automated synthesis of doctor-friendly reports; user interfaces designed with human-computer interaction principles; preliminary evaluation with five physicians using NASA-TLX, SUS, and QUIS.

Result: Patient app achieved NASA-TLX 15.6 (low workload), SUS 86 (high usability), QUIS 8.1/9 (strong satisfaction); strengths in ease of learning and interface design. Physician app showed NASA-TLX 26 (moderate workload), SUS 88.5 (excellent usability), satisfaction 8.3/9. Both apps integrated into clinical workflows, reducing cognitive demand and enabling efficient report generation.

Conclusion: The framework is feasible and usable for guideline-driven clinical interviews with effective workflow integration and automated reporting, but needs validation in larger, more diverse samples and improvements to reduce latency.

Abstract: We developed a task-oriented dialogue framework structured as a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) of medical questions. The system integrates: (1) a
systematic pipeline for transforming medical algorithms and guidelines into a
clinical question corpus; (2) a cold-start mechanism based on hierarchical
clustering to generate efficient initial questioning without prior patient
information; (3) an expand-and-prune mechanism enabling adaptive branching and
backtracking based on patient responses; (4) a termination logic to ensure
interviews end once sufficient information is gathered; and (5) automated
synthesis of doctor-friendly structured reports aligned with clinical
workflows. Human-computer interaction principles guided the design of both the
patient and physician applications. Preliminary evaluation involved five
physicians using standardized instruments: NASA-TLX (cognitive workload), the
System Usability Scale (SUS), and the Questionnaire for User Interface
Satisfaction (QUIS). The patient application achieved low workload scores
(NASA-TLX = 15.6), high usability (SUS = 86), and strong satisfaction (QUIS =
8.1/9), with particularly high ratings for ease of learning and interface
design. The physician application yielded moderate workload (NASA-TLX = 26) and
excellent usability (SUS = 88.5), with satisfaction scores of 8.3/9. Both
applications demonstrated effective integration into clinical workflows,
reducing cognitive demand and supporting efficient report generation.
Limitations included occasional system latency and a small, non-diverse
evaluation sample.

### [239] [Artificial Intelligence Virtual Cells: From Measurements to Decisions across Modality, Scale, Dynamics, and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12498)
*Chengpeng Hu,Calvin Yu-Chian Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Cell-State Latent (CSL) as a model-agnostic framework with an operator grammar to unify multimodal, multiscale cell-state learning, and proposes a cross-dataset, operator-aware evaluation blueprint with leakage-resistant data design and function-space readouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations are often isolated to single datasets; transportability across laboratories and platforms is limited; leakage and coverage biases exist; dose, time, and combination effects are not systematically handled; cross-scale coupling remains weak. A reproducible, operator-aware framework is needed to enable like-for-like comparisons.

Method: Proposes a model-agnostic Cell-State Latent (CSL) perspective organized by an operator grammar: measurement, lift/project for cross-scale coupling, and intervention for dosing/scheduling. Introduces a decision-aligned evaluation blueprint across modality, scale, context, and intervention, emphasizing function-space readouts (pathway activity, spatial neighborhoods, clinically relevant endpoints). Recommends operator-aware data design, leakage-resistant partitions, and transparent calibration/reporting.

Result: A model-agnostic conceptual framework and evaluation blueprint rather than empirical results, providing guidance for designing and assessing multicellular models, datasets, and cross-lab generalization.

Conclusion: Advocates reproducible, like-for-like comparisons and scalable evaluation across modalities and scales; calls for standardized data design, leakage control, and transparent reporting to enable cross-lab reproducibility and clinically relevant readouts.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Virtual Cells (AIVCs) aim to learn executable,
decision-relevant models of cell state from multimodal, multiscale
measurements. Recent studies have introduced single-cell and spatial foundation
models, improved cross-modality alignment, scaled perturbation atlases, and
explored pathway-level readouts. Nevertheless, although held-out validation is
standard practice, evaluations remain predominantly within single datasets and
settings; evidence indicates that transport across laboratories and platforms
is often limited, that some data splits are vulnerable to leakage and coverage
bias, and that dose, time and combination effects are not yet systematically
handled. Cross-scale coupling also remains constrained, as anchors linking
molecular, cellular and tissue levels are sparse, and alignment to scientific
or clinical readouts varies across studies. We propose a model-agnostic
Cell-State Latent (CSL) perspective that organizes learning via an operator
grammar: measurement, lift/project for cross-scale coupling, and intervention
for dosing and scheduling. This view motivates a decision-aligned evaluation
blueprint across modality, scale, context and intervention, and emphasizes
function-space readouts such as pathway activity, spatial neighborhoods and
clinically relevant endpoints. We recommend operator-aware data design,
leakage-resistant partitions, and transparent calibration and reporting to
enable reproducible, like-for-like comparisons.

*Utsav Kumar Nareti,Suraj Kumar,Soumya Pandey,Soumi Chattopadhyay,Chandranath Adak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProtoSiTex is a semi-interpretable framework for fine-grained multi-label text classification that learns adaptive prototypes through a dual-phase training (unsupervised prototype discovery + supervised label mapping) with a hierarchical loss, delivering state-of-the-art performance and human-aligned explanations on sub-sentence to document levels, and introduces a sub-sentence level multi-label hotel reviews dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for interpretable, fine-grained multi-label text classification. Existing prototype-based methods are often coarse (sentence/document level) and single-label, failing to capture overlapping semantics and sub-sentence signals in real-world reviews.

Method: ProtoSiTex uses a dual-phase alternating training: (1) unsupervised prototype discovery to learn diverse, semantically coherent prototypes; (2) supervised phase that maps prototypes to class labels. A hierarchical loss enforces consistency across sub-sentence, sentence, and document levels. It employs adaptive prototypes and multi-head attention to capture overlapping/ conflicting semantics. Additionally, it introduces a sub-sentence level annotated hotel reviews dataset and evaluates on binary and multi-class benchmarks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on the new sub-sentence hotel-review dataset and on two public benchmarks (binary and multi-class) while providing faithful, human-aligned explanations.

Conclusion: ProtoSiTex offers a robust, semi-interpretable approach to fine-grained multi-label text classification, addressing granularity and semantic overlap issues with adaptive prototypes and hierarchical supervision, and introduces a valuable sub-sentence level dataset for evaluation.

Abstract: The surge in user-generated reviews has amplified the need for interpretable
models that can provide fine-grained insights. Existing prototype-based models
offer intuitive explanations but typically operate at coarse granularity
(sentence or document level) and fail to address the multi-label nature of
real-world text classification. We propose ProtoSiTex, a semi-interpretable
framework designed for fine-grained multi-label text classification. ProtoSiTex
employs a dual-phase alternating training strategy: an unsupervised prototype
discovery phase that learns semantically coherent and diverse prototypes, and a
supervised classification phase that maps these prototypes to class labels. A
hierarchical loss function enforces consistency across sub-sentence, sentence,
and document levels, enhancing interpretability and alignment. Unlike prior
approaches, ProtoSiTex captures overlapping and conflicting semantics using
adaptive prototypes and multi-head attention. We also introduce a benchmark
dataset of hotel reviews annotated at the sub-sentence level with multiple
labels. Experiments on this dataset and two public benchmarks (binary and
multi-class) show that ProtoSiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering faithful, human-aligned explanations, establishing it as a robust
solution for semi-interpretable multi-label text classification.

*Andries Rosseau,Raphaël Avalos,Ann Nowé*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A biologically inspired multi-agent RL framework using genotype-based agents and inclusive fitness rewards to study cooperative/competitive dynamics; demonstrates alignment with Hamilton's rule in network Prisoner’s Dilemma and hints at an evolutionary-like autocurriculum.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge biology and AI by modeling inclusive fitness in agents, enabling spectrum of cooperation and non-team-based social dynamics, and exploring emergent strategic intelligence.

Method: Assign genotypes to agents; define rewards via inclusive fitness that accounts for gene sharing; analyze two network Prisoner’s Dilemma games; discuss extensions to spatial-temporal environments, finite resources, evolving populations; discuss possible arms race and autocurriculum.

Result: Social dynamics produced by inclusive fitness rewards align with Hamilton's rule; observed cooperation levels correlate with genetic relatedness; non-binary cooperation possible; demonstration of arms race tendencies and potential non-team-based dynamics.

Conclusion: Incorporating inclusive fitness into multi-agent RL provides a foundation for emergent strategic social intelligence and richer interactions; scalable to more complex and evolving environments, enabling new forms of cooperation and competition.

Abstract: The competitive and cooperative forces of natural selection have driven the
evolution of intelligence for millions of years, culminating in nature's vast
biodiversity and the complexity of human minds. Inspired by this process, we
propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where each agent
is assigned a genotype and where reward functions are modelled after the
concept of inclusive fitness. An agent's genetic material may be shared with
other agents, and our inclusive reward function naturally accounts for this. We
study the resulting social dynamics in two types of network games with
prisoner's dilemmas and find that our results align with well-established
principles from biology, such as Hamilton's rule. Furthermore, we outline how
this framework can extend to more open-ended environments with spatial and
temporal structure, finite resources, and evolving populations. We hypothesize
the emergence of an arms race of strategies, where each new strategy is a
gradual improvement over earlier adaptations of other agents, effectively
producing a multi-agent autocurriculum analogous to biological evolution. In
contrast to the binary team-based structures prevalent in earlier research, our
gene-based reward structure introduces a spectrum of cooperation ranging from
full adversity to full cooperativeness based on genetic similarity, enabling
unique non team-based social dynamics. For example, one agent having a mutual
cooperative relationship with two other agents, while the two other agents
behave adversarially towards each other. We argue that incorporating inclusive
fitness in agents provides a foundation for the emergence of more strategically
advanced and socially intelligent agents.

*Jingcong Liang,Shijun Wan,Xuehai Wu,Siyuan Wang,Yitong Li,Qianglong Chen,Duyu Tang,Zhongyu Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HardcoreLogic introduces a large, multi-game benchmark to probe LRMs' robustness in logical reasoning by applying three transformations (Increased Complexity, Uncommon Elements, Unsolvable Puzzles) to canonical puzzles, revealing that current LRMs rely heavily on memorization and struggle with non-canonical variants; results show performance drops even for top models; the dominant difficulty comes from complexity, with subtle rule variations also challenging; the work exposes reasoning gaps and sets a benchmark for progress in high-level logical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address overfitting/memorization on canonical puzzles and assess whether LRMs can generalize to non-canonical rules and longer-tail logical problems; existing corpora bias models toward canonical formats and fail to test flexible rule application.

Method: Create HardcoreLogic benchmark with >5,000 puzzles across 10 games; systematically transform canonical puzzles along IC, UE, UP axes; evaluate a diverse set of LRMs; perform systematic error analysis on solvable and unsolvable puzzles.

Result: LRMs show significant performance drops, even for models with top scores on existing benchmarks; models rely on memorized stereotypes; increased complexity is the main difficulty, though subtle rule variations also hinder; error analysis highlights gaps in genuine reasoning.

Conclusion: HardcoreLogic reveals current LRMs' limitations in high-level logical reasoning and provides a robust benchmark to drive future improvements in generalization and rule-based reasoning.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
complex tasks, including logical puzzle games that require deriving solutions
satisfying all constraints. However, whether they can flexibly apply
appropriate rules to varying conditions, particularly when faced with
non-canonical game variants, remains an open question. Existing corpora focus
on popular puzzles like 9x9 Sudoku, risking overfitting to canonical formats
and memorization of solution patterns, which can mask deficiencies in
understanding novel rules or adapting strategies to new variants. To address
this, we introduce HardcoreLogic, a challenging benchmark of over 5,000 puzzles
across 10 games, designed to test the robustness of LRMs on the "long-tail" of
logical games. HardcoreLogic systematically transforms canonical puzzles
through three dimensions: Increased Complexity (IC), Uncommon Elements (UE),
and Unsolvable Puzzles (UP), reducing reliance on shortcut memorization.
Evaluations on a diverse set of LRMs reveal significant performance drops, even
for models achieving top scores on existing benchmarks, indicating heavy
reliance on memorized stereotypes. While increased complexity is the dominant
source of difficulty, models also struggle with subtle rule variations that do
not necessarily increase puzzle difficulty. Our systematic error analysis on
solvable and unsolvable puzzles further highlights gaps in genuine reasoning.
Overall, HardcoreLogic exposes the limitations of current LRMs and establishes
a benchmark for advancing high-level logical reasoning.

### [243] [Memory as Action: Autonomous Context Curation for Long-Horizon Agentic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12635)
*Yuxiang Zhang,Jiangming Shu,Ye Ma,Xueyuan Lin,Shangxi Wu,Jitao Sang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Reframes memory management in LLMs as a learnable intrinsic capability, introducing Memory-as-Action where memory editing is part of the policy, and Dynamic Context Policy Optimization to handle non-prefix trajectory fractures, achieving end-to-end RL that improves task performance while reducing computation through adaptive context curation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with long-horizon, agentic tasks due to limited working-memory and distraction from irrelevant context. Existing memory modules rely on external heuristics and are decoupled from policy. A unified, learnable memory management mechanism could improve efficiency and performance.

Method: Proposes Memory-as-Action: an agent edits its working memory via explicit actions as part of a single policy, trained by reinforcement learning under resource constraints. Introduces Dynamic Context Policy Optimization (DCPO): segments trajectories at memory-edit points and applies trajectory-level advantages to segments to address trajectory fractures caused by non-prefix editing, enabling stable end-to-end RL.

Result: End-to-end optimization of task reasoning and memory management reduces overall computation and improves task performance, driven by adaptive context curation strategies tuned to the model’s intrinsic capabilities.

Conclusion: Treating memory management as an actionable, learnable policy component and segmenting trajectories around memory edits enables stable RL and efficient reasoning in long-horizon tasks, with benefits in both performance and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Large Language Models face challenges in long-horizon agentic tasks as their
constrained memory is easily overwhelmed by distracting or irrelevant context.
Existing working memory methods typically rely on external, heuristic
mechanisms that are decoupled from the agent's core policy. In this work, we
reframe working memory management as a learnable, intrinsic capability. We
propose a novel framework, Memory-as-Action, where an agent actively manages
its working memory by executing explicit editing operations as part of a
unified policy. This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement
learning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under
given resource constraints. However, such memory editing actions break the
standard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions,
leading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt
the causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making
those methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm,
Dynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end
reinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and
applying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments. Our
results demonstrate that jointly optimizing for task reasoning and memory
management in an end-to-end fashion not only reduces overall computational
consumption but also improves task performance, driven by adaptive context
curation strategies tailored to the model's intrinsic capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ERA is a two-stage embodied AI framework that combines three priors with online RL to create scalable agents. Stage 1 distills Embodied Priors (Trajectory-Augmented, Environment-Anchored, External Knowledge) and Stage 2 uses online RL with self-summarization, dense rewards, and turn-level policy updates. It achieves notable gains over GPT-4o on EB-ALFRED and EB-Manipulation and generalizes to unseen tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the performance gap between large, costly vision-language models and smaller, efficient VLMs by leveraging structured priors and online RL to enable embodied perception, reasoning, and control.

Method: Stage 1 Embodied Prior Learning: integrate three priors—Trajectory-Augmented Priors (enhanced reasoning from stronger models on trajectory data), Environment-Anchored Priors (in-environment grounding and supervision), External Knowledge Priors (transfer from out-of-environment datasets). Stage 2 Online RL: self-summarization for context, dense reward shaping, and turn-level policy optimization to handle long horizons, sparse rewards, and instability. Evaluation on EB-ALFRED (high-level planning) and EB-Manipulation (low-level control).

Result: ERA-3B outperforms prompting-based large models and previous training-based baselines, achieving 8.4% improvement on EB-ALFRED and 19.4% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, with strong generalization to unseen tasks.

Conclusion: ERA provides a practical path toward scalable embodied intelligence and offers methodological insights for future embodied AI systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in embodied AI highlight the potential of vision language
models (VLMs) as agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in
complex environments. However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale
models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary
knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present
\textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates
prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first
stage, \textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from
three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing
trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2)
Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and
grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer
general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we
develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance
agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including
long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key
designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and
turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level
planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate
that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous
training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of
8.4\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits
strong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path
toward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for
future embodied AI systems.

### [245] [Multi-Agent Debate for LLM Judges with Adaptive Stability Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12697)
*Tianyu Hu,Zhen Tan,Song Wang,Huaizhi Qu,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Multi-agent debate judge framework for LLM-based judgments; uses iterative debate to outperform static ensembles; adds a stability-detection mechanism with a time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture and KS-based adaptive stopping; empirical results show higher accuracy with maintained efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current aggregation methods (e.g., majority vote) can fail even when individual agents are correct; there is a need for collaborative reasoning and efficient consensus mechanisms to improve automated judgments.

Method: Formally model and analyze a multi-agent debate process where agents iteratively refine responses; prove that debate amplifies correctness relative to static ensembles; implement a stability detector using a time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture; employ adaptive stopping based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution similarity; validate on multiple benchmarks and models.

Result: Framework achieves higher judgment accuracy than majority voting while preserving computational efficiency across several benchmarks and model families.

Conclusion: A debate-based judging framework with an adaptive, distribution-aware stopping criterion provides a principled and efficient path to improved automated judgments, with theoretical backing and empirical validation; future work could explore scalability, alternative stopping criteria, and broader task domains.

Abstract: With advancements in reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
increasingly employed for automated judgment tasks. While LLMs-as-Judges offer
promise in automating evaluations, current approaches often rely on simplistic
aggregation methods (e.g., majority voting), which can fail even when
individual agents provide correct answers. To address this, we propose a
multi-agent debate judge framework where agents collaboratively reason and
iteratively refine their responses. We formalize the debate process
mathematically, analyzing agent interactions and proving that debate amplifies
correctness compared to static ensembles. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a
stability detection mechanism that models judge consensus dynamics via a
time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture, with adaptive stopping based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This mechanism models the
judges' collective correct rate dynamics using a time-varying mixture of
Beta-Binomial distributions and employs an adaptive stopping criterion based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic). Experiments across
multiple benchmarks and models demonstrate that our framework improves judgment
accuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency.

*Mattia Grasselli,Angelo Porrello,Carlo Augusto Grazia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAMNet: a graph neural network that uses Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) for vehicle trajectory prediction, showing promise but with limitations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome sensor occlusion and enhance situational awareness in autonomous driving by leveraging V2V CAM data for forecasting trajectories.

Method: Designed and trained CAMNet, a graph neural network, on a standard motion forecasting dataset; evaluated on a CAM-derived dataset created in-house.

Result: CAMNet achieved promising trajectory prediction performance, indicating CAM data can support forecasting when fused with learned structures.

Conclusion: CAM data is valuable for trajectory forecasting, but the approach has limitations and invites further research to improve robustness, generalization, and data quality.

Abstract: Autonomous driving remains a challenging task, particularly due to safety
concerns. Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as
LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these
sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be
obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this
context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables
cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are
occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness
Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle
trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network,
Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely
used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset
that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to
assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach
demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle
trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the
approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.

*Wissam Salhab,Darine Ameyed,Hamid Mcheick,Fehmi Jaafar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Unsupervised OOD detection using self-supervised representation learning and graph-theoretic techniques; achieves AUROC 0.99 without labeled data, improving AI robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robustness under distribution shifts (OOD, adversarial, environmental changes) is critical for safety-critical AI systems; reducing dependence on labeled data can enhance deployment scalability.

Method: Leverages self-supervised learning to extract meaningful representations from unlabeled data, then applies graph-theoretical techniques to identify and categorize OOD samples, enabling efficient, label-free detection.

Result: Outperforms existing methods, achieving AUROC of 0.99 on evaluation, demonstrating strong unsupervised OOD detection performance.

Conclusion: The combination of self-supervision and graph-based reasoning provides an effective path to robust, label-free OOD detection, contributing to safer AI systems.

Abstract: Robustness in AI systems refers to their ability to maintain reliable and
accurate performance under various conditions, including out-of-distribution
(OOD) samples, adversarial attacks, and environmental changes. This is crucial
in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, transportation, or
healthcare, where malfunctions could have severe consequences. This paper
proposes an approach to improve OOD detection without the need of labeled data,
thereby increasing the AI systems' robustness. The proposed approach leverages
the principles of self-supervised learning, allowing the model to learn useful
representations from unlabeled data. Combined with graph-theoretical
techniques, this enables the more efficient identification and categorization
of OOD samples. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, this approach
achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) =
0.99.

*Myles Foley,Sergio Maffeis,Muhammad Fakhrur Rozi,Takeshi Takahashi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLUTCH is a deep combinatorial bandit for JavaScript fuzzing that handles variable-length test cases with attention and adaptive exploration, improving mutation targeting and coverage while reducing regret.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve mutation-target selection in fuzzing JavaScript engines; existing fuzzers rely on random mutations and struggle with a volatile combinatorial action space.

Method: Introduces CLUTCH, a deep combinatorial bandit with an attention mechanism to process variable-length test case representations and Concrete Dropout for dynamic exploration; evaluated against three baselines.

Result: Outperforms baselines by increasing the number of valid test cases by 20.3% and coverage-per-testcase by 8.9% on average; in volatile and combinatorial settings, achieves at least 78.1% and 4.1% less regret, respectively.

Conclusion: CLUTCH is effective for volatile, combinatorial fuzzing of JavaScript engines, delivering higher-quality test cases and coverage with adaptive exploration.

Abstract: JavaScript engines are widely used in web browsers, PDF readers, and
server-side applications. The rise in concern over their security has led to
the development of several targeted fuzzing techniques. However, existing
approaches use random selection to determine where to perform mutations in
JavaScript code. We postulate that the problem of selecting better mutation
targets is suitable for combinatorial bandits with a volatile number of arms.
Thus, we propose CLUTCH, a novel deep combinatorial bandit that can observe
variable length JavaScript test case representations, using an attention
mechanism from deep learning. Furthermore, using Concrete Dropout, CLUTCH can
dynamically adapt its exploration. We show that CLUTCH increases efficiency in
JavaScript fuzzing compared to three state-of-the-art solutions by increasing
the number of valid test cases and coverage-per-testcase by, respectively,
20.3% and 8.9% on average. In volatile and combinatorial settings we show that
CLUTCH outperforms state-of-the-art bandits, achieving at least 78.1% and 4.1%
less regret in volatile and combinatorial settings, respectively.

### [249] [CTRL-Rec: Controlling Recommender Systems With Natural Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12742)
*Micah Carroll,Adeline Foote,Kevin Feng,Marcus Williams,Anca Dragan,W. Bradley Knox,Smitha Milli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CTRL-Rec enables real-time natural-language control of traditional recommender systems by training embeddings to predict user approvals of items given language requests; uses a single LLM embedding at deployment; validated on MovieLens and a Letterboxd user study, showing fine-grained control and higher perceived control/satisfaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Users lack fine-grained, intuitive controls for recommendations; LLM-guided requests offer natural-language levers; need efficient integration for real-time use.

Method: During training, use an LLM to simulate user approval of items given text requests; train item/user/embedding models to approximate these judgments; integrate into standard weighting of recommender signals; at deployment, compute a single LLM embedding per request for real-time control.

Result: On MovieLens, achieved fine-grained control across diverse requests; in a 19-participant Letterboxd study, users perceived CTRL-Rec positively and reported greater sense of control and satisfaction vs traditional controls.

Conclusion: CTRL-Rec provides a computationally efficient mechanism to inject user-language preferences into recommender systems in real time, improving user perceived control and satisfaction, with empirical validation.

Abstract: When users are dissatisfied with recommendations from a recommender system,
they often lack fine-grained controls for changing them. Large language models
(LLMs) offer a solution by allowing users to guide their recommendations
through natural language requests (e.g., "I want to see respectful posts with a
different perspective than mine"). We propose a method, CTRL-Rec, that allows
for natural language control of traditional recommender systems in real-time
with computational efficiency. Specifically, at training time, we use an LLM to
simulate whether users would approve of items based on their language requests,
and we train embedding models that approximate such simulated judgments. We
then integrate these user-request-based predictions into the standard weighting
of signals that traditional recommender systems optimize. At deployment time,
we require only a single LLM embedding computation per user request, allowing
for real-time control of recommendations. In experiments with the MovieLens
dataset, our method consistently allows for fine-grained control across a
diversity of requests. In a study with 19 Letterboxd users, we find that
CTRL-Rec was positively received by users and significantly enhanced users'
sense of control and satisfaction with recommendations compared to traditional
controls.

*Marco Del Tredici,Jacob McCarran,Benjamin Breen,Javier Aspuru Mijares,Weichen Winston Yin,Jacob M. Taylor,Frank Koppens,Dirk Englund*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Ax-Prover is a tool-based, agentive prover for Lean that combines LLM reasoning with Lean tooling via MCP to autonomously and collaboratively solve problems across domains; it performs competitively with frontier provers and excels on new benchmarks, with a practical use case in cryptography.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for generalizable formal verification across diverse scientific domains. Domain-specific provers struggle to generalize; integrating LLM-based reasoning with formal proof systems (Lean) via a disciplined interface (MCP) can enable broader applicability and reliability.

Method: A multi-agent system that augments Large Language Models with Lean tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to generate formal proofs. The prover operates autonomously or in collaboration with humans. Evaluation benchmarks include two public math datasets and two new Lean benchmarks in abstract algebra and quantum theory; comparisons are made against frontier LLMs and specialized prover models. A practical use case demonstrates formalizing a cryptography theorem.

Result: Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art provers on public datasets and largely outperforms them on the newly introduced benchmarks, illustrating strong generalization beyond specialized systems. The work also demonstrates practical assistive use by an expert mathematician in formalizing a complex cryptography proof.

Conclusion: A tool-based, agentic theorem proving approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal verification across diverse scientific domains, enabling autonomous and collaborative problem solving with humans and showing promise for broad applicability beyond domain-specific provers.

Abstract: We present Ax-Prover, a multi-agent system for automated theorem proving in
Lean that can solve problems across diverse scientific domains and operate
either autonomously or collaboratively with human experts. To achieve this,
Ax-Prover approaches scientific problem solving through formal proof
generation, a process that demands both creative reasoning and strict syntactic
rigor. Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models
(LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its
performance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier
LLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two
Lean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum
theory. On public datasets, Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art
provers, while it largely outperform them on the new benchmarks. This shows
that, unlike specialized systems that struggle to generalize, our tool-based
agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal
verification across diverse scientific domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate
Ax-Prover's assistant capabilities in a practical use case, showing how it
enabled an expert mathematician to formalize the proof of a complex
cryptography theorem.
