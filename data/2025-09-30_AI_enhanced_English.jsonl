Existing I2V methods concatenate the full\ninformation of the conditional image with noisy latents to achieve high\nfidelity. However, the denoisers in these methods tend to shortcut the\nconditional image, which is known as conditional image leakage, leading to\nperformance degradation issues such as slow motion and color inconsistency. In\nthis work, we further clarify that conditional image leakage leads to\noverfitting to in-domain data and decreases the performance in out-of-domain\nscenarios. Moreover, we introduce Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting I2V, named\nFlashI2V, to prevent conditional image leakage. Concretely, FlashI2V consists\nof: (1) Latent Shifting. We modify the source and target distributions of flow\nmatching by subtracting the conditional image information from the noisy\nlatents, thereby incorporating the condition implicitly. (2) Fourier Guidance.\nWe use high-frequency magnitude features obtained by the Fourier Transform to\naccelerate convergence and enable the adjustment of detail levels in the\ngenerated video. Experimental results show that our method effectively\novercomes conditional image leakage and achieves the best generalization and\nperformance on out-of-domain data among various I2V paradigms.
