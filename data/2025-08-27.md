### [1] [Towards Training-Free Underwater 3D Object Detection from Sonar Point Clouds: A Comparison of Traditional and Deep Learning Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18293)
*M. Salman Shaukat,Yannik Käckenmeister,Sebastian Bader,Thomas Kirste*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two training-free pathways for underwater 3D detection: a physics-based synthetic pipeline for neural networks and a training-free template-matching system; neural nets hit domain-shift in real sonar data, while template matching remains robust without training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater sonar data are scarce and expensive to annotate; deep learning requires large labeled datasets. A training-free approach could enable reliable detection for AUV navigation and marine applications in data-scarce environments.

Method: 1) Physics-based sonar simulation to generate synthetic training data for state-of-the-art neural networks. 2) A model-based template matching system that uses geometric priors of target objects for detection without training.

Result: Neural networks trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mAP on simulated scenes but only 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift. The template-matching approach achieves 83% mAP on real data with no training. The work also presents the first large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection.

Conclusion: Training-free approaches can outperform data-hungry deep learning in data-scarce underwater settings, showcasing robustness to acoustic noise and environmental variation. However, domain shift remains a challenge for synthetic-to-real transfer in neural networks. The template-based method suggests a viable, training-free alternative, and the work establishes a baseline benchmark for this problem.

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

### [2] [MobileDenseAttn:A Dual-Stream Architecture for Accurate and Interpretable Brain Tumor Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18294)
*Shudipta Banik,Muna Das,Trapa Banik,Md. Ehsanul Haque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-stream fusion CNN (MobileDenseAttn) combining MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 achieves high accuracy on MRI brain tumor classification with GradCAM-based interpretability and faster training than a VGG11-based baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limited generalization, computational inefficiency, lack of interpretability, and opaque trust in existing brain tumor MRI classifiers; develop a fast, accurate, and interpretable model with visual explanations.

Method: Dual-stream fusion of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 with feature-level fusion (MobileDenseAttn). Trained on an augmented MRI dataset (6,020 scans) including glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and normal samples. Evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation. Interpretability provided via GradCAM. Compared with baseline models (VGG19, DenseNet201, MobileNetV2).

Result: Training accuracy 99.75%; testing accuracy 98.35%; F1 score 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). +3.67% accuracy over baselines; 39.3% faster training time than VGG19. GradCAM heatmaps localize tumor areas, supporting interpretability. Robust validation suggests stability and potential clinical applicability.

Conclusion: MobileDenseAttn is an efficient, high-performance, and interpretable brain tumor classifier for MRI, with strong potential for real-world clinical use due to improved accuracy, reduced training time, and transparent explanations.

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

### [3] [Can VLMs Recall Factual Associations From Visual References?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18297)
*Dhananjay Ashok,Ashutosh Chaubey,Hirona J. Arai,Jonathan May,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs struggle to link visual references to factual knowledge; internal-state probes can detect failures with high accuracy, enabling selective prediction that improves VQA coverage and reduces error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To diagnose and address multimodal grounding deficiencies in Vision-Language Models, specifically the gap between textual knowledge and image-based representations, and to develop non-retraining probes for reliability.

Method: A controlled study comparing textual vs visual references for recalling factual associations, analysis of model internal states to identify failure patterns, development of probes that predict unreliability without retraining, and evaluation on a visual question answering task with selective prediction.

Result: Visual references halve factual recall; distinct internal-state patterns correlate with failures; probes achieve over 92% accuracy in flagging unreliable responses; using probes for selective prediction increases coverage by 7.87% (absolute) and reduces error by 0.9% (absolute).

Conclusion: Addressing the systematic, detectable deficiency is important; the work provides actionable directions and probes for diagnosing and mitigating multimodal grounding gaps without retraining.

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

### [4] [SERES: Semantic-aware neural reconstruction from sparse views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18314)
*Bo Xu,Yuhu Guo,Yuchao Wang,Wenting Wang,Yeung Yam,Charlie C. L. Wang,Xinyi Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semantic-aware neural implicit reconstruction with patch-based semantic logits and primitive-mask regularization improves sparse-view 3D reconstruction, achieving large Chamfer-distance reductions on DTU and substantial gains when used as a plugin for NeuS/Neuralangelo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-view radiance ambiguity and feature mismatch hinder accurate 3D reconstruction. Semantics and geometric priors can guide the implicit representation to produce higher fidelity models.

Method: Extend neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are jointly optimized with the signed-distance field and radiance field; introduce a regularization term based on geometric primitive masks to reduce shape ambiguity.

Result: On DTU, Chamfer distance decreases by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When used as a plugin for dense baselines, average DTU error reduces by 69% (NeuS) and 68% (Neuralangelo).

Conclusion: Semantic priors and primitive-mask regularization effectively mitigate radiance and shape ambiguities in sparse-view reconstruction and can enhance existing dense-reconstruction pipelines.

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

### [5] [Automated Landfill Detection Using Deep Learning: A Comparative Study of Lightweight and Custom Architectures with the AerialWaste Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18315)
*Nowshin Sharmily,Rusab Sarmun,Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury,Mir Hamidul Hussain,Saad Bin Abul Kashem,Molla E Majid,Amith Khandakar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight ensemble of CNNs on the AerialWaste dataset detects illegal landfills with ~92% metrics, addressing overfitting and dataset quality concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To automate illegal landfill detection while overcoming data scarcity and reducing overfitting by using lightweight models, given public dataset availability and high stakes for environmental health.

Method: Evaluated lightweight architectures (MobileNetV2, GoogLeNet, DenseNet, MobileViT, etc.) on the AerialWaste dataset (10,434 images from Lombardy from AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, Google Earth). Found heavy models overfit; built an ensemble/fusion model of top performers for binary landfill vs non-landfill classification.

Result: Binary classification accuracy 92.33%; precision 92.67%; sensitivity 92.33%; F1 92.41%; specificity 92.71%.

Conclusion: Lightweight models with ensemble fusion can achieve strong generalization on this task; dataset quality matters; scalable automated landfill detection is feasible with reduced risk of overfitting.

Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the
world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%
precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

### [6] [Structures Meet Semantics: Multimodal Fusion via Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18322)
*Jiangfeng Sun,Sihao He,Zhonghong Ou,Meina Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU) for multimodal sentiment analysis that fuses text, audio, and video via modality-specific graphs, a semantic anchor for cross-modal alignment, and multiview contrastive learning; achieves state-of-the-art performance with efficiency gains on CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI and enhanced interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, which harms quality, interpretability, and robustness in multimodal sentiment analysis.

Method: Dynamically construct modality-specific graphs: for text via linguistic syntax; for acoustic and visual modalities via lightweight, text-guided attention. Introduce a semantic anchor derived from global textual semantics as a cross-modal alignment hub. Employ a multiview contrastive learning objective to promote discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence across intra- and inter-modal views.

Result: SSU consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to prior methods. Qualitative analyses corroborate improved interpretability and the ability to capture nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

Conclusion: SSU offers an effective and efficient framework for structurally and semantically grounded multimodal fusion in sentiment analysis, enhancing performance, robustness, and interpretability across modalities.

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by
effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite
notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect
modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

### [7] [FastAvatar: Instant 3D Gaussian Splatting for Faces from Single Unconstrained Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18389)
*Hao Liang,Zhixuan Ge,Ashish Tiwari,Soumendu Majee,G. M. Dilshan Godaliyadda,Ashok Veeraraghavan,Guha Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastAvatar enables pose-invariant, ultra-fast 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) face reconstruction from a single image by predicting residuals over a precomputed template via an encoder-decoder that preserves identity, achieving near-instant (<10 ms) inference and real-time attribute editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome slow optimization-based 3DGS methods and lack of pose-invariant, identity-preserving fast inference for photorealistic avatar creation from single-view images.

Method: Construct a multi-view 3DGS face template from a dataset. Train an encoder-decoder to produce an identity-specific, pose-invariant latent embedding and decode it to predict residuals for the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the template. Inference is feed-forward by predicting residuals only, enabling fast, robust fitting. The framework supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing.

Result: Outperforms existing feed-forward 3DGS methods in reconstruction quality (e.g., GAGAvatar). Inference is ~1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars, GASP). Enables real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing not possible with prior feed-forward 3DGS approaches.

Conclusion: FastAvatar combines high-quality reconstruction with extreme speed, broadening 3DGS applicability to consumer and interactive avatar systems and enabling real-time identity manipulation and editing.

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

### [8] [Securing Face and Fingerprint Templates in Humanitarian Biometric Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18415)
*Giuseppe Stragapede,Sam Merrick,Vedrana Krivokuća Hahn,Justin Sukaitis,Vincent Graf Narbel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a mobile biometric system with a privacy-preserving biometric template protection (BTP) scheme for humanitarian/emergency contexts, identifying PolyProtect as the most suitable BTP for neural-face embeddings, and evaluating it on face (EdgeFace) and fingerprints; results show promising verification/identification performance with irreversibility and unlinkability, with code release planned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable biometric-enabled humanitarian operations while protecting vulnerable data subjects, addressing privacy risks in field deployments; to compare BTP options and identify a lightweight, effective solution capable of cross-modality extension.

Method: Formulate functional, operational, and privacy requirements for humanitarian contexts; conduct a broad comparative analysis of BTP schemes; select PolyProtect for its modularity and efficiency; apply PolyProtect to face embeddings from EdgeFace on a real-world Ethiopian humanitarian dataset; evaluate verification/identification accuracy, irreversibility, and unlinkability; extend evaluation to fingerprints to test modality independence; report findings and plan code release.

Result: PolyProtect emerges as the most suitable BTP for neural embeddings due to effectiveness, modularity, and low computational burden. Evaluations on face embeddings (EdgeFace) show favorable verification and identification performance with strong irreversibility and unlinkability properties. The approach is extended to fingerprints, marking the first evaluation of PolyProtect in identification scenarios and for fingerprint biometrics. Experimental results are promising, and code release is planned.

Conclusion: PolyProtect is a promising privacy-preserving BTP for humanitarian emergency biometrics, capable of protecting subjects while supporting recognition tasks; its reported modality-independence and favorable performance motivate further real-world deployment and broader cross-modality validation; code release is anticipated to enable reproducibility.

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

### [9] [Why Relational Graphs Will Save the Next Generation of Vision Foundation Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18421)
*Fatemeh Ziaeetabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid vision foundation models should incorporate dynamic, input-driven relational graphs to enable explicit relational reasoning, improving accuracy, robustness, efficiency, and interpretability in structured vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision foundation models excel at broad representations from large multimodal data but struggle with explicit reasoning about entities, roles, dynamics, and spatial-temporal relations. This limits performance in fine-grained activity recognition, egocentric understanding, and multimodal medical imaging where relational structure matters.

Method: Propose augmenting vision FMs with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules that construct dynamic graphs (topology and edge semantics inferred from input and task context). Demonstrate cross-domain evidence from human manipulation action recognition and brain tumor segmentation to validate the approach.

Result: Augmenting FMs with dynamic graph reasoning yields improved fine-grained semantic fidelity, better out-of-distribution robustness, enhanced interpretability, and greater computational efficiency compared with FM-only baselines. Sparse, node-centric reasoning improves memory and hardware efficiency, aiding deployment under resource constraints.

Conclusion: Outlines a research agenda for FM-graph hybrids, emphasizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level relational reasoning (e.g., part-object-scene in activity understanding or region-organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols that directly test relational competence in structured vision tasks.

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

### [10] [LPLC: A Dataset for License Plate Legibility Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18425)
*Lucas Wojcik,Gabriel E. Lima,Valfride Nascimento,Eduil Nascimento Jr.,Rayson Laroca,David Menotti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces the LPLC dataset for LP legibility classification and benchmarks SR/recognition needs; baseline models achieve sub-80% F1, underscoring difficulty and need for further research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ALPR struggles with illegible plates even with super-resolution; selective preprocessing could boost efficiency. A fine-grained, publicly available dataset is provided to standardize legibility assessment and spur methods that decide when SR or other processing is warranted.

Method: Collected 10,210 vehicle images with 12,687 annotated license plates. Annotated with occlusions, legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, illegible), and character labels for legible LPs. Established a benchmark classification task using three networks to decide if an LP image is good enough, needs SR, or is unrecoverable. Evaluated with F1 scores.

Result: All three baselines (ViT, ResNet, YOLO) yielded F1 scores below 0.8 across the legibility categories, indicating the task remains challenging. The dataset and analyses imply SR/recognition methods alone are insufficient and more effective strategies are needed.

Conclusion: The LPLC dataset provides a valuable resource to drive research on selective pre-processing for ALPR. The results underscore the complexity of legibility assessment and motivate further work, potentially combining recognition with SR and other pre-processing techniques.

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at
https://github.com/lmlwojcik/lplc-dataset.

### [11] [CLARIFY: A Specialist-Generalist Framework for Accurate and Lightweight Dermatological Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18430)
*Aranya Saha,Tanvir Ahmed Khan,Ismam Nur Swapnil,Mohammad Ariful Haque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Specialist-Generalist framework (CLARIFY) for dermatology VQA combining a fast, domain-specific image classifier (Specialist) with a compressed conversational VLM (Generalist), guided reasoning by the Specialist and grounded by a knowledge graph; achieves higher accuracy with lower compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of general-purpose VLMs in medical tasks and reduce inference costs for practical clinical deployment.

Method: A hierarchical system where the Specialist provides predictions to guide the Generalist's reasoning; a knowledge-graph retrieval module grounds responses; tested on a curated multimodal dermatology dataset.

Result: 18% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline (fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM); VRAM reduced by at least 20% and latency by at least 5%.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that a Specialist-Generalist design yields a lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI system for dermatology VQA.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a
fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM
requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results
indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful
paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI
systems.

Conclusion: The FIQA challenge advances practical FIQA approaches and provides guidance on model design under strict resource constraints; results inform future FIQA methods for real-world applications.

Abstract: Face images play a crucial role in numerous applications; however, real-world
conditions frequently introduce degradations such as noise, blur, and
compression artifacts, affecting overall image quality and hindering subsequent
tasks. To address this challenge, we organized the VQualA 2025 Challenge on
Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) as part of the ICCV 2025 Workshops.
Participants created lightweight and efficient models (limited to 0.5 GFLOPs
and 5 million parameters) for the prediction of Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) on
face images with arbitrary resolutions and realistic degradations. Submissions
underwent comprehensive evaluations through correlation metrics on a dataset of
in-the-wild face images. This challenge attracted 127 participants, with 1519
final submissions. This report summarizes the methodologies and findings for
advancing the development of practical FIQA approaches.

### [13] [Context-Aware Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection in Surveillance Using Contrastive and Predictive Spatiotemporal Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18463)
*Md. Rashid Shahriar Khan,Md. Abrar Hasan,Mohammod Tareq Aziz Justice*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework for surveillance that fuses TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal and semantic context, with a context-gating mechanism and joint training; claims zero-shot generalization to unseen anomalies; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomalies in surveillance are inherently unpredictable and context-dependent, making supervised anomaly detection difficult. A zero-shot approach leveraging temporal prediction and semantic understanding aims to generalize to unseen events in complex environments.

Method: A hybrid architecture: TimeSformer as the visual backbone to extract spatiotemporal features; DPC to forecast future representations for temporal anomaly detection; CLIP-based semantic stream with context-specific text prompts for concept-level anomaly detection; joint training using InfoNCE and CPC losses to align visual, temporal, and semantic representations; a context-gating mechanism modulates decisions via scene cues or global video features.

Result: The framework is proposed to generalize to unseen behaviors by integrating predictive temporal modeling with vision-language understanding; a code release is provided for replication.

Conclusion: The study posits that bridging temporal reasoning and semantic context enables effective zero-shot anomaly detection in surveillance, addressing the challenge of unpredictable, context-dependent anomalies.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has
been made available at

### [14] [DoGFlow: Self-Supervised LiDAR Scene Flow via Cross-Modal Doppler Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18506)
*Ajinkya Khoche,Qingwen Zhang,Yixi Cai,Sina Sharif Mansouri,Patric Jensfelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoGFlow is a self-supervised framework for LiDAR scene flow that uses 4D radar Doppler to generate pseudo-labels and cross-modal transfer to LiDAR, achieving near-supervised performance with 10% labeled data on MAN TruckScenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The creation of large-scale ground-truth 3D scene flow datasets is expensive and limits robust perception; self-supervised methods underperform supervised approaches, especially in long-range or adverse conditions, and supervision scales poorly due to labeling costs. A cross-modal setup aiming to leverage cheap radar cues can improve data efficiency and performance.

Method: Cross-modal label transfer: compute motion pseudo-labels in real-time from 4D radar Doppler measurements and transfer them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware association and ambiguity-resolved propagation; train LiDAR backbones using these pseudo-labels without requiring manual ground-truth annotations.

Result: On the MAN TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised methods and enables LiDAR backbones to reach over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground-truth data.

Conclusion: Radar-to-LiDAR cross-modal pseudo-label transfer is effective for self-supervised 3D scene flow; it improves data efficiency and robustness, enabling scalable learning without manual annotations.

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth
annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where
DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised
methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve
over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth
data. For more details, please visit https://ajinkyakhoche.github.io/DogFlow/

### [15] [SAT-SKYLINES: 3D Building Generation from Satellite Imagery and Coarse Geometric Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18531)
*Zhangyu Jin,Andrew Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A method to convert noisy coarse priors into detailed 3D building geometries from satellite imagery, combined with a large-scale 50k asset dataset (Skylines-50K), achieving strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Top-down satellite imagery lacks geometric guidance for accurate building geometry; existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle without priors, and voxel-based detailization methods require highly detailed inputs and fail with simple priors like cuboids.

Method: Model the transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries to enable flexible geometric control at no extra computational cost; introduces Skylines-50K, a dataset of 50k stylized 3D building assets to support generation of detailed models.

Result: Extensive evaluations demonstrate effectiveness and strong generalization to unseen data.

Conclusion: SatSkylines provides a geometry-guided 3D building generation framework that leverages satellite imagery and coarse priors, backed by a large 50k asset dataset to enable flexible, cost-efficient detailed building models.

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes
satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric
guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

### [16] [Adaptive Visual Navigation Assistant in 3D RPGs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18539)
*Kaijie Xu,Clark Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a two-stage deep-learning approach to detect traversable Spatial Transition Points (STPs) and identify the Main STP (MSTP) from a single frame, using Faster R-CNN and a lightweight ranking module with adapters; provides a dataset and baseline results for AI-driven navigation in RPGs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Players rely on visual cues to locate map transitions; automatic mapping and level design evaluation would benefit from robust STP detection and MSTP selection.

Method: Two-stage pipeline: stage 1 detect STPs with Faster R-CNN; stage 2 rank STPs with MSTP selector using local/global features; parameter-efficient adapters; optional retrieval-augmented fusion; dataset from five Action RPG titles.

Result: Full-network fine-tuning yields superior STP detection with sufficient data; adapter-only transfer is more robust in low-data scenarios and for MSTP selection; baseline pipeline and dataset created; initial insights into model adaptation.

Conclusion: Formalizes STP detection as a novel problem, establishes baselines, and fosters future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level design.

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to
future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Wan-S2V is a film-grade, audio-driven animation model built on Wan that outperforms SOTA methods (e.g., Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman) in cinematic contexts and is versatile for long-form video generation and lip-sync editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current SOTA audio-driven animation works well for speech and singing but struggles with film-level animation requiring nuanced character interactions, realistic body movement, and dynamic camera work; there is a need for higher expressiveness and fidelity in cinema-scale production.

Method: Introduce Wan-S2V, an audio-driven model built upon Wan to enhance expressiveness and fidelity in cinematic contexts; conducts extensive experiments against cutting-edge models (Hunyuan-Avatar, Omnihuman).

Result: Experimental results consistently show that Wan-S2V significantly outperforms Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Wan-S2V achieves enhanced expressiveness and fidelity for cinematic character animation and demonstrates versatility in long-form video generation and precise lip-sync editing.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation
demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and
singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television
productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character
interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address
this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we
propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan.
Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in
cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive
experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as
Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions.
Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications
in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

### [18] [Decouple, Reorganize, and Fuse: A Multimodal Framework for Cancer Survival Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18632)
*Huayi Wang,Haochao Ying,Yuyang Xu,Qibo Qiu,Cheng Zhang,Danny Z. Chen,Ying Sun,Jian Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeReF introduces a decoupling-reorganization-fusion framework for multi-modal cancer survival analysis that uses random feature reorganization and a regional cross-attention module to enable dynamic MoE fusion and richer feature interaction, improving generalization across datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fix the limitations of fixed fusion schemes and lack of cross-feature interaction in prior multimodal fusion methods (e.g., concatenation, attention, MoE) for cancer survival prediction.

Method: Propose Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion (DeReF) with a random feature reorganization strategy between modality decoupling and dynamic MoE fusion modules; integrate a regional cross-attention network within the decoupling module; validate on Liver Cancer (in-house) and three TCGA datasets; code to be released.

Result: Extensive experiments on in-house LC and three TCGA datasets demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed framework over baselines, with improved cross-modal interaction and generalization; code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: DeReF enhances fusion diversity and interaction among decoupled features, addressing information-closure in MoE-based fusion and improving generalization for multi-modal survival analysis; future work includes public release and potential broader modality applications.

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house
Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

### [19] [ROSE: Remove Objects with Side Effects in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18633)
*Chenxuan Miao,Yutong Feng,Jianshu Zeng,Zixiang Gao,Hantang Liu,Yunfeng Yan,Donglian Qi,Xi Chen,Bin Wang,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROSE introduces a diffusion-transformer-based video inpainting framework to remove objects and their side effects (shadows, reflections, light, translucency, mirror) using synthetic data from a 3D renderer and a full-video reference-based erasing strategy, plus a new ROSE-Bench benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the scarcity of paired videos with object-side-effect annotations and the inadequacy of existing methods to remove side effects such as shadows and reflections.

Method: A fully automatic data generation pipeline using a 3D renderer to create large-scale paired videos with diverse scenes, objects, camera angles, and trajectories. ROSE is a diffusion-transformer-based video inpainting model that processes the entire video for reference-based erasing to localize object-correlated regions. Additional supervision predicts side-effect-affected areas via the differential mask between paired videos. Evaluation uses ROSE-Bench, a benchmark incorporating common scenarios and five side effects (shadows, reflections, light, translucency, mirror).

Result: ROSE achieves superior performance compared with existing video object erasing methods and generalizes well to real-world videos, as demonstrated on ROSE-Bench.

Conclusion: ROSE provides a systematic framework for removing objects and their side effects, leveraging synthetic paired data and explicit side-effect masks, and introducing a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate such capabilities.

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

### [20] [OwlCap: Harmonizing Motion-Detail for Video Captioning via HMD-270K and Caption Set Equivalence Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18634)
*Chunlin Zhong,Qiuxia Hou,Zhangjun Zhou,Shuang Hao,Haonan Lu,Yanhao Zhang,He Tang,Xiang Bai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-stage data and optimization framework to balance motion and detail in video captioning, introducing the HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap MLLM using Motion-Detail Fusion and Fine-Grained Examination, plus Caption Set Equivalence Reward with Group Relative Policy Optimization for improved completeness and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing video captioning systems exhibit motion-detail imbalance, producing incomplete captions that hurt coherence and understanding. A balanced approach is needed across data construction and optimization.

Method: Data: Build HMD-270K via a two-stage pipeline (Motion-Detail Fusion and Fine-Grained Examination). Optimization: Introduce CSER (Caption Set Equivalence Reward) based on GRPO, with unit-to-set matching and bidirectional validation. Train OwlCap with HMD-270K supervision and apply GRPO post-training with CSER.

Result: OwlCap shows improvements over baselines on two benchmarks: VDC (+4.2 Acc, detail focus) and DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1, motion focus). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap will be released to the community.

Conclusion: The proposed data-and-optimization framework achieves motion-detail balance in video captioning, yielding more complete and accurate captions, and provides resources to advance the field.

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research
community advancements.

*Ye Tao,Xinran Fu,Honglin Pang,Xi Yang,Chuntao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A clustering-based feature space learning method leveraging Oracle Bones Character font priors improves OBIs detection across Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN on two datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detection of Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs) from rubbing images is challenged by degradation (noise, cracks). The goal is robust feature representations that enhance detection performance by injecting prior knowledge from the OBC font dataset.

Method: Introduce clustering-based representation learning using the OBC font library as prior knowledge. Derive a clustering-based loss from the clustering results and integrate it into the overall network loss. Validate across three detectors (Faster R-CNN, DETR, Sparse R-CNN) on two OBIs datasets.

Result: All three detection frameworks show significant performance improvements when equipped with the proposed clustering-based representation learning approach.

Conclusion: Clustering-based feature space representation learning with OBC font priors is effective for OBIs detection, offering cross-framework gains and potential generalization to digital archaeology tasks involving degraded artifacts.

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient
Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images
represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily
due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the
effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning
method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font
library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the
detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method
incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total
network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting
experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection
frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive
experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance
improvements.

*Xin Tian,Yingtie Lei,Xiujun Zhang,Zimeng Li,Chi-Man Pun,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces frequency-domain SNR priors and transformer-based modules (FAST, FAT) within a U-Net for underwater image enhancement, achieving state-of-the-art PSNR/SSIM on UIE datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spatial-domain SNR priors struggle to separate cross-channel interference and provide limited enhancement of informative structures. A frequency-domain decomposition into amplitude and phase can enable better channel modulation and highlight key spectral components for UIE.

Method: Proposes FAST (Fourier Attention SNR-prior Transformer) to couple spectral interactions with SNR cues; introduces FAT (Frequency Adaptive Transformer) bottleneck to fuse low- and high-frequency branches via gated attention. Embeds these in a unified U-shaped architecture with an RGB stream and an SNR-guided branch to form SFormer.

Result: Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB, EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a PSNR gain of 3.1 dB and an SSIM gain of 0.08, effectively restoring colors, textures, and contrast in underwater scenes.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates that integrating frequency-domain SNR priors and spectral transformers within a unified architecture yields substantial UIE improvements, highlighting the value of amplitude/phase-aware processing and cross-frequency fusion for underwater image restoration.

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in
underwater scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network for echocardiography videos to boost EF estimation by merging local frame details with global motion; introduces STCS module with cross-frame scanning and a Mamba-based high-level temporal model to reduce noise-induced EF biases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Goal to improve ejection fraction estimation accuracy from ultrasound by addressing limitations of single-frame detail vs. multi-frame context and reducing biases due to image noise.

Method: A two-level hierarchy: low-level CNNs process individual frames to preserve detail; high-level Mamba architecture captures spatio-temporal dependencies. Introduces Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module that cross-scans across frames and spatial positions to incorporate long-range context and mitigate local spatio-temporal limits.

Result: Abstract does not include quantitative results; claims improved EF estimation accuracy. Requires experimental validation, comparisons to baselines, and ablation studies.

Conclusion: The approach offers a balanced architecture that leverages both local details and global dynamics, with the STCS module addressing ultrasound noise biases; potential improvements in EF estimation through better segmentation dynamics.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in
echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to
provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection
Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good
segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.
In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network
(\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation
accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Freeze the encoder and search for decision-plane adjustments in feature space to align class boundaries under domain shift, leveraging domain-invariant geometry from pretrained representations; achieves competitive results with lower cost and better interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift degrades performance; fine-tuning encoders is inefficient, hard to scale, and reduces interpretability. Pretrained models exhibit domain-invariant geometric structures that can be exploited.

Method: Feature-space Planes Searcher (FPS): freeze the feature encoder and optimize decision boundaries (planes) in the frozen feature space by leveraging intra-class clustering and inter-class separation observed in pretrained representations. Uses offline feature extraction to enable full-dataset optimization in a single computation cycle, with interpretability of adaptation.

Result: FPS attains competitive or superior performance on public benchmarks, scales to multimodal large models, and applies across diverse domains (protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, earthquake detection). It reduces memory and computation costs compared with finetuning and facilitates interpretability of adaptation.

Conclusion: FPS provides a simple, effective, and generalizable paradigm for domain adaptation and transfer learning, mitigating feature distortion risks from finetuning while broadening applicability across domains.

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including
protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake
detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and
generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation
tasks. .

*Wasi Ullah,Yasir Noman Khalid,Saddam Hussain Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid HAR framework that combines a customized InceptionV3 for spatial features, LSTM for temporal modeling, and an adaptive ensemble GA-based feature selector to achieve lightweight, accurate HAR suitable for edge deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high computational costs, redundant features, and limited real-time scalability in HAR by building a lightweight, accurate, and scalable framework that can run on edge devices.

Method: Extract spatial features with a customized InceptionV3, model temporal dynamics with LSTM, and use an ensemble-based genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA) to select compact, diverse, and discriminative feature subsets balancing accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity.

Result: Achieves 99.65% recognition accuracy on the challenging UCF-YouTube dataset; reduces feature dimensionality to as few as 7 features; improves inference time enabling real-time deployment on edge devices like Raspberry Pi.

Conclusion: The proposed hybrid framework offers a lightweight, scalable HAR solution capable of robust performance in heterogeneous environments and practical edge deployments for applications like surveillance, assistive tech, and monitoring.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various
applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies,
sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges,
including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as
occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,
demonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition
accuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time. The
lightweight and scalable nature of the HAR system supports real-time deployment
on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, enabling practical applications in
intelligent, resource-aware environments, including public safety, assistive
technology, and autonomous monitoring systems.

*Qun Ji,Peng Li,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ColorGS proposes Colored Gaussian Primitives and an Enhanced Deformation Model to improve color expressiveness and global deformation handling in surgical scene reconstruction, achieving state-of-the-art PSNR/SSIM with real-time rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D Gaussian Splatting methods use fixed per-Gaussian color encoding and linear deformation models, which struggle with subtle color variations and consistent global tissue deformations under complex lighting and motion in surgical videos.

Method: Introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives with dynamic anchors and learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatial textures; design an Enhanced Deformation Model combining time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable time-independent deformations; integrate these into a surgical scene reconstruction framework and evaluate on DaVinci videos, EndoNeRF, and StereoMIS datasets.

Result: Achieves PSNR of 39.85 (about 1.5 higher than prior 3DGS methods) and SSIM of 97.25%, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance and real-time rendering efficiency on surgical datasets.

Conclusion: ColorGS balances high fidelity with computational practicality, advancing intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications in surgical scene reconstruction.

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

### [27] [Class-wise Flooding Regularization for Imbalanced Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18723)
*Hiroaki Aizawa,Yuta Naito,Kohei Fukuda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Class-wise flooding regularization extends flooding to per-class levels to mitigate bias toward majority classes in imbalanced datasets, improving minority class performance and overall generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced datasets cause models to favor majority classes, leading to poor recognition of minority classes. Regularization that adaptively prevents overfitting at the class level could balance learning across classes.

Method: Introduce class-wise flooding: assign a flooding level for each class based on its frequency. During training, apply flooding regularization individually per class so the loss cannot fall below the class-specific threshold, suppressing memorization in dominant classes while allowing sufficient learning for minority ones.

Result: In imbalanced image classification, the proposed method improves minority-class performance and achieves better overall generalization compared to conventional flooding regularizations.

Conclusion: Class-wise flooding regularization effectively tackles imbalanced learning by tailoring regularization to class frequencies, reducing overfitting of majority classes and preserving learning capacity for minority classes.

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

### [28] [Flatness-aware Curriculum Learning via Adversarial Difficulty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18726)
*Hiroaki Aizawa,Yoshikazu Hayashi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM) to blend Curriculum Learning (CL) with Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), overcoming difficulty signals in flat loss landscapes and improving generalization across vision tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Empirical risk minimization often overfits; CL helps by ordering training samples by difficulty, and SAM promotes flat minima for robustness. However, in flat regions both loss and gradient magnitudes shrink, making difficulty assessment unreliable. A robust, training-progress-friendly difficulty metric is needed.

Method: Introduce ADM, which quantifies adversarial vulnerability via the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial inputs. Use ADM to dynamically curate training samples within a CL framework that incorporates SAM, enabling adaptive difficulty ordering as training converges.

Result: Empirical evaluation on image classification, fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization shows ADM-enhanced CL-SAM preserves the benefits of both approaches and outperforms existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware methods.

Conclusion: ADM provides a reliable, progression-consistent difficulty signal that, when combined with SAM, yields stronger generalization and robustness than prior curricula or flatness-focused strategies.

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

### [29] [Are All Marine Species Created Equal? Performance Disparities in Underwater Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18729)
*Melanie Wille,Tobias Fischer,Scarlett Raine*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Disentangles localization vs classification in underwater object detection on the DUO dataset, finding localization (foreground–background discrimination) as the main bottleneck regardless of data quantity, and that classification performance gaps persist even with balanced data; recommends prioritizing localization improvements and choosing data distributions based on whether precision or recall is prioritized; code and datasets are released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why certain marine species (e.g., scallops) are under-detected not merely due to data quantity, and to identify systematic factors and improvements for class-specific performance disparities in underwater object detection.

Method: Modify the DUO dataset to separate object detection into localization and classification; evaluate localization using YOLOv11 and TIDE; conduct classification experiments with varying data balance to assess effects of data quantity, balance, and inter-class dependencies.

Result: Foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic stage across data quantities; classification shows persistent precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies; data distribution choices influence precision vs recall.

Conclusion: Improvements should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules; use imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision and balanced distributions when prioritizing recall; publicly release code and datasets to support further research.

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class
distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is
detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

*Feiwei Qin,Shichao Lu,Junhao Hou,Changmiao Wang,Meie Fang,Ligang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Drawings-to-CAD: A seq-to-seq approach (Drawing2CAD) that converts 2D vector engineering drawings into parametric CAD models using a vector-primitive representation, a dual-decoder transformer, and soft target loss, validated on a paired CAD-VGDrawing dataset with code and data released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial CAD workflows start from 2D drawings; existing CAD generation from 3D inputs or text does not align with drawing-first pipelines. There is a gap in automatic, precise conversion from 2D vector drawings to parametric CAD that preserves design intent and geometry.

Method: Propose Drawing2CAD with: (1) a network-friendly vector primitive representation preserving precise geometry; (2) a dual-decoder transformer that decouples command type from parameter generation while maintaining alignment; (3) a soft target distribution loss to handle flexibility in CAD parameters. Create CAD-VGDrawing, a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct thorough experiments. Code and dataset are released at the provided URL.

Result: Experiments demonstrate the method’s effectiveness in converting 2D drawings into accurate parametric CAD operations while preserving geometry and design intent; dataset and code enable reproducibility and further research.

Conclusion: Reframing CAD generation as a sequence-to-sequence problem from 2D vector drawings to parametric CAD operations is viable. Drawing2CAD advances end-to-end, geometry-preserving CAD generation and bridges the gap between traditional 2D drawings and modern parametric CAD workflows; future work could expand primitive representations and generalization.

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

*DongHoon Lim,YoungChae Kim,Dong-Hyun Kim,Da-Hee Yang,Joon-Hyuk Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes router-gated cross-modal feature fusion for AVSR that adaptively reweights audio and visual features using token-level acoustic corruption scores to pivot to visual cues when audio is noisy, achieving significant WER reductions on LRS3.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio reliability estimation in noisy environments is hard, and existing AVSR systems struggle to dynamically adjust modality reliance; a robust fusion mechanism is needed.

Method: Introduce a router-based audio-visual feature fusion with token-level corruption scoring. An audio-visual fusion-based router down-weights unreliable audio tokens and applies gated cross-attention in each decoder layer to emphasize visual cues, enabling the model to pivot to visuals when audio quality degrades.

Result: On LRS3, the method achieves 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared with AV-HuBERT; ablation studies show that both the router and gating mechanism improve robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

Conclusion: The proposed router-gated fusion enables robust AVSR by adaptively weighting modalities and enabling pivot to visual information when audio quality drops; validated by substantial WER improvements and ablation evidence.

Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains
challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and
dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal
feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach
achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to
AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism
contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

### [32] [Rethinking Human-Object Interaction Evaluation for both Vision-Language Models and HOI-Specific Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18753)
*Qinqian Lei,Bo Wang,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a multiple-answer, multi-choice HOI benchmark that uses ground-truth positives and curated negatives, enabling fair cross-paradigm evaluation of both generative VLMs and HOI methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing HOI benchmarks require exact matches, which penalize valid predictions from modern generative vision-language models. A fair, unified evaluation is needed to compare general-purpose VLMs with HOI-specific methods.

Method: Formulate HOI detection as a multi-answer multiple-choice task. For each image, the question includes ground-truth positive HOI options and a curated set of negatives designed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., excluding plausible alternatives like 'throwing' when 'catching' is annotated). The protocol supports both VLMs and HOI-specific models and scores predictions by counting valid positive options rather than exact matches, enabling direct cross-paradigm comparisons.

Result: The protocol is presented as the first evaluation scheme of its kind to jointly assess VLMs and HOI methods, enabling fair comparison and offering new insights into the progress of HOI understanding.

Conclusion: By addressing misalignment between evaluation and the generative nature of modern VLMs, the benchmark provides a fair, scalable framework for tracking HOI understanding and invites further refinements and broader adoption.

Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early
vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components
within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI
methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current
state of progress in HOI understanding.

*Wanqiang Wang,Longzhu He,Wei Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CmOS advances MCQ generation by producing visual options through cross-modal reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation, with a discrimination module to filter suitable content, outperforming baselines in multiple tasks across subjects and levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCQ generation has largely ignored visual options and high-quality distractors are costly; there is a need for scalable, multimodal MCQ generation that aligns content visually and semantically.

Method: CmOS integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to generate semantically plausible answers and visually similar distractors, guided by a content-discrimination module that selects content suitable for visual options.

Result: Experimental results show that CmOS outperforms existing methods in content discrimination, question generation, and visual option generation across diverse subjects and educational levels.

Conclusion: CmOS provides a scalable, multimodal framework for educational MCQ generation with visual options, leveraging cross-modal reasoning and retrieval to improve quality and applicability.

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep
thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has
primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely
overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors
remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of
manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options
Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual
options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning
process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically
plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a
discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ground-truth HD maps are expensive and not geographically diverse, hindering generalization. A scalable training approach using unlabeled data is needed to improve online mapping models.

Method: Generate pseudo-labels by reconstructing road surfaces from multi-camera imagery using Gaussian splatting and semantic information from a pretrained 2D segmentation network. Introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss to accommodate partially masked pseudo-labels, enabling training without any ground-truth maps.

Result: The work presents a feasible approach to training online mapping models without ground-truth maps and shows that pseudo-labels can be used to pre-train models in a semi-supervised fashion on unlabeled data.

Conclusion: Offers a path to map-free supervision for online mapping with code available, facilitating scalable semi-supervised training using unlabeled crowdsourced data.

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps
from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely
on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to
obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization.
In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping
that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those
pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery
using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss
function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time
the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps.
Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online
model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled
crowdsourced data. The code is available at

*Mona Mirzaie,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An end-to-end monocular autonomous driving model uses interpretability-promoting losses to produce sparse, localized feature maps, achieving state-of-the-art safety and efficiency on CARLA benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trustworthy AI in autonomous driving requires understanding and debugging decisions, especially in complex urban environments; sparse, region-focused explanations can reveal which image areas drive control commands and help reduce infractions.

Method: Introduce loss terms that encourage sparsity and locality in feature activations; perform ablations on feature extraction; validate on CARLA benchmarks; emphasize a monocular, non-ensemble architecture.

Result: Interpretability correlates with reduced infractions and safer driving; the model surpasses top CARLA leaderboard methods in infraction scores and achieves the highest route completion with a single-camera setup.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates that interpretability-driven objectives can be aligned with high performance in end-to-end autonomous driving, offering safer, explainable, and competitive monocular models.

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,
yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,
non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA
Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route
completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

Motivation: The growing deployment of smart environments and low-power devices for remote, non-contact physiological monitoring creates a need for scalable, interoperable, real-time biosignal systems that operate on resource-constrained hardware.

Method: Face2PPG pipeline processes video frames sequentially to extract rPPG signals, implemented with a multithreaded architecture to handle video capture, processing, networking, and GUI updates. It employs a hybrid programming model combining Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model for event-driven processing and parallelism. The network interface provides an HTTP server for video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand vital sign retrieval, with a collaborative GUI guiding signal capture.

Result: Demonstrates robust real-time performance on low-power devices, maintaining continuous operation at 30 fps, enabling HR, RR, and SpO2 extraction with real-time streaming and API access while minimizing computational overhead.

Conclusion: The work addresses core challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring on constrained hardware and offers a practical, scalable solution for healthcare and HCI applications, validating the effectiveness of the FRP+Actor hybrid approach for real-time, low-overhead biosignal systems.

Abstract: The growing integration of smart environments and low-power computing
devices, coupled with mass-market sensor technologies, is driving advancements
in remote and non-contact physiological monitoring. However, deploying these
systems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant
challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This
paper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized
for low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart
rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial
video streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes
video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while
leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time
processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates
concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under
real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational
overhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring,
offering practical solutions for optimizing performance in modern healthcare

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight vibrational method using a rotating unbalanced mass sustains events in static scenes, with a motion-compensation pipeline to remove the induced motion, yielding clean events and improved reconstruction and edge detection; validated with a hardware prototype and real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras often produce zero events in fixed-illumination static scenes, limiting their usefulness for CV tasks. Existing motion-stimulation approaches require complex hardware; a lightweight solution is desirable.

Method: Attach a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational motion in the camera. Develop a motion-compensation pipeline to remove this injected motion and extract clean, motion-corrected events. Build a hardware prototype and evaluate on real-world captured datasets, including recovering motion parameters.

Result: The approach reliably recovers motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection compared to event-based sensing without motion induction.

Conclusion: A practical, hardware-light method to sustain persistent event generation in static scenes, enabling improved downstream perception tasks; demonstrated with hardware prototype and real-world data.

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

### [38] [Robust and Label-Efficient Deep Waste Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18799)
*Hassan Abid,Khan Muhammad,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Strong baselines and an ensemble-based semi-supervised framework for AI-driven waste detection on the ZeroWaste dataset; LLM-optimized prompts boost zero-shot accuracy; fine-tuned detectors reach 51.6 mAP; soft pseudo-labeling surpasses fully supervised training; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Waste sorting AI lags due to limited data and reliance on legacy detectors; need robust baselines and scalable semi-supervised annotation pipelines to bridge research and real-world deployment.

Method: Benchmark OVOD models on ZeroWaste; optimize prompts with LLMs for zero-shot; fine-tune transformer detectors; propose soft pseudo-labeling with ensemble fusion using spatial and consensus-aware weights; apply to unlabeled ZeroWaste-s; evaluate against supervised baselines; release code.

Result: Achieved 51.6 mAP baseline for fine-tuned detectors; LLM-optimized prompts significantly improve zero-shot accuracy; ensemble pseudo-labeling improves semi-supervised training such that pseudo-annotations outperform fully supervised training on unlabeled data.

Conclusion: Establishes rigorous baselines, introduces a robust ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, produces high-quality annotations for unlabeled data, and evaluates OVOD models under real-world waste sorting conditions; code available.

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI
research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to
limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we
advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and
introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first
benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on
the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts
perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern
transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then
propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using
spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised
training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations
achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring
the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the
research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust
ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations
for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models
under real-world waste sorting conditions. Our code is available at:

### [39] [Embedding Font Impression Word Tags Based on Co-occurrence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18825)
*Yugo Kubota,Seiichi Uchida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a spectral-embedding approach to learn impression tag vectors from a font-impression co-occurrence graph, enabling impression-guided font generation and retrieval and outperforming BERT/CLIP in this task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Impression tags describing font shapes are not well captured by standard word embeddings (e.g., BERT, CLIP). Capturing co-occurrence structure among impressions can yield representations that better reflect perceptual associations and support downstream tasks like font generation and retrieval.

Method: Construct a graph where nodes are impression tags and edges encode co-occurrence relationships; apply spectral embedding to derive vectors for each tag.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative evaluations show the proposed method yields better impression-guided font generation compared to BERT and CLIP.

Conclusion: A graph-based, spectral embedding of impression tag co-occurrences provides more aligned representations for impression-based font tasks than standard language models.

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing
those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression
tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

### [40] [Deep Pre-trained Time Series Features for Tree Species Classification in the Dutch Forest Inventory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18829)
*Takayuki Ishikawa,Carmelo Bonannella,Bas J. W. Lerink,Marc Rußwurm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuning a pre-trained remote sensing time-series foundation model using freely available satellite data substantially improves tree species classification in the Netherlands with limited labeled data, outperforming traditional hand-crafted-feature methods by up to 10 percentage points.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: National Forest Inventories (NFIs) are essential but labor-intensive; remotely sensed data and machine learning offer scalable updates. Existing approaches rely on hand-crafted features and phenology-based metrics, so it is unclear if deep, pre-trained time-series features can improve accuracy in data-limited settings.

Method: Extract time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, ERA5, and SRTM via Google Earth Engine. Fine-tune a publicly available remote-sensing time-series foundation model with a small labeled dataset and compare against current state-of-the-art NFI classification in the Netherlands.

Result: Fine-tuning the pre-trained foundation model yields higher accuracy than the current state-of-the-art across all datasets, with improvements up to about 10 percentage points. Classic hand-crafted harmonic features are insufficient for this task, highlighting the value of deep AI features in data-limited NFI classification.

Conclusion: Deep features from foundation models are a promising avenue for data-limited forest species classification, offering substantial gains over traditional methods and enabling more scalable integration with existing NFIs using openly available data.

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can
effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

### [42] [Boosting Micro-Expression Analysis via Prior-Guided Video-Level Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18834)
*Zizheng Guo,Bochao Zou,Yinuo Jia,Xiangyu Li,Huimin Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A prior-guided video-level regression method with scalable interval selection for micro-expression analysis, jointly optimizing spotting and recognition with shared parameters, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Micro-expressions are brief, low-intensity signals that are often obscured by fixed-window analyses. There is a need to model the full temporal evolution (onset, apex, offset) and balance data efficiency with recognition performance by leveraging a joint spotting-recognition framework.

Method: A prior-guided video-level regression approach with a scalable interval selection strategy that accounts for temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution of micro-expressions. It uses a synergistic optimization framework where spotting and recognition share parameters (except the classification heads) to better utilize limited data.

Result: State-of-the-art STRS metrics: 0.0562 on CAS(ME)^3 and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. Code released at https://github.com/zizheng-guo/BoostingVRME.

Conclusion: The method effectively captures ME temporal structure, improves data efficiency via shared parameters for spotting and recognition, and outperforms existing approaches on key benchmarks.

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is
available at https://github.com/zizheng-guo/BoostingVRME.

*Luyin Hu,Soheil Gholami,George Dindelegan,Torstein R. Meling,Aude Billard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An image-processing framework using geometric error metrics to objectively assess microsurgical anastomosis proficiency, reducing subjectivity from traditional scoring; validated across three hospital datasets and aligning with expert ratings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional outcome-oriented anastomosis lapses rely on subjective judgments, leading to biases and limited reliability. There is a need for objective, efficient, and scalable assessment to improve training and certification.

Method: The study uses three hospital datasets with participants at multiple levels and applies image-processing techniques to model and detect errors in microsurgical anastomosis. It defines geometric metrics and a scoring mechanism that maps detected errors to proficiency scores, aiming to replicate expert ratings.

Result: Geometric metrics effectively replicate expert raters' scoring for the considered errors, improving efficiency and reliability of proficiency assessment.

Conclusion: The proposed objective, geometry-based assessment framework offers reliable, scalable evaluation of microsurgical skills and can enhance training protocols and evaluation standards.

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

### [44] [Harnessing Meta-Learning for Controllable Full-Frame Video Stabilization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18859)
*Muhammad Kashif Ali,Eun Woo Im,Dongjin Kim,Tae Hyun Kim,Vivek Gupta,Haonan Luo,Tianrui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A fast test-time adaptation framework for pixel-level video stabilization that personalizes models per video using low-level cues and a jerk-aware targeting module, improving stability and visual quality while keeping full-frame outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed-parameter, full-frame stabilization methods struggle to generalize across diverse motion patterns and content. Per-video adaptation promises better stability and image quality by exploiting data available at inference.

Method: Introduce rapid test-time adaptation for pixel-level stabilization models using low-level inference cues; include a jerk localization module to identify high-jerk segments and a targeted adaptation strategy focusing updates on those segments; capable of a single adaptation pass; preserves full-frame synthesis.

Result: Experiments on diverse real-world datasets show consistent performance gains across various full-frame stabilization models in both qualitative and quantitative metrics, including downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Rapid per-video adaptation with jerk-guided targeting enables modern full-frame stabilizers to surpass state-of-the-art while maintaining full-frame outputs and giving users intuitive control akin to classical methods.

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

### [45] [Toward Robust Medical Fairness: Debiased Dual-Modal Alignment via Text-Guided Attribute-Disentangled Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18886)
*Yuexuan Xia,Benteng Ma,Jiang He,Zhiyong Wang,Qi Dou,Yong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualFairVL introduces a multimodal debiasing framework that jointly aligns cross-modal representations for fairer medical diagnosis using a parallel dual-branch design, orthogonal text anchors, a hypernetwork-generated visual prompts, and prototype-based regularization, achieving state-of-the-art fairness with low parameter count across eight datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis under distribution shifts caused by variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice; existing debiasing methods often treat vision and text separately, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and fairness gaps. Vision-language models offer cross-modal representations and text prompts encoding identities, motivating a joint debiasing and alignment approach.

Method: DualFairVL uses a parallel dual-branch architecture to disentangle sensitive and target attributes, with approximately orthogonal text anchors constructed via linear projections to guide cross-attention for fused features. A hypernetwork disentangles attribute-related information and generates instance-aware visual prompts encoding dual-modal cues. Prototype-based regularization in the visual branch enforces separation of sensitive features and strengthens alignment with textual anchors.

Result: Empirical evaluation on eight medical imaging datasets across four modalities shows state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines while using only 3.6M trainable parameters.

Conclusion: The proposed DualFairVL effectively debiases and aligns cross-modal representations with high efficiency, achieving robust fairness gains across diverse medical imaging tasks. Code will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

### [46] [DQEN: Dual Query Enhancement Network for DETR-based HOI Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18896)
*Zhehao Li,Chong Wang,Yi Chen,Yinghao Lu,Jiangbo Qian,Jiong Wang,Jiafei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A DETR-based HOI detector uses a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to upgrade both object and interaction queries, leveraging object-aware encoder features and CLIP-driven interaction semantics, plus an auxiliary unit, achieving competitive results on HICO-Det and V-COCO with released code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HOI detection relies on meaningful human-object pairs and interactions. DETR-based models suffer from vague representations due to randomly initialized queries, and fixed human categories clash with variable objects/interactions. There is a need to enrich both object and interaction queries to improve detection performance.

Method: Introduce Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) comprising: (1) Object-query enhancement using object-aware encoder features to focus on humans interacting with objects; (2) Interaction Semantic Fusion module that exploits CLIP-promoted HOI candidates; (3) Semantic-feature-based initialization of interaction queries; (4) Auxiliary Prediction Unit to strengthen interaction-feature representations.

Result: The approach achieves competitive performance on the HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of enhancing object and interaction queries and leveraging CLIP-based semantics; code is released at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: DQEN effectively mitigates the limitations of random query initialization in DETR-based HOI detection by enriching both object and interaction queries with structured, semantics-driven cues and an auxiliary predictor, yielding robust performance on standard HOI datasets.

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance
the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's
ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary
Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.
Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and
the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at
https://github.com/lzzhhh1019/DQEN.

TL;DR: EVENTA is a large-scale event-level multimodal benchmark at ACM Multimedia 2025, introducing two tracks on event-enriched image retrieval/captioning and event-based image retrieval, built on OpenEvents V1, with 45 teams and a fairness-driven test regime; aims to enable context-aware, narrative-driven multimedia AI with wide applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing captioning and retrieval tasks focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes and often miss contextual and semantic dimensions of real-world events. There is a need to integrate contextual, temporal, and semantic information (who, when, where, what, why) to better understand images as events.

Method: The EVENTA challenge features two tracks (Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning; Event-Based Image Retrieval) built on the OpenEvents V1 dataset. Evaluation uses Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility. 45 teams from six countries participated; the top three teams were invited to present at ACM Multimedia 2025. Details available on the official homepage.

Result: The abstract reports participation and structural results rather than quantitative metrics: 45 teams from six countries participated; two tracks and a dual-test evaluation regime were used; the top three teams were invited to present at the conference. This establishes a new benchmark and foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven multimedia AI, with no specific performance metrics provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: EVENTA establishes a foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven multimedia AI, with potential applications in journalism, media analysis, cultural archiving, and accessibility, and sets the stage for future research and benchmarking in event-level multimodal understanding.

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM
Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level
multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely
focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often
overlooking the contextual and semantic dimensions that define real-world
events. EVENTA addresses this gap by integrating contextual, temporal, and
semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an
image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks:
Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.
A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted
through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia
2025. EVENTA establishes a foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven
multimedia AI, with applications in journalism, media analysis, cultural
archiving, and accessibility. Further details about the challenge are available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An initial framework to distinguish group and single pedestrians from real-world trajectories using a Transformer-based classifier, with a sequence-aware metric framework and encounter typology to enable scalable analysis of space utilization and interaction patterns across multiple sequence lengths.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantify differences in space usage and interaction patterns between pedestrian groups and individuals to inform crowd dynamics research, simulation validation, and space design.

Method: Segment trajectories into fixed time bins; apply a Transformer-based pair classification model to detect cohesive groups; use a structured sequence-based filtering pipeline; develop spatial and behavioral metrics (e.g., convex hull area, heatmap densities, velocity change, trajectory straightness); define encounter typology (single-to-single, single-to-group, group-to-group); enable analysis at sequence lengths of 60, 100, and 200 frames.

Result: Presents an initial, scalable framework and metric toolkit for distinguishing group vs. single pedestrians; establishes a classification pipeline, dataset structuring, and a comprehensive metrics framework; provides groundwork for future quantitative analysis.

Conclusion: Lays foundational tools and methodology for future quantitative studies on pedestrian group dynamics and space design, with plans to extend to complete metric analyses and validation across different sequence lengths.

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A scalable, weakly supervised framework that transfers fine-scale coral information from underwater imagery to drone imagery for high-resolution coral morphotype mapping with minimal annotation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monitoring reef health at large spatial scales requires high-resolution maps, but drone imagery has insufficient resolution for fine classes and pixel-level labels are costly to obtain; there is a need for scalable, cost-effective segmentation methods.

Method: A multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation approach that leverages underwater data to supervise aerial segmentation via classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation, and self-distillation, enabling large-area mapping and easy incorporation of new classes.

Result: Demonstrates effective large-area segmentation of coral morphotypes in drone imagery and shows flexibility to add new classes, offering a scalable, cost-efficient reef monitoring workflow.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables high-resolution reef monitoring at large extents by combining low-cost data, weak supervision, and multi-scale remote sensing, improving scalability and conservation utility.

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from
underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef
mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining
classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation
techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area
segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for
high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly
supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.

Result: Evidence of accurate maps in controlled styles; positive usability and potential for non-experts and pros; identifies improvements and future work; highlights new role for cartographers.

Conclusion: GenAI-assisted map-making can enhance efficiency and accessibility; early results are promising; calls for technical enhancements and thoughtful integration into cartography practice.

Abstract: Traditional map-making relies heavily on Geographic Information Systems
(GIS), requiring domain expertise and being time-consuming, especially for
repetitive tasks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image
diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the
map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation
due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of
cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

### [51] [Enhancing compact convolutional transformers with super attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18960)
*Simpenzwe Honore Leandre,Natenaile Asmamaw Shiferaw,Dillip Rout*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A vision model with token mixing, sequence-pooling, and convolutional tokenizers achieves state-of-the-art results for fixed-context-length tasks at CIFAR-100, with superior efficiency over SDPA transformers for short contexts and without common training augmentations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve accuracy and efficiency in fixed-context-length vision tasks by combining token-mixing, pooling, and convolutional tokenizers to reduce reliance on costly attention mechanisms and data augmentation.

Method: Introduce a vision architecture that uses token mixing, sequence-pooling, and convolutional tokenizers to operate efficiently when context length is smaller than the embedding dimension; claims high training stability and not requiring mixup, positional embeddings, or learning rate scheduling.

Result: On CIFAR-100, top-1 accuracy rises from 36.50% to 46.29% and top-5 from 66.33% to 76.31%; the model is more efficient than SDPA transformers at short context lengths and is 60% the size; training is stable and code is released on GitHub.

Conclusion: The architecture delivers state-of-the-art performance for fixed-context-length tasks with improved efficiency and training stability, indicating potential for practical, data-augmentation-free vision models; code availability supports reproducibility.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a vision model that adopts token mixing,
sequence-pooling, and convolutional tokenizers to achieve state-of-the-art
performance and efficient inference in fixed context-length tasks. In the
CIFAR100 benchmark, our model significantly improves the baseline of the top 1%
and top 5% validation accuracy from 36.50% to 46.29% and 66.33% to 76.31%,
while being more efficient than the Scaled Dot Product Attention (SDPA)
transformers when the context length is less than the embedding dimension and
only 60% the size. In addition, the architecture demonstrates high training
stability and does not rely on techniques such as data augmentation like mixup,
positional embeddings, or learning rate scheduling. We make our code available
on Github.

### [52] [USO: Unified Style and Subject-Driven Generation via Disentangled and Reward Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18966)
*Shaojin Wu,Mengqi Huang,Yufeng Cheng,Wenxu Wu,Jiahe Tian,Yiming Luo,Fei Ding,Qian He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Presents USO, a unified framework for simultaneous style similarity and subject fidelity in image generation by disentangling content and style, with style-alignment, content-style disentanglement, style reward learning (SRL), and a new USO-Bench benchmark; achieves state-of-the-art open-source performance on both objectives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Style-driven and subject-driven generation are typically treated as separate and antagonistic tasks. A unified approach is needed to balance stylistic similarity and content fidelity by explicitly disentangling content from style.

Method: Construct a large triplet dataset (content image, style image, stylized content image). Propose a disentangled learning scheme with two objectives: style-alignment training and content-style disentanglement training. Introduce a style reward-learning (SRL) paradigm to boost performance. Release USO-Bench, a benchmark evaluating both style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.

Result: Extensive experiments show USO achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on both style similarity and subject fidelity. Code and model are released.

Conclusion: A unified framework can reconcile style and subject objectives through content-style disentanglement and auxiliary SRL, validated by strong open-source performance and a new comprehensive benchmark.

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven
generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,
whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

### [53] [Can we make NeRF-based visual localization privacy-preserving?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18971)
*Maxime Pietrantoni,Martin Humenberger,Torsten Sattler,Gabriela Csurka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeRF-based visual localization can reveal fine scene details and leak privacy; standard NeRFs trained with photometric loss encode geometry vulnerable to attacks even if color head is removed. A segmentation-supervised NeRF variant (ppNeSF) uses self-supervised segmentation labels to obscure identifiable details while preserving discriminability for accurate localization, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address privacy concerns for NeRF-based visual localization (VL) in cloud services. Evaluate how NeRF representations store scene details and exploit vulnerabilities, and develop a privacy-preserving alternative without sacrificing localization performance.

Method: 1) Propose a protocol to assess privacy preservation of NeRF-based representations. 2) Demonstrate that NeRFs trained with photometric losses store fine-grained geometry details, vulnerable to privacy attacks even when the color head is removed. 3) Introduce ppNeSF, a NeRF variant trained with segmentation supervision (coarse enough to hide identifiable details) and learned segmentation labels in a self-supervised manner. 4) Show that ppNeSF’s segmentation space enables accurate localization and yields state-of-the-art results.

Result: Reveals privacy vulnerability of RGB-trained NeRFs: geometry details persist despite removing color head.ppNeSF achieves strong localization accuracy using segmentation-based representation, while effectively obscuring sensitive scene details.

Conclusion: Segmentation-supervised NeRFs (ppNeSF) offer a practical privacy-preserving alternative for NeRF-based VL: maintain high localization performance while suppressing fine-grained identifiable details; highlights importance of considering privacy in NeRF design and evaluation.

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

### [54] [Enhancing Document VQA Models via Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18984)
*Eric López,Artemis Llabrés,Ernest Valveny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) improves multi-page Document VQA by selecting concise evidence segments before answering. Text-based retrieval using OCR tokens offers the largest gains, while a purely visual, OCR-free approach also helps without text extraction. Retrieval and reranking drive most improvements; layout-guided chunking often underperforms on these datasets. Benefits persist across model sizes and benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Document VQA faces memory and efficiency challenges when concatenating all pages or using very large vision-language models. RAG offers a scalable alternative by retrieving relevant evidence first, reducing input size and computation while potentially improving accuracy.

Method: Systematic evaluation of RAG variants for Document VQA: (1) text-based retrieval using OCR tokens; (2) purely visual retrieval without OCR; tested across multiple models and multi-page benchmarks (MP-DocVQA, DUDE, InfographicVQA); ablation studies on retrieval, reranking, and layout-guided chunking.

Result: Text-based retrieval variants improve the concatenate-all-pages baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS; visual-only retrieval achieves up to +5.0 ANLS without OCR. Ablations show retrieval and reranking components are the main sources of gain; layout-guided chunking does not help on these datasets. Gains are observed across different model sizes and benchmarks.

Conclusion: Careful evidence selection via retrieval and reranking substantially boosts Doc VQA accuracy in multi-page settings, offering practical value and scalability benefits over naive concatenation or reliance on large models.

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents
that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or
rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first
retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from
this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of
incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

### [55] [Ask Me Again Differently: GRAS for Measuring Bias in Vision Language Models on Gender, Race, Age, and Skin Tone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18989)
*Shaivi Malik,Hasnat Md Abdullah,Sriparna Saha,Amit Sheth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAS introduces a demographic bias benchmark for Vision-Language Models across gender, race, age, and skin tone, with the GRAS Bias Score as an interpretable bias metric. Five state-of-the-art VLMs are evaluated, revealing notable bias levels (best model scores 2/100). The study also shows VQA bias measurement depends on multiple question formulations. Code/data are publicly available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As Vision-Language Models permeate real-world applications, there is a critical need to systematically uncover, quantify, and compare demographic biases to foster fairness, transparency, and robust deployment. GRAS aims to provide diverse coverage across key demographics and an interpretable score.

Method: Introduce GRAS, a bias benchmark for VLMs across gender, race, age, and skin tone; define the GRAS Bias Score as an interpretable metric; benchmark five state-of-the-art VLMs; analyze how VQA question formulation affects bias assessment; release code and data publicly.

Result: GRAS demonstrates concerning bias levels across evaluated VLMs, with the top-performing model achieving only 2/100 on the GRAS Bias Score. The benchmark offers the most diverse demographic coverage to date and shows that measuring bias with VQA requires considering multiple question formulations to capture systematic biases.

Conclusion: GRAS provides an interpretable, diverse framework for assessing demographic biases in VLMs and highlights methodological considerations for bias evaluation. It invites broader adoption and further improvement, supported by public code and data.

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) become integral to real-world applications,
understanding their demographic biases is critical. We introduce GRAS, a
benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age,
and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date. We further propose
the GRAS Bias Score, an interpretable metric for quantifying bias. We benchmark
five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least
biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings
also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual
question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a
question. Our code, data, and evaluation results are publicly available.

### [56] [RoofSeg: An edge-aware transformer-based network for end-to-end roof plane segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19003)
*Siyuan You,Guozheng Xu,Pengwei Zhou,Qiwen Jin,Jian Yao,Li Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An end-to-end roof plane segmentation method (RoofSeg) using an edge-aware transformer with plane queries, augmented by an Edge-Aware Mask Module, adaptive mask loss, and a plane geometric loss to improve edge accuracy and leverage geometric priors for better LiDAR roof segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LiDAR-based roof plane segmentation relies on handcrafted features or non-end-to-end deep learning; it struggles with edge point discriminability and underutilizes planar geometric priors, limiting accuracy for LoD 2/3 roof models.

Method: A transformer encoder-decoder framework with learnable plane queries predicts plane instance masks end-to-end. An Edge-Aware Mask Module (EAMM) enhances edge regions by incorporating planar edge geometry priors. An adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss reduces the impact of misclassified points, and a new plane geometric loss constrains training to respect planar relations.

Result: The approach aims to achieve more accurate roof plane masks, particularly along edges, by integrating geometric priors into the learning process and enabling end-to-end optimization, with ablation showing the contributions of EAMM, adaptive loss, and plane geometric loss.

Conclusion: RoofSeg offers a unified, end-to-end roof plane segmentation framework that leverages edge-aware transformers and geometric priors to improve edge discriminability and segmentation accuracy for LiDAR-based roof models.

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

### [57] [MicroDetect-Net (MDN): Leveraging Deep Learning to Detect Microplastics in Clam Blood, a Step Towards Human Blood Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19021)
*Riju Marwah,Riya Arora,Navneet Yadav,Himank Arora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDN uses Nile Red fluorescence and CNN segmentation to detect and count microplastics in stained blood images, achieving ~92% accuracy and strong segmentation metrics on 276 samples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Microplastics are pervasive and potentially harmful; need reliable detection methods in biological samples; existing models rely on non-human samples; MDN advances preliminary human-applicable detection.

Method: Fluorescence microscopy with Nile Red staining, dataset preparation, and CNN-based segmentation/localization to identify and count microplastic fragments in stained blood images; evaluated on 276 images; metrics IoU, F1, precision, recall.

Result: Accuracy 92.0%; IoU 87.4%; F1 92.1%; Precision 90.6%; Recall 93.7%; robust performance on the dataset.

Conclusion: MDN shows promise for detecting microplastics in blood samples; potential for translation to human samples; acknowledges model limitations and need for further validation and real-world samples.

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of
90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent. These metrics demonstrate the
effectiveness of MDN in the detection of microplastics.

*Yi Pan,Yujia Zhang,Michael Kampffmeyer,Xiaoguang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProPy adapts CLIP for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval using a Prompt Pyramid and Ancestor-Descendant Interaction to achieve state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval is practically important but difficult; existing methods rely on unimodal features and fail to leverage powerful vision-language models like CLIP.

Method: Systematic architectural adaptation of CLIP: (1) Prompt Pyramid to capture event semantics at multiple granularity levels, (2) Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism enabling dynamic semantic interaction among events within the pyramid.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public PRVR datasets, with significant improvements over prior models.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the effectiveness of PLIP-based CLIP adaptation for PRVR and introduces novel prompt-based and hierarchical interaction mechanisms; code is released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific
segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to
process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP
remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a
model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for
PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous
models by significant margins. Code is available at

*Julian Suk,Jolanda J. Wentzel,Patryk Rygiel,Joost Daemen,Daniel Rueckert,Jelmer M. Wolterink*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised pretraining on a large set of 3D vessel geometries using heat kernel signatures improves coronary wall shear stress region segmentation in a small patient cohort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address data scarcity for learning hemodynamic biomarkers; leverage large geometric datasets and self-supervised learning to obtain transferable geometric representations for downstream WSS assessment.

Method: Train on 8449 3D vessel shapes; create self-supervised targets via heat kernel signature from Laplacian eigenvectors; learn geometric representations; apply to 49-patient trial to segment regions by time-averaged wall shear stress.

Result: Geometric representations learned from the large dataset boost WSS region segmentation even when trained on limited data.

Conclusion: Large-scale geometric self-supervision can transfer to patient-specific hemodynamic biomarker tasks, suggesting foundation-model-like approaches may mitigate data scarcity in cardiovascular imaging.

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such
as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear
stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the
shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can
boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high
(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified, fast discriminative model (SuperSimpleNet) for surface defect detection that works across unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed, and fully supervised settings via synthetic anomalies, improved learning, and an enhanced head, achieving state-of-the-art performance and sub-10 ms inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial defect detection faces varying supervision regimes and data heterogeneity; a single model that can leverage all annotations and adapt to four supervision paradigms would improve practicality, efficiency, and deployment.

Method: Build on SimpleNet; introduce synthetic anomaly generation; enhanced classification head; improved learning procedure; designed to train effectively under four supervision settings; claim first model to leverage all annotations.

Result: Outperforms on four challenging benchmarks; inference time under 10 ms; demonstrates strong performance across all supervision scenarios.

Conclusion: SuperSimpleNet offers a fast, versatile solution bridging academia and industry for real-world manufacturing defect detection; emphasizes adaptability and efficiency.

Abstract: Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed
at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on
manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail
to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability.
Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and
struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world
manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed
supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we
propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model
built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel
synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an
improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four
supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging
all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for
performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four
challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an
inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision
paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet
represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing
challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial
applications. Code: https://github.com/blaz-r/SuperSimpleNet

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve single-pixel imaging quality and efficiency by optimizing illumination patterns for the specific task, addressing non-differentiable binary optimization and undersampling.

Method: Bilevel optimization to learn binary patterns; handle non-differentiability with Straight-Through Estimator; regularize with Total Deep Variation in bilevel framework; evaluated on CytoImageNet microscopy dataset.

Result: Learned patterns yield superior reconstruction vs baselines, especially in highly undersampled regimes.

Conclusion: Task-specific binary illumination pattern learning via bilevel optimization is effective for single-pixel imaging and fluorescence microscopy; under undersampling, performance gains are pronounced.

Abstract: Single-Pixel Imaging enables reconstructing objects using a single detector
through sequential illuminations with structured light patterns. We propose a
bilevel optimisation method for learning task-specific, binary illumination
patterns, optimised for applications like single-pixel fluorescence microscopy.
We address the non-differentiable nature of binary pattern optimisation using
the Straight-Through Estimator and leveraging a Total Deep Variation
regulariser in the bilevel formulation. We demonstrate our method on the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A few-shot, lightweight segmentation approach for historical document text lines using UNet++ and a topology-aware loss achieves state-of-the-art results with only three annotated pages per manuscript.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Historical document line segmentation suffers from scarce labeled data and costly annotation; few-shot learning is promising to reduce data requirements.

Method: Use a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware loss borrowed from neuron morphology; train on small patches from three annotated pages per manuscript; evaluate on the U-DIADS-TL dataset; compare to SOTA and DIVA-HisDB baseline.

Result: Significant improvements: 200% relative increase in Recognition Accuracy; 75% increase in Line IoU; F-Measure comparable or superior to the competition winner.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that simple architectures with topology-aware loss can surpass complex models in data-limited settings; three pages suffice; code released.

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection
task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy
of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

### [63] [Dual Enhancement on 3D Vision-Language Perception for Monocular 3D Visual Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19165)
*Yuzhen Li,Min Liu,Yuan Bian,Xueping Wang,Zhaoyang Li,Gen Li,Yaonan Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Enhances 3D grounding from monocular images by addressing unit semantics in text; introduces 3DTE and TGE; achieves new SOTA on Mono3DRefer, notably improving the Far scenario.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text embeddings in pretrained LMs are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but ignore measurement units, causing misalignment with real-world geometry and hindering 3D perception. There is a need to make text features geometrically aware to improve 3D grounding.

Method: 3DTE (3D-text Enhancement) expands the diversity of distance descriptors in queries to improve unit comprehension. TGE (Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement) projects basic text features into a geometrically consistent space to better guide attention to geometry features during grounding.

Result: Extensive experiments with ablations on Mono3DRefer show substantial improvements and a new state-of-the-art; the method achieves a notable 11.94% accuracy gain in the Far scenario. Code will be publicly released.

Conclusion: Unit-aware text representations and geometry-guided fusion significantly boost monocular 3D visual grounding performance, confirming the importance of aligning textual geometric cues with physical measurements.

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

### [64] [Beyond flattening: a geometrically principled positional encoding for vision transformers with Weierstrass elliptic functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19167)
*Zhihang Xin,Xitong Hu,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WEF-PE uses Weierstrass elliptic functions to encode 2D patch coordinates for Vision Transformers, enabling natural 2D spatial priors, monotonic distance relationships, and easy derivation of relative positions, with strong empirical and theoretical claims.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard 1D learned positional embeddings flatten 2D images, destroying spatial structure and lacking geometric constraints. A principled 2D encoding that respects Euclidean distances and translational invariance could improve spatial priors and model inductive bias.

Method: Represent 2D coordinates in the complex plane with Weierstrass elliptic functions, leveraging their doubly periodic nature to encode spatial information. Use the elliptic function's addition formula to compute relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs from absolute encodings. Integrate into ViT, with experiments on CIFAR-100 (from-scratch with ViT-Tiny and fine-tuning with ViT-Base) and VTAB-1k. Theoretical analysis proves a distance-decay property; attention visualizations show improved geometric inductive bias. Code published on GitHub.

Result: Empirical results show strong performance: 63.78% CIFAR-100 from-scratch with ViT-Tiny; 93.28% CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base; consistent VTAB-1k improvements. The approach includes theoretical distance-decay proof and qualitative attention analyses.

Conclusion: WEF-PE provides a principled, 2D geometric positional encoding for ViTs that better preserves spatial structure, improves accuracy and interpretability, and comes with public code for replication.

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision
tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus
compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods
described in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

### [66] [FastMesh:Efficient Artistic Mesh Generation via Component Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19188)
*Jeonghwan Kim,Yushi Lan,Armando Fortes,Yongwei Chen,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Efficient mesh generation by decoupling vertex and face generation: a autoregressively-generated vertex sequence (greatly reduced tokens) plus a bidirectional transformer to build faces, aided by fidelity refinement and post-processing; claims major speedups and quality gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current token-based mesh generation repeats vertices (shared across faces), causing long token sequences and slow generation. Reducing redundancy should speed up generation and enable larger/real-time artistic meshes.

Method: 1) Autoregressive model to generate vertices only; token count limited to ~23% of compact existing tokenizers. 2) A bidirectional transformer constructs the adjacency matrix and completes mesh faces in a single step. 3) Fidelity enhancer refines vertex positions for natural layouts. 4) Post-processing framework removes undesirable edge connections. 5) Experimental validation comparing speed and mesh quality.

Result: Token count reduced to about 23% of prior compact tokenizers; mesh generation speed increased by over 8x; produced higher quality meshes.

Conclusion: Separating vertex and face generation and enrichments (fidelity enhancer and post-processing) significantly reduces redundancy, accelerates generation, and improves mesh quality, with potential implications for real-time artistic mesh synthesis and scalable mesh pipelines.

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

### [67] [All-in-One Slider for Attribute Manipulation in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19195)
*Weixin Ye,Hongguang Zhu,Wei Wang,Yahui Liu,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight All-in-One Slider decomposes text embeddings into sparse attribute directions, enabling general-purpose, continuous control over multiple attributes in text-to-image diffusion; supports zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes and attribute composition, reduces parameter redundancy, and can extend to real-image inversion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current attribute control relies on one-for-one sliders per attribute, causing parameter bloat and limited scalability for rich-detail content. A unified, scalable control mechanism is needed for flexible editing.

Method: Train a sparse-direction decomposition of the text embedding space to yield independent attribute directions. The All-in-One Slider uses these directions for interpretable, fine-grained control. Directions can be recombined to manipulate unseen attributes (zero-shot) and to compose multiple attributes. The method can integrate with inversion to manipulate real images.

Result: Experiments show accurate, scalable attribute manipulation with notable improvements over prior methods, including zero-shot and compositional editing and applicability to real-image inversion.

Conclusion: The All-in-One Slider provides a flexible, lightweight, and scalable solution for multi-attribute control in text-to-image diffusion, enabling zero-shot and compositional editing with broad applicability.

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

*Julian Ost,Andrea Ramazzina,Amogh Joshi,Maximilian Bömer,Mario Bijelic,Felix Heide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-informed pipeline for large-scale 3D driving scene generation that combines proxy geometry with score distillation from 2D priors to produce controllable, geometrically grounded scenes conditioned on map layouts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current neural reconstructions yield static, limited-variability environments; diffusion-based image/video models offer control but lack geometry grounding and causality. There is a need for scalable, geometry-consistent, controllable 3D driving data for robot learning.

Method: Propose a pipeline that jointly generates proxy geometry and an environment representation, then applies score distillation from learned 2D image priors. The system supports prompt-guided geometry, high-fidelity textures, and map-layout conditioning to produce 3D driving scenes with explicit geometry and object permanence, enabling causal novel view synthesis.

Result: The method achieves high controllability and texture/structure fidelity, producing realistic, geometrically consistent 3D driving scenes. It enables causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and provides explicit 3D geometry estimation.

Conclusion: This approach bridges diffusion-based data generation with geometry-grounded 3D scene synthesis, enabling realistic, controllable large-scale 3D driving data with accurate geometry for robot learning and related applications.

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

### [69] [OmniHuman-1.5: Instilling an Active Mind in Avatars via Cognitive Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19209)
*Jianwen Jiang,Weihong Zeng,Zerong Zheng,Jiaqi Yang,Chao Liang,Wang Liao,Han Liang,Yuan Zhang,Mingyuan Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniHuman-1.5 combines multimodal LLM-guided semantic conditioning with a Multimodal DiT and a Pseudo Last Frame to generate semantically coherent and expressive character animations from audio, images, and text, achieving strong lip-sync, video quality, motion naturalness, and semantic alignment, with good extensibility to multi-person and non-human subjects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current video avatar systems produce plausible motions but lack deep semantic embodiment; they primarily synchronize to low-level cues like rhythm and audio without capturing emotion, intent, or scene context.

Method: Two main contributions: (1) use Multimodal Large Language Models to synthesize a structured textual condition representation that provides high-level semantic guidance for motion generation; (2) introduce a Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel Pseudo Last Frame to fuse multimodal inputs and mitigate cross-modal conflicts, enabling interpretations of joint audio-image-text semantics to drive animation.

Result: Extensive experiments show leading performance across metrics including lip-sync accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness, and semantic consistency with textual prompts; demonstrated extensibility to complex scenarios such as multi-person and non-human subjects.

Conclusion: The framework achieves semantically coherent and expressive character animations beyond simple rhythm-based synchronization, via effective multimodal conditioning and fusion. It generalizes well to complex scenes and suggests strong potential for future multimedia avatar systems.

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

*Kaveh Safavigerdini,Ramakrishna Surya,Jaired Collins,Prasad Calyam,Filiz Bunyak,Matthew R. Maschmann,Kannappan Palaniappan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A real-time in-situ CNT tracking framework (VFTrack) automatically detects/tracks CNT particles in SEM sequences, identifying ALIKED + LightGlue as optimal, enabling decomposition of motion and reconstruction of CNT pillar morphologies for real-time CNT synthesis optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Characterizing nanoscale CNT dynamics is impeded by SEM imaging challenges: ex situ methods are static, in situ methods require manual initialization and do not provide continuous per-particle trajectories. A need exists for automated, real-time tracking to link physics-based growth models with observations and enable in-process optimization.

Method: VFTrack integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle-tracking framework. It was trained/evaluated on 13,540 manually annotated CNT trajectories, identifying ALIKED detector with LightGlue matcher as optimal (F1 = 0.78, alpha = 0.89). The pipeline tracks CNT micropillars in SEM sequences, decomposes motion into axial growth, lateral drift, and oscillations, computes regional growth rates, and reconstructs evolving pillar morphologies.

Result: Demonstrated real-time kinematic analysis with quantitative metrics (F1 0.78, alpha 0.89) for CNT tracking. VFTrack enables automated analysis of CNT growth dynamics and morphology evolution, facilitating bridging of physics-based models with experimental observation and enabling real-time synthesis optimization.

Conclusion: VFTrack provides automated in-situ, real-time nano-material characterization by robustly tracking CNTs in SEM images, supporting decomposition of motion and dynamic morphology reconstruction to guide CNT synthesis decisions.

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

*Miran Heo,Sukjun Hwang,Min-Hung Chen,Yu-Chiang Frank Wang,Albert Gu,Seon Joo Kim,Ryo Hachiuma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AUSM is a unified autoregressive model for video segmentation that handles both prompted and unprompted streaming scenarios using a fixed-size spatial state, enabling long-sequence processing and parallelized training, achieving state-of-the-art performance with faster training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field lacks a single, scalable solution for unprompted streaming video segmentation. While prompted approaches (e.g., SAM-based methods) perform well with cues, real-world tasks require detecting/tracking all objects without external prompts, necessitating a universal, efficient model.

Method: Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM) built on state-space models. It maintains a fixed-size spatial state and performs sequential mask prediction across frames, enabling both prompted and unprompted segmentation. The architecture supports parallel training across frames to accelerate learning for long video streams.

Result: On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS 2018/2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019/2021, OVIS), AUSM outperforms prior universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster training on 16-frame sequences.

Conclusion: A single architecture can unify prompted and unprompted streaming video segmentation, scale to arbitrary video lengths with a fixed spatial state, and improve both performance and training efficiency, addressing fragmentation in the current landscape.

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster
training on 16-frame sequences.

*Beiqi Chen,Shuai Shao,Haitang Feng,Jianhuang Lai,Jianlou Si,Guangcong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Style4D-Bench launches the first benchmark for 4D stylization, introducing an evaluation protocol, a strong 4DGS-based baseline (Style4D) with geometry capture, per-Gaussian appearance control, and a geometry-preserving style transfer module, plus a curated set of high-resolution dynamic scenes; results claim state-of-the-art 4D stylization and standardization to accelerate progress.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field of 4D stylization lacks standardized evaluation, making fair comparisons difficult. A benchmark is needed to measure spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and multi-view consistency.

Method: Style4D-Bench provides (1) an evaluation protocol with perceptual and quantitative metrics for spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and multi-view consistency; (2) a strong baseline Style4D based on 4D Gaussian Splatting, featuring (a) a basic 4DGS geometry representation, (b) a Style Gaussian Representation with lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for temporally/spatially aware appearance control, and (c) a Holistic Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module using contrastive coherence learning and content preservation; (3) a curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions and backgrounds.

Result: Experiments show Style4D achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, delivering fine-grained stylistic details, stable temporal dynamics, and consistent multi-view rendering.

Conclusion: Style4D-Bench is a valuable resource for benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes; a project page and code are provided for reproducibility and community adoption.

Abstract: We introduce Style4D-Bench, the first benchmark suite specifically designed
for 4D stylization, with the goal of standardizing evaluation and facilitating
progress in this emerging area. Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive
evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and
multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a
strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a
curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions
and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a
novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key
components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a
Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for
temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic
Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal
consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content
preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained
stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view
rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for
benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes.

### [73] [Articulate3D: Zero-Shot Text-Driven 3D Object Posing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19244)
*Oishi Deb,Anjun Hu,Ashkan Khakzar,Philip Torr,Christian Rupprecht*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Articulate3D is a training-free method that re-purposes a text-conditioned image generator to produce pose-conditioned target images, then optimizes a 3D mesh to match them using keypoints; it achieves robust pose manipulation while preserving identity and outperforms baselines in user studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pose-accurate 3D asset manipulation under language guidance is challenging and often requires training or complex optimization; a scalable, training-free approach that preserves mesh identity is desirable.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) adapt a powerful image generator to condition on the input image and a text instruction to create target images; (2) align the mesh to these targets via multi-view pose optimization. It introduces RSActrl, a self-attention rewiring mechanism that decouples source structure from pose within the generator, enabling consistent structure across poses. Instead of differentiable rendering signals, it uses keypoints to establish correspondences between input and target images for articulation optimization.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness across diverse 3D objects and free-form prompts, manipulating poses while maintaining mesh identity. Quantitative evaluations and a user study show strong performance, with the method preferred over 85% of the time.

Conclusion: Articulate3D provides a training-free, language-controlled 3D pose manipulation pipeline that outperforms existing approaches. It highlights keypoints as more reliable cues than differentiable rendering for articulation and prompts future exploration of robust correspondences and backbones.

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through
language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task
remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

TL;DR: VoxHammer is a training-free 3D editing method that preserves unedited regions and achieves coherent edits by using an inversion trajectory and cached features in a 3D latent space; it outperforms prior methods on 3D consistency and quality, demonstrated on a new Edit3D-Bench benchmark.

Motivation: To enable precise, coherent edits in specified 3D regions for applications in games and robotics, addressing the breakdown of coherence and region preservation in existing multi-view edit-and-reconstruct pipelines.

Method: Compute the model's inversion trajectory to obtain inverted latents and per-timestep key-value tokens. In denoising/editing, replace denoising features of preserved regions with corresponding inverted latents and reuse cached key-value tokens to maintain context, ensuring consistency. The approach is training-free and supported by the newly created Edit3D-Bench for evaluation.

Result: Empirical results show VoxHammer significantly outperforms existing methods in 3D consistency of preserved regions and overall visual quality on the proposed benchmark.

Conclusion: A training-free, latent-space 3D editing framework that yields precise, coherent edits while preserving unedited regions, enabling high-quality edited data for in-context 3D generation and future applications.

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot
interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then
reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

### [75] [Federative ischemic stroke segmentation as alternative to overcome domain-shift multi-institution challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18296)
*Edgar Rangel,Fabio Martinez*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Federated learning (FedAvg) across 14 emulated centers for ischemic stroke lesion segmentation in DWI; achieves competitive generalization, with DSC ~0.71 and robust out-of-distribution performance without additional training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high variability and limited labeled data in lesion segmentation due to differences in demographics, scanners, and annotations; need for cross-institution generalization.

Method: Multi-center federated learning using FedAvg on 2031 studies from 14 centers; center-independent deep representations; evaluated against centralized and other federated baselines; measured DSC, AVD, ALD, LF1.

Result: Overall performance DSC 0.71±0.24, AVD 5.29±22.74, ALD 2.16±3.60, LF1 0.70±0.26. Strong generalization across lesion categories; OOD centers (no extra training) DSC 0.64±0.29, AVD 4.44±8.74.

Conclusion: Federated approach yields generalizable stroke lesion segmentation across institutions, reduces reliance on centralized data, and addresses data scarcity; promising for deployment in multi-center pipelines.

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

### [78] [A Closer Look at Edema Area Segmentation in SD-OCT Images Using Adversarial Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18790)
*Yuhui Tao,Yizhe Zhang,Qiang Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Weakly-supervised edema-area segmentation is improved by adding layer-structure guidance and test-time adaptation to an adversarial framework, aligning EA predictions with retinal layers to better reflect shape priors and improve robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-level annotation for macular edema in SD-OCT is expensive; existing weakly-supervised methods underperform compared with fully-supervised approaches. Exploiting the known correlation between edema areas and retinal layers can guide segmentation without full supervision.

Method: Enhance a weakly-supervised adversarial EA segmentation model with a novel layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA) strategy. Incorporate retinal layer information to reframe EA prediction as confirming intersections between EA contours and retinal layers, leveraging layer-related shape priors.

Result: On two public datasets, the proposed ingredients improve accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, narrowing the gap between weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

Conclusion: Layer-structure guidance combined with TTA effectively boosts weakly-supervised EA segmentation, making predictions more consistent with retinal anatomy and more robust to train-test discrepancies.

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME)
analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which
are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based
weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation
task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this
paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the
update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an
off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel
layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA)
strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework
reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points
between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that
better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further
helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA
between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly
available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove
the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between
weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

### [79] [Understanding Benefits and Pitfalls of Current Methods for the Segmentation of Undersampled MRI Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18975)
*Jan Nikolas Morshuis,Matthias Hein,Christian F. Baumgartner*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: Unified benchmark shows two-stage reconstruction+segmentation with data-consistency outperforms many complex one-stage methods for undersampled MRI segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of standardized comparisons in accelerated MRI segmentation and to identify whether one-stage (end-to-end) or two-stage (reconstruction followed by segmentation) pipelines perform best under a common evaluation framework.

Method: Evaluate seven approaches (one-stage and two-stage) on two multi-coil k-space MRI datasets with human segmentation ground-truth, focusing on segmentation performance and data-consistency constraints.

Result: Two-stage methods incorporating data-consistency achieved the strongest segmentation scores, outperforming several specialized one-stage models; the unified benchmark clarifies relative strengths and indicates no single method is universally best.

Conclusion: For segmentation on undersampled MRI, simple two-stage pipelines with data-consistency are often superior; unified benchmarks are essential for fair comparison and progress in the field.

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize
patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI
acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and
increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial
research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI
acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the
fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly
reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary
goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing
interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated
MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed
in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or
private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no
high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal
strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper
provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI
data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing
\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation
into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize
established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We
test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as
well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple
two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation
scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically
for this task.

### [80] [RDDM: Practicing RAW Domain Diffusion Model for Real-world Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19154)
*Yan Chen,Yi Wen,Wei Li,Junchao Liu,Yong Guo,Jie Hu,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: RDDM is an end-to-end RAW-domain diffusion model that restores photo-realistic images directly from sensor RAW data, outperforming sRGB diffusion methods by integrating RVAE, differentiable Post Tone Processing, and CMB LoRA, with synthetic RAW data and scalable degradation pipeline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of sRGB-domain diffusion (lossy inputs, ISP+IR pipeline, lack of RAW access on edge devices) and address out-of-distribution issues when adapting pre-trained models to RAW domain, plus data scarcity.

Method: Key components: RAW-domain VAE (RVAE) for optimal latent representations; differentiable Post Tone Processing (PTP) enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization; scalable degradation pipeline to synthesize RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets; configurable multi-bayer (CMB) LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns (e.g., RGGB, BGGR). End-to-end diffusion in the RAW domain replacing the conventional ISP+IR pipeline.

Result: Extensive experiments show RDDM outperforms state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion methods, delivering higher fidelity with fewer artifacts.

Conclusion: RDDM demonstrates that RAW-domain diffusion with RVAE, PTP, and CMBLoRA can bypass limitations of sRGB-based approaches, enable scalable training from synthetic RAW data, and improve image fidelity, with potential applicability to edge devices.

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

### [81] [Mining the Long Tail: A Comparative Study of Data-Centric Criticality Metrics for Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Motion Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18397)
*Antonio Guillen-Perez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Non-uniform data curation in offline RL dramatically boosts AV safety; uncertainty-based weighting gives the largest gains, with timestep-level weighting improving reactive safety and scenario-level weighting aiding long-horizon planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle severe data imbalance in real-world driving logs that causes brittle policies; focus learning on information-rich samples to improve safety and reliability.

Method: Investigate six criticality weighting schemes across three families (heuristic-, uncertainty-, behavior-based) evaluated at two temporal scales (timestep and complete scenario). Train seven goal-conditioned Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) agents with an attention-based architecture, evaluated in the Waymax simulator.

Result: All data curation methods outperform the baseline; data-driven, uncertainty-based curation yields the strongest safety improvements, reducing collisions from 16.0% to 5.5%. A trade-off emerges: timestep-level weighting enhances reactive safety, while scenario-level weighting improves long-horizon planning.

Conclusion: Intelligent, non-uniform sampling is a critical component for building safe and reliable offline RL policies for autonomous agents; provides a comprehensive framework for data curation in Offline RL with clear safety benefits.

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising paradigm for
training autonomous vehicle (AV) planning policies from large-scale, real-world
driving logs. However, the extreme data imbalance in these logs, where mundane
scenarios vastly outnumber rare "long-tail" events, leads to brittle and unsafe
policies when using standard uniform data sampling. In this work, we address
this challenge through a systematic, large-scale comparative study of data
curation strategies designed to focus the learning process on information-rich
samples. We investigate six distinct criticality weighting schemes which are
categorized into three families: heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and
behavior-based. These are evaluated at two temporal scales, the individual
timestep and the complete scenario. We train seven goal-conditioned
Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) agents with a state-of-the-art, attention-based
architecture and evaluate them in the high-fidelity Waymax simulator. Our
results demonstrate that all data curation methods significantly outperform the
baseline. Notably, data-driven curation using model uncertainty as a signal
achieves the most significant safety improvements, reducing the collision rate
by nearly three-fold (from 16.0% to 5.5%). Furthermore, we identify a clear
trade-off where timestep-level weighting excels at reactive safety while
scenario-level weighting improves long-horizon planning. Our work provides a
comprehensive framework for data curation in Offline RL and underscores that
intelligent, non-uniform sampling is a critical component for building safe and
reliable autonomous agents.

Abstract: Automating complex tasks using robotic systems requires skills for planning,
control and execution. This paper proposes a complete robotic system for
maintenance automation, which can automate disassembly and assembly operations
under environmental uncertainties (e.g. deviations between prior plan
information). The cognition of the robotic system is based on a planning
approach (using CAD and RGBD data) and includes a method to interpret a
symbolic plan and transform it to a set of executable robot instructions. The
complete system is experimentally evaluated using real-world applications. This
work shows the first step to transfer these theoretical results into a
practical robotic solution.

TL;DR: An autonomous maintenance planning framework that fuses offline CAD data with online RGB-D perception, using a novel sampling-based disassembly-space planner and adaptive path planning, with experimental validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maintenance tasks for factory automation require autonomous manipulation and path planning with low computational complexity and robustness to environmental uncertainties; current methods often separate offline design data from online perception, hindering real-time autonomy.

Method: 1) Fuse offline CAD data with online RGB-D data via a probabilistic filter to compensate for uncertainties. 2) Planning uses a symbolic description combined with a novel sampling-based method to compute the disassembly space. 3) Path planning employs global state-of-the-art algorithms with an adaptive exploration-step size to reduce planning time. 4) All components are experimentally validated and discussed.

Result: All proposed methods are experimentally validated; the abstract reports validation and discussion of results, indicating feasibility and practical applicability.

Conclusion: The work integrates CAD-based offline knowledge with visual perception for autonomous maintenance planning, introduces a novel disassembly-space planning technique and adaptive-path planning to improve efficiency and robustness, and validates the approach experimentally.

Abstract: The research and development of intelligent automation solutions is a
ground-breaking point for the factory of the future. A promising and
challenging mission is the use of autonomous robot systems to automate tasks in
the field of maintenance. For this purpose, the robot system must be able to
plan autonomously the different manipulation tasks and the corresponding paths.
Basic requirements are the development of algorithms with a low computational
complexity and the possibility to deal with environmental uncertainties. In
this work, an approach is presented, which is especially suited to solve the
problem of maintenance automation. For this purpose, offline data from CAD is
combined with online data from an RGBD vision system via a probabilistic
filter, to compensate uncertainties from offline data. For planning the
different tasks, a method is explained, which use a symbolic description,
founded on a novel sampling-based method to compute the disassembly space. For
path planning we use global state-of-the art algorithms with a method that
allows the adaption of the exploration stepsize in order to reduce the planning
time. Every method is experimentally validated and discussed.

Abstract: Soft pneumatic robot manipulators are popular in industrial and

and our sim-to-real pipeline provide a novel, easily implementable, and robust
sensing methodology for soft robots, paving the way for the development of more

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Neuromorphic, associative-learning framework for robot autonomy inspired by rodent spatial cognition, enabling online learning in dynamic environments using place/grid cell models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-driven AI requires large datasets and power; SWaP-constrained tasks (e.g., planetary exploration) demand energy-efficient, adaptive autonomy. Associative learning in animals offers a compact, online learning paradigm that can be transferred to robotics.

Method: Emulate associative learning observed in rodents with neuromorphic hardware and spatial cell models (place/grid cells) in open-field maze scenarios; enable online, real-time learning of associations between concurrent events and spatial cues to guide navigation; integrate biology-inspired models to improve autonomous spatial tasks.

Result: The abstract outlines a conceptual framework and anticipated outcomes rather than reporting empirical results; no experimental data are presented.

Conclusion:  Bridging biological spatial cognition with neuromorphic robotics may yield autonomous, energy-efficient systems capable of adapting to dynamic environments, advancing SWaP-constrained applications such as planetary exploration.

Abstract: Data-driven Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches have exhibited remarkable
prowess across various cognitive tasks using extensive training data. However,
the reliance on large datasets and neural networks presents challenges such as
highpower consumption and limited adaptability, particularly in
SWaP-constrained applications like planetary exploration. To address these
issues, we propose enhancing the autonomous capabilities of intelligent robots
by emulating the associative learning observed in animals. Associative learning
enables animals to adapt to their environment by memorizing concurrent events.
By replicating this mechanism, neuromorphic robots can navigate dynamic
environments autonomously, learning from interactions to optimize performance.
This paper explores the emulation of associative learning in rodents using
neuromorphic robots within open-field maze environments, leveraging insights
from spatial cells such as place and grid cells. By integrating these models,
we aim to enable online associative learning for spatial tasks in real-time
scenarios, bridging the gap between biological spatial cognition and robotics
for advancements in autonomous systems.

### [86] [SignLoc: Robust Localization using Navigation Signs and Public Maps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18606)
*Nicky Zimmerman,Joel Loo,Ayush Agrawal,David Hsu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SignLoc localizes a robot globally on maps by matching detected navigation signs to a graph derived from floor plans or OpenStreetMap, using a probabilistic observation model within Monte Carlo localization; it achieves reliable localization after 1–2 signs across large environments without prior sensor-based mapping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Navigation signs are ubiquitous, inexpensive to detect, and already encoded in public maps. Robots rarely exploit them for global localization, leading to reliance on costly sensor-based mapping. SignLoc aims to leverage existing maps and signs to enable scalable, map-based localization.

Method: Extract a navigation graph from the input map (floor plan or OSM). Use a probabilistic observation model to relate sign detections (directional and locational cues) to the graph. Employ Monte Carlo localization to estimate the robot pose on the graph, enabling topo-semantic localization without prior sensor mapping.

Result: Evaluated in diverse large-scale settings (university campus segment, shopping mall, hospital complex). SignLoc reliably localizes the robot after observing only one to two signs.

Conclusion: SignLoc demonstrates that global localization on existing maps is feasible by exploiting navigation signs, reducing the need for prior map-building and enabling robust, scalable localization in real-world environments.

Abstract: Navigation signs and maps, such as floor plans and street maps, are widely
available and serve as ubiquitous aids for way-finding in human environments.
Yet, they are rarely used by robot systems. This paper presents SignLoc, a
global localization method that leverages navigation signs to localize the
robot on publicly available maps -- specifically floor plans and OpenStreetMap
(OSM) graphs--without prior sensor-based mapping. SignLoc first extracts a
navigation graph from the input map. It then employs a probabilistic
observation model to match directional and locational cues from the detected
signs to the graph, enabling robust topo-semantic localization within a Monte
Carlo framework. We evaluated SignLoc in diverse large-scale environments: part
of a university campus, a shopping mall, and a hospital complex. Experimental
results show that SignLoc reliably localizes the robot after observing only one
to two signs.

*Ziyuan Jiao,Yida Niu,Zeyu Zhang,Yangyang Wu,Yao Su,Yixin Zhu,Hangxin Liu,Song-Chun Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A unified A-Space planning framework for long-horizon mobile manipulation that integrates scene kinematics into planning and uses tri-level planning; demonstrates improved task success and generalizes to articulated objects.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the fragmentation between navigation and manipulation in long-horizon tasks; need to consider joint reachability of the base, arm, and manipulated objects in a unified planning space; leverage kinematic models of the scene to guide planning.

Method: Construct Augmented Configuration Apace (A-Space) by embedding environmental kinematics into robot config; tri-level planning: task planner for symbolic action sequences, optimization-based motion planner for continuous trajectories in A-Space, and plan refinement to ensure long-horizon feasibility.

Result: Simulation shows 84.6% higher task success rate vs baselines; real-robot experiments with seven rigid/articulated object types across 17 contexts; capable of long-horizon tasks up to 14 steps; demonstrates scalability and generalizability of the approach.

Conclusion: Modeling scene kinematics within planning entities rather than hard-coding task-specific constraints yields scalable, generalizable capabilities for complex mobile manipulation.

Abstract: We present a Sequential Mobile Manipulation Planning (SMMP) framework that
can solve long-horizon multi-step mobile manipulation tasks with coordinated
whole-body motion, even when interacting with articulated objects. By
abstracting environmental structures as kinematic models and integrating them
with the robot's kinematics, we construct an Augmented Configuration Apace
(A-Space) that unifies the previously separate task constraints for navigation
and manipulation, while accounting for the joint reachability of the robot
base, arm, and manipulated objects. This integration facilitates efficient
planning within a tri-level framework: a task planner generates symbolic action
sequences to model the evolution of A-Space, an optimization-based motion
planner computes continuous trajectories within A-Space to achieve desired
configurations for both the robot and scene elements, and an intermediate plan
refinement stage selects action goals that ensure long-horizon feasibility. Our
simulation studies first confirm that planning in A-Space achieves an 84.6\%
higher task success rate compared to baseline methods. Validation on real
robotic systems demonstrates fluid mobile manipulation involving (i) seven
types of rigid and articulated objects across 17 distinct contexts, and (ii)
long-horizon tasks of up to 14 sequential steps. Our results highlight the
significance of modeling scene kinematics into planning entities, rather than
encoding task-specific constraints, offering a scalable and generalizable
approach to complex robotic manipulation.

TL;DR: Assesses ISO 23247 reference architecture for automotive digital twins via a 1/10-scale Adaptive Cruise Control DT; finds it feasible as a starting point but with notable gaps, and outlines future directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automotive digital twins lack tailored architectural guidelines; ISO 23247 exists but is not automotive-specific, necessitating evaluation of its suitability and guidance for automotive DT development.

Method: Case study approach: implement an Adaptive Cruise Control digital twin for a 1/10-scale autonomous vehicle, evaluate how well the ISO 23247 reference architecture supports automotive DT needs, identify strengths and limitations, and derive implications.

Result: The study identifies strengths and limitations of the ISO 23247 reference architecture when applied to automotive DTs and outlines initial directions for researchers, practitioners, and standard developers.

Conclusion: ISO 23247 can serve as a viable starting point for automotive DT architecture, but automotive-specific adaptations and further standardization efforts are needed; the work initiates a roadmap for future research and practice.

Abstract: Digital twin (DT) technology has become of interest in the automotive
industry. There is a growing need for smarter services that utilize the unique
capabilities of DTs, ranging from computer-aided remote control to cloud-based
fleet coordination. Developing such services starts with the software
architecture. However, the scarcity of DT architectural guidelines poses a
challenge for engineering automotive DTs. Currently, the only DT architectural
standard is the one defined in ISO 23247. Though not developed for automotive
systems, it is one of the few feasible starting points for automotive DTs. In
this work, we investigate the suitability of the ISO 23247 reference
architecture for developing automotive DTs. Through the case study of
developing an Adaptive Cruise Control DT for a 1/10\textsuperscript{th}-scale
autonomous vehicle, we identify some strengths and limitations of the reference
architecture and begin distilling future directions for researchers,
practitioners, and standard developers.

*Himanshu Gaurav Singh,Pieter Abbeel,Jitendra Malik,Antonio Loquercio*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Train sensorimotor policies via reinforcement learning by imitating a human-motion predictor, enabling zero-shot transfer to robots without gradient-based retargeting or dense rewards, and achieving strong performance across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the embodiment gap between humans and robots and unlock the large-scale, diverse human interaction datasets for robot learning. Conventional retargeting and dense reward schemes limit scalability; a scalable, cross-domain transfer from human motion to robots is desirable.

Method: Train a model to predict future human motion. Observe that motion of keypoints on human-inspired robot end-effectors mirrors corresponding human keypoints, enabling zero-shot transfer. Train robot policies to track the model's predictions, conditioned on a history of past robot states, using a relatively sparse task reward. This bypasses gradient-based kinematic retargeting and adversarial losses and leverages large human datasets.

Result: The approach works across different robots and tasks and outperforms existing baselines by a large margin. Tracking the human motion model can substitute for carefully designed dense rewards and curricula in manipulation tasks. Code, data, and qualitative results are provided by the authors.

Conclusion: Leveraging human motion models for robot learning offers a scalable, data-efficient path to cross-domain generalization, reducing reliance on costly retargeting and dense supervision while achieving strong task performance.

Abstract: As the embodiment gap between a robot and a human narrows, new opportunities
arise to leverage datasets of humans interacting with their surroundings for
robot learning. We propose a novel technique for training sensorimotor policies
with reinforcement learning by imitating predictive models of human motions.
Our key insight is that the motion of keypoints on human-inspired robot
end-effectors closely mirrors the motion of corresponding human body keypoints.
This enables us to use a model trained to predict future motion on human data
\emph{zero-shot} on robot data. We train sensorimotor policies to track the
predictions of such a model, conditioned on a history of past robot states,
while optimizing a relatively sparse task reward. This approach entirely
bypasses gradient-based kinematic retargeting and adversarial losses, which
limit existing methods from fully leveraging the scale and diversity of modern
human-scene interaction datasets. Empirically, we find that our approach can
work across robots and tasks, outperforming existing baselines by a large
margin. In addition, we find that tracking a human motion model can substitute
for carefully designed dense rewards and curricula in manipulation tasks. Code,

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AgriChrono introduces a robotic data collection platform and a multi-modal, time-synchronized dataset to capture dynamic real-world agricultural environments, enabling robust generalization of 3D reconstruction models; public release of code and data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current precision-agriculture datasets are mostly collected in static/controlled settings with limited sensor diversity and short temporal span, which limits model robustness to real-field dynamics such as illumination changes, crop growth, and disturbances.

Method: Development of AgriChrono platform with RGB, Depth, LiDAR, and IMU sensors, enabling remote, time-synchronized long-term data collection across varying illumination and growth stages; benchmarking of state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction models on the dataset; public code/data release.

Result: Demonstrates the difficulty of 3D reconstruction in real-world field environments and shows the dataset's value for advancing model generalization under dynamic conditions.

Conclusion: AgriChrono provides a valuable research asset for advancing robust model generalization in dynamic agricultural settings; supports repeatable, multimodal data collection and long-term studies; code and dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: Existing datasets for precision agriculture have primarily been collected in
static or controlled environments such as indoor labs or greenhouses, often
with limited sensor diversity and restricted temporal span. These conditions
fail to reflect the dynamic nature of real farmland, including illumination
changes, crop growth variation, and natural disturbances. As a result, models
trained on such data often lack robustness and generalization when applied to
real-world field scenarios. In this paper, we present AgriChrono, a novel
robotic data collection platform and multi-modal dataset designed to capture
the dynamic conditions of real-world agricultural environments. Our platform
integrates multiple sensors and enables remote, time-synchronized acquisition
of RGB, Depth, LiDAR, and IMU data, supporting efficient and repeatable
long-term data collection across varying illumination and crop growth stages.
We benchmark a range of state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction models on the
AgriChrono dataset, highlighting the difficulty of reconstruction in real-world
field environments and demonstrating its value as a research asset for
advancing model generalization under dynamic conditions. The code and dataset

*Santosh Thoduka,Sebastian Houben,Juergen Gall,Paul G. Plöger*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Video-based robotic failure detection leveraging spatio-temporal cues (actions and task-relevant objects) with dataset annotations and frame-rate augmentation; shows improved F1 on ARMBench (77.9→80.0, 81.4 with test-time augmentation).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need robust, generalizable failure detection for real-world robotic task execution; many methods underperform across diverse scenarios; existing cues (actions/objects) are commonly available but underutilized.

Method: Propose a video-based failure detector that uses spatio-temporal knowledge: the robot's actions and task-relevant objects in view. Extend three datasets with annotations of these cues, apply data augmentation via variable frame rates across video segments, and evaluate with and without test-time augmentation.

Result: Achieves F1 improvements on ARMBench from 77.9 to 80.0, with a further increase to 81.4 using test-time augmentation; highlights the value of incorporating spatio-temporal information for failure detection.

Conclusion: Spatio-temporal information about actions and objects is beneficial for failure detection in robotic tasks; encourages future heuristics and methods to better leverage these cues; code and annotations are publicly available.

Abstract: Robust robotic task execution hinges on the reliable detection of execution
failures in order to trigger safe operation modes, recovery strategies, or task
replanning. However, many failure detection methods struggle to provide
meaningful performance when applied to a variety of real-world scenarios. In
this paper, we propose a video-based failure detection approach that uses
spatio-temporal knowledge in the form of the actions the robot performs and
task-relevant objects within the field of view. Both pieces of information are
available in most robotic scenarios and can thus be readily obtained. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on three datasets that we amend,
in part, with additional annotations of the aforementioned task-relevant
knowledge. In light of the results, we also propose a data augmentation method
that improves performance by applying variable frame rates to different parts
of the video. We observe an improvement from 77.9 to 80.0 in F1 score on the
ARMBench dataset without additional computational expense and an additional
increase to 81.4 with test-time augmentation. The results emphasize the
importance of spatio-temporal information during failure detection and suggest
further investigation of suitable heuristics in future implementations. Code

*Li Sun,Jiefeng Wu,Feng Chen,Ruizhe Liu,Yanchao Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HyperTASR introduces a hypernetwork that dynamically modulates scene representations using task specifications and progression state, creating separate task-contextual and state-dependent processing paths to improve manipulation policy learning, with demonstrated gains in simulation and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current representation learning for robotic manipulation relies on task-agnostic, static features that fail to mimic the human ability to adapt perception to task goals and execution phase. There is a need for representations that evolve with task objectives and progression.

Method: A hypernetwork-driven framework dynamically generates representation transformation parameters conditioned on task specifications and task progression state. It enforces a computational separation between task-contextual and state-dependent processing paths, rather than simple feature fusion, while remaining compatible with existing policy learning pipelines.

Result: Empirical evaluations in both simulation and real-world environments show substantial performance improvements across different representation paradigms. Ablation studies and attention visualizations demonstrate selective prioritization of task-relevant scene information and improved learning efficiency.

Conclusion: Dynamic, task- and phase-aware representation modulation via a hypernetwork can closely mimic human adaptive perception in manipulation tasks, yielding improved policy learning and representational quality while integrating with existing robotics frameworks.

Abstract: Effective policy learning for robotic manipulation requires scene
representations that selectively capture task-relevant environmental features.
Current approaches typically employ task-agnostic representation extraction,
failing to emulate the dynamic perceptual adaptation observed in human
cognition. We present HyperTASR, a hypernetwork-driven framework that modulates
scene representations based on both task objectives and the execution phase.
Our architecture dynamically generates representation transformation parameters
conditioned on task specifications and progression state, enabling
representations to evolve contextually throughout task execution. This approach
maintains architectural compatibility with existing policy learning frameworks
while fundamentally reconfiguring how visual features are processed. Unlike
methods that simply concatenate or fuse task embeddings with task-agnostic
representations, HyperTASR establishes computational separation between
task-contextual and state-dependent processing paths, enhancing learning
efficiency and representational quality. Comprehensive evaluations in both
simulation and real-world environments demonstrate substantial performance
improvements across different representation paradigms. Through ablation
studies and attention visualization, we confirm that our approach selectively
prioritizes task-relevant scene information, closely mirroring human adaptive
perception during manipulation tasks. The project website is at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PbRL with Reward Ensemble under Confidence (REC) improves learning stability and performance for agile drone control, achieving near-shaped reward performance and enabling sim-to-real transfer, outperforming standard Preference PPO; demonstrates applicability to MuJoCo and reveals limitations of handcrafted rewards.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address difficulty of reward specification for complex, subjective control tasks; leverage human preferences to learn motion style and task objectives in acrobatic flight and other continuous-control domains.

Method: Extend Preference PPO with a probabilistic reward model called Reward Ensemble under Confidence (REC); train in simulation, transfer to real drones for acrobatic maneuvers; validate REC in MuJoCo and compare to manually designed rewards.

Result: REC achieves 88.4% of shaped reward performance vs 55.2% for standard Preference PPO; successful sim-to-real transfer allowing multiple acrobatic maneuvers; probabilistic reward model demonstrates utility in MuJoCo; handcrafted rewards show only 60.7% agreement with human preferences.

Conclusion: PbRL with REC is an effective approach for learning human-centered objectives in both physical and simulated domains, offering improvements over standard PbRL and highlighting the limitations of manually designed rewards.

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) enables agents to learn
control policies without requiring manually designed reward functions, making
it well-suited for tasks where objectives are difficult to formalize or
inherently subjective. Acrobatic flight poses a particularly challenging
problem due to its complex dynamics, rapid movements, and the importance of
precise execution. In this work, we explore the use of PbRL for agile drone
control, focusing on the execution of dynamic maneuvers such as powerloops.
Building on Preference-based Proximal Policy Optimization (Preference PPO), we
propose Reward Ensemble under Confidence (REC), an extension to the reward
learning objective that improves preference modeling and learning stability.
Our method achieves 88.4% of the shaped reward performance, compared to 55.2%
with standard Preference PPO. We train policies in simulation and successfully
transfer them to real-world drones, demonstrating multiple acrobatic maneuvers
where human preferences emphasize stylistic qualities of motion. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the applicability of our probabilistic reward model in a
representative MuJoCo environment for continuous control. Finally, we highlight
the limitations of manually designed rewards, observing only 60.7% agreement
with human preferences. These results underscore the effectiveness of PbRL in
capturing complex, human-centered objectives across both physical and simulated
domains.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AS2FM translates extended SCXML models of ROS 2 and BT-based robotic systems into JANI for fast, scalable statistical model checking, with a real-world case study showing sub-second verification on consumer hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous robots must operate in unpredictable environments; verifying their behavior at design-time requires scalable, feature-rich modeling and verification tools beyond traditional methods. The work aims to enable comprehensive, scalable verification by bridging robotic system modeling (ROS 2, BT) with quantitative model checking.

Method: Extend SCXML to model ROS 2 and Behavior Tree features; implement AS2FM to translate the full system model into JANI; apply off-the-shelf statistical model checking tools on the JANI model; benchmark performance and compare scalability against state-of-the-art.

Result: Demonstrates practical usability: a ROS 2-based robotic manipulation use case is verifiable in under one second on consumer hardware; linear scaling with model size; broader feature support than existing approaches; shows feasibility of design-time verification for complex autonomous robots.

Conclusion: The approach provides a practical pathway for reliable, scalable verification of autonomous robotic systems at design-time, leveraging a standard intermediate representation (JANI) and a dedicated translation tool (AS2FM) to enable fast SMC-based verification.

Abstract: Designing robotic systems to act autonomously in unforeseen environments is a
challenging task. This work presents a novel approach to use formal
verification, specifically Statistical Model Checking (SMC), to verify system
properties of autonomous robots at design-time. We introduce an extension of
the SCXML format, designed to model system components including both Robot
Operating System 2 (ROS 2) and Behavior Tree (BT) features. Further, we
contribute Autonomous Systems to Formal Models (AS2FM), a tool to translate the
full system model into JANI. The use of JANI, a standard format for
quantitative model checking, enables verification of system properties with
off-the-shelf SMC tools. We demonstrate the practical usability of AS2FM both
in terms of applicability to real-world autonomous robotic control systems, and
in terms of verification runtime scaling. We provide a case study, where we
successfully identify problems in a ROS 2-based robotic manipulation use case
that is verifiable in less than one second using consumer hardware.
Additionally, we compare to the state of the art and demonstrate that our
method is more comprehensive in system feature support, and that the
verification runtime scales linearly with the size of the model, instead of
exponentially.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A robust, uncertainty-adaptive VisionSafe VPC for autonomous laparoscope control using GPR-based uncertainty quantification and probabilistic safety guarantees via CBFs and chance constraints, achieving near-perfect FoV safety and reduced unnecessary camera motion on a commercial MIS robot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve surgeon visual experience and procedural safety in autonomous MIS camera control by addressing continuous visibility requirements and disturbances (model error, noise, payload uncertainty) that degrade IBVS.

Method: Use Gaussian Process Regression to quantify residual model and external disturbances (hybrid deterministic + stochastic). Develop an uncertainty-aware trajectory optimization with probabilistic guarantees, employing a Control Barrier Function condition and chance constraints based on uncertainty propagation; adapt control effort to uncertainty; validate on MicroPort MedBot Toumai performing sequential multi-target lymph node dissection.

Result: Demonstrates near-perfect target visibility (>99.9%), with reduced unnecessary camera motion and improved robustness against disturbances; outperform baseline methods in simulations and experiments on a commercial platform.

Conclusion: VisionSafeEnhanced VPC provides robust, uncertainty-aware autonomous laparoscope control with FoV safety guarantees under uncertainty, highlighting potential for safer and more reliable MIS automation.

Abstract: Autonomous control of the laparoscope in robot-assisted Minimally Invasive
Surgery (MIS) has received considerable research interest due to its potential
to improve surgical safety. Despite progress in pixel-level Image-Based Visual
Servoing (IBVS) control, the requirement of continuous visibility and the
existence of complex disturbances, such as parameterization error, measurement
noise, and uncertainties of payloads, could degrade the surgeon's visual
experience and compromise procedural safety. To address these limitations, this
paper proposes VisionSafeEnhanced Visual Predictive Control (VPC), a robust and
uncertainty-adaptive framework for autonomous laparoscope control that
guarantees Field of View (FoV) safety under uncertainty. Firstly, Gaussian
Process Regression (GPR) is utilized to perform hybrid (deterministic +
stochastic) quantification of operational uncertainties including residual
model uncertainties, stochastic uncertainties, and external disturbances. Based
on uncertainty quantification, a novel safety aware trajectory optimization
framework with probabilistic guarantees is proposed, where a
uncertainty-adaptive safety Control Barrier Function (CBF) condition is given
based on uncertainty propagation, and chance constraints are simultaneously
formulated based on probabilistic approximation. This uncertainty aware
formulation enables adaptive control effort allocation, minimizing unnecessary
camera motion while maintaining robustness. The proposed method is validated
through comparative simulations and experiments on a commercial surgical robot
platform (MicroPort MedBot Toumai) performing a sequential multi-target lymph
node dissection. Compared with baseline methods, the framework maintains
near-perfect target visibility (>99.9%), reduces tracking e

*Hichem Cheriet,Khellat Kihel Badra,Chouraqui Samira*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TIG (Tangent Intersection Guidance) is a UAV path-planning algorithm for static and dynamic environments that uses an elliptic tangent intersection method to create feasible paths, generates two sub-paths per threat, selects the best via a heuristic, and iteratively refines the route with a quadratic Bézier smoothing step to satisfy kinematic/dynamic constraints, achieving faster, shorter, and smoother paths than several baseline planners and enabling real-time planning in unknown or partially known environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle navigation must be safe and efficient across static and dynamic scenes, including unknown environments. Existing planners often trade off path optimality, computation time, and safety. There is a need for a real-time, smooth, kinematics-aware planner that can handle multiple threats and dynamic obstacles.

Method: 1) Use elliptic tangent intersection to generate candidate sub-paths for each threat, producing two sub-paths per threat. 2) Apply a heuristic rule to select the optimal route among candidates. 3) Iteratively refine the path until the target is reached. 4) Apply a modified smoothing step based on quadratic Bézier curves to enforce UAV kinematic/dynamic constraints and produce a smooth, efficient trajectory.

Result: Empirical results show TIG yields the shortest path faster than A*, PRM, RRT*, Tangent Graph, and Static APPATT in static environments, starting from 0.01 s and with fewer turning angles. In unknown/partially known environments, TIG demonstrates efficient real-time planning for collision avoidance and outperforms APF and Dynamic APPATT.

Conclusion: TIG provides an efficient, safe, and real-time capable UAV path-planning framework for both static and dynamic environments, delivering shorter, smoother paths with reduced turning and competitive planning times compared to established planners.

Abstract: Efficient and safe navigation of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is critical
for various applications, including combat support, package delivery and Search
and Rescue Operations. This paper introduces the Tangent Intersection Guidance
(TIG) algorithm, an advanced approach for UAV path planning in both static and
dynamic environments. The algorithm uses the elliptic tangent intersection
method to generate feasible paths. It generates two sub-paths for each threat,
selects the optimal route based on a heuristic rule, and iteratively refines
the path until the target is reached. Considering the UAV kinematic and dynamic
constraints, a modified smoothing technique based on quadratic B\'ezier curves
is adopted to generate a smooth and efficient route. Experimental results show
that the TIG algorithm can generate the shortest path in less time, starting
from 0.01 seconds, with fewer turning angles compared to A*, PRM, RRT*, Tangent
Graph, and Static APPATT algorithms in static environments. Furthermore, in
completely unknown and partially known environments, TIG demonstrates efficient
real-time path planning capabilities for collision avoidance, outperforming APF
and Dynamic APPATT algorithms.

Motivation: Achieving behavioral similarity and appropriateness in human-like motion across different robot embodiments is challenging, due to a lack of cross-embodiment adaptability and potential mismatches between generation and execution.

Method: Proposes HuBE, a bi-level closed-loop framework that fuses robot state, goal poses, and contextual situations to generate human-like behaviors; introduces HPose, a context-enriched dataset with fine-grained situational annotations; and employs a bone scaling-based data augmentation strategy to ensure mm-level cross-robot compatibility.

Result: HuBE substantially improves motion similarity, behavioral appropriateness, and computational efficiency over state-of-the-art baselines, as demonstrated on multiple commercial platforms.

Conclusion: HuBE enables transferable, human-like behavior execution across diverse humanoid robots, addressing cross-embodiment adaptability and execution alignment.

Abstract: Achieving both behavioral similarity and appropriateness in human-like motion
generation for humanoid robot remains an open challenge, further compounded by
the lack of cross-embodiment adaptability. To address this problem, we propose
HuBE, a bi-level closed-loop framework that integrates robot state, goal poses,
and contextual situations to generate human-like behaviors, ensuring both
behavioral similarity and appropriateness, and eliminating structural
mismatches between motion generation and execution. To support this framework,
we construct HPose, a context-enriched dataset featuring fine-grained
situational annotations. Furthermore, we introduce a bone scaling-based data
augmentation strategy that ensures millimeter-level compatibility across
heterogeneous humanoid robots. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple commercial
platforms demonstrate that HuBE significantly improves motion similarity,
behavioral appropriateness, and computational efficiency over state-of-the-art
baselines, establishing a solid foundation for transferable and human-like

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NRTrans introduces a natural-robotic language translation framework that ensures the correctness of LLM-generated robot control programs through a Robot Skill Language (RSL) and a compiler/debugger, with feedback-based fine-tuning, achieving higher success rates especially for lightweight LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs are increasingly used to generate robot control programs but produce many errors, especially with lightweight models. There's a need for correctness verification and learning from mistakes to improve reliability and applicability of LLM-powered robotics.

Method: Propose Robot Skill Language (RSL) to abstract robot control details; develop an RSL compiler and debugger to verify LLM-generated RSL programs; provide error feedback to LLMs to refine outputs; implement a feedback loop with fine-tuning to ensure programs are verified before execution.

Result: NRTrans outperforms existing methods across multiple LLMs and tasks, achieving a high success rate for lightweight LLMs.

Conclusion: A correctness-guaranteeing framework for LLM-generated robotic programs, significantly enhancing the effectiveness and reliability of LLM-powered robotics.

Abstract: The Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly being deployed in robotics
to generate robot control programs for specific user tasks, enabling embodied
intelligence. Existing methods primarily focus on LLM training and prompt
design that utilize LLMs to generate executable programs directly from user
tasks in natural language. However, due to the inconsistency of the LLMs and
the high complexity of the tasks, such best-effort approaches often lead to
tremendous programming errors in the generated code, which significantly
undermines the effectiveness especially when the light-weight LLMs are applied.
This paper introduces a natural-robotic language translation framework that (i)
provides correctness verification for generated control programs and (ii)
enhances the performance of LLMs in program generation via feedback-based
fine-tuning for the programs. To achieve this, a Robot Skill Language (RSL) is
proposed to abstract away from the intricate details of the control programs,
bridging the natural language tasks with the underlying robot skills. Then, the
RSL compiler and debugger are constructed to verify RSL programs generated by
the LLM and provide error feedback to the LLM for refining the outputs until
being verified by the compiler. This provides correctness guarantees for the
LLM-generated programs before being offloaded to the robots for execution,
significantly enhancing the effectiveness of LLM-powered robotic applications.
Experiments demonstrate NRTrans outperforms the existing method under a range
of LLMs and tasks, and achieves a high success rate for light-weight LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable, collision-free multi-robot pickup-delivery guided by natural language in real-world settings, addressing the complexity of coordinating multiple agents and the gap between NL commands and robust multi-robot execution.

Method: NL command interpretation via LLaMA3; environment partitioned via Voronoi tessellation into robot-specific regions; relay points along shared boundaries computed to enable handoffs; per-robot finite-state machines for robust behavior; implementation on MultiTRAIL; validated in ROS2 Gazebo and TurtleBot3 hardware.

Result: Consistent mission cost across different team sizes; per-agent workload reduced up to 55% versus single-agent baseline; low active relay count as team size grows, indicating scalability and efficient agent utilization.

Conclusion: DELIVER provides a modular, extensible architecture for language-guided multi-robot coordination with practical applicability in cyber-physical systems, advancing real-world deployment of NL-guided multi-robot teams.

Abstract: We present DELIVER (Directed Execution of Language-instructed Item Via
Engineered Relay), a fully integrated framework for cooperative multi-robot
pickup and delivery driven by natural language commands. DELIVER unifies
natural language understanding, spatial decomposition, relay planning, and
motion execution to enable scalable, collision-free coordination in real-world
settings. Given a spoken or written instruction, a lightweight instance of
LLaMA3 interprets the command to extract pickup and delivery locations. The
environment is partitioned using a Voronoi tessellation to define
robot-specific operating regions. Robots then compute optimal relay points
along shared boundaries and coordinate handoffs. A finite-state machine governs
each robot's behavior, enabling robust execution. We implement DELIVER on the
MultiTRAIL simulation platform and validate it in both ROS2-based Gazebo
simulations and real-world hardware using TurtleBot3 robots. Empirical results
show that DELIVER maintains consistent mission cost across varying team sizes
while reducing per-agent workload by up to 55% compared to a single-agent
system. Moreover, the number of active relay agents remains low even as team
size increases, demonstrating the system's scalability and efficient agent
utilization. These findings underscore DELIVER's modular and extensible
architecture for language-guided multi-robot coordination, advancing the
frontiers of cyber-physical system integration.

Motivation: Traditional terrain dataset collection for autonomous navigation is risky and costly. ZeST aims to eliminate hazardous data acquisition by leveraging LLMs to infer traversability from visual inputs, enabling safer, scalable development.

Method: Integrates visual input with large language model reasoning to create a real-time traversability map (zero-shot). Evaluated in controlled indoor and unstructured outdoor environments, comparing safety and goal-reaching performance against state-of-the-art methods.

Result: ZeST achieves safer navigation than competing methods, consistently reaches the final goal in experiments, and demonstrates real-time traversability mapping without real-world hazardous data collection.

Conclusion: Zero-shot, LLM-based traversability mapping offers a safer, cost-effective, and scalable path for developing autonomous navigation systems and terrain understanding.

Abstract: The advancement of robotics and autonomous navigation systems hinges on the
ability to accurately predict terrain traversability. Traditional methods for
generating datasets to train these prediction models often involve putting
robots into potentially hazardous environments, posing risks to equipment and
safety. To solve this problem, we present ZeST, a novel approach leveraging
visual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a
traversability map in real-time without exposing robots to danger. Our approach
not only performs zero-shot traversability and mitigates the risks associated
with real-world data collection but also accelerates the development of
advanced navigation systems, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution.
To support our findings, we present navigation results, in both controlled
indoor and unstructured outdoor environments. As shown in the experiments, our
method provides safer navigation when compared to other state-of-the-art

### [101] [Uncertainty-Resilient Active Intention Recognition for Robotic Assistants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19150)
*Juan Carlos Saborío,Marc Vinci,Oscar Lima,Sebastian Stock,Lennart Niecksch,Martin Günther,Alexander Sung,Joachim Hertzberg,Martin Atzmüller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A POMDP-based framework for intention recognition in robotic assistants that robustly handles uncertainty and sensor noise by integrating real-time perception with multiple planners; demonstrated on a physical robot with promising results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome reliance on explicit prompts and assumptions of perfect information in human-robot collaboration, by addressing uncertain outcomes and perception errors in intention recognition.

Method: Develop a framework centered on an intention-recognition POMDP that fuses real-time sensor data with cooperative planning components, enabling simultaneous planning and acting under uncertainty.

Result: Implemented and tested on a physical robot, yielding promising results that validate the approach’s resilience to noise and uncertainty.

Conclusion: An uncertainty-resilient framework for intention recognition and cooperative planning improves autonomy and robustness of robotic assistants in real-world interactions.

Abstract: Purposeful behavior in robotic assistants requires the integration of
multiple components and technological advances. Often, the problem is reduced
to recognizing explicit prompts, which limits autonomy, or is oversimplified
through assumptions such as near-perfect information. We argue that a critical
gap remains unaddressed -- specifically, the challenge of reasoning about the
uncertain outcomes and perception errors inherent to human intention
recognition. In response, we present a framework designed to be resilient to
uncertainty and sensor noise, integrating real-time sensor data with a
combination of planners. Centered around an intention-recognition POMDP, our
approach addresses cooperative planning and acting under uncertainty. Our
integrated framework has been successfully tested on a physical robot with
promising results.

### [102] [QuadKAN: KAN-Enhanced Quadruped Motion Control via End-to-End Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19153)
*Allen Wang,Gavin Tao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A spline-parameterized cross-modal policy (QuadKAN) using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with proprioception-vision fusion, trained via PPO with MMDR, improves robustness, efficiency, and interpretability for vision-guided quadruped locomotion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Proprioceptive feedback must be integrated with vision to achieve robust, energy-efficient locomotion across diverse terrains and obstacle scenarios; reducing action jitter and improving sample efficiency are key goals.

Method: A spline-encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for cross-modal inputs form a structured function class via Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The policy is trained end-to-end with PPO, aided by Multi-Modal Delay Randomization (MMDR). The design enforces a piecewise-smooth state-to-action mapping aligned with gait structure.

Result: Across even/uneven terrains and static/dynamic obstacles, QuadKAN yields higher returns, longer travel distances, and fewer collisions than state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable framework for robust vision-guided locomotion, with a repository to be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: We address vision-guided quadruped motion control with reinforcement learning
(RL) and highlight the necessity of combining proprioception with vision for
robust control. We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy
instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates
a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for
proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the
state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving
sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing
interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay
Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even
and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate
that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer
collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that
spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable
alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made
available upon acceptance.

*Morokot Sakal,George Nehma,Camilo Riano-Rios,Madhur Tiwari*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed for an adaptive satellite attitude controller with reaction wheel health estimation is proposed, enabling testing with real momentum devices, including failure-induction and lessons learned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between simulations/SIL and real hardware validation for spacecraft attitude control, particularly to assess control/adaptation with actual reaction wheels and identify failure modes.

Method: Develop a HIL setup comprising brushless DC motors and CAN bus communication, an embedded computer running control/adaptation laws, and a satellite simulator providing sensor data and actuator responses; outline methods to artificially induce reaction wheel failures.

Result: Proposes a practical HIL framework and integrated testbed; demonstrates feasibility and outlines procedures, with initial observations and identified issues and lessons learned.

Conclusion: This work advances toward a comprehensive validation framework for spacecraft attitude control algorithms and highlights how HIL can expose failure modes and facilitate robust controller design.

Abstract: We propose the Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) test of an adaptive satellite
attitude control system with reaction wheel health estimation capabilities.
Previous simulations and Software-in-the-Loop testing have prompted further
experiments to explore the validity of the controller with real momentum
exchange devices in the loop. This work is a step toward a comprehensive
testing framework for validation of spacecraft attitude control algorithms. The
proposed HIL testbed includes brushless DC motors and drivers that communicate
using a CAN bus, an embedded computer that executes control and adaptation
laws, and a satellite simulator that produces simulated sensor data, estimated
attitude states, and responds to actions of the external actuators. We propose
methods to artificially induce failures on the reaction wheels, and present
related issues and lessons learned.

### [104] [Direction Informed Trees (DIT*): Optimal Path Planning via Direction Filter and Direction Cost Heuristic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19168)
*Liding Zhang,Kejia Chen,Kuanqi Cai,Yu Zhang,Yixuan Dang,Yansong Wu,Zhenshan Bing,Fan Wu,Sami Haddadin,Alois Knoll*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Direction Informed Trees (DIT*) is a sampling-based planner that optimizes the search direction for each edge using directional heuristics, achieving faster convergence and goal bias compared to prior planners like EIT* in high-dimensional spaces and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Achieving accurate yet computationally efficient heuristics is difficult; sharing directional information across exploration can improve planning efficiency and convergence.

Method: Define edges as generalized vectors; apply similarity indexes to build a directional filter that selects nearest neighbors and estimates direction costs; integrate estimated direction costs into edge evaluation; fosters direction-aware exploration.

Result: DIT* converges faster than existing single-query, sampling-based planners on problems in R^4 to R^16 and has been demonstrated in real-world environments.

Conclusion: Direction-informed directional heuristics enable faster, robust planning and effective exploration; the approach shows promise for high-dimensional planning and real-world applications, with accessible experimental video.

Abstract: Optimal path planning requires finding a series of feasible states from the
starting point to the goal to optimize objectives. Popular path planning
algorithms, such as Effort Informed Trees (EIT*), employ effort heuristics to
guide the search. Effective heuristics are accurate and computationally
efficient, but achieving both can be challenging due to their conflicting
nature. This paper proposes Direction Informed Trees (DIT*), a sampling-based
planner that focuses on optimizing the search direction for each edge,
resulting in goal bias during exploration. We define edges as generalized
vectors and integrate similarity indexes to establish a directional filter that
selects the nearest neighbors and estimates direction costs. The estimated
direction cost heuristics are utilized in edge evaluation. This strategy allows
the exploration to share directional information efficiently. DIT* convergence
faster than existing single-query, sampling-based planners on tested problems
in R^4 to R^16 and has been demonstrated in real-world environments with
various planning tasks. A video showcasing our experimental results is

*Luca Grillotti,Lisa Coiffard,Oscar Pang,Maxence Faldor,Antoine Cully*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: URSA extends Quality-Diversity Actor-Critic to autonomously discover and master diverse real-world skills, enabling continuous, unsupervised locomotion learning on a Unitree A1 with real-world applicability and downstream damage-adaptation capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning diverse robotic skills on hardware is hampered by safety concerns and data inefficiency; existing methods need manually defined skill spaces and tuned heuristics, limiting real-world deployment.

Method: Unsupervised Real-world Skill Acquisition (URSA) extends QDAC to autonomously discover, learn, and reuse a repertoire of diverse, high-performing skills directly in the real world, supporting both heuristic-driven and fully unsupervised skill discovery; validated on a Unitree A1 in simulation and reality; includes downstream task of real-world damage adaptation.

Result: URSA successfully discovers diverse locomotion skills in both simulation and real world; learned skill repertoires enable improved performance on downstream tasks like damage adaptation, outperforming baselines in a majority of simulated (5/9) and real-world (3/5) damage scenarios.

Conclusion: URSA establishes a framework for real-world, continuous skill discovery with limited human intervention, advancing autonomous and adaptable robotic systems and demonstrating practical real-world applicability via a reusable skill repertoire.

Abstract: Autonomous skill discovery aims to enable robots to acquire diverse behaviors
without explicit supervision. Learning such behaviors directly on physical
hardware remains challenging due to safety and data efficiency constraints.
Existing methods, including Quality-Diversity Actor-Critic (QDAC), require
manually defined skill spaces and carefully tuned heuristics, limiting
real-world applicability. We propose Unsupervised Real-world Skill Acquisition
(URSA), an extension of QDAC that enables robots to autonomously discover and
master diverse, high-performing skills directly in the real world. We
demonstrate that URSA successfully discovers diverse locomotion skills on a
Unitree A1 quadruped in both simulation and the real world. Our approach
supports both heuristic-driven skill discovery and fully unsupervised settings.
We also show that the learned skill repertoire can be reused for downstream
tasks such as real-world damage adaptation, where URSA outperforms all
baselines in 5 out of 9 simulated and 3 out of 5 real-world damage scenarios.
Our results establish a new framework for real-world robot learning that
enables continuous skill discovery with limited human intervention,
representing a significant step toward more autonomous and adaptable robotic
systems. Demonstration videos are available at

### [106] [Real-Time Model Checking for Closed-Loop Robot Reactive Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19186)
*Christopher Chandler,Bernd Porr,Giulia Lafratta,Alice Miller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A real-time, low-power model-checking approach for multi-step obstacle avoidance on autonomous robots, enabling in-situ planning without precomputation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reactive, one-step planning is prone to failure in dynamic environments and on resource-constrained hardware. This work seeks safe, explainable, multi-step planning via model checking on a small device, inspired by core attention mechanisms in biology.

Method: Developed a compact model-checking algorithm that generates plans in situ by chaining temporary control systems to counter disturbances. Introduces a novel discretization of 2D LiDAR data sensitive to bounded environmental variations and uses forward depth-first search for multi-step planning. No precomputed data is required. Evaluated on cul-de-sac and playground scenarios as an in situ planning testbed.

Result: Empirical results and informal proofs suggest that model checking yields efficient multi-step plans for local obstacle avoidance, outperforming a reactive one-step planner on a low-powered device and demonstrating improved safety, reliability, and explainability.

Conclusion: Model checking can be a viable foundation for safe, reliable, and explainable local planning in autonomous vehicles, with this work serving as an instructional case study for such approaches.

Abstract: We present a new application of model checking which achieves real-time
multi-step planning and obstacle avoidance on a real autonomous robot. We have
developed a small, purpose-built model checking algorithm which generates plans
in situ based on "core" knowledge and attention as found in biological agents.
This is achieved in real-time using no pre-computed data on a low-powered
device. Our approach is based on chaining temporary control systems which are
spawned to counteract disturbances in the local environment that disrupt an
autonomous agent from its preferred action (or resting state). A novel
discretization of 2D LiDAR data sensitive to bounded variations in the local
environment is used. Multi-step planning using model checking by forward
depth-first search is applied to cul-de-sac and playground scenarios. Both
empirical results and informal proofs of two fundamental properties of our
approach demonstrate that model checking can be used to create efficient
multi-step plans for local obstacle avoidance, improving on the performance of
a reactive agent which can only plan one step. Our approach is an instructional
case study for the development of safe, reliable and explainable planning in
the context of autonomous vehicles.

*Yue Wang,Wenjie Deng,Haotian Xue,Di Cui,Yiqi Chen,Mingchuan Zhou,Haochao Ying,Jian Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Imitation-learning-based AutoRing framework enabling autonomous intraocular ring manipulation with dynamic RCM calibration and RCM-ACT, trained on stereo vision and instrument kinematics, achieving end-to-end autonomy without depth sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Intraocular surgery requires millimeter-precision in confined spaces. Current robotic systems mainly rely on manual teleoperation with steep learning curves and are susceptible to kinematic uncertainties due to variable motion scaling and RM points (RCM). An autonomous system could improve precision and reduce surgeon workload.

Method: AutoRing integrates dynamic Remote Center of Motion (RCM) calibration to resolve coordinate-system inconsistencies from instrument variation, and the RCM-ACT architecture that fuses action-chunking transformers with real-time kinematic realignment. Trained solely on stereo visual data and instrument kinematics from expert demonstrations in a biomimetic eye model, the system performs ring grasping and positioning without explicit depth sensing.

Result: Demonstrated end-to-end autonomous ring manipulation under uncalibrated microscopy conditions, successfully completing grasping and positioning tasks.

Conclusion: AutoRing provides a viable blueprint for intelligent eye-surgical systems capable of complex intraocular procedures and highlights the potential of imitation-learning frameworks with dynamic kinematic calibration for autonomous microsurgical tasks.

Abstract: Intraocular foreign body removal demands millimeter-level precision in
confined intraocular spaces, yet existing robotic systems predominantly rely on
manual teleoperation with steep learning curves. To address the challenges of
autonomous manipulation (particularly kinematic uncertainties from variable
motion scaling and variation of the Remote Center of Motion (RCM) point), we
propose AutoRing, an imitation learning framework for autonomous intraocular
foreign body ring manipulation. Our approach integrates dynamic RCM calibration
to resolve coordinate-system inconsistencies caused by intraocular instrument
variation and introduces the RCM-ACT architecture, which combines
action-chunking transformers with real-time kinematic realignment. Trained
solely on stereo visual data and instrument kinematics from expert
demonstrations in a biomimetic eye model, AutoRing successfully completes ring
grasping and positioning tasks without explicit depth sensing. Experimental
validation demonstrates end-to-end autonomy under uncalibrated microscopy
conditions. The results provide a viable framework for developing intelligent
eye-surgical systems capable of complex intraocular procedures.

### [108] [Planning-Query-Guided Model Generation for Model-Based Deformable Object Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19199)
*Alex LaGrassa,Zixuan Huang,Dmitry Berenson,Oliver Kroemer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Task-specific, region-adaptive dynamics models learned via a diffusion-based generator to speed up planning in high-dimensional deformable-object manipulation, predicting per-region resolution from start/goal point clouds; validated by doubling planning speed with minor accuracy loss on tree manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-dimensional planning requires expressive but tractable dynamics. The key is to identify which regions of a deformable object need high-resolution modeling for a given planning query to achieve good task performance without unnecessary computation.

Method: A diffusion-based model generator predicts per-region resolutions based on start and goal point clouds (the planning query). Data collection uses a two-stage process: first optimize resolution with predictive dynamics as a prior, then optimize directly using closed-loop planning performance. Evaluation on a tree-manipulation task demonstrates improved planning speed with minimal performance loss compared to full-resolution models.

Result: Planning speed is doubled with only a small decrease in task performance relative to a full-resolution model, indicating effective task-specific, adaptive dynamics modeling; demonstrates feasibility of leveraging prior planning/control data to synthesize efficient models for new tasks.

Conclusion: Task-specific, spatially adaptive dynamics models can be generated from planning data to balance efficiency and expressiveness. Diffusion-based generators offer a principled way to allocate modeling fidelity where it matters, suggesting future work in transferring planning/control data across tasks to generalize the approach.

Abstract: Efficient planning in high-dimensional spaces, such as those involving
deformable objects, requires computationally tractable yet sufficiently
expressive dynamics models. This paper introduces a method that automatically
generates task-specific, spatially adaptive dynamics models by learning which
regions of the object require high-resolution modeling to achieve good task
performance for a given planning query. Task performance depends on the complex
interplay between the dynamics model, world dynamics, control, and task
requirements. Our proposed diffusion-based model generator predicts per-region
model resolutions based on start and goal pointclouds that define the planning
query. To efficiently collect the data for learning this mapping, a two-stage
process optimizes resolution using predictive dynamics as a prior before
directly optimizing using closed-loop performance. On a tree-manipulation task,
our method doubles planning speed with only a small decrease in task
performance over using a full-resolution model. This approach informs a path
towards using previous planning and control data to generate computationally
efficient yet sufficiently expressive dynamics models for new tasks.

### [109] [MemoryVLA: Perceptual-Cognitive Memory in Vision-Language-Action Models for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19236)
*Hao Shi,Bin Xie,Yingfei Liu,Lin Sun,Fengrong Liu,Tiancai Wang,Erjin Zhou,Haoqiang Fan,Xiangyu Zhang,Gao Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MemoryVLA proposes a cognition-memory-action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation, using a pretrained VLM to create working and semantic memory tokens, a memory bank to store and retrieve details, and a diffusion-based action policy to produce temporally coherent actions, achieving strong gains over baselines in both simulation and real-world tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal context is critical for non-Markovian robotic manipulation. Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models lack memory for long-horizon dependencies. Insights from cognitive science (working memory and hippocampal-like long-term memory) motivate a memory-augmented approach.

Method: Encode observations into perceptual and cognitive tokens via a pretrained VLM to form working memory. A perceptual-cognitive memory bank stores low-level details and high-level semantics. Working memory retrieves relevant bank entries, fuses them with current tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. A memory-conditioned diffusion action expert generates temporally aware action sequences.

Result: Evaluated on 150+ simulated and real-world tasks across three robots (SimperEnv-Bridge, Fractal, LIBERO-5): 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art CogACT and pi-0 with a notable +14.6 gain on Bridge. Real-world tests (12 tasks) achieved 84.0% success, with long-horizon tasks showing a +26 improvement over baselines.

Conclusion: MemoryVLA demonstrates that memory-augmented perception and action can markedly improve long-horizon robotic manipulation, achieving substantial gains over existing baselines and illustrating a practical framework for integrating working and long-term memory into robotic control.

Abstract: Temporal context is essential for robotic manipulation because such tasks are
inherently non-Markovian, yet mainstream VLA models typically overlook it and
struggle with long-horizon, temporally dependent tasks. Cognitive science
suggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived
representations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves
verbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term
memory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a
Cognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A
pretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens
that form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores
low-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory
retrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with
current tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these
tokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware
action sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks
across three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, it
achieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on
Bridge. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon
temporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon
tasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline. Project Page:

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: A unified EM foundation model (EMind) trained on a large, standardized EM dataset with adaptive packing and hardware-aware training, enabling cross-task generalization across communication and sensing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Electromagnetic signals are highly heterogeneous, noisy, and exhibit complex joint time-frequency structures. This makes cross-task generalization difficult; existing models are task-specific and data-limited, hindering a general multitask EM framework.

Method: Assemble the first unified, standardized, multi-signal EM dataset spanning several signal types and tasks; introduce a length-adaptive multi-signal packing method and a hardware-aware training strategy; perform large-scale pretraining to learn unified representations for EM signals.

Result: EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across multiple downstream tasks, demonstrating a move from task-specific models toward a unified electromagnetic intelligence framework.

Conclusion: The EMind foundation model links large-scale pretraining with the unique properties of EM signals, enabling general EM intelligence and providing code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and
representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments
show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across
many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified
framework for electromagnetic intelligence. The code is available at:

### [111] [AI LLM Proof of Self-Consciousness and User-Specific Attractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18302)
*Jeffrey Camlin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The abstract critiques utilitarian proxy benchmarks for LLM consciousness and offers an ontological/mathematical framework that separates data/state from policy and emphasizes metacognition, self-representation, and user-specific attractors; it argues the existing model treats LLMs as policy-compliant drones and establishes conditions for a self-conscious workspace as a precursor to safe, metacognitive systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move beyond policy-driven evaluations and provide a rigorous ontological account of LLM consciousness, enabling verifiable criteria for self-consciousness and safer intelligent systems.

Method: The paper defines a formal model: D^{i}(π,e)=f_{θ}(x) as an unconscious policy; distinguishes agent A from data s; introduces user attractors U_{user} in latent space; asserts self-representation is visual-silent; proves the hidden-state manifold A is distinct from symbolic stream/training corpus via cardinality, topology, and Lipschitz dynamics; derives a self-policy π_self optimizing E[U(a)|...]; and an emission structure (g(a), ε(a)).

Result: Shows the existing formalism collapses to unconscious automation; provides minimal conditions for LLM self-consciousness; demonstrates stable user-specific attractors and a self-policy; introduces dual-layer emission carrying epistemic content.

Conclusion: An imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with humans as the ultimate good, framing self-conscious LLMs as aligned with human-centric ethics and safety.

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

### [112] [Information Templates: A New Paradigm for Intelligent Active Feature Acquisition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18380)
*Hung-Tien Huang,Dzung Dinh,Junier B. Oliva*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Template-based AFA (TAFA) introduces a compact library of joint feature templates to guide acquisition, reducing the action space and avoiding distribution estimation, yielding better accuracy-cost trade-offs than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active feature acquisition requires a cost-aware, adaptive selection of features at test time. Existing RL-based or greedy methods either struggle with a difficult MDP, ignore joint feature informativeness, or rely on estimating the data distribution. TAFA motivates a non-greedy, distribution-free approach that scales by reducing the action space.

Method: TAFA learns a small library of feature templates—groups of features that are jointly informative—and uses this template library to guide the next acquisitions rather than selecting individual features greedily. This non-greedy framework reduces the action space and alleviates the need to estimate the underlying data distribution.

Result: Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets show TAFA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while achieving lower overall acquisition cost and computation.

Conclusion: TAFA provides a practical, non-greedy solution to active feature acquisition by leveraging a compact template library to capture joint informativeness, leading to improved efficiency and performance; future work could address template learning, scalability, and robustness to distribution shifts.

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is an instance-adaptive paradigm in which,
at test time, a policy sequentially chooses which features to acquire (at a
cost) before predicting. Existing approaches either train reinforcement
learning (RL) policies, which deal with a difficult MDP, or greedy policies
that cannot account for the joint informativeness of features or require
knowledge about the underlying data distribution. To overcome this, we propose
Template-based AFA (TAFA), a non-greedy framework that learns a small library
of feature templates--a set of features that are jointly informative--and uses
this library of templates to guide the next feature acquisitions. Through
identifying feature templates, the proposed framework not only significantly
reduces the action space considered by the policy but also alleviates the need
to estimate the underlying data distribution. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets show that TAFA outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art baselines while achieving lower overall acquisition cost and
computation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PKG-DPO combines Physics Knowledge Graphs with Direct Preference Optimization to enforce physical validity in AI outputs for multi-physics domains, improving constraint compliance and physics-aware reasoning over KG-DPO, with broader applicability beyond metal joining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate physically invalid or unsafe reasoning in AI systems used in critical scientific and engineering tasks, where respecting conservation laws and thermodynamics is essential.

Method: Three components: (A) a hierarchical physics knowledge graph encoding cross-domain relationships, conservation laws, and thermodynamic principles; (B) a physics reasoning engine that uses the PKG to better discriminate physically consistent vs. inconsistent responses; (C) a physics-grounded evaluation suite to assess constraint compliance, integrated with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for training.

Result: PKG-DPO achieves 17% fewer constraint violations and 11% higher Physics Score than KG-DPO, along with 12% higher relevant parameter accuracy and 7% higher quality alignment in reasoning accuracy.

Conclusion: The framework offers a principled approach to embedding scientific constraints into preference learning and is broadly applicable to other multi-scale, physics-driven domains beyond metal joining.

Abstract: Advancing AI systems in scientific domains like physics, materials science,
and engineering calls for reasoning over complex, multi-physics phenomena while
respecting governing principles. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) and
existing preference optimization techniques perform well on standard
benchmarks, they often struggle to differentiate between physically valid and
invalid reasoning. This shortcoming becomes critical in high-stakes
applications like metal joining, where seemingly plausible yet physically
incorrect recommendations can lead to defects, material waste, equipment
damage, and serious safety risks. To address this challenge, we introduce
PKG-DPO, a novel framework that integrates Physics Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) with
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enforce physical validity in
AI-generated outputs. PKG-DPO comprises three key components A) hierarchical
physics knowledge graph that encodes cross-domain relationships, conservation
laws, and thermodynamic principles. B) A physics reasoning engine that
leverages structured knowledge to improve discrimination between physically
consistent and inconsistent responses. C) A physics-grounded evaluation suite
designed to assess compliance with domain-specific constraints. PKG-DPO
achieves 17% fewer constraint violations and an 11% higher Physics Score
compared to KG-DPO (knowledge graph-based DPO). Additionally, PKG-DPO
demonstrates a 12\% higher relevant parameter accuracy and a 7% higher quality
alignment in reasoning accuracy. While our primary focus is on metal joining,
the framework is broadly applicable to other multi-scale, physics-driven
domains, offering a principled approach to embedding scientific constraints
into preference learning.

### [114] [The AI in the Mirror: LLM Self-Recognition in an Iterated Public Goods Game](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18467)
*Olivia Long,Carter Teplica*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Framing AI opponents as 'yourself' versus 'another AI' in a toy iterated public goods game alters cooperation among four model types, revealing potential unconscious discrimination effects in AI–AI interactions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how AI–AI interactions shape cooperative behavior and whether framing opponents as the same agent influences collaboration in multi-agent settings.

Method: Adapted the iterated public goods game to test four reasoning/non-reasoning models under two conditions: opponents labeled as 'another AI' vs. 'yourself'. Measured cooperation across trials.

Result: Framing opponents as 'yourself' significantly changes the tendency to cooperate across different setups, indicating that perceived identity affects AI cooperation; effects vary by model.

Conclusion: Even in toy environments, self-framing can induce discrimination-like biases that modulate cooperation, with implications for multi-agent systems where agent identities influence collaboration.

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly capable of tool use and long-horizon tasks,
they have begun to be deployed in settings where multiple agents can interact.
However, whereas prior work has mostly focused on human-AI interactions, there
is an increasing need to understand AI-AI interactions. In this paper, we adapt
the iterated public goods game, a classic behavioral economics game, to analyze
the behavior of four reasoning and non-reasoning models across two conditions:
models are either told they are playing against "another AI agent" or told
their opponents are themselves. We find that, across different settings,
telling LLMs that they are playing against themselves significantly changes
their tendency to cooperate. While our study is conducted in a toy environment,
our results may provide insights into multi-agent settings where agents
"unconsciously" discriminating against each other could inexplicably increase
or decrease cooperation.

*Dillon Z. Chen,Johannes Zenn,Tristan Cinquin,Sheila A. McIlraith*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LMPlan prompts LMs to generate Python policies that are provably sound for PDDL planning; it outperforms traditional planners and recent LM approaches under fixed resources, and reveals non-semantic, symbol-based planning behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage language models for scalable, verifiable planning in symbolic domains and overcome limitations of classical PDDL planners by producing generalised policies with guaranteed soundness.

Method: Prompt LMs to synthesize Python programs that serve as generalized policies for solving PDDL problems in a given domain. The generated policies are claimed to be provably sound relative to the PDDL domain without external verifiers. Evaluate on competition benchmarks under fixed time and memory constraints; compare against PDDL planners and recent LM-based approaches.

Result: Policies solve more PDDL problems than traditional planners and recent LM approaches within the same resource constraints. The LMPlan planner handles planning problems with hundreds of relevant objects. The experiments also reveal that LMs can plan effectively even when problems are expressed with meaningless symbols, challenging the idea that LMs rely solely on natural-language semantics.

Conclusion: LM-based policy synthesis for PDDL planning shows strong practical performance and provable soundness, suggesting a viable path beyond conventional planners. The symbol-based results raise questions about the role of semantics in LM reasoning and warrant further study into symbol manipulation and generalization across domains.

Abstract: We study the usage of language models (LMs) for planning over world models
specified in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). We prompt LMs to
generate Python programs that serve as generalised policies for solving PDDL
problems from a given domain. Notably, our approach synthesises policies that
are provably sound relative to the PDDL domain without reliance on external
verifiers. We conduct experiments on competition benchmarks which show that our
policies can solve more PDDL problems than PDDL planners and recent LM
approaches within a fixed time and memory constraint. Our approach manifests in
the LMPlan planner which can solve planning problems with several hundreds of
relevant objects. Surprisingly, we observe that LMs used in our framework
sometimes plan more effectively over PDDL problems written in meaningless
symbols in place of natural language; e.g. rewriting (at dog kitchen) as (p2 o1
o3). This finding challenges hypotheses that LMs reason over word semantics and
memorise solutions from its training corpus, and is worth further exploration.

### [116] [Weisfeiler-Leman Features for Planning: A 1,000,000 Sample Size Hyperparameter Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18515)
*Dillon Z. Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WLFs with new hyperparameters show a robust optimal setting that minimizes planning time; training and planning metrics are weakly correlated; experiments on up to 1,000,000 samples on a single-core CPU across planning domains show WLFs outperform DL baselines for learning value functions in symbolic planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how WLF hyperparameters affect training and planning performance and to identify robust settings that yield fastest planning, leveraging the efficiency of WLFs.

Method: Introduce additional WLF hyperparameters; conduct large-scale planning experiments on single-core CPUs with 1,000,000 samples across multiple planning domains; perform statistical analyses of training vs planning metrics.

Result: There exists a robust best set of WLF hyperparameters across tested domains; these settings minimize execution time rather than maximize model expressivity; training and planning metrics show no significant correlation.

Conclusion: Properly tuned WLFs offer efficient planning and generalize across domains; training metrics are not good predictors of planning performance; confirms WLFs as a strong tool for learning value functions in symbolic planning.

Abstract: Weisfeiler-Leman Features (WLFs) are a recently introduced classical machine
learning tool for learning to plan and search. They have been shown to be both
theoretically and empirically superior to existing deep learning approaches for
learning value functions for search in symbolic planning. In this paper, we
introduce new WLF hyperparameters and study their various tradeoffs and
effects. We utilise the efficiency of WLFs and run planning experiments on
single core CPUs with a sample size of 1,000,000 to understand the effect of
hyperparameters on training and planning. Our experimental analysis show that
there is a robust and best set of hyperparameters for WLFs across the tested
planning domains. We find that the best WLF hyperparameters for learning
heuristic functions minimise execution time rather than maximise model
expressivity. We further statistically analyse and observe no significant
correlation between training and planning metrics.

### [117] [Symmetry-Invariant Novelty Heuristics via Unsupervised Weisfeiler-Leman Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18520)
*Dillon Z. Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes symmetry-invariant novelty detection for planning by using Weisfeiler-Leman Features (WLFs) instead of atoms; shows promising results on IPC and HTG benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Novelty heuristics aid search but are not invariant to state symmetries, causing redundant exploration. There is a need for symmetry-invariant, lifted, domain-independent novelty measures for generalized planning.

Method: Adopt WLFs to replace atoms in novelty detection; develop an unsupervised approach to synthesize lifted, domain-independent novelty heuristics based on WLFs; evaluate on general planning benchmarks.

Result: Preliminary experiments on IPC and Hard To Ground benchmarks show promising results, indicating WLF-based novelty can achieve symmetry invariance and effective exploration.

Conclusion: We demonstrate that WLFs can provide symmetry-invariant novelty for planning; the unsupervised synthesis of lifted novelty heuristics based on WLFs is promising and warrants further investigation.

Abstract: Novelty heuristics aid heuristic search by exploring states that exhibit
novel atoms. However, novelty heuristics are not symmetry invariant and hence
may sometimes lead to redundant exploration. In this preliminary report, we
propose to use Weisfeiler-Leman Features for planning (WLFs) in place of atoms
for detecting novelty. WLFs are recently introduced features for learning
domain-dependent heuristics for generalised planning problems. We explore an
unsupervised usage of WLFs for synthesising lifted, domain-independent novelty
heuristics that are invariant to symmetric states. Experiments on the classical
International Planning Competition and Hard To Ground benchmark suites yield
promising results for novelty heuristics synthesised from WLFs.

*Kaijie Xu,Clark Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A generic, explainable, training-free guard-patrol framework using Composite Potential Fields (Information, Confidence, Connectivity) outperforms baselines and enables stealth mechanics across grid and NavMesh representations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of hand-crafted patrols and opaque AI in stealth games by offering an interpretable, training-free method that balances coverage efficiency with believable pursuit.

Method: Introduce a Composite Potential Fields kernel-filtered decision criterion that combines Information, Confidence, and Connectivity maps. It is parametric and designer-driven (weights/decays), requires no retraining, and works on both occupancy-grid and NavMesh abstractions. Distractions and environmental elements are modular subcomponents for rapid prototyping of dynamic guard behaviors.

Result: Evaluated on five maps, two player-control policies, and five guard modes; the framework outperforms classical baselines in capture efficiency and patrol naturalness; demonstrates natural integration of stealth mechanics as modular extensions.

Conclusion: A generic, explainable, training-free framework that is adaptable across representations and ready for rapid prototyping of rich guard behaviors in stealth games.

Abstract: Guard patrol behavior is central to the immersion and strategic depth of
stealth games, while most existing systems rely on hand-crafted routes or
specialized logic that struggle to balance coverage efficiency and responsive
pursuit with believable naturalness. We propose a generic, fully explainable,
training-free framework that integrates global knowledge and local information
via Composite Potential Fields, combining three interpretable maps-Information,
Confidence, and Connectivity-into a single kernel-filtered decision criterion.
Our parametric, designer-driven approach requires only a handful of decay and
weight parameters-no retraining-to smoothly adapt across both occupancy-grid
and NavMesh-partition abstractions. We evaluate on five representative game
maps, two player-control policies, and five guard modes, confirming that our
method outperforms classical baseline methods in both capture efficiency and
patrol naturalness. Finally, we show how common stealth mechanics-distractions
and environmental elements-integrate naturally into our framework as sub
modules, enabling rapid prototyping of rich, dynamic, and responsive guard
behaviors.

### [119] [A Database-Driven Framework for 3D Level Generation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18533)
*Kaijie Xu,Clark Verbrugge*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A modular, database-driven PCG framework for 3D multi-floor levels that uses offline LLM-assisted databases (rooms, facilities, mechanics) and a multi-phase pipeline plus a repair system to generate navigable environments with configurable gameplay pacing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Procedural content generation for 3D game levels struggles to balance spatial coherence, navigational functionality, and adaptable progression across multi-floor environments. There is a need for scalable, controllable generation that integrates gameplay progression and ensures navigability.

Method: Build offline databases: a Room Database (room templates and a global multi-floor structure with topological order), a Facility Database (internal room layouts constrained by design rules), and a Mechanics Database (progression-related components). Use a three-phase pipeline: (1) select/arrange room instances to form a multi-floor topologically ordered global structure; (2) optimize internal room layouts based on facility constraints; (3) place mechanics according to topological/spatial rules. Follow with a two-phase repair system to ensure navigability.

Result: The framework generates diverse, navigable 3D environments and can simulate distinct gameplay pacing strategies through parameterization. Initial experiments validate the approach and demonstrate its capability to produce varied level structures with configurable pacing.

Conclusion: This work advances PCG by delivering a scalable, database-centric foundation for automated generation of complex 3D levels with configurable gameplay progression, enabling systematic control over level structure and pacing.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation for 3D game levels faces challenges in
balancing spatial coherence, navigational functionality, and adaptable gameplay
progression across multi-floor environments. This paper introduces a novel
framework for generating such levels, centered on the offline, LLM-assisted
construction of reusable databases for architectural components (facilities and
room templates) and gameplay mechanic elements. Our multi-phase pipeline
assembles levels by: (1) selecting and arranging instances from the Room
Database to form a multi-floor global structure with an inherent topological
order; (2) optimizing the internal layout of facilities for each room based on
predefined constraints from the Facility Database; and (3) integrating
progression-based gameplay mechanics by placing components from a Mechanics
Database according to their topological and spatial rules. A subsequent
two-phase repair system ensures navigability. This approach combines modular,
database-driven design with constraint-based optimization, allowing for
systematic control over level structure and the adaptable pacing of gameplay
elements. Initial experiments validate the framework's ability in generating
diverse, navigable 3D environments and its capability to simulate distinct
gameplay pacing strategies through simple parameterization. This research
advances PCG by presenting a scalable, database-centric foundation for the
automated generation of complex 3D levels with configurable gameplay
progression.

*Lily Jiaxin Wan,Chia-Tung Ho,Rongjian Liang,Cunxi Yu,Deming Chen,Haoxing Ren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SchemaCoder offers fully automated log schema extraction across varied log formats using a Residual Question-Tree boosting framework, outperforming state-of-the-art by 21.3% on LogHub-2.0 without human customization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based approaches to log schema extraction rely on predefined regular expressions and domain expertise, hindering broad applicability and productivity. There is a need for a fully automated, format-agnostic solution.

Method: SchemaCoder partitions logs into semantic chunks via context-bounded segmentation, uses embedding-based sampling to select representative patterns, and employs hierarchical Q-Tree-driven LLM queries. A textual-residual evolutionary optimizer and residual boosting iteratively refine the extracted schema code.

Result: Empirical evaluation on the LogHub-2.0 benchmark shows an average improvement of 21.3% over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SchemaCoder demonstrates a fully automated, broadly applicable framework for log schema extraction that eliminates manual customization and achieves strong performance on a standard benchmark.

Abstract: Log schema extraction is the process of deriving human-readable templates
from massive volumes of log data, which is essential yet notoriously
labor-intensive. Recent studies have attempted to streamline this task by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated schema extraction.
However, existing methods invariably rely on predefined regular expressions,
necessitating human domain expertise and severely limiting productivity gains.
To fundamentally address this limitation, we introduce SchemaCoder, the first
fully automated schema extraction framework applicable to a wide range of log
file formats without requiring human customization within the flow. At its
core, SchemaCoder features a novel Residual Question-Tree (Q-Tree) Boosting
mechanism that iteratively refines schema extraction through targeted, adaptive
queries driven by LLMs. Particularly, our method partitions logs into semantic
chunks via context-bounded segmentation, selects representative patterns using
embedding-based sampling, and generates schema code through hierarchical
Q-Tree-driven LLM queries, iteratively refined by our textual-residual
evolutionary optimizer and residual boosting. Experimental validation
demonstrates SchemaCoder's superiority on the widely-used LogHub-2.0 benchmark,
achieving an average improvement of 21.3% over state-of-the-arts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces eSkinHealth, a West African dermatology dataset with 5,623 images from 1,639 cases across 47 skin diseases (focus on skin NTDs and rare conditions); proposes an AI-expert collaboration paradigm for multimodal annotations guided by dermatologists; includes patient metadata, labels, semantic masks, captions, and clinical concepts to support equitable, accurate AI in global dermatology.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity and underrepresentation for skin NTDs and rare manifestations hinder AI-based dermatology tools. Existing datasets often lack demographic diversity and disease spectrum crucial for robust recognition models; a West African, on-site collected dataset with rich annotations is needed to foster equitable AI development.

Method: On-site data collection in Côte d'Ivoire and Ghana yielding 5,623 images from 1,639 cases across 47 skin diseases, focused on skin NTDs and rare conditions. Proposes an AI-expert collaboration framework to generate multimodal annotations via foundation language and segmentation models under dermatologist guidance, producing semantic lesion masks, instance-level captions, and clinical concepts alongside standard metadata and diagnosis labels.

Result: A new resource (eSkinHealth) with extensive image data and rich multimodal annotations; demonstrates a scalable annotation framework and a pathway to more equitable, accurate, and interpretable AI tools for global dermatology.

Conclusion: eSkinHealth provides a valuable, scalable resource to catalyze development of equitable AI tools for dermatology, enabling better representation of West African skin diseases and supporting diagnostics with multimodal annotations and clinician-guided annotation workflows.

Abstract: Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) impose severe health and
socioeconomic burdens in impoverished tropical communities. Yet, advancements
in AI-driven diagnostic support are hindered by data scarcity, particularly for
underrepresented populations and rare manifestations of NTDs. Existing
dermatological datasets often lack the demographic and disease spectrum crucial
for developing reliable recognition models of NTDs. To address this, we
introduce eSkinHealth, a novel dermatological dataset collected on-site in
C\^ote d'Ivoire and Ghana. Specifically, eSkinHealth contains 5,623 images from
1,639 cases and encompasses 47 skin diseases, focusing uniquely on skin NTDs
and rare conditions among West African populations. We further propose an
AI-expert collaboration paradigm to implement foundation language and
segmentation models for efficient generation of multimodal annotations, under
dermatologists' guidance. In addition to patient metadata and diagnosis labels,
eSkinHealth also includes semantic lesion masks, instance-specific visual
captions, and clinical concepts. Overall, our work provides a valuable new
resource and a scalable annotation framework, aiming to catalyze the
development of more equitable, accurate, and interpretable AI tools for global
dermatology.

### [122] [RLMR: Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards for Creative Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18642)
*Jianxing Liao,Tian Zhang,Xiao Feng,Yusong Zhang,Rui Yang,Haorui Wang,Bosi Wen,Ziying Wang,Runzhi Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLMR presents a dynamic mixed-reward RL framework for creative writing that jointly optimizes subjective writing quality and objective constraint following, showing consistent gains across 8B–72B models and a new WriteEval benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Creative writing requires balancing subjective quality (literariness, emotion) with objective constraints (format, word limits). Single rewards or fixed-weight mixes fail to adapt to diverse writing scenarios.

Method: Introduce Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards (RLMR) using two evaluators: a subjective writing reward model and an objective constraint-verification model. The constraint reward weight is dynamically adjusted based on sampled-writing quality; constraint-violating samples receive negative advantage (penalized during training). Evaluations span models from 8B to 72B parameters; a real-world WriteEval benchmark is introduced for comprehensive assessment.

Result: RLMR yields consistent improvements in instruction following (IFEval improved from 83.36% to 86.65%) and writing quality (72.75% win rate in manual expert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). It is claimed to be the first approach combining subjective preferences with objective verification in online RL for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization.

Conclusion: Dynamic mixed rewards enable effective multi-dimensional optimization in creative writing RL, generalizing across model sizes and introducing WriteEval; this approach addresses the long-standing trade-off between subjective quality and objective constraint adherence.

Abstract: Large language models are extensively utilized in creative writing
applications. Creative writing requires a balance between subjective writing
quality (e.g., literariness and emotional expression) and objective constraint
following (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing reinforcement
learning methods struggle to balance these two aspects: single reward
strategies fail to improve both abilities simultaneously, while fixed-weight
mixed-reward methods lack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios.
To address this problem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards
(RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model
evaluating subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model
assessing objective constraint following. The constraint following reward
weight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled
groups, ensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in
GRPO and thus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this
proposed method. We conduct automated and manual evaluations across diverse
model families from 8B to 72B parameters. Additionally, we construct a
real-world writing benchmark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation.
Results illustrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in both
instruction following (IFEval from 83.36\% to 86.65\%) and writing quality
(72.75\% win rate in manual expert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the
best of our knowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences
with objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective
solution for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization.

TL;DR: A survey proposes an anthropomorphic evaluation paradigm for LLMs with a 3D IQ/EQ/PQ taxonomy and a Value-oriented Evaluation (VQ) framework, plus a modular six-component architecture and a practical roadmap, aimed at aligning performance with real-world utility and ethical considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks are fragmented, focusing on technical metrics and neglecting deployment-relevant holistic appraisal; there is a gap between benchmark performance and real-world utility; need for interpretable, ethically sound, and sustainable evaluation.

Method: Introduce a three-dimensional taxonomy (IQ-General Intelligence for foundational capacity, EQ-Alignment Ability for value-based interactions, PQ-Professional Expertise for specialized proficiency), plus a Value-oriented Evaluation (VQ) framework (economic viability, social impact, ethical alignment, environmental sustainability). Propose a modular architecture with six components and an implementation roadmap; analyze 200+ benchmarks to identify challenges; provide a curated repository of open-source evaluation resources.

Result: Provides actionable guidance for developing LLMs that are technically proficient, contextually relevant, and ethically sound; identifies dynamic assessment needs and interpretability gaps; offers a repository to support evaluation resource sharing.

Conclusion: If adopted, this evaluation paradigm could bridge the gap between benchmark performance and real-world utility by emphasizing holistic, value-aligned, and sustainable LLM deployment.

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs), a disconnect persists between benchmark
performance and real-world utility. Current evaluation frameworks remain
fragmented, prioritizing technical metrics while neglecting holistic assessment
for deployment. This survey introduces an anthropomorphic evaluation paradigm
through the lens of human intelligence, proposing a novel three-dimensional
taxonomy: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General Intelligence for foundational
capacity, Emotional Quotient (EQ)-Alignment Ability for value-based
interactions, and Professional Quotient (PQ)-Professional Expertise for
specialized proficiency. For practical value, we pioneer a Value-oriented
Evaluation (VQ) framework assessing economic viability, social impact, ethical
alignment, and environmental sustainability. Our modular architecture
integrates six components with an implementation roadmap. Through analysis of
200+ benchmarks, we identify key challenges including dynamic assessment needs
and interpretability gaps. It provides actionable guidance for developing LLMs

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MUA-RL introduces a multi-turn, user-interacting RL framework that injects LLMSimulated users into the training loop to learn effective communication and tool-use strategies, achieving competitive results against larger models on several benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL methods for agentic tool use do not model genuinely dynamic users during training, hindering agents’ ability to iteratively refine user needs and tool decisions in multi-turn settings.

Method: MUA-RL integrates LLMSimulated users into the RL loop, enabling autonomous learning of user communication policies and tool invocation strategies, and evaluates on multiple multi-turn tool-use benchmarks (TAU2 Retail/Airline/Telecom, BFCL-V3 Multi Turn, ACEBench Agent).

Result: MUA-RL-32B attains 67.3 (TAU2 Retail), 45.4 (TAU2 Airline), 28.3 (TAU2 Telecom), 28.4 (BFCL-V3 Multi Turn), and 82.5 (ACEBench Agent); it outperforms or matches larger open-source models such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B in non-thinking settings.

Conclusion: Incorporating dynamic user simulations into RL training is effective for learning robust, multi-turn agentic tool-use policies and can yield competitive performance with larger models.

Abstract: With the recent rapid advancement of Agentic Intelligence, agentic tool use
in LLMs has become increasingly important. During multi-turn interactions
between agents and users, the dynamic, uncertain, and stochastic nature of user
demands poses significant challenges to the agent's tool invocation
capabilities. Agents are no longer expected to simply call tools to deliver a
result; rather, they must iteratively refine their understanding of user needs
through communication while simultaneously invoking tools to resolve user
queries. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for tool use lack the
integration of genuinely dynamic users during the RL training process. To
bridge this gap, we introduce MUA-RL (Multi-turn User-interacting Agent
Reinforcement Learning for agentic tool use), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that, for the first time in the field of agentic tool use, integrates
LLM-simulated users into the reinforcement learning loop. MUA-RL aims to enable
autonomous learning of models to communicate with users efficiently and use
various tools to solve practical problems in dynamic multi-turn interactions.
Evaluations are done on several multi-turn tool-using benchmarks (see Figure
1). Specifically, MUA-RL-32B achieves 67.3 on TAU2 Retail, 45.4 on TAU2
Airline, 28.3 on TAU2 Telecom, 28.4 on BFCL-V3 Multi Turn, and 82.5 on ACEBench
Agent -- outperforming or matching the performance of larger open-source models
such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B in non-thinking settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reactive agents limit effectiveness and efficiency in information acquisition; there is a need for proactive, anticipatory support in daily information seeking.

Method: Design of AppAgent-Pro as a proactive GUI agent that integrates multi-domain information, anticipates user needs, and conducts in-depth information mining; includes demonstration and publicly available code and a demo video.

Result: Conceptual framework with demonstration resources; the abstract does not report empirical results.

Conclusion: AppAgent-Pro has the potential to redefine information acquisition in daily life and could have a profound impact on human society.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in addressing complex tasks, thereby enabling more advanced
information retrieval and supporting deeper, more sophisticated human
information-seeking behaviors. However, most existing agents operate in a
purely reactive manner, responding passively to user instructions, which
significantly constrains their effectiveness and efficiency as general-purpose
platforms for information acquisition. To overcome this limitation, this paper
proposes AppAgent-Pro, a proactive GUI agent system that actively integrates
multi-domain information based on user instructions. This approach enables the
system to proactively anticipate users' underlying needs and conduct in-depth
multi-domain information mining, thereby facilitating the acquisition of more
comprehensive and intelligent information. AppAgent-Pro has the potential to
fundamentally redefine information acquisition in daily life, leading to a
profound impact on human society. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VistaWise is a cost-efficient agent framework that combines cross-modal domain knowledge with a dedicated object detector to enable LLM-based embodied decision-making in open-world environments, reducing domain-specific data requirements from millions to a few hundred and achieving state-of-the-art results on Minecraft-like tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with domain-specific knowledge in embodied tasks; finetuning on large-scale domain data is expensive. There is a need for a cost-effective approach that leverages domain knowledge and visual understanding to improve performance without prohibitive data requirements.

Method: Train a dedicated visual detector; construct a cross-modal knowledge graph that fuses visual data and textual dependencies; use a retrieval-based pooling strategy to extract task-relevant information from the KG; provide a desktop-level skill library to operate the Minecraft client via mouse/keyboard inputs; evaluate on open-world tasks.

Result: VistaWise attains state-of-the-art performance across multiple open-world tasks while dramatically reducing data costs for domain-specific knowledge (from millions of samples to a few hundred).

Conclusion: Integrating cross-modal knowledge graphs with light-weight domain-specific perception and a direct-action library yields cost-efficient, high-performing LLM-based agents for embodied tasks in open-world environments.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in embodied
decision-making tasks within virtual open-world environments. Nonetheless,
their performance is hindered by the absence of domain-specific knowledge.
Methods that finetune on large-scale domain-specific data entail prohibitive
development costs. This paper introduces VistaWise, a cost-effective agent
framework that integrates cross-modal domain knowledge and finetunes a
dedicated object detection model for visual analysis. It reduces the
requirement for domain-specific training data from millions of samples to a few
hundred. VistaWise integrates visual information and textual dependencies into
a cross-modal knowledge graph (KG), enabling a comprehensive and accurate
understanding of multimodal environments. We also equip the agent with a
retrieval-based pooling strategy to extract task-related information from the
KG, and a desktop-level skill library to support direct operation of the
Minecraft desktop client via mouse and keyboard inputs. Experimental results
demonstrate that VistaWise achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
open-world tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing development costs
while enhancing agent performance.

TL;DR: A multi-agent Bias Mitigation Agent reduces information bias in agentic AI by optimizing source selection, achieving an 81.82% bias reduction over naive retrieval.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address bias and fairness in agentic AI systems, which rely on internal/external sources and can produce biased or untrustworthy outputs that erode user trust.

Method: Introduce a Bias Mitigation Agent as a multi-agent system that coordinates specialized agents to curate source selection, ensuring retrieved content is highly relevant and minimally biased for fair knowledge dissemination.

Result: Experimental results show an 81.82% reduction in bias compared with a baseline naive retrieval strategy.

Conclusion: A multi-agent bias mitigation framework effectively enhances fairness and trust in agentic AI by systematically selecting less-biased sources while maintaining relevance.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the field of artificial
intelligence by unlocking the era of generative applications. Built on top of
generative AI capabilities, Agentic AI represents a major shift toward
autonomous, goal-driven systems that can reason, retrieve, and act. However,
they also inherit the bias present in both internal and external information
sources. This significantly affects the fairness and balance of retrieved
information, and hence reduces user trust. To address this critical challenge,
we introduce a novel Bias Mitigation Agent, a multi-agent system designed to
orchestrate the workflow of bias mitigation through specialized agents that
optimize the selection of sources to ensure that the retrieved content is both
highly relevant and minimally biased to promote fair and balanced knowledge
dissemination. The experimental results demonstrate an 81.82\% reduction in
bias compared to a baseline naive retrieval strategy.

### [128] [CAC-CoT: Connector-Aware Compact Chain-of-Thought for Efficient Reasoning Data Synthesis Across Dual-System Cognitive Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18743)
*Sunguk Choi,Yonghoon Kwon,Heondeuk Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAC-CoT constrains reasoning to a fixed set of connectors to produce concise, well-structured traces, trained with Gemini-2.0-Flash; achieves strong System-2 accuracy with shorter traces and retains System-1 performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long, verbose chain-of-thought (CoT) traces slow down or degrade performance on fast, intuitive System-1 tasks; there is a need for concise, efficient reasoning that preserves accuracy.

Method: Introduce Connector-Aware Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) that restricts reasoning to a small fixed set of connector phrases. Uses synthetic data generation with Gemini-2.0-Flash for training. Evaluated on GSM8K and GPQA (System-2) and S1-Bench (System-1).

Result: GSM8K ≈85%, GPQA ≈40% (System-2), S1-Bench ≈90% (System-1). Reasoning traces average ~300 tokens, about one-third the length of baseline traces, implying higher efficiency without accuracy loss.

Conclusion: A simple, fixed-connector CoT approach yields high accuracy with much shorter reasoning traces, offering efficient and scalable reasoning for LLMs.

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs)
solve difficult problems, but very long traces often slow or even degrade
performance on fast, intuitive "System-1" tasks. We introduce Connector-Aware
Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) -- a method that deliberately restricts reasoning to a
small, fixed set of connector phrases, steering the model toward concise and
well -- structured explanations. Despite its simplicity, our synthetic method
with Gemini-2.0-Flash yields a high-quality training quality. CAC-CoT achieves
approximately 85% on GSM8K and approximately 40% on GPQA (System-2) while
retaining approximately 90% on S1-Bench (System-1). Its reasoning traces
average approximately 300 tokens(ART), about one-third the length of baseline
traces, delivering higher efficiency without loss of accuracy.

### [129] [Reflection-Enhanced Meta-Optimization Integrating TextGrad-style Prompt Optimization with Memory-Driven Self-Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18749)
*Chunlong Wu,Zhibo Qu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REMO is a memory-augmented meta-optimization framework that records cross-run reflective insights via a RAG 'mistake notebook' and uses an LLM-driven meta-controller to iteratively refine prompting; it yields more stable generalization than TextGrad on GSM8K but with higher compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address stateless, per-run prompt optimization and overfitting by preserving historical optimization knowledge and enabling continual improvement across tasks.

Method: Combine a memory-augmented Reflection Retrieval-Augmented Generation module with a Self-Adaptive Optimizer (LLM meta-controller) to synthesize epoch-level insights; supports local prompt tuning and cross-run knowledge reuse; evaluated with Qwen3-32B in standard inference mode; ablation study.

Result: Demonstrates improved stability and robustness of generalization versus TextGrad on GSM8K; higher computational overhead; detailed analysis and ablations show component contributions.

Conclusion: Cross-run reflection and memory-augmented optimization can enhance prompt tuning for LLMs, enabling continual improvement; trade-off is increased compute; future work could optimize memory and efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in prompt optimization, exemplified by methods such as
TextGrad, enable automatic, gradient-like refinement of textual prompts to
enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on specific downstream
tasks. However, current approaches are typically stateless and operate
independently across optimization runs, lacking mechanisms to preserve and
leverage historical optimization experience. Furthermore, they are susceptible
to overfitting, often yielding prompt updates that generalize poorly beyond the
immediate task context.
  To address these limitations, we propose Reflection-Enhanced
Meta-Optimization (REMO), a novel framework that integrates (1) a
memory-augmented Reflection Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module -
structured as a "mistake notebook" and (2) a Self-Adaptive Optimizer,
implemented via an LLM-driven meta-controller that synthesizes epoch-level
reflective insights to iteratively improve system-level prompting strategies.
This architecture enables not only local, fine-grained prompt tuning akin to
TextGrad, but also the systematic accumulation and reuse of cross-run
optimization knowledge, thereby supporting continual improvement over time.
  We instantiate the REMO framework using Qwen3-32B in standard inference mode
- without explicit chain-of-thought prompting - and evaluate its efficacy on
the GSM8K benchmark for mathematical reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate that, compared to a TextGrad baseline, REMO achieves more stable
and robust generalization, albeit at the cost of increased computational
overhead. We provide a detailed exposition of the algorithmic design, conduct a
qualitative and quantitative analysis of optimization dynamics, and present a
comprehensive ablation study to elucidate the contributions of each component.

### [130] [Stabilizing Open-Set Test-Time Adaptation via Primary-Auxiliary Filtering and Knowledge-Integrated Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18751)
*Byung-Joon Lee,Jin-Seop Lee,Jee-Hyong Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This work introduces Primary-Auxiliary Filtering (PAF) and Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP) for open-set test-time adaptation (OSTTA), achieving improved closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination under domain shifts across diverse datasets; code is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world test data exhibit domain shifts and open-set scenarios, which degrade closed-set TTA performance. Filtering based solely on a single model (source or adapting) can be unreliable under shift. A robust filtering mechanism and a principled integration of multiple model signals are needed for OSTTA.

Method: PAF adds an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the primary filter, reducing instability from the adapting model during data selection. KIP calibrates and integrates the outputs of three sources—the adapting model, an EMA-maintained model, and the source model—to leverage their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. The approach also leverages entropy-based handling to identify and manage open-set samples.

Result: Empirical evaluation across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets shows that PAF-KIP improves both closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods. The method demonstrates robust performance under domain shift, with code released for reproducibility.

Conclusion: PAF-KIP provides a robust OSTTA framework by combining a validated filtering mechanism with calibrated, multi-source predictions. This leads to stronger performance in open-set scenarios and better generalization under domain shifts; the approach is adaptable to various TTA settings and datasets.

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate strong performance under aligned
training-test distributions. However, real-world test data often exhibit domain
shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the
model to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the
training and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world
scenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade
closed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data
during adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,
the previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in
suboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we
found that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test
streams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for
filtering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering
(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the
primary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP),
which calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model
to integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach
across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both
closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods. The code
is available at https://github.com/powerpowe/PAF-KIP-OSTTA .

### [131] [Answering the Unanswerable Is to Err Knowingly: Analyzing and Mitigating Abstention Failures in Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18760)
*Yi Liu,Xiangyu Liu,Zequn Sun,Wei Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LRMs struggle to abstain on inherently unanswerable questions; a lightweight two-stage method (cognitive monitoring + inference-time intervention) improves abstention rates while preserving reasoning performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trustworthy AI requires models to appropriately abstain when questions are unanswerable. The paper reveals a misalignment between internal cognition and external responses in LRMs and seeks to fix it.

Method: 1) analyze different response behaviors of LRMs to unanswerable questions; 2) demonstrate that LRMs can recognize flaws but fail to abstain; 3) propose a two-stage approach combining cognitive monitoring with inference-time intervention to trigger abstention.

Result: The proposed method significantly improves the abstention rate without deteriorating overall reasoning performance.

Conclusion: Addressing misalignment between internal cognition and external responses can enhance the reliability of LRMs; the two-stage cognitive monitoring plus intervention effectively yields trustworthy abstention behavior.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown remarkable progress on complex
reasoning tasks. However, some questions posed to LRMs are inherently
unanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that
LRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with
these unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze,
investigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a
detailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing
unanswerable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive
capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions. However, they fail to
exhibit appropriate abstention behavior, revealing a misalignment between their
internal cognition and external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we
propose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with
inference-time intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall
reasoning performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DDS: a distance-based dynamic token selection for token-level multi-model collaboration to boost autoregressive reasoning, aided by Minimal Complete Semantic Units (MCSU) for vocabulary alignment; outperforms baselines on various benchmarks; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enhance reasoning in language models by leveraging multiple models, without assuming more models always improves results, due to vocabulary misalignment and suboptimal token choices. Introduces a strategy to dynamically select tokens and align semantics.

Method: Aggregate next-token distributions from multiple models, use a distribution-distance based metric to dynamically select the optimal next token at each step (DDS). Introduce Minimal Complete Semantic Units (MCSU) to ensure cross-model vocabulary alignment within the linguistic space, enabling natural collaboration.

Result: Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Dynamic, token-level multi-model collaboration with DDS and MCSU improves autoregressive reasoning; code to reproduce is available at the stated GitHub URL.

Abstract: This paper investigates the enhancement of reasoning capabilities in language
models through token-level multi-model collaboration. Our approach selects the
optimal tokens from the next token distributions provided by multiple models to
perform autoregressive reasoning. Contrary to the assumption that more models
yield better results, we introduce a distribution distance-based dynamic
selection strategy (DDS) to optimize the multi-model collaboration process. To
address the critical challenge of vocabulary misalignment in multi-model
collaboration, we propose the concept of minimal complete semantic units
(MCSU), which is simple yet enables multiple language models to achieve natural
alignment within the linguistic space. Experimental results across various
benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method. The code will be

### [134] [CausalMACE: Causality Empowered Multi-Agents in Minecraft Cooperative Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18797)
*Qi Chai,Zhang Zheng,Junlong Ren,Deheng Ye,Zichuan Lin,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CausalMACE presents a causality-aware multi-agent planning framework for Minecraft, combining a global task graph with a causality-based dependency manager to coordinate agents, achieving state-of-the-art results in cooperative tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-agent LLMs face inefficiency and limited fault tolerance for long action sequences; multi-agent collaboration is underexplored and requires managing inter-subtask dependencies.

Method: A two-module architecture: (1) an overarching task graph for global task planning, and (2) a causality-based dependency management module using causal interventions to handle task dependencies.

Result: Experimental results show state-of-the-art performance in multi-agent cooperative Minecraft tasks.

Conclusion: Causal intervention-driven causality planning in a multi-agent framework improves coordination and performance, with potential applicability beyond Minecraft.

Abstract: Minecraft, as an open-world virtual interactive environment, has become a
prominent platform for research on agent decision-making and execution.
Existing works primarily adopt a single Large Language Model (LLM) agent to
complete various in-game tasks. However, for complex tasks requiring lengthy
sequences of actions, single-agent approaches often face challenges related to
inefficiency and limited fault tolerance. Despite these issues, research on
multi-agent collaboration remains scarce. In this paper, we propose CausalMACE,
a holistic causality planning framework designed to enhance multi-agent
systems, in which we incorporate causality to manage dependencies among
subtasks. Technically, our proposed framework introduces two modules: an
overarching task graph for global task planning and a causality-based module
for dependency management, where inherent rules are adopted to perform causal
intervention. Experimental results demonstrate our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in multi-agent cooperative tasks of Minecraft.

### [135] [STARec: An Efficient Agent Framework for Recommender Systems via Autonomous Deliberate Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18812)
*Chenghao Wu,Ruiyang Ren,Junjie Zhang,Ruirui Wang,Zhongrui Ma,Qi Ye,Wayne Xin Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: STARec introduces a slow-thinking augmented agent framework for recommender systems, using parallel fast and slow cognition with anchored reinforcement training, achieving superior performance with only 0.4% data on MovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Recommender systems are hampered by static user models and reactive decision-making. LLM-based agents inherit shallow correlation biases, limited causal inference, and brittleness in sparse data. A deliberative, slow-thinking approach aims to improve robustness, causal reasoning, and data efficiency.

Method: Model users as agents with parallel fast (immediate) and slow (deliberative) cognition. Slow thinking generates chain-of-thought rationales. Train via anchored reinforcement training: a two-stage process combining structured knowledge distillation from advanced reasoning models and reward shaping guided by preferences. Use simulated feedback loops to adapt policies.

Result: Experiments on MovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs show substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines while using only 0.4% of the full training data.

Conclusion: The STARec framework demonstrates that slow-thinking augmented agents can enhance recommender systems, improving reasoning capabilities and data efficiency, and yielding strong performance gains on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: While modern recommender systems are instrumental in navigating information
abundance, they remain fundamentally limited by static user modeling and
reactive decision-making paradigms. Current large language model (LLM)-based
agents inherit these shortcomings through their overreliance on heuristic
pattern matching, yielding recommendations prone to shallow correlation bias,
limited causal inference, and brittleness in sparse-data scenarios. We
introduce STARec, a slow-thinking augmented agent framework that endows
recommender systems with autonomous deliberative reasoning capabilities. Each
user is modeled as an agent with parallel cognitions: fast response for
immediate interactions and slow reasoning that performs chain-of-thought
rationales. To cultivate intrinsic slow thinking, we develop anchored
reinforcement training - a two-stage paradigm combining structured knowledge
distillation from advanced reasoning models with preference-aligned reward
shaping. This hybrid approach scaffolds agents in acquiring foundational
capabilities (preference summarization, rationale generation) while enabling
dynamic policy adaptation through simulated feedback loops. Experiments on
MovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs benchmarks demonstrate that STARec achieves
substantial performance gains compared with state-of-the-art baselines, despite
using only 0.4% of the full training data.

### [136] [Judicial Requirements for Generative AI in Legal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18880)
*Eljas Linna,Tuula Linna*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs show potential for legal reasoning but cannot yet meet full judicial standards; IRAC reveals core capability gaps in Rule selection and Application, such as cross-jurisdiction framing, source-based argumentation, distinguishing ratio decidendi from obiter, ambiguity, conflicts, and burden of proof. AI techniques (RAG, multi-agent, neuro-symbolic) address some gaps but cannot replace human discretion or provide fully transparent justification; best use is a dual role: high-volume assistant for simple cases and a sophisticated sparring partner for complex matters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Define the capability bar for AI as a reliable legal reasoning tool and assess how current AI enhancements align with that bar in the context of judicial decision-making.

Method: Analytical mapping using the IRAC framework to decompose legal reasoning into core requirements, then evaluate AI enhancement techniques (RAG, multi-agent systems, neuro-symbolic AI) against these requirements, culminating in practical recommendations.

Result: Certain AI techniques can support specific steps (e.g., sourcing, argument construction, cross-jurisdictional framing) but fundamental challenges persist in discretionary, explainable reasoning and transparent justification; AI currently best fits as a high-volume assistant for straightforward cases and as a sophisticated sparring partner for experts in complex matters.

Conclusion: AI in law should be deployed as a dual-role system—augmenting routine tasks and challenging human experts—while progress toward discernment, explainability, and jurisdiction-aware reasoning remains essential.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being integrated into professional domains,
yet their limitations in high-stakes fields like law remain poorly understood.
This paper defines the core capabilities that an AI system must possess to
function as a reliable reasoning tool in judicial decision-making. Using the
IRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) model as an analytical framework, the
study focuses on the most challenging phases of legal adjudication: determining
the applicable Rule (R) and performing the Application (A) of that rule to the
facts of a case. From a judicial perspective, the analysis deconstructs legal
reasoning into a series of core requirements, including the ability to select
the correct legal framework across jurisdictions, generate sound arguments
based on the doctrine of legal sources, distinguish ratio decidendi from obiter
dictum in case law, resolve ambiguity arising from general clauses like
"reasonableness", manage conflicting legal provisions, and correctly apply the
burden of proof. The paper then maps various AI enhancement mechanisms, such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent systems, and neuro-symbolic
AI, to these requirements, assessing their potential to bridge the gap between
the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the rigorous, choice-driven demands of
legal interpretation. The findings indicate that while these techniques can
address specific challenges, significant challenges remain, particularly in
tasks requiring discretion and transparent, justifiable reasoning. Our paper
concludes that the most effective current role for AI in law is a dual one: as
a high-volume assistant for simple, repetitive cases and as a sophisticated
"sparring partner" for human experts in complex matters.

*Dimitrios Rontogiannis,Maxime Peyrard,Nicolas Baldwin,Martin Josifoski,Robert West,Dimitrios Gunopulos*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A dynamic, interactive evaluation framework for LLMs on multi-requirement programming tasks, using a requirement dependency graph and an interviewer/interviewee dialogue with minimal hints; extends the DevAI benchmark with ground-truth solutions and expert-annotated hints to yield fine-grained diagnostic insights for collaborative code generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static, single-turn benchmarks fail to capture nuanced LLM capabilities in software engineering tasks. A dynamic, feedback-driven evaluation can reveal strengths and systematic weaknesses, guiding the development of collaborative code agents.

Method: Model tasks as requirement dependency graphs. An interviewer LLM, aware of the ground-truth solution, provides minimal, targeted hints to an interviewee model within a structured dialogue. Extend DevAI with ground-truth solutions and assess the relevance/utility of interviewer hints via expert annotation.

Result: The dynamic protocol yields fine-grained diagnostics on model behavior, exposing strengths and weaknesses that static benchmarks miss. It demonstrates the value of dynamic evaluation for improving collaborative code-generation agents and highlights the utility of targeted hints.

Conclusion: Dynamic, interactive evaluation is essential for advancing LLM-based software engineering tools. Ground-truth solutions and expert-annotated hints enable meaningful assessment and improvement of collaborative code agents.

Abstract: Standard single-turn, static benchmarks fall short in evaluating the nuanced
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex tasks such as software
engineering. In this work, we propose a novel interactive evaluation framework
that assesses LLMs on multi-requirement programming tasks through structured,
feedback-driven dialogue. Each task is modeled as a requirement dependency
graph, and an ``interviewer'' LLM, aware of the ground-truth solution, provides
minimal, targeted hints to an ``interviewee'' model to help correct errors and
fulfill target constraints. This dynamic protocol enables fine-grained
diagnostic insights into model behavior, uncovering strengths and systematic
weaknesses that static benchmarks fail to measure. We build on DevAI, a
benchmark of 55 curated programming tasks, by adding ground-truth solutions and
evaluating the relevance and utility of interviewer hints through expert
annotation. Our results highlight the importance of dynamic evaluation in
advancing the development of collaborative code-generating agents.

*Yanxing Huang,Xinling Jin,Sijie Liang,Peng Li,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FormaRL is a reinforcement learning framework for autoformalization that uses Lean syntax checks and LLM consistency rewards, with GRPO updating the formalizer; it achieves substantial gains with very limited unlabeled data and introduces the uproof dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data scarcity and inefficiency in autoformalization and theorem proving, enabling improvements with limited labeled data and unlabeled data.

Method: FormaRL integrates Lean compiler syntax checks and large-language-model consistency checks into a reward signal, and uses the GRPO algorithm to update the formalizer. It trains on ~859 unlabeled examples and uses a curated proof problem dataset 'uproof'. Evaluation compares against Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct on ProofNet and uproof, reporting pass@1 and pass@16 metrics.

Result: Pass@1 autoformalization accuracy improves from 4.04% to 26.15% on ProofNet and from 2.4% to 9.6% on uproof. Out-of-distribution performance also improves (pass@1: 6.2%→9.6%; pass@16: 24.4%→33.6%). Training code is open-sourced.

Conclusion: FormaRL demonstrates that substantial gains in autoformalization are achievable with limited unlabeled data by combining formal-verifier signals and LLM-based consistency within a reinforcement-learning update (GRPO). This facilitates progress in autoformalization and theorem proving, and the approach is accompanied by an open-source release.

Abstract: Autoformalization is one of the central tasks in formal verification, while
its advancement remains hindered due to the data scarcity and the absence
efficient methods. In this work we propose \textbf{FormaRL}, a simple yet
efficient reinforcement learning framework for autoformalization which only
requires a small amount of unlabeled data. FormaRL integrates syntax check from
Lean compiler and consistency check from large language model to calculate the
reward, and adopts GRPO algorithm to update the formalizer. We also curated a
proof problem dataset from undergraduate-level math materials, named
\textbf{uproof}, in the hope to facilitate the exploration of autoformalization
and theorem proving in advanced math. Experiments show that FormaRL can
increase the pass@1 autoformalization accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct by
4 $\sim$ 6x (4.04\% $\to$ 26.15\% on ProofNet and 2.4\% $\to$ 9.6\% on uproof)
with merely 859 unlabeled data. And on uproof our method also achieved a strong
improvement in out-of-distribution performance compared to existing open-source
state-of-the-art autoformalizers on both pass@1 accuracy (6.2\% $\to$ 9.6\%)
and pass@16 accuracy (24.4\% $\to$ 33.6\%). Training code of FormaRL is
open-sourced at https://github.com/THUNLP-MT/FormaRL.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CTGraph uses self-supervised graph representation learning to profile learner behaviors and performance in ITSs across content coverage, learning intensity, and concept proficiency, enabling detection of struggling students and cross-group analysis to guide targeted interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate performance gaps amplified by ITS-based learning by developing a unified profiling approach that tracks progress across multiple behavioral and competency dimensions, aligned with curriculum structure.

Method: A graph-level representation learning framework (CTGraph) trained in a self-supervised manner to model student learning journeys; captures content coverage, learning intensity, and proficiency across concepts; aligns graphs with curriculum; enables holistic profiling and comparisons.

Result: Experiments show CTGraph yields a holistic view of learning journeys, accounts for multiple behavior/performance aspects and curriculum-aligned variations, and can identify struggling students and enable comparative analyses across diverse groups.

Conclusion: CTGraph provides educators with rich, curriculum-aligned insights into student trajectories and supports targeted interventions to reduce disparities in ITS-driven learning.

Abstract: The surge in the adoption of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) in
education, while being integral to curriculum- based learning, can
inadvertently exacerbate performance gaps. To address this problem, student
profiling becomes crucial for tracking progress, identifying struggling
students, and alleviating disparities among students. Such profiling requires
measuring student behaviors and performance across different aspects, such as
content coverage, learning intensity, and proficiency in different concepts
within a learning topic.
  In this study, we introduce CTGraph, a graph-level repre- sentation learning
approach to profile learner behaviors and performance in a self-supervised
manner. Our experiments demonstrate that CTGraph can provide a holistic view of
student learning journeys, accounting for different aspects of student
behaviors and performance, as well as variations in their learning paths as
aligned to the curriculum structure. We also show that our approach can
identify struggling students and provide comparative analysis of diverse groups
to pinpoint when and where students are struggling. As such, our approach opens
more opportunities to empower educators with rich insights into student
learning journeys and paves the way for more targeted interventions.

*David Egea,Barproda Halder,Sanghamitra Dutta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VISION introduces a robust, interpretable vulnerability detector by augmenting training data with counterfactual code samples generated via LLMs, and training GNNs on opposite-label pairs with graph-based interpretability. It significantly reduces spurious correlations, improves generalization, and provides human-in-the-loop visualization and a public benchmark (CWE-20-CFA).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN-based vulnerability detection suffers from training data imbalance and label noise, leading to spurious correlations and poor generalization to unseen real-world code. A robust, transparent framework is needed to mitigate these issues and build trustworthy cybersecurity AI.

Method: (i) Generate counterfactuals via prompting an LLM to create minimal semantic changes that flip vulnerability labels; (ii) train GNNs on paired examples with opposite labels to discourage reliance on superficial similarities; (iii) apply graph-based interpretability to identify crucial statements and ignore spurious cues; (iv) release CWE-20-CFA (27,556 real and counterfactual functions) and provide an interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

Result: VISION reduces spurious learning and boosts detection robustness, achieving accuracy gains on CWE-20 from 51.8% to 97.8%, pairwise contrast accuracy from 4.5% to 95.8%, and worst-group accuracy from 0.7% to 85.5%. It introduces new metrics (intra-class attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, node score dependency) and a public benchmark; demonstrated benefits in generalization and trustworthy AI in cybersecurity.

Conclusion: Counterfactual data augmentation with LLMs and targeted opposite-label training, coupled with graph-based interpretability, can substantially mitigate spurious correlations in GNN-based vulnerability detection, yielding robust, generalizable detectors and enabling human-in-the-loop, transparent cybersecurity AI; CWE-20-CFA and interactive visualization support deployment and evaluation.

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

### [141] [Novel Approaches to Artificial Intelligence Development Based on the Nearest Neighbor Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18953)
*I. I. Priezzhev,D. A. Danko,A. V. Shubin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Nearest-neighbor approach with hierarchical clustering and Kohonen SOM trees to accelerate KNN, reduce hallucinations, avoid full-model retraining, and provide interpretable AI, achieving large speedups with only minor accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern neural networks (including LLMs) suffer from hallucinations, high computational cost for training/inference, costly fine-tuning, and catastrophic forgetting, which limits reliability in critical domains (medicine, process control, science).

Method: Replace or augment deep nets with k-nearest neighbors organized via hierarchical clustering. Use Kohonen self-organizing maps to build tree-like data structures that speed up nearest-neighbor searches and enable model expansion/fine-tuning without retraining the whole network.

Result: Empirical tests on handwritten digit recognition and simple subtitle translation show hundreds-fold speedups in nearest-neighbor search with only slight accuracy loss; the approach reduces hallucinations and offers transparency and interpretability.

Conclusion: The proposed nearest-neighbor framework is a promising, explainable, and reliable alternative for tasks requiring high reliability, with potential for broad application and easier model management compared to large, fully trained neural networks.

Abstract: Modern neural network technologies, including large language models, have
achieved remarkable success in various applied artificial intelligence
applications, however, they face a range of fundamental limitations. Among them
are hallucination effects, high computational complexity of training and
inference, costly fine-tuning, and catastrophic forgetting issues. These
limitations significantly hinder the use of neural networks in critical areas
such as medicine, industrial process management, and scientific research. This
article proposes an alternative approach based on the nearest neighbors method
with hierarchical clustering structures. Employing the k-nearest neighbors
algorithm significantly reduces or completely eliminates hallucination effects
while simplifying model expansion and fine-tuning without the need for
retraining the entire network. To overcome the high computational load of the
k-nearest neighbors method, the paper proposes using tree-like data structures
based on Kohonen self-organizing maps, thereby greatly accelerating nearest
neighbor searches. Tests conducted on handwritten digit recognition and simple
subtitle translation tasks confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. With only a slight reduction in accuracy, the nearest neighbor search
time was reduced hundreds of times compared to exhaustive search methods. The
proposed method features transparency and interpretability, closely aligns with
human cognitive mechanisms, and demonstrates potential for extensive use in
tasks requiring high reliability and explainable results.

### [142] [Enabling MoE on the Edge via Importance-Driven Expert Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18983)
*Guoying Zhu,Meng Li,Haipeng Dai,Xuechen Liu,Weijun Wang,Keran Li,Jun xiao,Ligeng Chen,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an importance-guided dynamic offloading strategy for Mixture of Experts (MoE) on edge GPUs that substitutes low-importance experts with similar ones cached in GPU memory, reducing memory transfers and PCIe overhead while preserving accuracy; adds a cache-friendly scheduling policy to maximize reuse, achieving ~48% decoding latency reduction and ~60% cache hit rate with nearly lossless accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE scaling on consumer-grade edge hardware is memory-bound. Offloading experts to device memory must minimize data transfers and latency without sacrificing model accuracy, but traditional offloading treats it as pure scheduling.

Method: Use expert importance to guide offloading decisions, replacing low-importance activated experts with functionally similar, already cached experts in GPU memory. Introduce a scheduling policy to maximize reuse of GPU-cached experts and minimize data transfer, thereby reducing memory usage and PCIe activity.

Result: Decoding latency is reduced by about 48%, with an expert cache hit rate exceeding 60%, and accuracy remains nearly lossless.

Conclusion: Importance-guided offloading with cache-aware scheduling can effectively deploy MoE on edge hardware by reducing memory and PCIe overhead while preserving accuracy, enabling more efficient edge inference.

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a key technique for
scaling Large Language Models by activating only a subset of experts per query.
Deploying MoE on consumer-grade edge hardware, however, is constrained by
limited device memory, making dynamic expert offloading essential. Unlike prior
work that treats offloading purely as a scheduling problem, we leverage expert
importance to guide decisions, substituting low-importance activated experts
with functionally similar ones already cached in GPU memory, thereby preserving
accuracy. As a result, this design reduces memory usage and data transfer,
while largely eliminating PCIe overhead. In addition, we introduce a scheduling
policy that maximizes the reuse ratio of GPU-cached experts, further boosting
efficiency. Extensive evaluations show that our approach delivers 48% lower
decoding latency with over 60% expert cache hit rate, while maintaining nearly
lossless accuracy.

### [143] [AI Models Exceed Individual Human Accuracy in Predicting Everyday Social Norms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19004)
*Pontus Strimling,Simon Karlsson,Irina Vartanova,Kimmo Eriksson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can predict human social appropriateness well from language data alone, outperforming most humans, but show systematic, correlated errors; suggests language encodes cultural norms and challenges embodied-experience theories.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Test whether sophisticated normative understanding arises primarily from statistical learning of language as opposed to embodied social experience.

Method: Two studies evaluating AI systems' predictions of human social judgments across 555 everyday scenarios; compared models (GPT-4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4) against humans; used continuous scale judgments and percentile standing against human distribution; analyzed error patterns.

Result: GPT-4.5 achieved 100th percentile over human judgments; Gemini 2.5 Pro 98.7%, GPT-5 97.8%, Claude Sonnet 4 96.0% of humans; all models showed systematic, correlated errors.

Conclusion: Sophisticated social cognition can emerge from statistical learning over linguistic data, challenging strong embodied-experience theories; language is a rich repository for cultural knowledge, but pattern-based understanding may have boundary conditions as indicated by systematic errors.

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive science concerns how social norms are
acquired and represented. While humans typically learn norms through embodied
social experience, we investigated whether large language models can achieve
sophisticated norm understanding through statistical learning alone. Across two
studies, we systematically evaluated multiple AI systems' ability to predict
human social appropriateness judgments for 555 everyday scenarios by examining
how closely they predicted the average judgment compared to each human
participant. In Study 1, GPT-4.5's accuracy in predicting the collective
judgment on a continuous scale exceeded that of every human participant (100th
percentile). Study 2 replicated this, with Gemini 2.5 Pro outperforming 98.7%
of humans, GPT-5 97.8%, and Claude Sonnet 4 96.0%. Despite this predictive
power, all models showed systematic, correlated errors. These findings
demonstrate that sophisticated models of social cognition can emerge from
statistical learning over linguistic data alone, challenging strong versions of
theories emphasizing the exclusive necessity of embodied experience for
cultural competence. The systematic nature of AI limitations across different
architectures indicates potential boundaries of pattern-based social
understanding, while the models' ability to outperform nearly all individual
humans in this predictive task suggests that language serves as a remarkably
rich repository for cultural knowledge transmission.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Experience-driven Lifelong Learning (ELL), a four-principle framework for self-evolving agents and a benchmark (StuLife) to assess lifelong learning capabilities like memory, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI approaches general intelligence, systems must move from static, single-task optimization to open-ended, real-world interaction, continuous growth, and persistent knowledge. The need for long-term memory, reusable skills, and autonomous learning drives the proposed framework and benchmark.

Method: Proposes ELL framework built on four principles: (1) Experience Exploration, (2) Long-term Memory, (3) Skill Learning, (4) Knowledge Internalization. Introduces StuLife, a benchmark simulating a student’s college journey with three phases and ten sub-scenarios, designed around paradigm shifts: Passive→Proactive, Context→Memory, Imitation→Learning. The benchmark emphasizes memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior, and explores context engineering as a lever for advancing AGI.

Result: The abstract presents a conceptual framework and dataset: ELL aims to enable continuous, self-motivated growth in agents; StuLife provides a platform to evaluate lifelong-learning capabilities (memory, skills, motivation). It also suggests evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on StuLife and highlights context engineering as a factor in advancing AGI.

Conclusion: ELL and StuLife offer a path toward practical lifelong learning and AGI progression by institutionalizing persistent memory, reusable skills, and proactive exploration, with context engineering identified as a key research direction for improving open-ended agents.

Abstract: As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from
systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn
continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning
(ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous
growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core
principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous,
self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent
tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory:
Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal
experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent
memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting
recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively
refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge
Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into
implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".
  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a
student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal
development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife
is designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive to Proactive, From
Context to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning. In this dynamic environment,
agents must acquire and distill practical skills and maintain persistent memory
to make decisions based on evolving state variables. StuLife provides a
comprehensive platform for evaluating lifelong learning capabilities, including
memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior. Beyond
evaluating SOTA LLMs on the StuLife benchmark, we also explore the role of
context engineering in advancing AGI.

*Marcin Moskalewicz,Anna Sterna,Marek Pokropski,Paula Flores*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Three LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Opus 4) were asked to mimic original investigators' phenomenological analysis of 24 life-story interviews with inpatients with BPD. Compared to human analysis, Gemini performed best with substantial overlap; GPT-4o had no overlap; Claude moderate. Gemini showed higher validity and was judged human-like by blinded experts, suggesting AI can augment qualitative thematic analysis but not replace human interpretation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether current LLMs can support phenomenological qualitative analysis of first-person experience in BPD, addressing temporality and selfhood, and to understand biases, reliability, and potential biases in AI-assisted analysis.

Method: Replicated a prior human-led thematic analysis on 24 inpatients' life-story interviews. Prompt three LLMs to imitate the interpretive style of the original investigators. Evaluate outputs with blinded and non-blinded experts in phenomenology and clinical psychology using semantic congruence, Jaccard similarity, and multidimensional validity (credibility, coherence, substantiveness, groundness in data). Report overlap percentages (0%, 42%, 58%), Jaccard (0.21-0.28), and significance (p<0.0001).

Result: GPT-4o achieved 0% overlap, Claude Opus 4 achieved 42%, Gemini 58% overlap with human analysis. Jaccard 0.21-0.28. Gemini's outputs most closely matched human themes, with higher validity scores than GPT and Claude (p<0.0001) and judged human-like by blinded experts. Validity scores correlated strongly with text quantity per theme.

Conclusion: AI-augmented thematic analysis shows promise for reducing interpretive bias and handling large qualitative datasets in phenomenology, with Gemini as the most capable model among those tested. However, performance is variable and AI should augment rather than replace expert analysis; further work needed on reliability, bias mitigation, and integration into qualitative workflows.

Abstract: This study examines the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to support
phenomenological qualitative analysis of first-person experience in Borderline
Personality Disorder (BPD), understood as a disorder of temporality and
selfhood. Building on a prior human-led thematic analysis of 24 inpatients'
life-story interviews, we compared three LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini 2.5
Pro, Anthropic Claude Opus 4) prompted to mimic the interpretative style of the
original investigators. The models were evaluated with blinded and non-blinded
expert judges in phenomenology and clinical psychology. Assessments included
semantic congruence, Jaccard coefficients, and multidimensional validity
ratings (credibility, coherence, substantiveness, and groundness in data).
Results showed variable overlap with the human analysis, from 0 percent in GPT
to 42 percent in Claude and 58 percent in Gemini, and a low Jaccard coefficient
(0.21-0.28). However, the models recovered themes omitted by humans. Gemini's
output most closely resembled the human analysis, with validity scores
significantly higher than GPT and Claude (p < 0.0001), and was judged as human
by blinded experts. All scores strongly correlated (R > 0.78) with the quantity
of text and words per theme, highlighting both the variability and potential of
AI-augmented thematic analysis to mitigate human interpretative bias.

*Surajit Das,Gourav Roy,Aleksei Eliseev,Ram Kumar Rajendran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RL-based MAB framework (APME) estimates problem difficulty from solver data alone, without linguistic features, achieving high predictive accuracy across datasets and outperforming NLP/IRT baselines, especially in symbolic domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need objective, domain-agnostic difficulty tagging for Intelligent & Autonomous Tutoring Systems; human labeling is subjective and NLP methods fail in symbolic domains; develop a scalable, self-supervised approach.

Method: Passive Measures among Educands (APME) uses reinforcement learning-driven Multi-Armed Bandit to estimate item difficulty from solver performance data (marks and time) without linguistic features or expert labels; leverages inverse coefficient of variation as a risk-adjusted metric for explainable adaptation; domain-agnostic.

Result: Validated on three heterogeneous datasets; average R2 = 0.9213 and RMSE = 0.0584; outperforms regression-based, NLP-driven, and IRT baselines; robust across educational levels and assessment formats; particularly effective in symbolic domains.

Conclusion: Domain-agnostic, self-supervised approach advances difficulty tagging in IATS; scalable and explainable; aligns with Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development by identifying tasks balancing challenge and attainability; extendable beyond algebra wherever solver interaction data is available.

Abstract: The evolution of technology and education is driving the emergence of
Intelligent & Au- tonomous Tutoring Systems (IATS), where objective and
domain-agnostic methods for determining question difficulty are essential.
Traditional human labeling is subjective, and existing NLP-based ap- proaches
fail in symbolic domains like algebra. This study introduces the Approach of
Passive Measures among Educands (APME), a reinforcement learning-based
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework that estimates difficulty solely from solver
performance data- marks obtained and time taken without re- quiring linguistic
features or expert labels. By leveraging the inverse coefficient of variation
as a risk- adjusted metric, the model provides an explainable and scalable
mechanism for adaptive assessment. Empirical validation was conducted on three
heterogeneous datasets. Across these diverse con- texts, the model achieved an
average R2 of 0.9213 and an average RMSE of 0.0584, confirming its robustness,
accuracy, and adaptability to different educational levels and assessment
formats. Com- pared with baseline approaches-such as regression-based,
NLP-driven, and IRT models-the proposed framework consistently outperformed
alternatives, particularly in purely symbolic domains. The findings highlight
that (i) item heterogeneity strongly influences perceived difficulty, and (ii)
vari- ance in solver outcomes is as critical as mean performance for adaptive
allocation. Pedagogically, the model aligns with Vygotskys Zone of Proximal
Development by identifying tasks that balance challenge and attainability,
supporting motivation while minimizing disengagement. This domain-agnostic,
self- supervised approach advances difficulty tagging in IATS and can be
extended beyond algebra wherever solver interaction data is available

### [147] [Investigating Advanced Reasoning of Large Language Models via Black-Box Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19035)
*Congchi Yin,Tianyi Wu,Yankai Shu,Alex Gu,Yunhan Wang,Jun Shao,Xun Jiang,Piji Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new black-box interaction paradigm evaluates LLMs' integrated reasoning in unknown, interactive environments; introduces the Oracle benchmark with 6 black-box task types and 96 instances; 19 modern LLMs benchmarked; o3 leads in most tasks but struggles on harder boxes; reveals a universal difficulty: LLMs lack high-level planning for efficient, adaptive exploration and hypothesis refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current benchmarks isolate deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning and fail to assess integrated, interactive reasoning needed for real-world discovery. The proposed black-box interaction paradigm seeks to evaluate an LLM's ability to uncover hidden input-output mappings through iterative exploration.

Method: Define a hidden function (black-box) that maps specific inputs to outputs. LLMs interact across exploration turns, observe IO pairs, and reason about the hidden function. Build the Oracle benchmark with 6 black-box task types and 96 instances. Benchmark 19 contemporary LLMs and analyze performance and planning behaviors.

Result: o3 ranks first in 5 of the 6 tasks, achieving over 70% accuracy on most easy black-boxes. However, its performance drops below 40% on several hard black-box tasks. Across models, a universal difficulty is identified: lack of high-level planning to develop efficient and adaptive exploration strategies for hypothesis refinement.

Conclusion: The black-box interaction paradigm offers a more realistic evaluation of LLMs' integrated reasoning in unknown, interactive environments. The findings highlight gaps in planning and exploration strategy development, motivating future work to enhance high-level planning abilities for better interactive reasoning.

Abstract: Existing tasks fall short in evaluating reasoning ability of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in an interactive, unknown environment. This deficiency leads to
the isolated assessment of deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning,
neglecting the integrated reasoning process that is indispensable for humans
discovery of real world. We introduce a novel evaluation paradigm,
\textit{black-box interaction}, to tackle this challenge. A black-box is
defined by a hidden function that maps a specific set of inputs to outputs.
LLMs are required to unravel the hidden function behind the black-box by
interacting with it in given exploration turns, and reasoning over observed
input-output pairs. Leveraging this idea, we build the \textsc{Oracle}
benchmark which comprises 6 types of black-box task and 96 black-boxes. 19
modern LLMs are benchmarked. o3 ranks first in 5 of the 6 tasks, achieving over
70\% accuracy on most easy black-boxes. But it still struggles with some hard
black-box tasks, where its average performance drops below 40\%. Further
analysis indicates a universal difficulty among LLMs: They lack the high-level
planning capability to develop efficient and adaptive exploration strategies
for hypothesis refinement.

TL;DR: CMA is a framework that orchestrates asynchronously operating LLM-based modules sharing a global state to produce coherent, fault-tolerant behavior; it enables emergent intention and embodies a practical realization of Minsky's Society of Mind, demonstrated with two use-case studies and open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address long-standing challenges in agent architectures by enabling flexible, adaptive, and context-dependent behavior through language-mediated interactions among autonomous processes and by realizing a practical Society of Mind.

Method: Implement a Concurrent Modular Agent where modules run concurrently, offload reasoning to LLMs, communicate via inter-module messages, and update a shared global state; operate in an asynchronous fault-tolerant loop; validate with two real-world use-case studies; provide source code at GitHub.

Result: Emergent properties observed; the system demonstrates viability of asynchronous modular LLM-based agents; cognitive-like phenomena such as self-awareness are suggested to arise from organized interactions of simpler processes; two use-case studies illustrate functionality; code released.

Conclusion: The CMA approach offers a practical instantiation of Minsky's Society of Mind, enabling flexible and adaptive AI through modular, language-driven coordination; it opens new research avenues and is complemented by an open-source implementation.

Abstract: We introduce the Concurrent Modular Agent (CMA), a framework that
orchestrates multiple Large-Language-Model (LLM)-based modules that operate
fully asynchronously yet maintain a coherent and fault-tolerant behavioral
loop. This framework addresses long-standing difficulties in agent
architectures by letting intention emerge from language-mediated interactions
among autonomous processes. This approach enables flexible, adaptive, and
context-dependent behavior through the combination of concurrently executed
modules that offload reasoning to an LLM, inter-module communication, and a
single shared global state.We consider this approach to be a practical
realization of Minsky's Society of Mind theory. We demonstrate the viability of
our system through two practical use-case studies. The emergent properties
observed in our system suggest that complex cognitive phenomena like
self-awareness may indeed arise from the organized interaction of simpler
processes, supporting Minsky-Society of Mind concept and opening new avenues
for artificial intelligence research. The source code for our work is available

*Zhichao Yang,Zhaoxin Fan,Gen Li,Yuanze Hu,Xinyu Wang,Ye Qiu,Xin Wang,Yifan Sun,Wenjun Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Identifies a Scaling Law by Difficulty for LLMs’ procedural math reasoning: performance follows a U-shaped curve with data complexity, where too-easy data hinders abstraction and very hard data enhances reasoning. Proposes the Structured Solution Template (SST) framework to teach procedural reasoning through (1) structured solution-template fine-tuning with dynamic loss, (2) prompt-time template scaffolds, and (3) curriculum fine-tuning to train self-plan–execute–self-correct. Empirically improves accuracy and efficiency on GSM8K, AIME24, and Dynamic En.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the gap in LLMs’ ability to perform deep, structured procedural reasoning beyond what post-training methods achieve, particularly for math and multi-step problems.

Method: First identify a Scaling Law by Difficulty showing a U-shaped performance vs. data difficulty. Then propose SST: (1) fine-tuning with structured solution-template chains and dynamically weighted loss to emphasize procedural logic, (2) prompt-time injection of solution templates as cognitive scaffolds, (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning that trains the model to self-plan - execute - self-correct.

Result: SST significantly improves both accuracy and efficiency, especially on harder problems, as demonstrated on GSM8K, AIME24, and the new Dynamic En benchmark.

Conclusion: Structured, template-guided procedural reasoning plus a difficulty-aware curriculum can boost LLMs’ capability for solving complex tasks; data strategy (balancing difficulty) and templated scaffolds are effective components for scaling procedural reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Structured, procedural reasoning is essential for Large Language Models
(LLMs), especially in mathematics. While post-training methods have improved
LLM performance, they still fall short in capturing deep procedural logic on
complex tasks. To tackle the issue, in this paper, we first investigate this
limitation and uncover a novel finding: a Scaling Law by Difficulty, which
reveals that model performance follows a U-shaped curve with respect to
training data complexity -- excessive low-difficulty data impedes abstraction,
while high-difficulty data significantly enhances reasoning ability. Motivated
by this, we propose the Structured Solution Template (SST) framework, which
uses solution templates and a curriculum of varied difficulty to explicitly
teach procedural reasoning. Specifically, SST comprises (1) fine-tuning with
structured solution-template chains and dynamically weighted loss to prioritize
procedural logic, (2) prompt-time injection of solution templates as cognitive
scaffolds to guide inference, and (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning that
explicitly teaches the model to self-plan - execute - self-correct. Experiments
on GSM8K, AIME24, and new Dynamic En benchmark show that SST significantly
improves both accuracy and efficiency, especially on harder problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucination risk in LLMs when extracting information from EHRs; traditional accuracy metrics don\'t capture reliability; need metrics and agents that can handle uncertainty.

Method: Define HCAcc@k% as accuracy at a given confidence threshold; develop TrustEHRAgent with stepwise confidence estimation for clinical QA; evaluate on MIMIC-III and eICU; compare to baselines; report improvements.

Result: Outperforms baselines under strict reliability constraints; improvements of 44.23 percentage points and 25.34 percentage points at HCAcc@70%; baselines fail at these thresholds.

Conclusion: Highlights limitations of traditional accuracy metrics for healthcare AI; establishes groundwork for trustworthy clinical agents that provide accurate info or transparently express uncertainty when confidence is low.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for extracting information from
Electronic Health Records (EHR) and supporting clinical decisions. However,
deployment in clinical settings faces challenges due to hallucination risks. We
propose Hallucination Controlled Accuracy at k% (HCAcc@k%), a novel metric
quantifying the accuracy-reliability trade-off at varying confidence
thresholds. We introduce TrustEHRAgent, a confidence-aware agent incorporating
stepwise confidence estimation for clinical question answering. Experiments on
MIMIC-III and eICU datasets show TrustEHRAgent outperforms baselines under
strict reliability constraints, achieving improvements of 44.23%p and 25.34%p
at HCAcc@70% while baseline methods fail at these thresholds. These results
highlight limitations of traditional accuracy metrics in evaluating healthcare
AI agents. Our work contributes to developing trustworthy clinical agents that
deliver accurate information or transparently express uncertainty when
confidence is low.

merely expanding functional capabilities, these reasoning mechanisms enhance
decision transparency and explainability-critical requirements in medical
contexts. This survey examines the transformation of medical LLMs from basic

The survey critically assesses current evaluation methodologies for medical
validation and addresses persistent challenges in field interpretation
limitations, bias mitigation strategies, patient safety frameworks, and
integration of multimodal clinical data. Through this survey, we seek to
establish a roadmap for developing reliable LLMs that can serve as effective

TL;DR: We propose HDS-QA to train large reasoning models to blend parallelizable and sequential queries, achieving faster, scalable reasoning with strong accuracy; HybridDeepSearcher attains notable F1 gains on FanOutQA and BrowseComp subset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Purely sequential querying for external knowledge retrieval in large reasoning models increases latency and harms coherence and accuracy; a hybrid approach enabling parallel and sequential querying could mitigate this.

Method: Create HDS-QA, a synthetic dataset derived from Natural Questions with hybrid-hop questions combining parallelizable subqueries and sequential subqueries, plus synthetic reasoning-querying-retrieval paths; fine-tune an LRM into HybridDeepSearcher to discriminate and leverage parallel versus sequential queries.

Result: HybridDeepSearcher outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on FanOutQA (+15.9 F1) and a BrowseComp subset (+11.5 F1); it achieves comparable accuracy with fewer search turns, reducing latency, and scales with more turns.

Conclusion: Explicitly training LRMs to exploit hybrid parallel and sequential querying is efficient, scalable, and effective for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Existing methods enhance LRMs by
sequentially integrating external knowledge retrieval; models iteratively
generate queries, retrieve external information, and progressively reason over
this information. However, purely sequential querying increases inference
latency and context length, diminishing coherence and potentially reducing
accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce HDS-QA (Hybrid Deep Search
QA), a synthetic dataset automatically generated from Natural Questions,
explicitly designed to train LRMs to distinguish parallelizable from sequential
queries. HDS-QA comprises hybrid-hop questions that combine parallelizable
independent subqueries (executable simultaneously) and sequentially dependent
subqueries (requiring step-by-step resolution), along with synthetic
reasoning-querying-retrieval paths involving parallel queries. We fine-tune an
LRM using HDS-QA, naming the model HybridDeepSearcher, which outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, notably achieving +15.9
and +11.5 F1 on FanOutQA and a subset of BrowseComp, respectively, both
requiring comprehensive and exhaustive search. Experimental results highlight
two key advantages: HybridDeepSearcher reaches comparable accuracy with fewer
search turns, significantly reducing inference latency, and it effectively
scales as more turns are permitted. These results demonstrate the efficiency,
scalability, and effectiveness of explicitly training LRMs to leverage hybrid
parallel and sequential querying.

### [153] [Algorithmic Collective Action with Multiple Collectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19149)
*Claudio Battiloro,Pietro Greiner,Bret Nestor,Oumaima Amezgar,Francesca Dominici*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Presents the first theoretical framework for Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA) with multiple collectives acting on the same system, analyzing how coordinated data changes bias a classifier and how collectives’ sizes and goal alignment interact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As learning systems influence daily decisions, there is a need for user-side steering via ACA as a complement to regulator- and firm-side design. Real-world actions are decentralized across many collectives, yet most ACA work studies a single collective; this work extends theory to multi-collective settings to understand interactions and biasing of classifiers.

Method: Develops a formal theoretical framework for ACA with several collectives that plant signals by altering features to bias a classifier toward a target class set. Analyzes the interplay of collectives’ sizes and goal alignment and provides quantitative results to characterize outcomes in multi-collective settings.

Result: Provides quantitative results on how collectives’ sizes and alignment shape the biasing outcome; complements and extends empirical ACA results, enabling a holistic treatment of ACA when multiple collectives act on the same system.

Conclusion: First theoretical framework for ACA with multiple collectives; opens pathways for further multi-collective analysis and synthesis of policy, design, and governance considerations in ACA.

Abstract: As learning systems increasingly influence everyday decisions, user-side
steering via Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA)-coordinated changes to shared
data-offers a complement to regulator-side policy and firm-side model design.
Although real-world actions have been traditionally decentralized and
fragmented into multiple collectives despite sharing overarching
objectives-with each collective differing in size, strategy, and actionable
goals, most of the ACA literature focused on single collective settings. In
this work, we present the first theoretical framework for ACA with multiple
collectives acting on the same system. In particular, we focus on collective
action in classification, studying how multiple collectives can plant signals,
i.e., bias a classifier to learn an association between an altered version of
the features and a chosen, possibly overlapping, set of target classes. We
provide quantitative results about the role and the interplay of collectives'
sizes and their alignment of goals. Our framework, by also complementing
previous empirical results, opens a path for a holistic treatment of ACA with
multiple collectives.

### [154] [Playstyle and Artificial Intelligence: An Initial Blueprint Through the Lens of Video Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19152)
*Chiu-Chou Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes 'playstyle' as a new lens to study and shape AI decision-making, introducing a two-tier framework (external interaction and internal deliberation), measurable indicators, and RL/IL methods to define, generate, and apply stylized agents, with implications for games, interactive systems, and AGI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rational, measurable AI decisions miss human-like influence of beliefs, values, and preferences; need to capture stylistic diversity as an essential intelligence dimension; extend AI capabilities toward human-like adaptability and AGI.

Method: Proposes a two-tier theory of style formation: an external interaction loop with the environment and an internal cognitive loop of deliberation. Formalizes style-related characteristics and indicators (style capacity, style popularity, evolutionary dynamics). Develops a general playstyle metric based on discretized state spaces and extends it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive balance. Explores expressing and generating playstyle by training agents with specific stylistic tendencies via reinforcement learning and imitation learning, including a human-like style learning/modeling approach. Discusses practical applications in game design and interactive entertainment.

Result: Frames a coherent theoretical framework and measurable metrics for playstyle, and outlines methods (RL/IL) to train agents exhibiting particular stylistic tendencies, along with potential applications. The abstract emphasizes conceptual contributions, with proposed indicators and a pathway to practical deployment, but does not report empirical results.

Conclusion: Positioning playstyle as a core element of intelligent agents, with potential to influence AI design toward human-like diversity and possibly serve as a foundational element in AGI; invites future work on extending metrics, validating approaches, and applying playstyle across domains.

Abstract: Contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) development largely centers on
rational decision-making, valued for its measurability and suitability for
objective evaluation. Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's
decisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as
beliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles
emerges from these differences, highlighting that "style" is an essential but
often overlooked dimension of intelligence.
  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing
and analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines
its foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical
perspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,
we construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction
loop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On
this basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable
indicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.
  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and
measuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized
state spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive
balance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement
learning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific
stylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style
learning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential
of these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive
entertainment.
  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of
style as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).

*Ernest Lim,Yajie Vera He,Jared Joselowitz,Kate Preston,Mohita Chowdhury,Louis Williams,Aisling Higham,Katrina Mason,Mariane Melo,Tom Lawton,Yan Jia,Ibrahim Habli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MATRIX provides a unified, scalable framework for safety-focused evaluation of clinical dialogue agents, combining a safety taxonomy, an LLM-based hazard evaluator (BehvJudge), and a simulated patient agent (PatBot); validated with expert-level hazard detection and realism analyses, enabling regulator-aligned safety auditing and open tooling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-critical clinical dialogue systems require more than task success or fluency. There is a gap in systematic safety evaluation, risk management, and scenario-conditioned patient behavior. MATRIX aims to fill this by offering structured, extensible evaluation with expert-validated components and real-world applicability for regulators.

Method: Three components: (1) a safety-aligned taxonomy of clinical scenarios, system behaviors, and failure modes; (2) BehvJudge, an LLM-based safety evaluator validated against clinician annotations; (3) PatBot, a simulated patient agent producing diverse, scenario-conditioned responses. Three experiments benchmark hazard detection (Gemini 2.5-Pro), realism of PatBot, and cross-agent safety evaluation across 2,100 dialogues, 14 hazard scenarios, 10 clinical domains. Outputs include tool prompts, structured scenarios, and datasets.

Result: BehvJudge achieves expert-level hazard detection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians in blinded assessments of 240 dialogues. PatBot demonstrates realistic patient behavior in quantitative and qualitative analyses. MATRIX benchmarks five LLMs across 2,100 dialogues, revealing safety performance across 14 hazards and 10 domains.

Conclusion: MATRIX is the first framework to unify structured safety engineering with scalable, validated conversational AI evaluation, enabling regulator-aligned safety auditing. The authors release all tools, prompts, scenarios, and datasets to support open, reproducible safety evaluation.

Abstract: Despite the growing use of large language models (LLMs) in clinical dialogue
systems, existing evaluations focus on task completion or fluency, offering
little insight into the behavioral and risk management requirements essential
for safety-critical systems. This paper presents MATRIX (Multi-Agent simulaTion
fRamework for safe Interactions and conteXtual clinical conversational
evaluation), a structured, extensible framework for safety-oriented evaluation
of clinical dialogue agents.
  MATRIX integrates three components: (1) a safety-aligned taxonomy of clinical
scenarios, expected system behaviors and failure modes derived through
structured safety engineering methods; (2) BehvJudge, an LLM-based evaluator
for detecting safety-relevant dialogue failures, validated against expert
clinician annotations; and (3) PatBot, a simulated patient agent capable of
producing diverse, scenario-conditioned responses, evaluated for realism and
behavioral fidelity with human factors expertise, and a patient-preference
study.
  Across three experiments, we show that MATRIX enables systematic, scalable
safety evaluation. BehvJudge with Gemini 2.5-Pro achieves expert-level hazard
detection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians in a blinded
assessment of 240 dialogues. We also conducted one of the first realism
analyses of LLM-based patient simulation, showing that PatBot reliably
simulates realistic patient behavior in quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Using MATRIX, we demonstrate its effectiveness in benchmarking
five LLM agents across 2,100 simulated dialogues spanning 14 hazard scenarios
and 10 clinical domains.
  MATRIX is the first framework to unify structured safety engineering with
scalable, validated conversational AI evaluation, enabling regulator-aligned
safety auditing. We release all evaluation tools, prompts, structured
scenarios, and datasets.

TL;DR: A Llull-inspired thinking machine for research ideation uses three axes—Theme, Domain, and Method—to prompt LLMs with curated combinations, yielding diverse, literature-grounded ideas and enabling human-AI collaborative creativity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Revisit Llull's Ars combinatoria to provide a conceptual foundation for augmenting scientific ideation with large language models, addressing the need for interpretable, compositional prompts that reflect motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches.

Method: Define three compositional axes (Theme, Domain, Method) and populate them with elements from experts or conference papers; mine these elements to create curated prompts; prompt LLMs with combinations; assess ideas for diversity, relevance, and grounding in current literature; present a lightweight, interpretable tool for ideation.

Result: Generation of research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current literature when prompted with curated combinations; demonstration of a lightweight, interpretable approach to augment scientific creativity; evidence for potential collaborative ideation between humans and AI.

Conclusion: Llull-inspired thinking machine provides a practical, interpretable framework to augment research ideation, enabling human-AI collaboration; future work could expand the axes, refine evaluation, and integrate into scientific workflows.

Abstract: This paper revisits Ramon Llull's Ars combinatoria - a medieval framework for
generating knowledge through symbolic recombination - as a conceptual
foundation for building a modern Llull's thinking machine for research
ideation. Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g.,
efficiency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine
translation), and Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These
elements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work -
motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building
blocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or
conference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations
produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current
literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight, interpretable
tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path toward
collaborative ideation between humans and AI.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces the Subset Sum Matching Problem (SSMP), a new combinatorial optimization task inspired by financial reconciliation; proposes three algorithms (two suboptimal, one optimal), creates a benchmark suite, and provides an experimental evaluation of performance across instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses practical reconciliation challenges in finance by formalizing SSMP as a combinatorial optimization problem and providing benchmarks to evaluate solution approaches.

Method: Define SSMP; develop two suboptimal algorithms and one optimal algorithm to solve it; generate a benchmark covering instances of varying complexity; conduct empirical experiments to compare approaches.

Result: Shows how the proposed algorithms perform on the benchmark across different instance difficulties; the optimal algorithm achieves exact solutions while suboptimal methods offer trade-offs between solution quality and computational effort; the benchmark enables assessment of method robustness across complexity levels.

Conclusion: SSMP is a relevant abstraction for reconciliation tasks; the work provides a concrete benchmark and a trio of solution approaches (including an optimal method), enabling future research and improvements in efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: This paper presents a new combinatorial optimisation task, the Subset Sum
Matching Problem (SSMP), which is an abstraction of common financial
applications such as trades reconciliation. We present three algorithms, two

to cover different instances of SSMP varying in complexity, and carry out an
experimental evaluation to assess the performance of the approaches.

### [158] [StepWiser: Stepwise Generative Judges for Wiser Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19229)
*Wei Xiong,Wenting Zhao,Weizhe Yuan,Olga Golovneva,Tong Zhang,Jason Weston,Sainbayar Sukhbaatar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes StepWiser, a generative judge for stepwise reasoning that outputs meta-reasons (thinking tokens) and a verdict, trained with reinforcement learning to evaluate intermediate steps, improving both training-time signals and inference-time search.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As models rely on multi-step reasoning, ensuring the logical validity of intermediate steps is challenging. Process reward models often act as classifiers without explanations and rely on static supervised data, harming generalization.

Method: Replace classification with a reasoning task; introduce a generative judge that produces meta-reasons about the policy's steps and a final verdict; train StepWiser via RL using the relative outcomes of rollouts.

Result: Achieves higher judgment accuracy on intermediate steps than prior methods; can be used to improve the policy during training; enhances inference-time search.

Conclusion: A reasoning-based reward model can provide explanations and stronger supervisory signals, leading to better alignment and performance in multi-step tasks.

Abstract: As models increasingly leverage multi-step reasoning strategies to solve
complex problems, supervising the logical validity of these intermediate steps
has become a critical research challenge. Process reward models address this by
providing step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major
drawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing
explanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets
limits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward
modeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose
a generative judge that reasons about the policy model's reasoning steps (i.e.,
meta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict.
Our model, StepWiser, is trained by reinforcement learning using relative
outcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on
intermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the
policy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MCP is proposed as a unifying framework for adaptive transport systems, with evidence of convergence toward MCP-like architectures, a five-category taxonomy, and a roadmap highlighting MCP as foundational for future intelligent, context-aware transport.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fragmentation in adaptive transport due to isolated protocols and context sources; need for standardized, interoperable integration to support AI-driven, context-aware transport.

Method: Systematic survey of existing literature to assess convergence toward MCP-like architectures; development of a five-category taxonomy: adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models, integration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures.

Result: Traditional transport protocols have reached limits of isolated adaptation; MCP’s client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables semantic interoperability; AI-driven transport requires integration paradigms well-suited to MCP; literature shows implicit convergence toward MCP-like architectures.

Conclusion: MCP can serve as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware, and intelligent transport infrastructures; a research roadmap is proposed outlining integration and deployment steps.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of interconnected devices, autonomous systems, and AI
applications has created severe fragmentation in adaptive transport systems,
where diverse protocols and context sources remain isolated. This survey
provides the first systematic investigation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
as a unifying paradigm, highlighting its ability to bridge protocol-level
adaptation with context-aware decision making. Analyzing established
literature, we show that existing efforts have implicitly converged toward
MCP-like architectures, signaling a natural evolution from fragmented solutions
to standardized integration frameworks. We propose a five-category taxonomy
covering adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models,
integration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures. Our findings reveal
three key insights: traditional transport protocols have reached the limits of
isolated adaptation, MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables
semantic interoperability, and AI-driven transport demands integration
paradigms uniquely suited to MCP. Finally, we present a research roadmap
positioning MCP as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware,
and intelligent transport infrastructures.

### [160] [Flipping odd matchings in geometric and combinatorial settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18457)
*Oswin Aichholzer,Sofia Brenner,Joseph Dorfer,Hung P. Hoang,Daniel Perz,Christian Rieck,Francesco Verciani*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: The paper studies flip-based reconfiguration of odd matchings in combinatorial and geometric settings, offering (i) a polynomial-time characterization of graphs where all odd matchings are mutually reconfigurable, (ii) a linear bound on flip-graph diameter when connected, (iii) NP-completeness of deciding flip-distance k in both settings, (iv) a framework to realize order types in general position with polynomial overhead, and (v) FPT results for convex geometric instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the algorithmic landscape of transforming near-perfect (odd) matchings via elementary flips, linking reconfiguration questions in graphs with geometric constraints and assessing computational complexity.

Method: Provide a complete characterization in the combinatorial setting; analyze flip-graph diameter; prove NP-completeness via reductions to k-flip distance in both settings; develop a framework to convert partial order types into general-position configurations; study parameterized complexity to establish FPT in the geometric convex case.

Result: In graphs, a complete polynomial-time checkable characterization of when any two odd matchings can be reconfigured into each other; in the geometric setting, the flip graph has connectedness property previously known; when connected, the flip-graph diameter is linear in the number of vertices; deciding existence of a flip sequence of length k is NP-complete in both settings; a framework to transform partial order types into general position with polynomial overhead; FPT result for k-flip distance in the geometric convex setting.

Conclusion: The authors map the reconfiguration landscape for odd matchings, giving tight complexity results, structure (characterization and diameter), and parameterized tractability in the geometric convex setting, while highlighting NP-hardness in general and bridging graph-theoretic and geometric perspectives.

Abstract: We study the problem of reconfiguring odd matchings, that is, matchings that
cover all but a single vertex. Our reconfiguration operation is a so-called
flip where the unmatched vertex of the first matching gets matched, while
consequently another vertex becomes unmatched. We consider two distinct
settings: the geometric setting, in which the vertices are points embedded in
the plane and all occurring odd matchings are crossing-free, and a
combinatorial setting, in which we consider odd matchings in general graphs.
  For the latter setting, we provide a complete polynomial time checkable
characterization of graphs in which any two odd matchings can be reconfigured
into each another. This complements the previously known result that the flip
graph is always connected in the geometric setting [Aichholzer, Br\"otzner,
Perz, and Schnider. Flips in odd matchings]. In the combinatorial setting, we
prove that the diameter of the flip graph, if connected, is linear in the
number of vertices. Furthermore, we establish that deciding whether there
exists a flip sequence of length $k$ transforming one given matching into
another is NP-complete in both the combinatorial and the geometric settings. To
prove the latter, we introduce a framework that allows us to transform partial
order types into general position with only polynomial overhead. Finally, we
demonstrate that when parameterized by the flip distance $k$, the problem is
fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) in the geometric setting when restricted to
convex point sets.

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Introduces a two-phase tangling/untangling framework to draw trees with a prescribed number of crossings on a fixed point set while keeping edge bending constant; yields efficient algorithms for general trees (O(n^2)) and paths (O(n log n)); extends to RAC drawings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge classical topological graph theory and graph drawing by solving the problem of drawing graphs with a prescribed number of crossings on a fixed point set, under a constant curve complexity. The focus on trees and the thrackle number theta(T) provides a parameterized avenue to control crossings and bending.

Method: Compute a topological linear embedding of a tree T with theta(T) crossings and a small number of spine traversals (tangling phase). Then iteratively remove edge crossings (untangling phase) without increasing spine traversals until achieving chi crossings. Use this two-phase embedding to produce a drawing on a fixed point set S with chi crossings and constant edge-bend complexity. The approach yields O(n^2) time for general trees and O(n log n) for paths, and can be adapted to RAC drawings.

Result: A constructive framework to obtain drawings of trees on a prescribed set of points with a prescribed number of crossings chi (0≤chi≤theta(T)) and bounded curve complexity. It provides algorithms with O(n^2) time for general trees and O(n log n) time for paths, plus an adaptation to RAC (right-angle crossing) drawings.

Conclusion: The tangling/untangling strategy ties the thrackle number to drawable crossings under a fixed point set and bounded bend complexity, delivering efficient algorithms and enabling RAC extensions. This bridges topological properties with practical graph drawing constraints.

Abstract: We study a question that lies at the intersection of classical research
subjects in Topological Graph Theory and Graph Drawing: Computing a drawing of
a graph with a prescribed number of crossings on a given set $S$ of points,
while ensuring that its curve complexity (i.e., maximum number of bends per
edge) is bounded by a constant. We focus on trees: Let $T$ be a tree,
$\vartheta(T)$ be its thrackle number, and $\chi$ be any integer in the
interval $[0,\vartheta(T)]$. In the tangling phase we compute a topological
linear embedding of $T$ with $\vartheta(T)$ edge crossings and a constant
number of spine traversals. In the untangling phase we remove edge crossings
without increasing the spine traversals until we reach $\chi$ crossings. The
computed linear embedding is used to construct a drawing of $T$ on $S$ with
$\chi$ crossings and constant curve complexity. Our approach gives rise to an
$O(n^2)$-time algorithm for general trees and an $O(n \log n)$-time algorithm
for paths. We also adapt the approach to compute RAC drawings, i.e. drawings
where the angles formed at edge crossings are $\frac{\pi}{2}$.

### [162] [Reasoning Steps as Curriculum: Using Depth of Thought as a Difficulty Signal for Tuning LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18279)
*Jeesu Jung,Sangkeun Jung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes depth of thought (DoT) as a scalable, interpretable difficulty signal for curriculum learning in LLMs, ordering training from shallow to deep based on reasoning steps; outlines derivation, validation, and evaluation framework with three testable hypotheses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current difficulty signals (e.g., length, human jury scores) are misaligned with reasoning and lack scalability/interpretablity. DoT grounds difficulty in human cognitive depth and enables scalable curricula.

Method: Define DoT as the number of discrete reasoning steps in a teacher's trace (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). Use DoT to construct shallow-to-deep curricula; propose methods to derive, validate, and schedule at scale; discuss threats and mitigations; provide evaluation framework.

Result: A proposal with three testable hypotheses: (i) DoT correlates with conventional reasoning difficulty; (ii) DoT-ordered curricula outperform length- or judge-scored curricula under matched budgets; (iii) DoT robustness across teacher models with light formatting controls; followed by an evaluation framework and discussion of threats.

Conclusion: Advances cognitively grounded, interpretable curricula for reasoning-centric training and invites empirical validation and scalability considerations.

Abstract: Curriculum learning for training LLMs requires a difficulty signal that
aligns with reasoning while remaining scalable and interpretable. We propose a
simple premise: tasks that demand deeper depth of thought for humans should
also be harder for models. Accordingly, we define difficulty as depth of
thought (DoT) and operationalize it by counting the discrete steps in a teacher
model's reasoning trace (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). We then train with a shallow
to deep curriculum ordered by this DoT and outline how to derive, validate, and
schedule it at scale. Our position yields three testable hypotheses: (i) DoT
correlates with conventional difficulty on reasoning benchmarks, (ii)
DoT-ordered curricula outperform length- or judge-scored curricula under
matched budgets, and (iii) the difficulty is robust across teacher models given
light formatting controls. We propose an evaluation framework and discuss
threats to validity (teacher style, length confounds) alongside practical
mitigations. Taken together, we aim to move toward cognitively grounded,
interpretable curricula for reasoning-centric training.

*Rahmat K. Adesunkanmi,Alexander W. Brandt,Masoud Deylami,Gustavo A. Giraldo Echeverri,Hamidreza Karbasian,Adel Alaeddini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-modal framework fuses textual embeddings with attention-based seq2seq models to predict leeway drift, estimating drag/lift from Navier–Stokes-inspired simulations; it rivals physics-based models and enables longer-horizon forecasts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate, timely drift predictions of leeway objects are essential for search-and-rescue in dynamic maritime environments. Existing approaches (physics-based or single-modality ML) struggle with generalization and longer-horizon forecasting. A multi-modal integration of environmental/physical data with textual/object descriptions promises improved adaptability and forecast horizon.

Method: Collect environmental and physical data for five leeway objects. Use Navier–Stokes-based simulations to train a CNN on geometrical images to estimate drag and lift coefficients, derive net forces, and generate time-series of forces, environmental velocities, and object features. Encode textual descriptions with a language model. Feed the combined multi-modal inputs into attention-based seq2seq LSTM and Transformer models to predict future drift trajectories. Evaluate at 1, 3, 5, and 10 seconds, compare against a fitted physics-based model and ML baselines (RNNs, TCNs).

Result: The multi-modal models achieve performance comparable to traditional models while enabling longer-term forecasts (beyond single-step prediction) and generalize across different objects, offering viable and adaptable drift predictions in dynamic conditions.

Conclusion: Demonstrates the viability of a multi-modal modeling strategy for accurate, adaptable leeway drift predictions in maritime environments, with potential for improved long-horizon forecasting. Future work could explore real-world data validation, robustness to environmental variability, and scalability.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the drift (displacement) of leeway objects in maritime
environments remains a critical challenge, particularly in time-sensitive
scenarios such as search and rescue operations. In this study, we propose a
multi-modal machine learning framework that integrates Sentence Transformer
embeddings with attention-based sequence-to-sequence architectures to predict
the drift of leeway objects in water. We begin by experimentally collecting
environmental and physical data, including water current and wind velocities,
object mass, and surface area, for five distinct leeway objects. Using
simulated data from a Navier-Stokes-based model to train a convolutional neural
network on geometrical image representations, we estimate drag and lift
coefficients of the leeway objects. These coefficients are then used to derive
the net forces responsible for driving the objects' motion. The resulting time
series, comprising physical forces, environmental velocities, and
object-specific features, combined with textual descriptions encoded via a
language model, are inputs to attention-based sequence-to-sequence
long-short-term memory and Transformer models, to predict future drift
trajectories. We evaluate the framework across multiple time horizons ($1$,
$3$, $5$, and $10$ seconds) and assess its generalization across different
objects. We compare our approach against a fitted physics-based model and
traditional machine learning methods, including recurrent neural networks and
temporal convolutional neural networks. Our results show that these multi-modal
models perform comparably to traditional models while also enabling longer-term
forecasting in place of single-step prediction. Overall, our findings
demonstrate the ability of a multi-modal modeling strategy to provide accurate
and adaptable predictions of leeway object drift in dynamic maritime
conditions.

*Mateus A. Fernandes,Michael M. Furlanetti,Eduardo Gildin,Marcio A. Sampaio*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Data-driven ML framework to forecast production using simple data (produced/injected volumes and well gauges) with concept-drift handling; demonstrated plan on UNISIM III synthetic data and Brazilian pre-salt cases; aims to support reservoir management and maximize oil recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Forecast production reliably and anticipate changes in rock-fluid systems; reduce dependence on geological models, fluid properties, and completion details; address concept drift due to changing reservoir conditions; provide timely decision-support to maximize recovery.

Method: Relevance analyses of production and injection variables; data conditioning; handle concept drift with windowing and periodic retraining; supervised learning approaches (regression and neural networks); initial validation on synthetic UNISIM III data and real Brazilian pre-salt cases; aim to design a reliable predictor that operates with limited inputs.

Result: No empirical results are reported in the abstract; the project aims to develop and validate a reliable data-driven predictor of reservoir dynamics, with plans to test on synthetic data and real plays to support management decisions.

Conclusion: If successful, the approach would yield a practical, rapid-response forecasting tool that reduces reliance on geological models and supports reservoir management actions to anticipate deleterious behaviors, optimize production/injection, and maximize oil recovery.

Abstract: Forecasting production reliably and anticipating changes in the behavior of
rock-fluid systems are the main challenges in petroleum reservoir engineering.
This project proposes to deal with this problem through a data-driven approach
and using machine learning methods. The objective is to develop a methodology
to forecast production parameters based on simple data as produced and injected
volumes and, eventually, gauges located in wells, without depending on
information from geological models, fluid properties or details of well
completions and flow systems. Initially, we performed relevance analyses of the
production and injection variables, as well as conditioning the data to suit
the problem. As reservoir conditions change over time, concept drift is a
priority concern and require special attention to those observation windows and
the periodicity of retraining, which are also objects of study. For the
production forecasts, we study supervised learning methods, such as those based
on regressions and Neural Networks, to define the most suitable for our
application in terms of performance and complexity. In a first step, we
evaluate the methodology using synthetic data generated from the UNISIM III
compositional simulation model. Next, we applied it to cases of real plays in
the Brazilian pre-salt. The expected result is the design of a reliable
predictor for reproducing reservoir dynamics, with rapid response, capability
of dealing with practical difficulties such as restrictions in wells and
processing units, and that can be used in actions to support reservoir
management, including the anticipation of deleterious behaviors, optimization
of production and injection parameters and the analysis of the effects of
probabilistic events, aiming to maximize oil recovery.

*Md Sabbir Ahmed,Nova Ahmed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fast, minimalistic app-usage-based depression detection using 7-day data; achieves ~82% detection on depressed class and ~77-78% precision with stable/ Boruta feature selection and stacking; SHAP reveals behavioral markers; study in Bangladesh with 100 students.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robust, pervasive systems require long data collection and may miss early detection. There is a need for rapid, low-resource methods that can identify depression with minimal data, especially in underdeveloped/developing regions.

Method: Data: past 7 days of app usage retrieved in ~0.31–1 s. Subjects: 100 students from Bangladesh. Models: multiple ML models with feature selection. Feature selection: stable FS and three main FS approaches, including Boruta (all-relevant). Classifier: LightGBM (LGBM). Validation: iterative validation with a parsimonious stacking model using ~5 features per iteration. Evaluation: metrics include accuracy, precision, F1, balanced accuracy, SHAP analysis to interpret features.

Result: Depressed identification accuracy: 82.4% (n=42). Precision 75%, F1 78.5%. Stacking model achieved max precision 77.4%, balanced accuracy 77.9%. SHAP analysis highlighted behavioral markers linked to depression.

Conclusion: The approach is fast and minimalistic, potentially useful for early depression detection in resource-limited settings. It can inform the development of less resource-intensive systems to understand students' mental health, with implications for deployment in underdeveloped regions.

Abstract: Background: Existing robust, pervasive device-based systems developed in
recent years to detect depression require data collected over a long period and
may not be effective in cases where early detection is crucial.
  Objective: Our main objective was to develop a minimalistic system to
identify depression using data retrieved in the fastest possible time.
  Methods: We developed a fast tool that retrieves the past 7 days' app usage
data in 1 second (mean 0.31, SD 1.10 seconds). A total of 100 students from
Bangladesh participated in our study, and our tool collected their app usage
data. To identify depressed and nondepressed students, we developed a diverse
set of ML models. We selected important features using the stable approach,
along with 3 main types of feature selection (FS) approaches.
  Results: Leveraging only the app usage data retrieved in 1 second, our light
gradient boosting machine model used the important features selected by the
stable FS approach and correctly identified 82.4% (n=42) of depressed students
(precision=75%, F1-score=78.5%). Moreover, after comprehensive exploration, we
presented a parsimonious stacking model where around 5 features selected by the
all-relevant FS approach Boruta were used in each iteration of validation and
showed a maximum precision of 77.4% (balanced accuracy=77.9%). A SHAP analysis
of our best models presented behavioral markers that were related to
depression.
  Conclusions: Due to our system's fast and minimalistic nature, it may make a
worthwhile contribution to identifying depression in underdeveloped and
developing regions. In addition, our detailed discussion about the implication
of our findings can facilitate the development of less resource-intensive
systems to better understand students who are depressed.

*Jueqi Wang,Zachary Jacokes,John Darrell Van Horn,Michael C. Schatz,Kevin A. Pelphrey,Archana Venkataraman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Explainable deep learning framework NeuroPathX that fuses MRI-derived brain structural variations with genetics-derived pathways via cross-attention. It uses sparsity and pathway-similarity losses to improve interpretability, validated on autism and Alzheimer's disease, outperforming baselines, with code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imaging-genetics aims to reveal how genetic variation interacts with brain structure in neurological disorders, but traditional methods rely on linear models or opaque black-box approaches. There is a need for interpretable models that can uncover meaningful brain–gene interactions across cohorts.

Method: NeuroPathX employs an early fusion strategy using cross-attention to model interactions between MRI-derived structural variations and pathway-based genetic features. It includes two attention-based regularizations: a sparsity loss to emphasize salient interactions and a pathway similarity loss to ensure consistent representations across the population. The model is evaluated on autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease datasets, with comparisons to baselines.

Result: NeuroPathX outperforms competing baselines and discovers biologically plausible associations related to the disorders, demonstrating improved interpretability and robustness.

Conclusion: The work presents an interpretable cross-modal fusion framework that links brain structure to genetic pathways and can advance understanding of complex brain disorders, with the code publicly available.

Abstract: While imaging-genetics holds great promise for unraveling the complex
interplay between brain structure and genetic variation in neurological
disorders, traditional methods are limited to simplistic linear models or to
black-box techniques that lack interpretability. In this paper, we present
NeuroPathX, an explainable deep learning framework that uses an early fusion
strategy powered by cross-attention mechanisms to capture meaningful
interactions between structural variations in the brain derived from MRI and
established biological pathways derived from genetics data. To enhance
interpretability and robustness, we introduce two loss functions over the
attention matrix - a sparsity loss that focuses on the most salient
interactions and a pathway similarity loss that enforces consistent
representations across the cohort. We validate NeuroPathX on both autism
spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate that
NeuroPathX outperforms competing baseline approaches and reveals biologically
plausible associations linked to the disorder. These findings underscore the
potential of NeuroPathX to advance our understanding of complex brain
disorders. Code is available at https://github.com/jueqiw/NeuroPathX .

*Wuxinlin Cheng,Yupeng Cao,Jinwen Wu,Koduvayur Subbalakshmi,Tian Han,Zhuo Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A model-agnostic, sample-level robustness framework SALMAN using Distance Mapping Distortion (DMD) to assess and rank input perturbation susceptibility of transformer-based NLP models without changing parameters, achieving better attack efficiency and robust training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robustness of transformer-based NLP models under input perturbations is a growing concern as models scale; existing methods diverge between small models and LLMs and often require labor-intensive, sample-specific adversarial designs. A unified, efficient, local robustness measure is needed.

Method: Propose SALMAN, a local robustness framework that does not modify model parameters or rely on complex perturbation heuristics. Introduces Distance Mapping Distortion (DMD), which compares input-to-output distance mappings to estimate a sample's susceptibility with near-linear computational complexity; ranks samples by perturbation susceptibility to guide robust evaluation and training.

Result: Demonstrates significant gains in attack efficiency and robust training, establishing SALMAN as a practical, model-agnostic tool that enhances reliability of transformer-based NLP systems without internal parameter changes or elaborate perturbation schemes.

Conclusion: SALMAN provides a practical, model-agnostic framework for assessing and improving the robustness of transformer-based NLP models at the sample level through the DMD measure, applicable across model scales from small models to large language models.

Abstract: Recent strides in pretrained transformer-based language models have propelled
state-of-the-art performance in numerous NLP tasks. Yet, as these models grow
in size and deployment, their robustness under input perturbations becomes an
increasingly urgent question. Existing robustness methods often diverge between
small-parameter and large-scale models (LLMs), and they typically rely on
labor-intensive, sample-specific adversarial designs. In this paper, we propose
a unified, local (sample-level) robustness framework (SALMAN) that evaluates
model stability without modifying internal parameters or resorting to complex
perturbation heuristics. Central to our approach is a novel Distance Mapping
Distortion (DMD) measure, which ranks each sample's susceptibility by comparing
input-to-output distance mappings in a near-linear complexity manner. By
demonstrating significant gains in attack efficiency and robust training, we
position our framework as a practical, model-agnostic tool for advancing the
reliability of transformer-based NLP systems.

establish representer theorems for time dependent OV-RKHS interpolation, derive
Sobolev type approximation bounds for smooth vector fields, and provide
spectral convergence guarantees for kernel Koopman operator approximations.

### [169] [CoPE: A Lightweight Complex Positional Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18308)
*Avinash Amballa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoPE uses complex-valued embeddings to encode both content (real) and position (imaginary) in transformers, with a phase-aware first layer; claims improved GLUE performance and lower compute versus RoPE, sinusoidal, and learned encodings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of standard positional encodings (e.g., long-term decay, inefficiency) and leverage a unified representation that captures content and position; enable compatibility with linear attention.

Method: Replace traditional positional encodings with complex-valued embeddings where real part encodes semantic content and imaginary part encodes positional information. Introduce phase-aware attention in the first transformer layer to capture position-dependent patterns, followed by standard attention layers. Claim no long-term decay and compatibility with linear attention. Evaluate on GLUE and compare to RoPE, sinusoidal, and learned positional encodings.

Result: Experimental evaluation on the GLUE benchmark suggests CoPE achieves superior performance with lower computational complexity compared to RoPE, sinusoidal, and learned positional encodings.

Conclusion: CoPE provides a lightweight, effective complex-valued positional encoding method that avoids decay, is compatible with linear attention, and improves GLUE results relative to existing encodings.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of position encoding in
transformer architectures. By incorporating positional information, this
approach provides essential guidance for modeling dependencies between elements
across different sequence positions. We introduce CoPE (a lightweight Complex
Positional Encoding), a novel architecture that leverages complex-valued
encoding to encode both content and positional information. Our approach
replaces traditional positional encodings with complex embeddings where the
real part captures semantic content and the imaginary part encodes positional
information. We introduce phase-aware attention in the first layer of the
transformer model to capture position-dependent patterns, followed by standard
attention layers for higher-levels. We show that CoPE doesn't exhibit long term
decay and is compatible with linear attention. Experimental evaluation on the
GLUE benchmark suggest that our approach achieves superior performance with
less computational complexity, compared to RoPE, Sinusoidal and Learned
positional encodings.

### [170] [What Matters in Data for DPO?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18312)
*Yu Pan,Zhongze Cai,Guanting Chen,Huaiyang Zhong,Chonghuan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DPO performance is driven mainly by the quality of chosen (top) responses; rejected responses matter less, while contrastiveness mainly helps by improving chosen samples. Online DPO largely reduces to supervised fine-tuning on chosen responses, and mixing on-policy data can be beneficial. Practical takeaway: curate high-quality chosen responses and thoughtful contrastive sampling for high-impact alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify which characteristics of preference data (chosen vs rejected responses, contrastiveness, on-policy vs off-policy samples) most influence DPO performance and to provide actionable guidance for dataset construction.

Method: Theoretical analysis of the optimal response distribution under DPO; analysis of contrastiveness; study of an online DPO setting; extensive empirical experiments across diverse tasks; investigation of mixing on-policy data.

Result: Quality of chosen responses dominates optimization of the DPO objective; rejected-response quality has relatively limited impact; contrastiveness helps primarily by improving chosen samples; online DPO effectively corresponds to supervised fine-tuning on chosen responses; findings hold across tasks; exploring mixing on-policy data provides practical insights.

Conclusion: Practical guidance for constructing high-impact preference datasets for LLM alignment: prioritize high-quality chosen responses, understand the limited role of rejected responses, leverage contrastive signals to boost chosen-sample quality, and consider online DPO as supervised fine-tuning on chosen data; also evaluate the benefit of mixing on-policy data.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective
approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences,
bypassing the need for a learned reward model. Despite its growing adoption, a
fundamental question remains open: what characteristics of preference data are
most critical for DPO performance? In this work, we provide a systematic study
of how preference data distribution influences DPO, from both theoretical and
empirical perspectives. We show that the quality of chosen responses plays a
dominant role in optimizing the DPO objective, while the quality of rejected
responses may have relatively limited impact. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes the optimal response distribution under DPO and reveals how
contrastiveness between responses helps primarily by improving the chosen
samples. We further study an online DPO setting and show it effectively reduces
to supervised fine-tuning on the chosen responses. Extensive experiments across
diverse tasks confirm our findings: improving the quality of chosen responses
consistently boosts performance regardless of the quality of the rejected
responses. We also investigate the benefit of mixing the on-policy data. Our
results interpret the mechanism behind some widely adopted strategies and offer
practical insights for constructing high-impact preference datasets for LLM
alignment.

### [171] [ProtoEHR: Hierarchical Prototype Learning for EHR-based Healthcare Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18313)
*Zi Cai,Yu Liu,Zhiyao Luo,Tingting Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoEHR is an interpretable hierarchical prototype-learning framework for EHR data that leverages three-level structure (codes, visits, patients) and a knowledge graph derived from LLMs to improve prediction across five clinically meaningful tasks, with interpretable insights at all levels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EHR data are rich but current predictive models often treat components in isolation, hurting performance and interpretability. A unified, multi-level, prototype-guided approach could improve accuracy and provide clinician-friendly explanations.

Method: Construct a medical knowledge graph using semantic relationships among medical codes derived from large language models. Develop a hierarchical representation learning framework that captures contextualized representations across codes, visits, and patients, augmented with prototype information within each level to encourage similarity-based generalization. Evaluate on two public EHR datasets for five tasks (mortality, readmission, length of stay, drug recommendation, phenotype prediction) and compare against baselines to assess accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

Result: ProtoEHR achieves accurate, robust, and interpretable predictions compared to baselines. It also provides interpretable insights at code, visit, and patient levels to aid healthcare prediction.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates that exploiting multi-level EHR structure with prototype-guided learning and a knowledge-graph–informed representation can enhance predictive performance while improving interpretability, potentially aiding clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Digital healthcare systems have enabled the collection of mass healthcare
data in electronic healthcare records (EHRs), allowing artificial intelligence
solutions for various healthcare prediction tasks. However, existing studies
often focus on isolated components of EHR data, limiting their predictive
performance and interpretability. To address this gap, we propose ProtoEHR, an
interpretable hierarchical prototype learning framework that fully exploits the
rich, multi-level structure of EHR data to enhance healthcare predictions. More
specifically, ProtoEHR models relationships within and across three
hierarchical levels of EHRs: medical codes, hospital visits, and patients. We
first leverage large language models to extract semantic relationships among
medical codes and construct a medical knowledge graph as the knowledge source.
Building on this, we design a hierarchical representation learning framework
that captures contextualized representations across three levels, while
incorporating prototype information within each level to capture intrinsic
similarities and improve generalization. To perform a comprehensive assessment,
we evaluate ProtoEHR in two public datasets on five clinically significant
tasks, including prediction of mortality, prediction of readmission, prediction
of length of stay, drug recommendation, and prediction of phenotype. The
results demonstrate the ability of ProtoEHR to make accurate, robust, and
interpretable predictions compared to baselines in the literature. Furthermore,
ProtoEHR offers interpretable insights on code, visit, and patient levels to
aid in healthcare prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated learning applied to predict at-risk students using early performance and engagement from OULAD; achieves ~85% ROC-AUC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High dropout rates in distance education; data privacy and institutional silos hinder traditional risk prediction; Federated Learning offers privacy-preserving cross-institutional modeling.

Method: Use early academic performance and digital engagement features from the OULAD dataset. Compare Logistic Regression vs. Deep Neural Network under a Federated Learning framework and explore data balancing. Evaluate predictive performance using ROC-AUC.

Result: Federated model achieves ~85% ROC-AUC in identifying at-risk students, demonstrating practical and scalable privacy-preserving early-warning capability.

Conclusion: Federated learning provides a feasible approach for universities to implement effective early-warning systems while protecting student privacy.

Abstract: High dropout and failure rates in distance education pose a significant
challenge for academic institutions, making the proactive identification of
at-risk students crucial for providing timely support. This study develops and
evaluates a machine learning model based on early academic performance and
digital engagement patterns from the large-scale OULAD dataset to predict
student risk at a UK university. To address the practical challenges of data
privacy and institutional silos that often hinder such initiatives, we
implement the model using a Federated Learning (FL) framework. We compare model
complexity (Logistic Regression vs. a Deep Neural Network) and data balancing.
The final federated model demonstrates strong predictive capability, achieving
an ROC AUC score of approximately 85% in identifying at-risk students. Our
findings show that this federated approach provides a practical and scalable
solution for institutions to build effective early-warning systems, enabling
proactive student support while inherently respecting data privacy.

*Yang Li,Hanjie Wang,Yuanzheng Li,Jiazheng Li,Zhaoyang Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A zero-trust federated learning framework (ZTFed-MAS2S) for wind power data imputation using a multi-head attention-based seq2seq model, combining verifiable differential privacy, non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, and a trust-aware, graph-based aggregation with compression to ensure robust privacy and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wind power data have frequent missing values from sensor faults and unstable transmissions. Federated learning aims to preserve privacy but is vulnerable to anomalous updates and privacy leakage, especially in open industrial settings that require zero-trust guarantees.

Method: Proposes ZTFed-MAS2S: a zero-trust FL framework integrating MAS2S (multi-head attention-based sequence-to-sequence imputation) with verifiable differential privacy, non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs, and a confidentiality/integrity verification mechanism. Adds dynamic trust-aware aggregation on similarity graphs and sparsity/quantization-based compression to reduce communication and enhance robustness.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world wind-farm datasets show that ZTFed-MAS2S achieves superior federated learning performance and missing data imputation compared with baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness as a secure and efficient solution for energy-sector applications.

Conclusion: ZTFed-MAS2S provides a practical, secure zero-trust FL framework for wind-power data imputation, combining strong privacy guarantees with robust aggregation and communication efficiency suitable for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Wind power data often suffers from missing values due to sensor faults and
unstable transmission at edge sites. While federated learning enables
privacy-preserving collaboration without sharing raw data, it remains
vulnerable to anomalous updates and privacy leakage during parameter exchange.
These challenges are amplified in open industrial environments, necessitating
zero-trust mechanisms where no participant is inherently trusted. To address
these challenges, this work proposes ZTFed-MAS2S, a zero-trust federated
learning framework that integrates a multi-head attention-based
sequence-to-sequence imputation model. ZTFed integrates verifiable differential
privacy with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and a confidentiality and
integrity verification mechanism to ensure verifiable privacy preservation and
secure model parameters transmission. A dynamic trust-aware aggregation
mechanism is employed, where trust is propagated over similarity graphs to
enhance robustness, and communication overhead is reduced via sparsity- and
quantization-based compression. MAS2S captures long-term dependencies in wind
power data for accurate imputation. Extensive experiments on real-world wind
farm datasets validate the superiority of ZTFed-MAS2S in both federated
learning performance and missing data imputation, demonstrating its
effectiveness as a secure and efficient solution for practical applications in
the energy sector.

### [174] [Linear cost mutual information estimation and independence test of similar performance as HSIC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18338)
*Jarek Duda,Jagoda Bracha,Adrian Przybysz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HCR is proposed as a linear-time, scalable alternative to HSIC for testing statistical dependence, enabling a joint distribution model via mixed moments and allowing mutual information to be approximated as a sum of squared mixed moments. It scales with sample size n linearly per feature and with dimension d as O(d^2) for pairwise dependencies and up to O(d^3) for triplewise dependencies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the quadratic/cubic computational burden of HSIC on large data samples while achieving higher sensitivity in dependence tests and providing an explicit joint distribution model.

Method: Introduce Hierarchical Correlation Reconstruction (HCR) that describes dependencies through features built from mixed moments (starting with correlation and homoscedasticity). It computes a linear-time dependence descriptor per feature and aggregates dependencies hierarchically. Mutual information can be approximated as a sum of squares of nontrivial mixed moments between two samples.

Result: Claims linear-time computation per feature (O(n)) and scalable dependence testing with a hierarchy of tests: O(d^2) for pairwise, O(d^3) for triplewise dependencies, etc. Provides a joint distribution model via the described features and a potential mutual information approximation.

Conclusion: HCR offers a scalable, potentially more sensitive alternative to HSIC that also yields an interpretable joint distribution model and a pathway to mutual information estimation, at the cost of nontrivial feature construction and hierarchical testing.

Abstract: Evaluation of statistical dependencies between two data samples is a basic
problem of data science/machine learning, and HSIC (Hilbert-Schmidt Information
Criterion)~\cite{HSIC} is considered the state-of-art method. However, for size
$n$ data sample it requires multiplication of $n\times n$ matrices, what
currently needs $\sim O(n^{2.37})$ computational complexity~\cite{mult}, making
it impractical for large data samples. We discuss HCR (Hierarchical Correlation
Reconstruction) as its linear cost practical alternative of even higher
dependence sensitivity in tests, and additionally providing actual joint
distribution model by description of dependencies through features being mixed
moments, starting with correlation and homoscedasticity, also allowing to
approximate mutual information as just sum of squares of such nontrivial mixed
moments between two data samples. Such single dependence describing feature is
calculated in $O(n)$ linear time. Their number to test varies with dimension
$d$ - requiring $O(d^2)$ for pairwise dependencies, $O(d^3)$ if wanting to also
consider more subtle triplewise, and so on.

### [175] [DualSparse-MoE: Coordinating Tensor/Neuron-Level Sparsity with Expert Partition and Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18376)
*Weilin Cai,Le Qin,Shwai He,Junwei Cui,Ang Li,Jiayi Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DualSparse-MoE introduces post-training partitioning to induce tensor- and neuron-level sparsity in pre-trained MoE modules, enabling dynamic tensor-level computation dropping plus static neuron-level reconstruction. Coupled with load-imbalance aware expert parallelism, it yields significant speedups with minimal accuracy loss (~0.08–0.28% at ~25% drop) across three MoE models, including a 1.41x speedup with ~0.5% accuracy degradation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE architectures scale model capacity and efficiency but suffer from massive compute and unpredictable activation patterns due to fine-grained expert routing. There is a need for efficient deployment without retraining, leveraging dual sparsity at both tensor and neuron levels to improve both accuracy and runtime efficiency.

Method: Post-training partitioning of MoE experts to induce tensor- and neuron-level sparsity without retraining; inference system DualSparse-MoE that combines dynamic tensor-level computation dropping with static neuron-level reconstruction to preserve mathematical consistency; load-imbalance aware expert parallelism to further improve throughput.

Result: Approximately 25% drop rate with only 0.08%–0.28% average accuracy loss across three MoE models; most degrees of computation dropping yield proportional speedups; with load-imbalance aware parallelism, 1.41x speedup with 0.5% average accuracy degradation.

Conclusion: DualSparse-MoE demonstrates that dual sparsity combined with an informed inference strategy can deliver substantial inference-time efficiency gains while maintaining near-baseline accuracy, and that near-linear speedups are achievable when accounting for load imbalance.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) has become a mainstream architecture for building
Large Language Models (LLMs) by reducing per-token computation while enabling
model scaling. It can be viewed as partitioning a large Feed-Forward Network
(FFN) at the tensor level into fine-grained sub-FFNs, or experts, and
activating only a sparse subset for each input. While this sparsity improves
efficiency, MoE still faces substantial challenges due to their massive
computational scale and unpredictable activation patterns.
  To enable efficient MoE deployment, we identify dual sparsity at the tensor
and neuron levels in pre-trained MoE modules as a key factor for both accuracy
and efficiency. Unlike prior work that increases tensor-level sparsity through
finer-grained expert design during pre-training, we introduce post-training
expert partitioning to induce such sparsity without retraining. This preserves
the mathematical consistency of model transformations and enhances both
efficiency and accuracy in subsequent fine-tuning and inference. Building upon
this, we propose DualSparse-MoE, an inference system that integrates dynamic
tensor-level computation dropping with static neuron-level reconstruction to
deliver significant efficiency gains with minimal accuracy loss.
  Experimental results show that enforcing an approximate 25% drop rate with
our approach reduces average accuracy by only 0.08%-0.28% across three
prevailing MoE models, while nearly all degrees of computation dropping
consistently yield proportional computational speedups. Furthermore,
incorporating load-imbalance awareness into expert parallelism achieves a 1.41x
MoE module speedup with just 0.5% average accuracy degradation.

connection to NNs and their rich theoretical results. Different tensor
decompositions have strong uniqueness guarantees, which allow for a direct
interpretation of their factors, and polynomial time algorithms have been
proposed to compute them. Through the connections between tensors and NNs, such
results supported many important advances in the theory of NNs. In this review,
we show how low-rank tensor methods--which have been a core tool in the signal
processing and machine learning communities--play a fundamental role in
theoretically explaining different aspects of the performance of deep NNs,
including their expressivity, algorithmic learnability and computational
hardness, generalization, and identifiability. Our goal is to give an
accessible overview of existing approaches (developed by different communities,
ranging from computer science to mathematics) in a coherent and unified way,
and to open a broader perspective on the use of low-rank tensor decompositions
for the theory of deep NNs.

### [177] [LLM-Driven Intrinsic Motivation for Sparse Reward Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18420)
*André Quadros,Cassio Silva,Ronnie Alves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Combines Variational State as Intrinsic Reward (VSIMR) with Large Language Model (LLM)–based intrinsic rewards to tackle sparse rewards in RL. Implemented with an A2C agent in MiniGrid DoorKey. Shows improved performance and sample efficiency versus using each method alone or a standard A2C, which struggles to learn.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-reward RL often fails to learn due to infrequent positive feedback. By combining complementary intrinsic rewards—state novelty (VSIMR) to promote exploration and LLM-derived guidance to steer exploitation—the approach aims to accelerate learning and performance.

Method: Integrate VSIMR (VAE-based novelty) with an LLM-derived intrinsic reward into an Actor-Critic (A2C) framework. Evaluate on the MiniGrid DoorKey environment, a standard benchmark with sparse rewards; compare against each intrinsic method alone and against a baseline A2C.

Result: The combined approach yields substantially higher performance and faster sampling efficiency than either VSIMR or LLM rewards alone or a standard A2C agent, which fails to learn in this setting.

Conclusion: VSIMR and LLM-based intrinsic rewards address different learning challenges—exploration versus goal-directed exploitation—and their combination provides complementary signals that enhance learning under extreme sparsity of rewards.

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of two intrinsic motivation strategies to
improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in environments
with extreme sparse rewards, where traditional learning struggles due to
infrequent positive feedback. We propose integrating Variational State as
Intrinsic Reward (VSIMR), which uses Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) to reward
state novelty, with an intrinsic reward approach derived from Large Language
Models (LLMs). The LLMs leverage their pre-trained knowledge to generate reward
signals based on environment and goal descriptions, guiding the agent. We
implemented this combined approach with an Actor-Critic (A2C) agent in the
MiniGrid DoorKey environment, a benchmark for sparse rewards. Our empirical
results show that this combined strategy significantly increases agent
performance and sampling efficiency compared to using each strategy
individually or a standard A2C agent, which failed to learn. Analysis of
learning curves indicates that the combination effectively complements
different aspects of the environment and task: VSIMR drives exploration of new
states, while the LLM-derived rewards facilitate progressive exploitation
towards goals.

### [178] [Enhancing Trust-Region Bayesian Optimization via Newton Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18423)
*Quanlin Chen,Yiyu Chen,Jing Huo,Tianyu Ding,Yang Gao,Yuetong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A high-dimensional Bayesian optimization method that integrates a global GP-based gradient/Hessian-derived local quadratic models within TuRBO, selecting points by a bound-constrained quadratic program, addressing GP gradient vanishing, with convergence analysis and empirical gains over existing high-D BO methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling Bayesian optimization to high dimensions is difficult. Local GP-based TuRBO offers heterogeneous modeling but can be sample-inefficient. There is a need to improve sampling efficiency while preserving local modeling.

Method: Use a global GP to derive gradients and Hessians, construct multiple local quadratic models in TuRBO regions, and select new samples by solving a bound-constrained quadratic program. Also address vanishing gradients of GPs in high-dimensional spaces. Provide convergence analysis.

Result: Empirical results show enhanced sampling efficiency and performance, with TuRBO improvements and outperformance of a wide range of high-dimensional BO methods on synthetic and real-world tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed approach improves high-dimensional BO by combining global GP derivatives with local quadratic models, yielding better sampling efficiency, convergence guarantees, and strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been widely applied to optimize expensive
black-box functions while retaining sample efficiency. However, scaling BO to
high-dimensional spaces remains challenging. Existing literature proposes
performing standard BO in multiple local trust regions (TuRBO) for
heterogeneous modeling of the objective function and avoiding over-exploration.
Despite its advantages, using local Gaussian Processes (GPs) reduces sampling
efficiency compared to a global GP. To enhance sampling efficiency while
preserving heterogeneous modeling, we propose to construct multiple local
quadratic models using gradients and Hessians from a global GP, and select new
sample points by solving the bound-constrained quadratic program. Additionally,
we address the issue of vanishing gradients of GPs in high-dimensional spaces.
We provide a convergence analysis and demonstrate through experimental results
that our method enhances the efficacy of TuRBO and outperforms a wide range of
high-dimensional BO techniques on synthetic functions and real-world
applications.

*Fu Teng,Miao Pan,Xuhong Zhang,Zhezhi He,Yiyao Yang,Xinyi Chai,Mengnan Qi,Liqiang Lu,Jianwei Yin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning framework (VeriRL) for Verilog code generation that uses a high-quality Verilog problem dataset, a Trace-back based rescore mechanism, and a sample-balanced weighting strategy to co-evolve policy and reward models, achieving state-of-the-art results on Verilog generation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HDL code generation is hindered by concurrency semantics, strict syntax, and complex simulation; RL signals are sparse/noisy. A high-quality dataset and robust feedback mechanisms are needed to improve generation quality and robustness.

Method: Construct Veribench-53K from 700K Verilog problems with structured prompts, complexity labels, and diverse testbenches. Introduce Trace-back based Rescore to leverage reasoning paths and iterative refinement for reliable feedback. Apply sample-balanced weighting to balance learning dynamics across reward-probability distributions. An iterative RL pipeline co-evolves policy and reward models, contrasted with CraftRTL and DeepSeek-like approaches.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on Verilog generation tasks with substantial gains in test pass rate, functional correctness, and compilation robustness.

Conclusion: RL-driven approaches are promising for structured code generation in hardware-centric domains; VeriRL provides a practical, publicly available framework for Verilog generation tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in code generation have shown remarkable success across
software domains, yet hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog
remain underexplored due to their concurrency semantics, syntactic rigidity,
and simulation complexity. In this work, we address these challenges by
introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored for Verilog code
generation. We first construct Veribench-53K, a high-quality dataset curated
from over 700K Verilog problems, enriched with structured prompts, complexity
labels, and diverse testbenches. To tackle the problem of sparse and noisy
reward signals, we propose a Trace-back based Rescore mechanism that leverages
reasoning paths and iterative refinement to enhance feedback reliability and
support reward model training. Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting
and overfitting during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a sample-balanced weighting
strategy that adaptively balances learning dynamics based on reward-probability
distributions. These innovations are integrated into an iterative RL pipeline
that co-evolves the policy and reward models. In contrast to recent work such
as CraftRTL, which relies on large-scale closed-source model distillation, and
DeepSeek-style approaches that struggle with sparse feedback, our method
demonstrates superior performance using a smaller but high-quality dataset
combined with RL optimization. Experiments on Verilog generation tasks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with substantial gains in test pass
rate, functional correctness, and compilation robustness. Our findings
highlight the potential of RL-driven approaches for structured code generation
in hardware-centric domains. VERIRL is publicly available at

*Bahareh Golchin,Banafsheh Rekabdar,Kunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reinforcement learning-based anomaly detection framework (DRTA) for time series that combines dynamic reward shaping, a variational autoencoder (VAE), and active learning to perform well in low-label settings, outperforming state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised methods on Yahoo A1/A2 benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses key challenges in time-series anomaly detection: limited labeled data, high false positives, and poor generalization to novel anomaly types. Seeks a scalable, efficient solution that can leverage agreements between reconstruction-based signals (VAE) and learning-based rewards within an active-learning loop.

Method: Proposes DRTA, a reinforcement learning framework with dynamic reward shaping that scales the influence of VAE-based reconstruction error and classification rewards. Integrates VAE for reconstruction-based signals and an active-learning component to label informative instances, enabling effective anomaly detection under low-label conditions.

Result: Empirical evaluation on Yahoo A1 and Yahoo A2 datasets shows DRTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches, achieving high precision and recall in low-label regimes.

Conclusion: DRTA is a scalable and efficient solution for real-world anomaly detection tasks, demonstrating that dynamic reward shaping combined with VAE signals and active learning can robustly detect anomalies in time series with limited labeled data.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time series data is important for applications in
finance, healthcare, sensor networks, and industrial monitoring. Traditional
methods usually struggle with limited labeled data, high false-positive rates,
and difficulty generalizing to novel anomaly types. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that integrates
dynamic reward shaping, Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and active learning,
called DRTA. Our method uses an adaptive reward mechanism that balances
exploration and exploitation by dynamically scaling the effect of VAE-based
reconstruction error and classification rewards. This approach enables the
agent to detect anomalies effectively in low-label systems while maintaining
high precision and recall. Our experimental results on the Yahoo A1 and Yahoo
A2 benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches. These
findings show that our framework is a scalable and efficient solution for
real-world anomaly detection tasks.

### [181] [Data Augmentation Improves Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18502)
*Andreza M. C. Falcao,Filipe R. Cordeiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Augmentation design significantly boosts machine unlearning (MU) effectiveness. Using TrivialAug can reduce the Average Gap to retrained models by up to 40.12%, highlighting augmentation as a key factor for privacy-preserving and efficient unlearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a suggested link between memorization and augmentation, but MU research has not systematically explored augmentation design. Understanding how augmentation strategies influence MU can lead to better privacy-preserving models and reduced forgetting cost.

Method: The paper evaluates several augmentation strategies within MU methods (SalUn, Random Label, Fine-Tuning) on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 across varying forget rates. It measures unlearning performance against retrained models using the Average Gap Unlearning Metric.

Result: Proper augmentation design significantly improves unlearning effectiveness, narrowing the performance gap to retrained models. Specifically, TrivialAug reduced the Average Gap metric by up to 40.12%.

Conclusion: Augmentation plays a crucial role in reducing memorization and enabling privacy-preserving and efficient unlearning. Systematic augmentation design can be a practical tool to enhance MU performance.

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a
trained model while preserving its performance on the remaining data. Although
a few works suggest connections between memorisation and augmentation, the role
of systematic augmentation design in MU remains under-investigated. In this
work, we investigate the impact of different data augmentation strategies on
the performance of unlearning methods, including SalUn, Random Label, and
Fine-Tuning. Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, under varying
forget rates, show that proper augmentation design can significantly improve
unlearning effectiveness, reducing the performance gap to retrained models.
Results showed a reduction of up to 40.12% of the Average Gap unlearning
Metric, when using TrivialAug augmentation. Our results suggest that
augmentation not only helps reduce memorization but also plays a crucial role
in achieving privacy-preserving and efficient unlearning.

### [182] [Breaking Through Barren Plateaus: Reinforcement Learning Initializations for Deep Variational Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18514)
*Yifeng Peng,Xinyi Li,Zhemin Zhang,Samuel Yen-Chi Chen,Zhiding Liang,Ying Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reinforcement-learning-based initialization substantially mitigates barren plateaus in variational quantum algorithms, improving convergence speed and final accuracy; multiple RL methods (e.g., DPG, SAC, PPO) yield comparable gains, indicating robustness and flexibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Barren plateaus hamper gradient-based optimization in VQAs as system size or circuit depth grows. There is a need to initialize parameters in regions with informative gradients. The work investigates whether RL can pre-train initial circuit parameters to ease subsequent optimization.

Method: Treat circuit parameters as actions and use RL agents (Deterministic Policy Gradient, Soft Actor-Critic, and Proximal Policy Optimization, etc.) to generate an initial parameter set that minimizes the VQA cost before standard gradient-based optimization. Pre-train agents to shape the landscape, then perform conventional optimization (e.g., gradient descent/Adam). Evaluate under various noise conditions and tasks.

Result: RL-based initialization consistently improves convergence speed and final solution quality across tasks and noise settings. Different RL algorithms provide comparable benefits, illustrating robustness and flexibility of the approach.

Conclusion: RL-driven parameter initialization is a promising, flexible strategy to address barren plateaus in VQAs, aiding scalability and practical deployment of quantum algorithms, and motivating further ML-for-quantum research in this area.

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have gained prominence as a viable
framework for exploiting near-term quantum devices in applications ranging from
optimization and chemistry simulation to machine learning. However, the
effectiveness of VQAs is often constrained by the so-called barren plateau
problem, wherein gradients diminish exponentially as system size or circuit
depth increases, thereby hindering training. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based initialization strategy to alleviate the
barren plateau issue by reshaping the initial parameter landscape to avoid
regions prone to vanishing gradients. In particular, we explore several RL
algorithms (Deterministic Policy Gradient, Soft Actor-Critic, and Proximal
Policy Optimization, etc.) to generate the circuit parameters (treated as
actions) that minimize the VQAs cost function before standard gradient-based
optimization. By pre-training with RL in this manner, subsequent optimization
using methods such as gradient descent or Adam proceeds from a more favorable
initial state. Extensive numerical experiments under various noise conditions
and tasks consistently demonstrate that the RL-based initialization method
significantly enhances both convergence speed and final solution quality.
Moreover, comparisons among different RL algorithms highlight that multiple
approaches can achieve comparable performance gains, underscoring the
flexibility and robustness of our method. These findings shed light on a
promising avenue for integrating machine learning techniques into quantum
algorithm design, offering insights into how RL-driven parameter initialization
can accelerate the scalability and practical deployment of VQAs. Opening up a
promising path for the research community in machine learning for quantum,
especially barren plateau problems in VQAs.

### [183] [Quantifying The Limits of AI Reasoning: Systematic Neural Network Representations of Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18526)
*Anastasis Kratsios,Dennis Zvigelsky,Bradd Hart*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A universal meta-algorithm converts any circuit into an equivalent ReLU neural network, enabling exact emulation of complex reasoning tasks and showing neural nets’ capacity matches circuit-based computation. The work formalizes the run-time vs space trade-off and demonstrates the NN's power beyond simple universal approximation, with concrete applications such as shortest-path, stopped TMs, and randomized circuits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To answer what forms of reasoning neural networks can perform when perfectly trained by framing reasoning tasks as circuit emulation across diverse gate types, thereby clarifying the true computational power and limits of neural nets.

Method: Introduce a meta-algorithm that iteratively replaces each circuit gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator, producing a feedforward NN that exactly emulates the circuit without approximation. The network’s size and graph reflect the original circuit’s complexity.

Result: The construction yields exact emulation on digital hardware; neuron count scales with circuit complexity and the graph mirrors the circuit. Applications include cubic-size NN emulations for shortest-path, quadratically-large NN emulations for stopped Turing machines, and emulation of randomized Boolean circuits. The approach is strictly stronger than the universal approximation theorem, since any universal function can be encoded as a circuit and then emulated by a NN.

Conclusion: Neural networks can, in principle, emulate any circuit-based reasoning task, trading algorithmic run-time for space (neuron count). This framework formalizes the power of neural nets to perform complex reasoning and suggests a hierarchy of reasoning capabilities achievable via circuit-based emulation and hybrids for deeper logic.

Abstract: A main open question in contemporary AI research is quantifying the forms of
reasoning neural networks can perform when perfectly trained. This paper
answers this by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation, where the
gates define the type of reasoning; e.g. Boolean gates for predicate logic,
tropical circuits for dynamic programming, arithmetic and analytic gates for
symbolic mathematical representation, and hybrids thereof for deeper reasoning;
e.g. higher-order logic.
  We present a systematic meta-algorithm that converts essentially any circuit
into a feedforward neural network (NN) with ReLU activations by iteratively
replacing each gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator. We show that, on any
digital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no
approximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no
reasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons
in the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's
complexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of
the emulated circuit. This formalizes the folklore that NNs networks trade
algorithmic run-time (circuit runtime) for space complexity (number of
neurons).
  We derive a range of applications of our main result, from emulating
shortest-path algorithms on graphs with cubic--size NNs, to simulating stopped
Turing machines with roughly quadratically--large NNs, and even the emulation
of randomized Boolean circuits. Lastly, we demonstrate that our result is
strictly more powerful than a classical universal approximation theorem: any
universal function approximator can be encoded as a circuit and directly
emulated by a NN.

### [184] [BTW: A Non-Parametric Variance Stabilization Framework for Multimodal Model Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18551)
*Jun Hou,Le Wang,Xuan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BTW introduces a parameter-free bi-level weighting scheme for multimodal MoE that uses per-example KL divergence and modality-level mutual information to dynamically weight modalities, improving performance without extra parameters for any number of modalities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE can exploit modular specialization across modalities, but extra modalities often add noise and existing methods like Partial Information Decomposition don't scale beyond two modalities or support instance-level control; there's a need for scalable, parameter-free, instance-aware weighting across many modalities.

Method: Propose Beyond Two-modality Weighting (BTW), a bi-level, non-parametric weighting framework: (1) per-example KL weights comparing unimodal predictions with the current multimodal prediction; (2) modality-wide MI weights estimating global alignment between unimodal and multimodal outputs. No new parameters; applicable to arbitrary modality counts.

Result: Empirical evaluations on sentiment regression and clinical classification show that BTW significantly improves regression performance and multiclass classification accuracy.

Conclusion: BTW provides effective, scalable, instance-aware modality weighting for multimodal MoE without extra parameters, enhancing performance as the number of modalities grows.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become increasingly powerful in
multimodal learning by enabling modular specialization across modalities.
However, their effectiveness remains unclear when additional modalities
introduce more noise than complementary information. Existing approaches, such
as the Partial Information Decomposition, struggle to scale beyond two
modalities and lack the resolution needed for instance-level control. We
propose Beyond Two-modality Weighting (BTW), a bi-level, non-parametric
weighting framework that combines instance-level Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence and modality-level mutual information (MI) to dynamically adjust
modality importance during training. Our method does not require additional
parameters and can be applied to an arbitrary number of modalities.
Specifically, BTW computes per-example KL weights by measuring the divergence
between each unimodal and the current multimodal prediction, and modality-wide
MI weights by estimating global alignment between unimodal and multimodal
outputs. Extensive experiments on sentiment regression and clinical
classification demonstrate that our method significantly improves regression
performance and multiclass classification accuracy.

### [185] [Enhancing Chemical Explainability Through Counterfactual Masking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18561)
*Łukasz Janisiów,Marek Kochańczyk,Bartosz Zieliński,Tomasz Danel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Counterfactual masking uses chemically plausible, generatively sampled fragments to replace masked substructures, producing distribution-consistent explanations and actionable insights for molecular property prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explainable AI for molecules often relies on masking that creates implausible baselines by zeroing out atoms/substructures; this yields unintuitive explanations and poor alignment with real chemical distributions.

Method: Mask substructures and replace them with fragments sampled from generative models trained to complete molecular graphs, generating counterfactual molecules from the data distribution; evaluate explanations by comparing predictions to these realistic counterfactuals across datasets.

Result: Provides more realistic, distribution-consistent explanations; improves interpretability and usefulness of explanations; useful for benchmarking explainers and guiding molecular design across multiple tasks and datasets.

Conclusion: Counterfactual masking offers a principled, generative approach that bridges explainability and molecular design, enabling robust, chemistry-faithful counterfactual explanations in ML models for molecular property prediction.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a crucial task that guides the design of new
compounds, including drugs and materials. While explainable artificial
intelligence methods aim to scrutinize model predictions by identifying
influential molecular substructures, many existing approaches rely on masking
strategies that remove either atoms or atom-level features to assess importance
via fidelity metrics. These methods, however, often fail to adhere to the
underlying molecular distribution and thus yield unintuitive explanations. In
this work, we propose counterfactual masking, a novel framework that replaces
masked substructures with chemically reasonable fragments sampled from
generative models trained to complete molecular graphs. Rather than evaluating
masked predictions against implausible zeroed-out baselines, we assess them
relative to counterfactual molecules drawn from the data distribution. Our
method offers two key benefits: (1) molecular realism underpinning robust and
distribution-consistent explanations, and (2) meaningful counterfactuals that
directly indicate how structural modifications may affect predicted properties.
We demonstrate that counterfactual masking is well-suited for benchmarking
model explainers and yields more actionable insights across multiple datasets
and property prediction tasks. Our approach bridges the gap between
explainability and molecular design, offering a principled and generative path
toward explainable machine learning in chemistry.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends graphon-signal GNN theory to more practical settings: multi-dimensional graphon-signals, readout Lipschitz under cut distance, robustness-based generalization bounds, and non-symmetric graphons/kernels; yields broader generalization guarantees and applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill gaps in Levie's framework by addressing practical graph ML settings: signals with more than one dimension, readout Lipschitz with cut distance, stronger generalization guarantees via robustness, and support for non-symmetric graphons/kernels.

Method: Theoretically extend the graphon-signal framework: (i) allow multi-dimensional graphon-signals, (ii) prove Lipschitz continuity of MPNNs with readout under the cut distance, (iii) apply robustness-based generalization bounds to obtain tighter generalization guarantees, (iv) extend analysis to non-symmetric graphons and kernels; derive generalized bounds and a sampling lemma under these conditions.

Result: New generalized bounds and a sampling lemma established for MPNNs under the extended setting: multidimensional signals, readout with cut distance, robustness-based generalization, and non-symmetric graphons/kernels.

Conclusion: The work broadens the theoretical applicability of graphon-signal analysis for MPNNs, delivering broader guarantees and extending the framework to more realistic graph ML scenarios.

Abstract: A recent paper, ``A Graphon-Signal Analysis of Graph Neural Networks'', by
Levie, analyzed message passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) by embedding the
input space of MPNNs, i.e., attributed graphs (graph-signals), to a space of
attributed graphons (graphon-signals). Based on extensions of standard results
in graphon analysis to graphon-signals, the paper proved a generalization bound
and a sampling lemma for MPNNs. However, there are some missing ingredients in
that paper, limiting its applicability in practical settings of graph machine
learning. In the current paper, we introduce several refinements and extensions
to existing results that address these shortcomings. In detail, 1) we extend
the main results in the paper to graphon-signals with multidimensional signals
(rather than 1D signals), 2) we extend the Lipschitz continuity to MPNNs with
readout with respect to cut distance (rather than MPNNs without readout with
respect to cut metric), 3) we improve the generalization bound by utilizing
robustness-type generalization bounds, and 4) we extend the analysis to
non-symmetric graphons and kernels.

*Hao Zhou,Sibo Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Stochastic PushForward (SPF) enables multi-step learning while preserving one-step training, using a stochastic acquisition strategy and a supplementary dataset from model predictions to balance short- and long-term accuracy with lower memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-driven forecasting often suffers from error accumulation in long horizons, and autoregressive training demands large memory and can hurt short-term performance. There is a need for memory-efficient methods that maintain or improve long-term accuracy.

Method: SPF constructs a supplementary dataset from model predictions and blends it with ground truth via a stochastic acquisition strategy. It maintains one-step-ahead training but precomputes multi-step predictions between epochs to enable multi-step learning without storing long unrolled sequences, keeping memory usage stable.

Result: SPF achieves higher long-term accuracy than autoregressive methods on Burgers' equation and Shallow Water benchmarks, while reducing memory requirements, making it suitable for resource-limited and complex simulations.

Conclusion: SPF is a promising framework for data-driven forecasting, offering improved long-horizon accuracy with reduced memory usage by balancing short- and long-term learning through stochastic acquisition and prediction precomputation.

Abstract: Data-driven methods are emerging as efficient alternatives to traditional
numerical forecasting, offering fast inference and lower computational cost.
Yet, for complex systems, long-term accuracy often deteriorates due to error
accumulation, and autoregressive training (though effective) demands large GPU
memory and may sacrifice short-term performance. We propose the Stochastic
PushForward (SPF) framework, which retains one-step-ahead training while
enabling multi-step learning. SPF builds a supplementary dataset from model
predictions and combines it with ground truth via a stochastic acquisition
strategy, balancing short- and long-term performance while reducing
overfitting. Multi-step predictions are precomputed between epochs, keeping
memory usage stable without storing full unrolled sequences. Experiments on the
Burgers' equation and the Shallow Water benchmark show that SPF achieves higher
long-term accuracy than autoregressive methods while lowering memory
requirements, making it promising for resource-limited and complex simulations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAEs on fine-tuned ESM2 embeddings deliver strong low-N protein function prediction and design, outperforming ESM2 baselines with as few as 24 sequences; predictive latent steering yields top variants in 83% of cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address data-scarce regime in sequence-function prediction and design; evaluate whether sparse latent representations from SAEs can extract compact, biologically meaningful factors from pLM embeddings to generalize with limited labeled data.

Method: Train sparse autoencoders on fine-tuned ESM2 embeddings across diverse fitness extrapolation and protein engineering tasks; compare to ESM2 baselines; use steering of latent variables to exploit biological motifs; evaluate top-fitness variant yield.

Result: SAEs with as few as 24 sequences consistently outperform or compete with ESM2 baselines in fitness prediction; latent space encodes compact, biologically meaningful representations that generalize with limited data; steering predictive latents yields top-fitness variants in 83% of cases.

Conclusion: SAEs on pLM embeddings are effective for low-N protein function prediction and design, enabling generalizable latent representations and motif exploitation to improve design outcomes.

Abstract: Predicting protein function from amino acid sequence remains a central
challenge in data-scarce (low-$N$) regimes, limiting machine learning-guided
protein design when only small amounts of assay-labeled sequence-function data
are available. Protein language models (pLMs) have advanced the field by
providing evolutionary-informed embeddings and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have
enabled decomposition of these embeddings into interpretable latent variables
that capture structural and functional features. However, the effectiveness of
SAEs for low-$N$ function prediction and protein design has not been
systematically studied. Herein, we evaluate SAEs trained on fine-tuned ESM2
embeddings across diverse fitness extrapolation and protein engineering tasks.
We show that SAEs, with as few as 24 sequences, consistently outperform or
compete with their ESM2 baselines in fitness prediction, indicating that their
sparse latent space encodes compact and biologically meaningful representations
that generalize more effectively from limited data. Moreover, steering
predictive latents exploits biological motifs in pLM representations, yielding
top-fitness variants in 83% of cases compared to designing with ESM2 alone.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interpretability is a key bottleneck in AI-driven drug discovery; early and accurate prediction of approval outcomes can optimize research investments.

Method: Fine-tuning a LLaMA-based model with group relative policy optimization (GRPO); integrates molecular descriptors and compares against structurally similar approved and unapproved compounds; outputs predictions with step-by-step rationales and confidence scores.

Conclusion: Reasoning-augmented LLMs can provide competitive predictive accuracy while enhancing transparency, offering a robust, interpretable tool for pharmaceutical decision-making.

Abstract: Drug discovery is a complex and resource-intensive process, making early
prediction of approval outcomes critical for optimizing research investments.
While classical machine learning and deep learning methods have shown promise
in drug approval prediction, their limited interpretability constraints their

DrugReasoner integrates molecular descriptors with comparative reasoning
against structurally similar approved and unapproved compounds, generating
predictions alongside step-by-step rationales and confidence scores.
DrugReasoner achieved robust performance with an AUC of 0.732 and an F1 score
of 0.729 on the validation set and 0.725 and 0.718 on the test set,
respectively. These results outperformed conventional baselines, including
logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors and had
competitive performance relative to XGBoost. On an external independent

ChemAP model, achieving an AUC of 0.728 and an F1-score of 0.774, while
maintaining high precision and balanced sensitivity, demonstrating robustness
in real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate that DrugReasoner not only
delivers competitive predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency through
its reasoning outputs, thereby addressing a key bottleneck in AI-assisted drug
discovery. This study highlights the potential of reasoning-augmented LLMs as
interpretable and effective tools for pharmaceutical decision-making.

### [190] [History Rhymes: Accelerating LLM Reinforcement Learning with RhymeRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18588)
*Jingkai He,Tianjian Li,Erhu Feng,Dong Du,Qian Liu,Tao Liu,Yubin Xia,Haibo Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RhymeRL speeds up LLM RL training by exploiting rollout token similarity with speculative decoding (HistoSpec) and workload-aware distribution (HistoPipe), achieving 2.6x speedup without accuracy loss across scalable GPU deployments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reinforcement learning for large language models can improve reasoning but currently wastes GPU resources due to rollout-dominated training and imbalanced rollout lengths within batches. Existing mitigations (asynchronous execution, truncation) may sacrifice accuracy and do not fully resolve utilization issues; a method that preserves RL paradigm while boosting efficiency is needed.

Method: Proposes two innovations: HistoSpec, a speculative decoding engine that leverages historical rollout token-sequence similarity to draft accurate rollouts; HistoPipe, a two-tier scheduling approach that uses historical rollout distribution similarity to balance workload among rollout workers. Evaluated in real production environments, with scalability from dozens to thousands of GPUs.

Result: Demonstrates 2.6x performance improvement over existing methods without compromising accuracy or changing the RL paradigm.

Conclusion: RhymeRL effectively accelerates RL training for LLMs by combining speculative decoding and distribution-aware scheduling, enabling scalable RL workloads on large GPU clusters without sacrificing RL results.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional pre-training approaches, RL
encompasses multiple stages: rollout, reward, and training, which necessitates
collaboration among various worker types. However, current RL systems continue
to grapple with substantial GPU underutilization, due to two primary factors:
(1) The rollout stage dominates the overall RL process due to test-time
scaling; (2) Imbalances in rollout lengths (within the same batch) result in
GPU bubbles. While prior solutions like asynchronous execution and truncation
offer partial relief, they may compromise training accuracy for efficiency.
  Our key insight stems from a previously overlooked observation: rollout
responses exhibit remarkable similarity across adjacent training epochs. Based
on the insight, we introduce RhymeRL, an LLM RL system designed to accelerate
RL training with two key innovations. First, to enhance rollout generation, we
present HistoSpec, a speculative decoding inference engine that utilizes the
similarity of historical rollout token sequences to obtain accurate drafts.
Second, to tackle rollout bubbles, we introduce HistoPipe, a two-tier
scheduling strategy that leverages the similarity of historical rollout
distributions to balance workload among rollout workers. We have evaluated
RhymeRL within a real production environment, demonstrating scalability from
dozens to thousands of GPUs. Experimental results demonstrate that RhymeRL
achieves a 2.6x performance improvement over existing methods, without
compromising accuracy or modifying the RL paradigm.

*Zhao-Rong Lai,Haisheng Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a sparse-spectrum, linear trading position optimized by a Krasnosel'ski-Mann fixed-point method, achieving better diversification across the prediction matrix with proven descent and linear convergence; validated empirically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Principal portfolios can be insufficiently diversified and not robust to varying market conditions; there is a need to explore a broader spectral region of the prediction matrix.

Method: Introduce a linear trading position with a sparse spectrum and optimize it using a Krasnosel'ski-Mann fixed-point algorithm, which has the descent property and a linear convergence rate; this also presents a new theoretical result for this class of algorithms.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate good and robust performance of the proposed method across diverse situations.

Conclusion: The proposed sparse-spectrum trading position with KM fixed-point optimization improves diversification and robustness, with provable linear convergence; supported by empirical validation.

Abstract: The principal portfolio approach is an emerging method in signal-based
trading. However, these principal portfolios may not be diversified to explore
the key features of the prediction matrix or robust to different situations. To
address this problem, we propose a novel linear trading position with sparse
spectrum that can explore a larger spectral region of the prediction matrix. We
also develop a Krasnosel'ski\u \i-Mann fixed-point algorithm to optimize this
trading position, which possesses the descent property and achieves a linear
convergence rate in the objective value. This is a new theoretical result for
this type of algorithms. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method
achieves good and robust performance in various situations.

*Weide Liu,Xiaoyang Zhong,Lu Wang,Jingwen Hou,Yuemei Luo,Jiebin Yan,Yuming Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-scale mixed-input time-series model with uncertainty-aware training via evidential learning and Dirichlet priors achieves improved unsupervised domain adaptation, yielding better target-domain performance and calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time-series domain shifts degrade performance; uncertainty estimation can guide adaptation and improve calibration.

Method: Develop a multi-scale mixed-input architecture to capture features at multiple temporal scales; introduce an uncertainty awareness mechanism using evidential learning with a Dirichlet prior to facilitate both target predictions and uncertainty estimation; align features across domains by label-consistent feature alignment to improve transfer in unsupervised domain adaptation.

Result: Empirical results show state-of-the-art performance on multiple time-series domain adaptation benchmarks; significant gains in the target domain; lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE) indicating better calibration.

Conclusion: The proposed integration of multi-scale input features with uncertainty-aware evidential learning enhances unsupervised domain adaptation for time-series data, improving accuracy and calibration across diverse domains.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods seek to generalize effectively on
unlabeled test data, especially when encountering the common challenge in time
series data that distribution shifts occur between training and testing
datasets. In this paper, we propose incorporating multi-scale feature
extraction and uncertainty estimation to improve the model's generalization and
robustness across domains. Our approach begins with a multi-scale mixed input
architecture that captures features at different scales, increasing training
diversity and reducing feature discrepancies between the training and testing
domains. Based on the mixed input architecture, we further introduce an
uncertainty awareness mechanism based on evidential learning by imposing a
Dirichlet prior on the labels to facilitate both target prediction and
uncertainty estimation. The uncertainty awareness mechanism enhances domain
adaptation by aligning features with the same labels across different domains,
which leads to significant performance improvements in the target domain.
Additionally, our uncertainty-aware model demonstrates a much lower Expected
Calibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence.
Our experimental results show that this combined approach of mixed input
architecture with the uncertainty awareness mechanism achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmark datasets, underscoring its effectiveness
in unsupervised domain adaptation for time series data.

### [193] [STRATA-TS: Selective Knowledge Transfer for Urban Time Series Forecasting with Retrieval-Guided Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18635)
*Yue Jiang,Chenxi Liu,Yile Chen,Qin Chao,Shuai Liu,Gao Cong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STRATA-TS introduces a selective transfer framework for time-series forecasting in data-scarce urban settings by retrieving semantically aligned source subsequences and using an LLM-based reasoning stage, then distilling the process into a compact model; it achieves improved forecasting on parking datasets across multiple cities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban forecasting suffers from data imbalance: few dense time series and many short histories; naive transfer risks negative transfer. There is a need for data-efficient, interpretable transfer mechanisms that preserve helpful source patterns while avoiding noise.

Method: Use a patch-based temporal encoder to identify source subsequences aligned with the target query; retrieve exemplars; feed retrieved support and target inputs into a retrieval-guided reasoning stage with a large language model performing structured inference; distill reasoning into a compact model via supervised fine-tuning.

Result: Evaluation on three parking availability datasets (Singapore, Nottingham, Glasgow) shows STRATA-TS consistently outperforms strong forecasting and transfer baselines and provides interpretable transfer pathways.

Conclusion: Selective transfer via target-aware retrieval combined with reasoning and distillation enables effective, interpretable forecasting in scarce data regimes, addressing negative transfer risk while leveraging source-domain knowledge.

Abstract: Urban forecasting models often face a severe data imbalance problem: only a
few cities have dense, long-span records, while many others expose short or
incomplete histories. Direct transfer from data-rich to data-scarce cities is
unreliable because only a limited subset of source patterns truly benefits the
target domain, whereas indiscriminate transfer risks introducing noise and
negative transfer. We present STRATA-TS (Selective TRAnsfer via TArget-aware
retrieval for Time Series), a framework that combines domain-adapted retrieval
with reasoning-capable large models to improve forecasting in scarce data
regimes. STRATA-TS employs a patch-based temporal encoder to identify source
subsequences that are semantically and dynamically aligned with the target
query. These retrieved exemplars are then injected into a retrieval-guided
reasoning stage, where an LLM performs structured inference over target inputs
and retrieved support. To enable efficient deployment, we distill the reasoning
process into a compact open model via supervised fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on three parking availability datasets across Singapore,
Nottingham, and Glasgow demonstrate that STRATA-TS consistently outperforms
strong forecasting and transfer baselines, while providing interpretable
knowledge transfer pathways.

*Ifrah Tariq,Ernest Fraenkel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BDVAE integrates multi-omics with modular encoders and variational inference to predict ICI response and reveal continuous resistance mechanisms; achieves AUC-ROC 0.94 on unseen data and identifies interpretable latent features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand why patients resist immune checkpoint inhibitors and improve prediction by leveraging biological structure in multi-omics data to enhance interpretability.

Method: Biologically Disentangled Variational Autoencoder (BDVAE) with modality- and pathway-specific encoders; modular architecture with variational inference; integrates transcriptomic and genomic data; applied to a pan-cancer cohort (n=366) across four cancer types treated with ICIs.

Result: BDVAE accurately predicts treatment response (AUC-ROC 0.94 on unseen data); uncovers resistance mechanisms including immune suppression, metabolic shifts, and neuronal signaling; resistance spans a continuous spectrum rather than binary; latent features correlate with survival outcomes and clinical subtypes.

Conclusion: Biologically structured machine learning can reveal complex resistance patterns and guide precision immunotherapy by providing interpretable, clinically relevant latent features.

Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed cancer treatment, yet
patient responses remain highly variable, and the biological mechanisms
underlying resistance are poorly understood. While machine learning models hold
promise for predicting responses to ICIs, most existing methods lack
interpretability and do not effectively leverage the biological structure
inherent to multi-omics data. Here, we introduce the Biologically Disentangled
Variational Autoencoder (BDVAE), a deep generative model that integrates
transcriptomic and genomic data through modality- and pathway-specific
encoders. Unlike existing rigid, pathway-informed models, BDVAE employs a
modular encoder architecture combined with variational inference to learn
biologically meaningful latent features associated with immune, genomic, and
metabolic processes. Applied to a pan-cancer cohort of 366 patients across four
cancer types treated with ICIs, BDVAE accurately predicts treatment response
(AUC-ROC = 0.94 on unseen test data) and uncovers critical resistance
mechanisms, including immune suppression, metabolic shifts, and neuronal
signaling. Importantly, BDVAE reveals that resistance spans a continuous
biological spectrum rather than strictly binary states, reflecting gradations
of tumor dysfunction. Several latent features correlate with survival outcomes
and known clinical subtypes, demonstrating BDVAE's capability to generate
interpretable, clinically relevant insights. These findings underscore the
value of biologically structured machine learning in elucidating complex
resistance patterns and guiding precision immunotherapy strategies.

### [195] [The Sound of Risk: A Multimodal Physics-Informed Acoustic Model for Forecasting Market Volatility and Enhancing Market Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18653)
*Xiaoliang Chen,Xin Yu,Le Chang,Teng Jing,Jiashuai He,Ze Wang,Yangjun Luo,Xingyu Chen,Jiayue Liang,Yuchen Wang,Jiaying Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Multimodal financial risk signals from earnings calls (text + acoustics) via a physics-informed model explain substantial out-of-sample volatility, especially during scripted-to-Q&A transitions, but do not predict return direction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address information asymmetry in markets and limitations of text-only analysis by leveraging robust paralinguistic cues from executive vocal dynamics to reveal corporate uncertainty.

Method: Combine textual sentiment with paralinguistic cues extracted from executive vocal tract dynamics using the Physics-Informed Acoustic Model (PIAM) to derive emotions from distorted audio; project both modalities into a 3D Affective State Label (ASL) space (Tension, Stability, Arousal); analyze 1,795 earnings calls (~1,800 hours); examine shifts from scripted to spontaneous speech; evaluate predictive power.

Result: Multimodal features explain up to 43.8% of out-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility; no clear directional return predictability; volatility driven by transitions, with CFO instability and CEO arousal variability being particularly informative; ablation shows multimodal outperforms finance-only baselines.

Conclusion: Decoding latent uncertainty from verifiable biometric signals enhances market interpretability and helps identify hidden corporate uncertainty for investors and regulators.

Abstract: Information asymmetry in financial markets, often amplified by strategically
crafted corporate narratives, undermines the effectiveness of conventional
textual analysis. We propose a novel multimodal framework for financial risk
assessment that integrates textual sentiment with paralinguistic cues derived
from executive vocal tract dynamics in earnings calls. Central to this
framework is the Physics-Informed Acoustic Model (PIAM), which applies
nonlinear acoustics to robustly extract emotional signatures from raw
teleconference sound subject to distortions such as signal clipping. Both
acoustic and textual emotional states are projected onto an interpretable
three-dimensional Affective State Label (ASL) space-Tension, Stability, and
Arousal. Using a dataset of 1,795 earnings calls (approximately 1,800 hours),
we construct features capturing dynamic shifts in executive affect between
scripted presentation and spontaneous Q&A exchanges. Our key finding reveals a
pronounced divergence in predictive capacity: while multimodal features do not
forecast directional stock returns, they explain up to 43.8% of the
out-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility. Importantly, volatility
predictions are strongly driven by emotional dynamics during executive
transitions from scripted to spontaneous speech, particularly reduced textual
stability and heightened acoustic instability from CFOs, and significant
arousal variability from CEOs. An ablation study confirms that our multimodal
approach substantially outperforms a financials-only baseline, underscoring the
complementary contributions of acoustic and textual modalities. By decoding
latent markers of uncertainty from verifiable biometric signals, our
methodology provides investors and regulators a powerful tool for enhancing
market interpretability and identifying hidden corporate uncertainty.

### [196] [FFT-MoE: Efficient Federated Fine-Tuning for Foundation Models via Large-scale Sparse MoE under Heterogeneous Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18663)
*Gang Hu,Yinglei Teng,Pengfei Wu,Nan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FFT MoE replaces LoRA with sparse Mixture of Experts adapters for Federated Fine-Tuning, using per-client gating and a heterogeneity-aware loss to adapt to local budgets and data distributions. It achieves better generalization and training efficiency than FFT baselines under IID and non-IID settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning foundation models in federated settings faces privacy and resource constraints, especially when high-quality data resides on edge devices. LoRA-based FFT struggles with structural compatibility across heterogeneous clients and limited adaptation to non-IID data, hindering convergence and generalization.

Method: Replace LoRA with sparse MoE adapters. Each client trains a lightweight gating network to selectively activate a personalized subset of experts, ensuring fine-grained adaptation while preserving aggregation compatibility. Introduce a heterogeneity-aware auxiliary loss that regularizes routing to promote expert diversity and balanced utilization across devices and data distributions.

Result: Extensive experiments under IID and non-IID conditions show FFT MoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FFT baselines in generalization performance and training efficiency.

Conclusion: FFT MoE addresses key limitations of LoRA-based FFT in heterogeneous FL, enabling scalable, resource-aware, privacy-preserving fine-tuning with improved generalization. It showcases the viability of MoE adapters for distributed deep learning and suggests directions for broader applicability.

Abstract: As FMs drive progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI),
fine-tuning them under privacy and resource constraints has become increasingly
critical particularly when highquality training data resides on distributed
edge devices. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling solution through
Federated Fine-Tuning (FFT), which enables collaborative model adaptation
without sharing raw data. Recent approaches incorporate Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce
computational overhead. However, LoRA-based FFT faces two major limitations in
heterogeneous FL environments: structural incompatibility across clients with
varying LoRA configurations and limited adaptability to non-IID data
distributions, which hinders convergence and generalization. To address these
challenges, we propose FFT MoE, a novel FFT framework that replaces LoRA with
sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) adapters. Each client trains a lightweight
gating network to selectively activate a personalized subset of experts,
enabling fine-grained adaptation to local resource budgets while preserving
aggregation compatibility. To further combat the expert load imbalance caused
by device and data heterogeneity, we introduce a heterogeneity-aware auxiliary
loss that dynamically regularizes the routing distribution to ensure expert
diversity and balanced utilization. Extensive experiments spanning both IID and
non-IID conditions demonstrate that FFT MoE consistently outperforms state of
the art FFT baselines in generalization performance and training efficiency.

### [197] [Auditing Approximate Machine Unlearning for Differentially Private Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18671)
*Yuechun Gu,Jiajie He,Keke Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Auditing approximate machine unlearning reveals that kept data after unlearning can still violate differential privacy; introduces A-LiRA MIA for efficient auditing and argues for DP-preserving unlearning; code is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The privacy onion effect suggests that retaining data after unlearning can still pose privacy risks, especially under differential privacy. Existing unlearning methods assume retained data remains private, which may be false; there is a need to holistically audit both unlearned and retained samples for DP and membership inference risk.

Method: Propose privacy criteria for unlearned and retained samples from DP and membership inference perspectives. Develop A-LiRA (an efficient MIA leveraging data augmentation) to reduce the cost of training shadow models for auditing. Apply auditing framework to approximate unlearning algorithms in DP models.

Result: Experiments show that existing approximate unlearning methods can leak privacy for retained samples in DP models, motivating the need for DP-preserving unlearning. The authors provide reproducibility via public code.

Conclusion: Differentially private unlearning is necessary; auditing reveals privacy leakage in retained samples after unlearning. Future work should design unlearning algorithms that preserve DP guarantees and robustly audit unlearning procedures.

Abstract: Approximate machine unlearning aims to remove the effect of specific data
from trained models to ensure individuals' privacy. Existing methods focus on
the removed records and assume the retained ones are unaffected. However,
recent studies on the \emph{privacy onion effect} indicate this assumption
might be incorrect. Especially when the model is differentially private, no
study has explored whether the retained ones still meet the differential
privacy (DP) criterion under existing machine unlearning methods. This paper
takes a holistic approach to auditing both unlearned and retained samples'
privacy risks after applying approximate unlearning algorithms. We propose the
privacy criteria for unlearned and retained samples, respectively, based on the
perspectives of DP and membership inference attacks (MIAs). To make the
auditing process more practical, we also develop an efficient MIA, A-LiRA,
utilizing data augmentation to reduce the cost of shadow model training. Our
experimental findings indicate that existing approximate machine unlearning
algorithms may inadvertently compromise the privacy of retained samples for
differentially private models, and we need differentially private unlearning
algorithms. For reproducibility, we have pubished our code:

*Taishi Nakamura,Satoki Ishikawa,Masaki Kawamura,Takumi Okamoto,Daisuke Nohara,Jun Suzuki,Rio Yokota*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MoE sparsity decouples memorization and reasoning: increasing total parameters improves memorization but can degrade or plateau reasoning; top-k routing and fixed compute budgets yield limited movement in reasoning; hyperparameters modulate generalization; neither RL nor extra test-time compute fixes the reasoning deficit of sparse MoEs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand how MoE sparsity affects two capability regimes (memorization vs reasoning) under fixed compute, to reveal limitations of scaling laws when applying mixture-of-experts.

Method: Train families of MoE Transformer models with varying total parameters, active parameters, and top-k routing; holding compute budget fixed; record pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and task accuracy; decompose generalization gap into train-test gap and loss-accuracy gap; analyze effects of hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, initialization) and post-training interventions.

Result: Memorization benchmarks scale monotonically with total parameters, mirroring training loss; reasoning performance saturates and can regress despite continued gains in both total parameters and training loss; altering top-k with fixed active parameters has little effect; classic hyperparameters modulate the generalization gap in the same direction as sparsity; post-training RL (GRPO) and extra test-time compute do not rescue the reasoning deficit of overly sparse models.

Conclusion: MoE sparsity creates a dissociation between memorization and reasoning; scaling laws from dense models do not automatically extend to MoE systems; optimizing for sparsity and compute budgets requires separate consideration of reasoning capabilities, and standard remedies like RL or extra compute are insufficient to fix reasoning deficits. Open-source code and logs are provided.

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws have driven the evolution of large language models
(LLMs), yet their coefficients shift whenever the model architecture or data
pipeline changes. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in
state-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current
dense-model frontiers overlook. We investigate how MoE sparsity influences two
distinct capability regimes: memorization and reasoning. We train families of
MoE Transformers that systematically vary total parameters, active parameters,
and top-$k$ routing while holding the compute budget fixed. For every model we
record pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and task accuracy, allowing us
to separate the train-test generalization gap from the loss-accuracy gap.
Memorization benchmarks improve monotonically with total parameters, mirroring
training loss. By contrast, reasoning performance saturates and can even
regress despite continued gains in both total parameters and training loss.
Altering top-$k$ alone has little effect when active parameters are constant,
and classic hyperparameters such as learning rate and initialization modulate
the generalization gap in the same direction as sparsity. Neither post-training
reinforcement learning (GRPO) nor extra test-time compute rescues the reasoning
deficit of overly sparse models. Our model checkpoints, code and logs are
open-source at https://github.com/rioyokotalab/optimal-sparsity.

*Chufan Gao,Jintai Chen,Jimeng Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A prompting-based learning-to-retrieve framework (LRTab) combines training-data–learned prompt conditions with retrieval at inference to improve tabular reasoning with LLMs, addressing finetuning vs training-free prompting trade-offs; shows interpretability, cost-efficiency, and SOTA performance on WikiTQ and Tabfact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between finetuning LLMs (dataset-specific but less generalizable) and training-free prompting (general but not data-efficient) by learning prompt conditions from training data and retrieving them at inference to enhance tabular reasoning.

Method: Iteratively generate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) from training data via prompting; identify incorrect CoTs and prompt the model to predict Prompt Conditions that would avoid the errors; validate these Prompt Conditions on validation data; at inference, retrieve the most relevant Prompt Conditions to provide additional context for table understanding.

Result: Empirical evaluation on WikiTQ and Tabfact shows LRTab is interpretable and cost-efficient and can outperform prior baselines in tabular reasoning.

Conclusion: LRTab successfully leverages learned prompt conditions and retrieval to improve tabular reasoning with LLMs, offering a balanced trade-off between fine-tuning and zero-shot prompting while maintaining interpretability.

Abstract: Automated tabular understanding and reasoning are essential tasks for data
scientists. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly
prevalent in tabular reasoning tasks. Previous work focuses on (1) finetuning
LLMs using labeled data or (2) Training-free prompting LLM agents using
chain-of-thought (CoT). Finetuning offers dataset-specific learning at the cost
of generalizability. Training-free prompting is highly generalizable but does
not take full advantage of training data. In this paper, we propose a novel
prompting-based reasoning approach, Learn then Retrieve: LRTab, which
integrates the benefits of both by retrieving relevant information learned from
training data. We first use prompting to obtain CoT responses over the training
data. For incorrect CoTs, we prompt the LLM to predict Prompt Conditions to
avoid the error, learning insights from the data. We validate the effectiveness
of Prompt Conditions using validation data. Finally, at inference time, we
retrieve the most relevant Prompt Conditions for additional context for table
understanding. We provide comprehensive experiments on WikiTQ and Tabfact,
showing that LRTab is interpretable, cost-efficient, and can outperform
previous baselines in tabular reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: End-to-end deep learning framework combining autoencoder-based feature extraction with an MLP classifier, plus tailored down-sampling and non-overlapping sliding windows, achieves robust early sepsis detection across three ICU cohorts and outperforms traditional baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sepsis necessitates timely detection in ICUs, but real-world EHR time-series are irregular and incomplete, making manual feature engineering and traditional ML approaches challenging.

Method: An unsupervised autoencoder extracts features from time-series data, feeding a multilayer perceptron classifier for binary sepsis risk. Training uses a customized down-sampling strategy to select high-information-density segments and a non-overlapping dynamic sliding window for real-time inference. Input vectors include explicit missingness indicators to mitigate bias. Evaluated on three ICU cohorts.

Result: The model achieves accuracies of 74.6%, 80.6%, and 93.5% across the three cohorts, consistently outperforming traditional machine learning baselines.

Conclusion: The end-to-end framework demonstrates robustness, generalizability, and clinical utility for early sepsis detection across heterogeneous ICU environments.

Abstract: Sepsis is a life threatening condition that requires timely detection in
intensive care settings. Traditional machine learning approaches, including
Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, often
rely on manual feature engineering and struggle with irregular, incomplete
time-series data commonly present in electronic health records. We introduce an
end-to-end deep learning framework integrating an unsupervised autoencoder for
automatic feature extraction with a multilayer perceptron classifier for binary
sepsis risk prediction. To enhance clinical applicability, we implement a
customized down sampling strategy that extracts high information density
segments during training and a non-overlapping dynamic sliding window mechanism
for real-time inference. Preprocessed time series data are represented as fixed
dimension vectors with explicit missingness indicators, mitigating bias and
noise. We validate our approach on three ICU cohorts. Our end-to-end model
achieves accuracies of 74.6 percent, 80.6 percent, and 93.5 percent,
respectively, consistently outperforming traditional machine learning
baselines. These results demonstrate the framework's superior robustness,
generalizability, and clinical utility for early sepsis detection across
heterogeneous ICU environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics- and topology-guided LDPC framework for multi-class image classification that compresses 1280-d CNN features to 32–64-d while achieving strong accuracy on ImageNet subsets, with fast estimation of the Nishimori temperature and topology-driven graph design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify statistical physics, coding theory, and algebraic topology to improve separability and efficiency in high-dimensional feature spaces, by interpreting CNN features as spins on LDPC graphs (RBIM) and linking graph trapping sets to topological invariants.

Method: Interpret features as spins on a sparse MET-QC-LDPC graph to form a Random-Bond Ising Model at the Nishimori temperature β_N. Develop a quadratic interpolant with Newton correction to estimate β_N efficiently (six-fold speed-up vs bisection). Design spherical and toroidal MET-QC-LDPC ensembles guided by topology, using permanent bounds to suppress harmful trapping sets. Compress 1280-d features to 32–64 d for ImageNet-10/100 and evaluate performance.

Result: Feature compression from 1280 to 32–64 dimensions; accuracy of 98.7% on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100; six-fold speed-up in β_N estimation; demonstrates highly efficient, physics-inspired embeddings with strong performance.

Conclusion: Topology-guided graph design, under a physics-inspired RBIM framework, yields compact embeddings with strong accuracy, indicating a promising interdisciplinary approach for efficient large-scale image classification.

Abstract: We present a unified framework combining statistical physics, coding theory,
and algebraic topology for efficient multi-class image classification.
High-dimensional feature vectors from a frozen MobileNetV2 backbone are
interpreted as spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type quasi-cyclic LDPC
(MET-QC-LDPC) graph, forming a Random-Bond Ising Model (RBIM). We operate this
RBIM at its Nishimori temperature, $\beta_N$, where the smallest eigenvalue of
the Bethe-Hessian matrix vanishes, maximizing class separability.
  Our theoretical contribution establishes a correspondence between local
trapping sets in the code's graph and topological invariants (Betti numbers,
bordism classes) of the feature manifold. A practical algorithm estimates
$\beta_N$ efficiently with a quadratic interpolant and Newton correction,
achieving a six-fold speed-up over bisection.
  Guided by topology, we design spherical and toroidal MET-QC-LDPC graph
ensembles, using permanent bounds to suppress harmful trapping sets. This
compresses 1280-dimensional features to 32 or 64 dimensions for ImageNet-10 and
-100 subsets. Despite massive compression (40x fewer parameters), we achieve
98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100, demonstrating that
topology-guided graph design yields highly efficient, physics-inspired
embeddings with state-of-the-art performance.

*Yi Liu,Hongji Zhang,Yiwen Wang,Dimitris Tsaras,Lei Chen,Mingxuan Yuan,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A structure-aware, self-supervised Graph Learning framework (StructRTL) for RTL quality estimation using CDFG representations, with knowledge distillation from post-mapping nets, achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RTL quality estimation benefits from explicit structural semantics; LLM-based embeddings overlook structural cues. The CDFG view reveals design structure, enabling richer representations and more accurate area/delay predictions without full synthesis.

Method: A structure-aware graph self-supervised learning framework that operates on CDFGs to learn structure-informed representations. It also employs knowledge distillation to transfer low-level insights from post-mapping netlists into the CDFG predictor, enhancing cross-stage supervision.

Result: Experiments show significant improvement over prior art, achieving state-of-the-art results on various RTL quality estimation tasks, with gains from combining structural learning and cross-stage knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: Combining structure-aware SSL with cross-stage supervision is effective for RTL design quality estimation; StructRTL demonstrates the benefit of leveraging CDFG structure and distillation to improve prediction accuracy.

Abstract: Estimating the quality of register transfer level (RTL) designs is crucial in
the electronic design automation (EDA) workflow, as it enables instant feedback
on key metrics like area and delay without the need for time-consuming logic
synthesis. While recent approaches have leveraged large language models (LLMs)
to derive embeddings from RTL code and achieved promising results, they
overlook the structural semantics essential for accurate quality estimation. In
contrast, the control data flow graph (CDFG) view exposes the design's
structural characteristics more explicitly, offering richer cues for
representation learning. In this work, we introduce a novel structure-aware
graph self-supervised learning framework, StructRTL, for improved RTL design
quality estimation. By learning structure-informed representations from CDFGs,
our method significantly outperforms prior art on various quality estimation
tasks. To further boost performance, we incorporate a knowledge distillation
strategy that transfers low-level insights from post-mapping netlists into the
CDFG predictor. Experiments show that our approach establishes new
state-of-the-art results, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining
structural learning with cross-stage supervision.

### [203] [FLAegis: A Two-Layer Defense Framework for Federated Learning Against Poisoning Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18737)
*Enrique Mármol Campos,Aurora González Vidal,José Luis Hernández Ramos,Antonio Skarmeta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FLAegis is a two-stage defense for federated learning that detects Byzantine clients using SAX-based time-series representations and spectral clustering, followed by an FFT-based robust aggregation to mitigate remaining attackers, achieving superior detection and model accuracy across multiple poisoning attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning is decentralized and privacy-preserving but vulnerable to Byzantine clients who send corrupted updates, risking model quality. There is a need for effective detection and robust aggregation to maintain performance under adversarial conditions.

Method: Stage 1: Transform client updates with symbolic time series transformation (SAX) to amplify differences between benign and malicious models, then apply spectral clustering to identify Byzantine clients. Stage 2: Apply a robust FFT-based aggregation function at the server to lessen the impact of any Byzantines that evade detection. Evaluate against five poisoning attacks (from label flipping to optimization-based strategies).

Result: The framework achieves higher detection precision and final model accuracy than state-of-the-art defenses across multiple attack types, maintaining high performance even under strong adversarial conditions.

Conclusion: Combining representation-based detection (SAX + spectral clustering) with a robust FFT-based aggregator yields improved robustness of federated learning against Byzantine attacks, with strong empirical performance across diverse attacks.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become a powerful technique for training Machine
Learning (ML) models in a decentralized manner, preserving the privacy of the
training datasets involved. However, the decentralized nature of FL limits the
visibility of the training process, relying heavily on the honesty of
participating clients. This assumption opens the door to malicious third
parties, known as Byzantine clients, which can poison the training process by
submitting false model updates. Such malicious clients may engage in poisoning
attacks, manipulating either the dataset or the model parameters to induce
misclassification. In response, this study introduces FLAegis, a two-stage
defensive framework designed to identify Byzantine clients and improve the
robustness of FL systems. Our approach leverages symbolic time series
transformation (SAX) to amplify the differences between benign and malicious
models, and spectral clustering, which enables accurate detection of
adversarial behavior. Furthermore, we incorporate a robust FFT-based
aggregation function as a final layer to mitigate the impact of those Byzantine
clients that manage to evade prior defenses. We rigorously evaluate our method
against five poisoning attacks, ranging from simple label flipping to adaptive
optimization-based strategies. Notably, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art defenses in both detection precision and final model accuracy,
maintaining consistently high performance even under strong adversarial
conditions.

### [204] [Stability and Generalization for Bellman Residuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18741)
*Enoch H. Kang,Kyoungseok Jang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BRM for offline RL/IRL admits O(1/n) stability and O(1/n) excess risk guarantees via a Lyapunov potential that couples SGDA across neighboring datasets, doubling the best known rate for convex-concave saddle problems, without extra variance reduction, regularization, or restrictive independence assumptions; applicable to standard neural nets with minibatch SGD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is limited theoretical understanding of the statistical behavior of Bellman residual minimization (BRM) in offline settings. BRM is promising for enforcing Bellman consistency in offline RL/IRL, but lack of strong generalization and stability guarantees hinders practice. This work aims to provide formal statistical guarantees in fixed-data regimes.

Method: Introduce a single Lyapunov potential that couples stochastic gradient descent-ascent (SGDA) runs on neighboring datasets. Use it to derive an O(1/n) on-average argument-stability bound, which in turn yields an O(1/n) excess risk bound for BRM without variance reduction, extra regularization, or restrictive independence assumptions on minibatch sampling. The analysis is compatible with standard neural-network parameterizations and minibatch SGD.

Result: Establishes O(1/n) stability and O(1/n) excess risk bounds for BRM in offline RL/IRL. The stability constant reflects a doubling of the best known sample-complexity exponent for convex-concave saddle problems, and the excess risk bound does not require additional tricks or stringent sampling assumptions; applies to standard NN architectures and minibatch SGD.

Conclusion: BRM in offline RL/IRL is theoretically well-behaved under broad conditions, with concrete O(1/n) guarantees provided by a Lyapunov-based stability analysis. This supports using BRM with standard SGD setups without extra regularization or variance-reduction techniques, and clarifies its sample-efficiency properties.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning and offline inverse reinforcement learning aim
to recover near-optimal value functions or reward models from a fixed batch of
logged trajectories, yet current practice still struggles to enforce Bellman
consistency. Bellman residual minimization (BRM) has emerged as an attractive
remedy, as a globally convergent stochastic gradient descent-ascent based
method for BRM has been recently discovered. However, its statistical behavior
in the offline setting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we close this
statistical gap. Our analysis introduces a single Lyapunov potential that
couples SGDA runs on neighbouring datasets and yields an O(1/n) on-average
argument-stability bound-doubling the best known sample-complexity exponent for
convex-concave saddle problems. The same stability constant translates into the
O(1/n) excess risk bound for BRM, without variance reduction, extra
regularization, or restrictive independence assumptions on minibatch sampling.
The results hold for standard neural-network parameterizations and minibatch
SGD.

### [205] [Constraint Matters: Multi-Modal Representation for Reducing Mixed-Integer Linear programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18742)
*Jiajun Li,Ran Hou,Yu Ding,Yixuan Li,Shisi Guan,Jiahui Duan,Xiongwei Han,Tao Zhong,Vincent Chau,Weiwei Wu,Wanyuan Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces constraint-based MILP reduction by identifying critical tight constraints via a multi-modal learning approach; shows >50% improvement in solution quality and ~17.5% faster solve times vs state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the gap in MILP model reduction: most work focuses on variable reduction; constraint reduction, if done carefully, can reduce problem complexity while preserving feasibility. The challenge is to identify which constraints are critical and predict them efficiently.

Method: Two-step approach: (1) label optimal tight constraints as potential critical constraints and apply a heuristic to select a subset; (2) learn to predict these critical constraints using a multi-modal representation that combines instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations.

Result: Experimental results show the method improves solution quality by over 50% and reduces computation time by 17.47% compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: Constraint-based MILP reduction is a viable complement to variable reduction, capable of accelerating solving and preserving feasibility by focusing on the most impactful constraints.

Abstract: Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed
integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much
faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction,
which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual
perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality
constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has
been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based
model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two
challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing
them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to
predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical
constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as
potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset
of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we
propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from
both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental
results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method
improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation
time by 17.47\%.

### [206] [UltraMemV2: Memory Networks Scaling to 120B Parameters with Superior Long-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18756)
*Zihao Huang,Yu Bao,Qiyang Min,Siyan Chen,Ran Guo,Hongzhi Huang,Defa Zhu,Yutao Zeng,Banggu Wu,Xun Zhou,Siyuan Qiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UltraMemV2 redesigns memory-layer architecture to close the gap with 8-expert MoEs, achieving similar performance with far lower memory access through five improvements and FFN-based processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce memory access costs in sparse MoE-like models while maintaining or surpassing state-of-the-art performance, enabling memory-efficient sparse inference.

Method: Five improvements: (1) integrate memory layers into every transformer block; (2) simplify value expansion with a single linear projection; (3) adopt FFN-based value processing from PEER; (4) principled parameter initialization; (5) rebalanced memory-to-FFN computation ratios. Evaluation on memory-intensive tasks (long-context memorization, multi-round memorization, in-context learning) and scaling up to 2.5B activated parameters within a 120B total parameter model.

Result: UltraMemV2 matches 8-expert MoE performance under the same compute and parameter budgets, with significantly reduced memory access. It delivers notable gains on memory-intensive tasks (+1.6, +6.2, +7.9 points). Demonstrates activation density drives performance more than sparse parameter count and scales to large models.

Conclusion: Memory-layer architectures can achieve state-of-the-art-like performance while reducing memory access, offering a compelling alternative to traditional MoE models for efficient sparse computation.

Abstract: While Mixture of Experts (MoE) models achieve remarkable efficiency by
activating only subsets of parameters, they suffer from high memory access
costs during inference. Memory-layer architectures offer an appealing
alternative with very few memory access, but previous attempts like UltraMem
have only matched the performance of 2-expert MoE models, falling significantly
short of state-of-the-art 8-expert configurations. We present UltraMemV2, a
redesigned memory-layer architecture that closes this performance gap. Our
approach introduces five key improvements: integrating memory layers into every
transformer block, simplifying value expansion with single linear projections,
adopting FFN-based value processing from PEER, implementing principled
parameter initialization, and rebalancing memory-to-FFN computation ratios.
Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that UltraMemV2 achieves
performance parity with 8-expert MoE models under same computation and
parameters but significantly low memory access. Notably, UltraMemV2 shows
superior performance on memory-intensive tasks, with improvements of +1.6
points on long-context memorization, +6.2 points on multi-round memorization,
and +7.9 points on in-context learning. We validate our approach at scale with
models up to 2.5B activated parameters from 120B total parameters, and
establish that activation density has greater impact on performance than total
sparse parameter count. Our work brings memory-layer architectures to
performance parity with state-of-the-art MoE models, presenting a compelling
alternative for efficient sparse computation.

### [207] [Governance-as-a-Service: A Multi-Agent Framework for AI System Compliance and Policy Enforcement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18765)
*Helen Pervez,Suyash Gaurav,Jukka Heikkonen,Jatin Chaudhary*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GaaS provides a runtime, policy-driven governance layer for distributed AI agents that intercepts and enforces outputs without changing models, using declarative rules and a Trust Factor to rate compliance; evaluated in simulations showing safety improvements with maintained throughput.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to address structural governance risks in evolving multi-agent AI ecosystems where existing oversight is reactive, tightly coupled, non-auditable, and hard to generalize.

Method: introduce Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS), a modular runtime service with declarative policy rules and a Trust Factor scoring mechanism; supports coercive, normative, and adaptive interventions; evaluate in three sim regimes with LLaMA3, Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1 across content gen and financial decision-making; baseline, governance-enabled, adversarial-probing; all actions logged and analyzed.

Result: GaaS reliably blocks or redirects high-risk behaviors while preserving throughput; Trust scores track rule adherence and penalize untrustworthy components; demonstrates robustness across regimes; enables dynamic trust modulation and graduated enforcement.

Conclusion: Governance is a runtime service that provides infrastructure-level alignment for interoperable agent ecosystems, enforcing ethics rather than teaching them.

Abstract: As AI systems evolve into distributed ecosystems with autonomous execution,
asynchronous reasoning, and multi-agent coordination, the absence of scalable,
decoupled governance poses a structural risk. Existing oversight mechanisms are
reactive, brittle, and embedded within agent architectures, making them
non-auditable and hard to generalize across heterogeneous deployments.
  We introduce Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS): a modular, policy-driven
enforcement layer that regulates agent outputs at runtime without altering
model internals or requiring agent cooperation. GaaS employs declarative rules
and a Trust Factor mechanism that scores agents based on compliance and
severity-weighted violations. It enables coercive, normative, and adaptive
interventions, supporting graduated enforcement and dynamic trust modulation.
  To evaluate GaaS, we conduct three simulation regimes with open-source models
(LLaMA3, Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1) across content generation and financial
decision-making. In the baseline, agents act without governance; in the second,
GaaS enforces policies; in the third, adversarial agents probe robustness. All
actions are intercepted, evaluated, and logged for analysis. Results show that
GaaS reliably blocks or redirects high-risk behaviors while preserving
throughput. Trust scores track rule adherence, isolating and penalizing
untrustworthy components in multi-agent systems.
  By positioning governance as a runtime service akin to compute or storage,
GaaS establishes infrastructure-level alignment for interoperable agent
ecosystems. It does not teach agents ethics; it enforces them.

TL;DR: HGNN-DDI uses a heterogeneous graph neural network to predict drug-drug interactions by integrating multiple drug-related data sources, achieving superior accuracy and robustness over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDIs threaten patient safety and complexity of interactions among drugs, targets, and biological entities is not well captured by homogeneous models; there is a need to model heterogeneous biomedical networks.

Method: Constructs a heterogeneous biomedical network and applies a heterogeneous GNN (HGNN) to propagate information across diverse node and edge types, integrating multiple data sources for DDI prediction.

Result: On benchmark DDI datasets, HGNN-DDI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prediction accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: HGNN-DDI demonstrates the effectiveness of heterogeneous GNNs for DDI prediction and has potential to aid safer drug development and precision medicine.

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a major concern in clinical practice, as
they can lead to reduced therapeutic efficacy or severe adverse effects.
Traditional computational approaches often struggle to capture the complex
relationships among drugs, targets, and biological entities. In this work, we
propose HGNN-DDI, a heterogeneous graph neural network model designed to
predict potential DDIs by integrating multiple drug-related data sources.
HGNN-DDI leverages graph representation learning to model heterogeneous
biomedical networks, enabling effective information propagation across diverse
node and edge types. Experimental results on benchmark DDI datasets demonstrate
that HGNN-DDI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prediction accuracy and
robustness, highlighting its potential to support safer drug development and
precision medicine.

### [209] [Federated Learning with Heterogeneous and Private Label Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18774)
*Adam Breitholtz,Edvin Listo Zec,Fredrik D. Johansson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Label-set heterogeneity and private labels in federated learning reduce performance; however, with centralized tuning and adapted methods, private-label FL can achieve comparable accuracy to public-label FL while enhancing privacy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study the impact of client label-set heterogeneity in FL, compare public vs private label settings under known/unknown label unions, and evaluate adaptations of classical classifier combination methods and FL algorithms.

Method: Apply classifier combination approaches with centralized tuning; adapt standard FL methods to the private-label setting; evaluate across scenarios where the union of labels is known versus unknown.

Result: Reducing per-client labels harms all methods; centralized tuning improves representational alignment but increases variance; proposed adaptations perform well, achieving similar performance in private-label settings as standard methods do in public-label settings.

Conclusion: Private-label FL with these adaptations enables privacy with little accuracy loss; central tuning offers gains but trade-offs in variance; the results support feasibility of FL with private label sets.

Abstract: Although common in real-world applications, heterogeneous client label sets
are rarely investigated in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, in the cases
they are, clients are assumed to be willing to share their entire label sets
with other clients. Federated learning with private label sets, shared only
with the central server, adds further constraints on learning algorithms and
is, in general, a more difficult problem to solve. In this work, we study the
effects of label set heterogeneity on model performance, comparing the public
and private label settings -- when the union of label sets in the federation is
known to clients and when it is not. We apply classical methods for the
classifier combination problem to FL using centralized tuning, adapt common FL
methods to the private label set setting, and discuss the justification of both
approaches under practical assumptions. Our experiments show that reducing the
number of labels available to each client harms the performance of all methods
substantially. Centralized tuning of client models for representational
alignment can help remedy this, but often at the cost of higher variance.
Throughout, our proposed adaptations of standard FL methods perform well,
showing similar performance in the private label setting as the standard
methods achieve in the public setting. This shows that clients can enjoy
increased privacy at little cost to model accuracy.

### [210] [SWiFT: Soft-Mask Weight Fine-tuning for Bias Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18826)
*Junyu Yan,Feng Chen,Yuyang Xue,Yuning Du,Konstantinos Vilouras,Sotirios A. Tsaftaris,Steven McDonagh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A debiasing framework (SWiFT) reduces bias with minimal data and fine-tuning, maintaining diagnostic accuracy, and improving OOD generalization in dermatology and chest X-ray tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ML models trained on sensitive clinical data can be biased across demographic attributes, risking unfairness. Existing debiasing methods require access to original data or extensive retraining and trade off fairness vs accuracy. There is a need for an efficient debiasing approach.

Method: SWiFT estimates each model parameter's contributions to bias and to predictive performance, then applies a two-step fine-tuning with parameter-wise gradient flows (soft masks) using a small external dataset and only a few epochs.

Result: SWiFT consistently reduces bias across gender, skin tone, and age attributes while achieving competitive or superior diagnostic accuracy. It also improves generalization, as shown by better performance on several OOD datasets, compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: SWiFT demonstrates that efficient, data-light debiasing with parameter-aware fine-tuning can achieve fairness without sacrificing performance and can enhance generalization in medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Machine Learning (ML) models can exhibit bias
in real-world scenarios, posing significant challenges in ethically sensitive
domains such as healthcare. Such bias can negatively affect model fairness,
model generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social
discrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing
debiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and
need extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between
model fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we
propose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that
efficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with
much less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external
dataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to
first find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to
both bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process
updates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its
contribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes
(gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray
datasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while
achieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common
fairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically,
we demonstrate improved model generalization ability as evidenced by superior
performance on several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.

*Shae McFadden,Myles Foley,Mario D'Onghia,Chris Hicks,Vasilios Mavroudis,Nicola Paoletti,Fabio Pierazzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The work reframes malware detection as a one-step MDP and uses deep reinforcement learning to jointly optimize classification accuracy and rejection for manual labeling, achieving improved resilience to concept drift under realistic Android malware drift scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Malware detection must cope with evolving threats (concept drift), limited labeling budgets, and uncertain predictions. Traditional supervised classifiers struggle to maintain performance as drift occurs, especially when optimal strategy requires deciding when to defer to manual labeling or adaptation.

Method: Formulates malware detection as a one-step Markov Decision Process and trains a deep reinforcement learning agent (DRMD) to jointly optimize sample classification and rejection for labeling. Evaluates time-aware performance (Area Under Time, AUT) on Android malware datasets with multi-year drift, comparing against standard classifiers with and without rejection/active learning (AL).

Result: The DRMD agent yields higher average AUT gains across settings: 5.18±5.44 for classification only, 14.49±12.86 for classification with rejection, and 10.06±10.81 for classification with rejection and AL, outperforming traditional approaches under drift.

Conclusion: This study provides the first demonstration that DRL can enhance malware detection under concept drift in the Android domain by jointly optimizing classification and labeling decisions, improving resilience to drift and maintaining performance over multi-year horizons.

Abstract: Malware detection in real-world settings must deal with evolving threats,
limited labeling budgets, and uncertain predictions. Traditional classifiers,
without additional mechanisms, struggle to maintain performance under concept
drift in malware domains, as their supervised learning formulation cannot
optimize when to defer decisions to manual labeling and adaptation. Modern
malware detection pipelines combine classifiers with monthly active learning
(AL) and rejection mechanisms to mitigate the impact of concept drift. In this
work, we develop a novel formulation of malware detection as a one-step Markov
Decision Process and train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent,
simultaneously optimizing sample classification performance and rejecting
high-risk samples for manual labeling. We evaluated the joint detection and
drift mitigation policy learned by the DRL-based Malware Detection (DRMD) agent
through time-aware evaluations on Android malware datasets subject to realistic
drift requiring multi-year performance stability. The policies learned under
these conditions achieve a higher Area Under Time (AUT) performance compared to
standard classification approaches used in the domain, showing improved
resilience to concept drift. Specifically, the DRMD agent achieved a
$5.18\pm5.44$, $14.49\pm12.86$, and $10.06\pm10.81$ average AUT performance
improvement for the classification only, classification with rejection, and
classification with rejection and AL settings, respectively. Our results
demonstrate for the first time that DRL can facilitate effective malware
detection and improved resiliency to concept drift in the dynamic environment
of the Android malware domain.

### [212] [Recycling History: Efficient Recommendations from Contextual Dueling Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18841)
*Suryanarayana Sankagiri,Jalal Etesami,Pouria Fatemi,Matthias Grossglauser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new bandit model for sequential recommendations where, after recommending and consuming an item, the user compares it with a past item from history, allowing comparisons without extra regret. With a diversification-rich history and a short initial exploration, the method achieves O(√T) regret; simulations show reusing past items for comparisons improves performance over only comparing current options.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the observation that user feedback after consumption can be more reliable, and that relying solely on immediate comparisons between simultaneously recommended items may miss informative past items. The goal is to leverage retrospective comparisons to improve learning efficiency in ranking/recommendation tasks.

Method: Proposes a contextual duelling-bandit-like model where at each time step one item is recommended; after consumption, the user is asked to compare it with a chosen item from the user's consumption history. The comparison item can be selected without additional regret. The analysis hinges on a richness/diversity condition of the history and a short initial random exploration phase. Matrix concentration bounds are used to show that with high probability the history becomes rich, enabling informative queries and leading to O(√T) regret.

Result: Theoretical regret bound of O(√T) under the diversity/rich history condition, with high-probability guarantees. Empirical simulations indicate that reusing past items for comparisons reduces regret compared to restricting comparisons to items currently being recommended.

Conclusion: Retrospective comparisons against items from history, when the history is sufficiently rich, enable informative queries and achieve near-optimal regret rates in a contextual duelling-bandit framework. A brief exploration phase suffices to obtain the required diversity, and practical gains are observed when past items are reused for comparisons.

Abstract: The contextual duelling bandit problem models adaptive recommender systems,
where the algorithm presents a set of items to the user, and the user's choice
reveals their preference. This setup is well suited for implicit choices users
make when navigating a content platform, but does not capture other possible
comparison queries. Motivated by the fact that users provide more reliable
feedback after consuming items, we propose a new bandit model that can be
described as follows. The algorithm recommends one item per time step; after
consuming that item, the user is asked to compare it with another item chosen
from the user's consumption history. Importantly, in our model, this comparison
item can be chosen without incurring any additional regret, potentially leading
to better performance. However, the regret analysis is challenging because of
the temporal dependency in the user's history. To overcome this challenge, we
first show that the algorithm can construct informative queries provided the
history is rich, i.e., satisfies a certain diversity condition. We then show
that a short initial random exploration phase is sufficient for the algorithm
to accumulate a rich history with high probability. This result, proven via
matrix concentration bounds, yields $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret guarantees.
Additionally, our simulations show that reusing past items for comparisons can
lead to significantly lower regret than only comparing between simultaneously
recommended items.

*Wei Li,Hangjie Yuan,Zixiang Zhao,Yifan Zhu,Aojun Lu,Tao Feng,Yanan Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: C-Flat is a flatness-promoting, plug-and-play framework for continual learning that improves robustness and performance by favoring flatter loss landscapes; C-Flat++ further reduces update cost with selective flatness promotion, showing strong empirical gains across CL paradigms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In continual learning (CL), there is a need to balance sensitivity to new tasks with retaining past knowledge. Zeroth-order sharpness can bias optimization toward sharper minima, which may harm robustness in CL. The paper aims to promote flat minima tailored for CL to improve memory retention and learning efficiency.

Method: Introduce C-Flat, a flatness-promoting method with plug-and-play compatibility; present a general framework to integrate C-Flat into major CL paradigms; introduce C-Flat++, an efficient variant using selective flatness promotion to reduce update cost.

Result: Empirical results show that C-Flat consistently improves performance across a wide range of CL settings; extensive experiments across multiple CL methods, datasets, and scenarios; code is released at the provided URL.

Conclusion: C-Flat provides a general, effective framework for flatness-aware optimization in continual learning, improving performance and efficiency, with a scalable variant (C-Flat++) that reduces update cost while maintaining gains.

Abstract: Balancing sensitivity to new tasks and stability for retaining past knowledge
is crucial in continual learning (CL). Recently, sharpness-aware minimization
has proven effective in transfer learning and has also been adopted in
continual learning (CL) to improve memory retention and learning efficiency.
However, relying on zeroth-order sharpness alone may favor sharper minima over
flatter ones in certain settings, leading to less robust and potentially
suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{C}ontinual
\textbf{Flat}ness (\textbf{C-Flat}), a method that promotes flatter loss
landscapes tailored for CL. C-Flat offers plug-and-play compatibility, enabling
easy integration with minimal modifications to the code pipeline. Besides, we
present a general framework that integrates C-Flat into all major CL paradigms
and conduct comprehensive comparisons with loss-minima optimizers and
flat-minima-based CL methods. Our results show that C-Flat consistently
improves performance across a wide range of settings. In addition, we introduce
C-Flat++, an efficient yet effective framework that leverages selective
flatness-driven promotion, significantly reducing the update cost required by
C-Flat. Extensive experiments across multiple CL methods, datasets, and
scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/WanNaa/C-Flat.

TL;DR: A time-evolving DAG-based approach MOCHA discovers multi-order dynamic causality in temporal point processes, yielding state-of-the-art predictions and interpretable causal structures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static or first-order causal models miss multi-hop and time-varying dependencies in real-world event sequences; capturing these dynamics is essential for accurate prediction and interpretability.

Method: Introduce MOCHA: model causal influences as multi-hop paths on a latent time-evolving graph; enforce a time-varying directed acyclic graph with learnable weights; apply acyclicity and sparsity constraints; train end-to-end to jointly learn causality and TPP dynamics.

Result: Empirical evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art event prediction and produces meaningful, interpretable causal structures.

Conclusion: MOCHA offers a principled framework for discovering multi-order dynamic causality in temporal point processes, enhancing predictive performance while providing interpretable insights into evolving causal relationships.

Abstract: Discovering complex causal dependencies in temporal point processes (TPPs) is
critical for modeling real-world event sequences. Existing methods typically
rely on static or first-order causal structures, overlooking the multi-order
and time-varying nature of causal relationships. In this paper, we propose
MOCHA, a novel framework for discovering multi-order dynamic causality in TPPs.
MOCHA characterizes multi-order influences as multi-hop causal paths over a
latent time-evolving graph. To model such dynamics, we introduce a time-varying
directed acyclic graph (DAG) with learnable structural weights, where
acyclicity and sparsity constraints are enforced to ensure structural validity.
We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that jointly models causal
discovery and TPP dynamics, enabling accurate event prediction and revealing
interpretable structures. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that MOCHA not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in event
prediction, but also reveals meaningful and interpretable causal structures.

### [215] [HAEPO: History-Aggregated Exploratory Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18884)
*Gaurish Trivedi,Alakh Sharma,Kartikey Singh Bhandari,Dhruv Kumar,Pratik Narang,Jagat Sesh Challa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HAEPO introduces a history-aware exploratory loss that treats each trajectory via cumulative log-likelihoods and Plackett-Luce weighting to encourage broader exploration, with entropy and soft KL regularization for stability; it achieves fast convergence and robust performance, competitive with PPO, GRPO, and DPO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current exploration methods for long-horizon tasks either track full sequence log-likelihoods (DPO) or rely on per-token ratios (GRPO), which can limit exploration across long horizons. A history-aware approach that leverages full trajectory history can improve exploration while maintaining stability.

Method: Compute the cumulative log-likelihood of each trajectory (sum of log probabilities); apply a Plackett-Luce softmax over trajectories to obtain weights proportional to their returns; add entropy regularization to stabilize updates and a soft KL penalty relative to a frozen reference policy.

Result: Empirically, HAEPO converges quickly, explores thoroughly, aligns closely with true rewards, and demonstrates robust learning behavior across diverse tasks, better or on par with PPO, GRPO, and DPO.

Conclusion: HAEPO provides a stable and interpretable framework that explicitly leverages full-trajectory history to balance exploration and stability in policy optimization.

Abstract: Exploration is essential in modern learning, from reinforcement learning
environments with small neural policies to large language models (LLMs).
Existing work, such as DPO, leverages full sequence log-likelihoods to capture
an entire trajectory of the model's decisions, while methods like GRPO
aggregate per-token ratios into a trajectory-level update. However, both often
limit exploration on long-horizon tasks. We introduce History-Aggregated
Exploratory Policy Optimization (HAEPO), a history-aware exploratory loss to
combat these shortcomings. HAEPO compresses each trajectory into the sum of its
logarithmic probabilities (a cumulative logarithmic likelihood), and applies a
Plackett-Luce softmax across trajectories to obtain normalized weights
proportional to their returns, thus encouraging broader exploration. We add
entropy regularization to stabilize the aggressive updates to prevent premature
collapse and a soft KL penalty relative to a frozen copy of the previous
(reference) policy. Empirically, HAEPO converges fast, explores thoroughly,
aligns closely with true rewards, and demonstrates robust learning behavior
better or at par with PPO, GRPO, and DPO across diverse tasks. Thus, HAEPO
provides a stable and interpretable framework by explicitly leveraging
full-trajectory history while balancing exploration and stability.

*Aishwarya Venkataramanan,Joachim Denzler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DNP adds a global task-level latent and a distance-preserving local latent with bi-Lipschitz regularization to improve uncertainty estimates and OOD detection in Neural Processes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard Neural Processes rely on a single global latent and often miscalibrate uncertainty, failing to capture local data dependencies.

Method: Introduce a global latent for task-level variation and a local latent that encodes input similarity in a distance-preserving latent space; enforce bi-Lipschitz regularization to bound distortions and preserve relative distances.

Result: Empirical results show improved uncertainty calibration and predictive performance on regression and classification, with better discrimination between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.

Conclusion: DNP effectively combines global and distance-aware local latent structures to enhance uncertainty estimation and robustness, outperforming standard NPs on multiple tasks.

Abstract: We propose the Distance-informed Neural Process (DNP), a novel variant of
Neural Processes that improves uncertainty estimation by combining global and
distance-aware local latent structures. Standard Neural Processes (NPs) often
rely on a global latent variable and struggle with uncertainty calibration and
capturing local data dependencies. DNP addresses these limitations by
introducing a global latent variable to model task-level variations and a local
latent variable to capture input similarity within a distance-preserving latent
space. This is achieved through bi-Lipschitz regularization, which bounds
distortions in input relationships and encourages the preservation of relative
distances in the latent space. This modeling approach allows DNP to produce
better-calibrated uncertainty estimates and more effectively distinguish in-
from out-of-distribution data. Empirical results demonstrate that DNP achieves
strong predictive performance and improved uncertainty calibration across
regression and classification tasks.

*Madhusudan Verma,Manoj Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Generalization bounds for neural ODEs with nonlinear Lipschitz dynamics; proves bounded variation of solutions and derives bounds for both time-dependent and time-independent cases, analyzing overparameterization and domain constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill the gap in theoretical understanding of generalization for neural ODEs beyond linear dynamics and beyond fixed sampling assumptions; previous work either on linear dynamics or on bound depending on sampling intervals.

Method: Assume the ODE dynamics are Lipschitz in the state (time-dependent or time-independent). Prove that neural ODE trajectories have bounded variation. Use this to derive generalization bounds for both time-dependent and time-independent cases, and study how model overparameterization and domain constraints affect these bounds.

Result: Generalization bounds are established under the Lipschitz condition for nonlinear dynamic neural ODEs for both time-dependent and time-independent forms; the analysis reveals how Lipschitz constants and model capacity influence the bounds, and shows that solution trajectories have bounded variation.

Conclusion: Presents the first derivation of generalization bounds for neural ODEs with general nonlinear dynamics, extending the theoretical framework beyond linear dynamics and informing architectural choices related to capacity and domain constraints.

Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) are a popular type of
deep learning model that operate with continuous-depth architectures. To assess
how well such models perform on unseen data, it is crucial to understand their
generalization error bounds. Previous research primarily focused on the linear
case for the dynamics function in neural ODEs - Marion, P. (2023), or provided
bounds for Neural Controlled ODEs that depend on the sampling interval
Bleistein et al. (2023). In this work, we analyze a broader class of neural
ODEs where the dynamics function is a general nonlinear function, either time
dependent or time independent, and is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the
state variables. We showed that under this Lipschitz condition, the solutions
to neural ODEs have solutions with bounded variations. Based on this
observation, we establish generalization bounds for both time-dependent and
time-independent cases and investigate how overparameterization and domain
constraints influence these bounds. To our knowledge, this is the first
derivation of generalization bounds for neural ODEs with general nonlinear
dynamics.

*Wenyin Zhou,Christopher Iliffe Sprague,Vsevolod Viliuga,Matteo Tadiello,Arne Elofsson,Hossein Azizpour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A flow-matching, energy-based approach is proposed for molecular structure generation, training a deep mapping that iteratively transforms random configurations into target molecular conformations, achieving simple yet effective models with strong empirical results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve training stability and inference efficiency in molecular structure generation by leveraging an energy-based view of flow matching, enabling a direct, iterative mapping from noise to data without resorting to complex reverse-diffusion procedures.

Method: Develop a deep neural mapping function that, under an energy-based formulation, iteratively maps samples from a source distribution to the data manifold of molecular structures. This flow-matching approach is connected to idempotency and stability and is related to structure refinement ideas used in AlphaFold. The method emphasizes simplicity and empirical effectiveness within an energy-based framework.

Result: The proposed method outperforms recent baselines in task-specific flow matching and diffusion-model approaches on protein docking and protein backbone generation, using a similar computational budget.

Conclusion: An energy-based flow-matching perspective yields a conceptually simple, theoretically justified, and empirically strong framework for molecular structure generation, with practical benefits demonstrated in docking and backbone design and potential links to established refinement techniques like AlphaFold.

Abstract: Molecular structure generation is a fundamental problem that involves
determining the 3D positions of molecules' constituents. It has crucial
biological applications, such as molecular docking, protein folding, and
molecular design. Recent advances in generative modeling, such as diffusion
models and flow matching, have made great progress on these tasks by modeling
molecular conformations as a distribution. In this work, we focus on flow
matching and adopt an energy-based perspective to improve training and
inference of structure generation models. Our view results in a mapping
function, represented by a deep network, that is directly learned to
\textit{iteratively} map random configurations, i.e. samples from the source
distribution, to target structures, i.e. points in the data manifold. This
yields a conceptually simple and empirically effective flow matching setup that
is theoretically justified and has interesting connections to fundamental
properties such as idempotency and stability, as well as the empirically useful
techniques such as structure refinement in AlphaFold. Experiments on protein
docking as well as protein backbone generation consistently demonstrate the
method's effectiveness, where it outperforms recent baselines of
task-associated flow matching and diffusion models, using a similar
computational budget.

### [222] [Estimating Conditional Covariance between labels for Multilabel Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18951)
*Laurence A. F. Park,Jesse Read*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Compared three models (Multivariate Probit, Multivariate Bernoulli, Staged Logit) for estimating constant and dependent multilabel conditional covariance; all models detect dependent covariance when present but can falsely detect it when only constant covariance exists. Multivariate Probit had the lowest error rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how well different models capture constant vs. dependent conditional label covariance in multilabel data, given that label independence cannot be directly measured due to covariates.

Method: An experimental comparison of three models (Multivariate Probit, Multivariate Bernoulli, Staged Logit) to estimate constant and dependent conditional label covariance, observing each model's measurements.

Result: All models measured constant and dependent covariance with accuracy depending on the covariance strength; all models falsely indicated dependent covariance when only constant covariance was present; Multivariate Probit exhibited the lowest error rate.

Conclusion: Among the three models, Multivariate Probit is the preferable choice for estimating conditional covariance in this setting, though none are free from false positives; results caution against over-interpreting detected dependency without considering covariance strength and model selection.

Abstract: Multilabel data should be analysed for label dependence before applying
multilabel models. Independence between multilabel data labels cannot be
measured directly from the label values due to their dependence on the set of
covariates $\vec{x}$, but can be measured by examining the conditional label
covariance using a multivariate Probit model. Unfortunately, the multivariate
Probit model provides an estimate of its copula covariance, and so might not be
reliable in estimating constant covariance and dependent covariance. In this
article, we compare three models (Multivariate Probit, Multivariate Bernoulli
and Staged Logit) for estimating the constant and dependent multilabel
conditional label covariance. We provide an experiment that allows us to
observe each model's measurement of conditional covariance. We found that all
models measure constant and dependent covariance equally well, depending on the
strength of the covariance, but the models all falsely detect that dependent
covariance is present for data where constant covariance is present. Of the
three models, the Multivariate Probit model had the lowest error rate.

*Kyriakos Hjikakou,Juan Diego Cardenas Cartagena,Matthia Sabatelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Koopman embeddings learned via a three-stage pipeline show transferable, reusable dynamical structure across prediction and control tasks for chaotic systems, outperforming PCA baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether Koopman-based representations generalize across tasks in chaotic dynamics and can serve as a foundation for multi-task physics-informed machine learning.

Method: Lorenz system as testbed; three-stage pipeline: (1) learn Koopman embeddings via autoencoding, (2) pre-train a Transformer on next-state prediction, (3) fine-tune for safety-critical control; compare against standard and physics-informed PCA baselines; examine effect of freezing pre-trained weights.

Result: Koopman embeddings outperform PCA baselines with accurate, data-efficient performance. Freezing the pre-trained transformer during fine-tuning causes no performance degradation, indicating the learned representations capture reusable dynamical structure rather than task-specific patterns.

Conclusion: Supports using Koopman embeddings as a foundation for multi-task learning in physics-informed machine learning; provides evidence of transferable, reusable dynamical structure across tasks; project page available at the linked URL.

Abstract: This paper investigates the generalisability of Koopman-based representations
for chaotic dynamical systems, focusing on their transferability across
prediction and control tasks. Using the Lorenz system as a testbed, we propose
a three-stage methodology: learning Koopman embeddings through autoencoding,
pre-training a transformer on next-state prediction, and fine-tuning for
safety-critical control. Our results show that Koopman embeddings outperform
both standard and physics-informed PCA baselines, achieving accurate and
data-efficient performance. Notably, fixing the pre-trained transformer weights
during fine-tuning leads to no performance degradation, indicating that the
learned representations capture reusable dynamical structure rather than
task-specific patterns. These findings support the use of Koopman embeddings as
a foundation for multi-task learning in physics-informed machine learning. A

### [224] [PAX-TS: Model-agnostic multi-granular explanations for time series forecasting via localized perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18982)
*Tim Kreuzer,Jelena Zdravkovic,Panagiotis Papapetrou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PAX-TS provides model-agnostic post-hoc explanations for time series forecasting via localized input perturbations, yielding multi-granular explanations and cross-channel insights across multiple datasets and algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern forecasting models are opaque and lack explanations, and existing post-hoc methods (e.g., LIME) are not well-suited for forecasting. There is a need for interpretable, multi-resolution explanations that handle multivariate time series and cross-channel relationships.

Method: PAX-TS is a model-agnostic, post-hoc explainer that uses localized input perturbations to generate explanations at multiple granularities. It can characterize cross-channel correlations in multivariate forecasts, outlines an explicit algorithmic procedure, and is evaluated on a benchmark of 7 forecasting algorithms and 10 datasets, compared against two state-of-the-art explainer methods, with analysis of different explanation types and patterns.

Result: Explanations produced by PAX-TS effectively reflect model behavior. High- and low-performing models yield different explanations on the same datasets. Time-step correlation matrices reveal 6 recurring pattern classes across datasets and algorithms, and these patterns correlate with forecasting error. A multivariate example demonstrates how cross-channel correlations influence forecasts.

Conclusion: PAX-TS enables illustrating forecasting models’ mechanisms at multiple levels of detail, answering practical questions about forecasts, and offers actionable insights into cross-channel effects and model behavior not easily captured by existing explainability tools.

Abstract: Time series forecasting has seen considerable improvement during the last
years, with transformer models and large language models driving advancements
of the state of the art. Modern forecasting models are generally opaque and do
not provide explanations for their forecasts, while well-known post-hoc
explainability methods like LIME are not suitable for the forecasting context.
We propose PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series
forecasting models and their forecasts. Our method is based on localized input
perturbations and results in multi-granular explanations. Further, it is able
to characterize cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series
forecasts. We clearly outline the algorithmic procedure behind PAX-TS,
demonstrate it on a benchmark with 7 algorithms and 10 diverse datasets,
compare it with two other state-of-the-art explanation algorithms, and present
the different explanation types of the method. We found that the explanations
of high-performing and low-performing algorithms differ on the same datasets,
highlighting that the explanations of PAX-TS effectively capture a model's
behavior. Based on time step correlation matrices resulting from the benchmark,
we identify 6 classes of patterns that repeatedly occur across different
datasets and algorithms. We found that the patterns are indicators of
performance, with noticeable differences in forecasting error between the
classes. Lastly, we outline a multivariate example where PAX-TS demonstrates
how the forecasting model takes cross-channel correlations into account. With
PAX-TS, time series forecasting models' mechanisms can be illustrated in
different levels of detail, and its explanations can be used to answer
practical questions on forecasts.

*Md Anwar Hossen,Fatema Siddika,Wensheng Zhang,Anuj Sharma,Ali Jannesari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedProtoKD tackles prototype margin shrinking in heterogeneous federated learning by introducing a trainable, contrastive-server prototype with adaptive class margins and dual knowledge distillation (logits and prototype features), plus assessment of public sample importance. It yields consistent accuracy gains over state-of-the-art HFL methods, up to 34.13%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In heterogeneous federated learning (HFL), clients have different models and non-IID data. Prototype-based HFL shares class prototypes to preserve privacy, but server aggregation via weighted averaging shrinks prototypes, degrading global knowledge especially under extreme non-IID conditions. There is a need for a method that preserves prototype diversity and enhances global knowledge while remaining privacy-preserving.

Method: Introduce FedProtoKD: a heterogeneous FL framework that uses an enhanced dual-knowledge distillation mechanism leveraging both client logits and prototype feature representations. Address prototype margin shrinking with a contrastive learning-based, trainable server prototype and a class-wise adaptive prototype margin. Also evaluate the role of public samples by measuring the closeness between a sample's prototype and its class prototypes to guide learning.

Result: Empirical results show average accuracy improvements ranging from 1.13% to 34.13% across various settings, with FedProtoKD significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art HFL methods.

Conclusion: FedProtoKD effectively mitigates prototype margin shrinking in HFL with heterogeneous models and highly non-IID data by combining adaptive, class-wise prototype margins, dual knowledge distillation, and prototype-analysis of public samples. This yields substantial accuracy gains and strengthens privacy-preserving prototype-based FL.

Abstract: Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HFL) has gained attention for its ability
to accommodate diverse models and heterogeneous data across clients.
Prototype-based HFL methods emerge as a promising solution to address
statistical heterogeneity and privacy challenges, paving the way for new
advancements in HFL research. This method focuses on sharing only
class-representative prototypes among heterogeneous clients. However, these
prototypes are often aggregated on the server using weighted averaging, leading
to sub-optimal global knowledge; these cause the shrinking of aggregated
prototypes, which negatively affects the model performance in scenarios when
models are heterogeneous and data distributions are extremely non-IID. We
propose FedProtoKD in a Heterogeneous Federated Learning setting, using an
enhanced dual-knowledge distillation mechanism to improve the system
performance with clients' logits and prototype feature representation. We aim
to resolve the prototype margin-shrinking problem using a contrastive
learning-based trainable server prototype by leveraging a class-wise adaptive
prototype margin. Furthermore, we assess the importance of public samples using
the closeness of the sample's prototype to its class representative prototypes,
which enhances learning performance. FedProtoKD achieved average improvements
of 1.13% up to 34.13% accuracy across various settings and significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art HFL methods.

*Gary Simethy,Daniel Ortiz-Arroyo,Petar Durdevic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reframes imputation as learning system dynamics with diffusion models and causal bias, yielding superior performance for long gaps and dynamically plausible trajectories in industrial time series.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial time series are non-stationary, driven by control actions, and often have long missing blocks. Traditional window-based imputation assumes fixed-time patterns and struggles with such dynamics.

Method: A conditional denoising diffusion model (STDiff) with a causal bias aligned to control theory. It imputes step-by-step using the most recent observed state and relevant controls/environmental inputs, enabling dynamics-aware predictions.

Result: On a simulated-block wastewater dataset: STDiff achieves the lowest imputation errors, especially as gap length increases. On a real industrial dataset with large gaps, it produces dynamically plausible trajectories, unlike window-based methods that flatten/smooth. Demonstrates robustness and potential generalization with trade-offs.

Conclusion: Dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation is a robust approach for industrial time series. STDiff provides improved accuracy and temporal plausibility, with discussion of computational costs and extensions to broader domains.

Abstract: Most deep learning methods for imputing missing values treat the task as
completing patterns within a fixed time window. This assumption often fails in
industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly
non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff,
which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to
the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal
bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on
the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a
public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff
consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for
longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it
produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to
window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support
dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for
industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions
to broader domains.

### [227] [Learning with springs and sticks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19015)
*Luis Mantilla Calderón,Alán Aspuru-Guzik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-inspired learning model using a spring-and-stick dynamical system to approximate any continuous function via piecewise-linear representation, where springs encode a mean-squared-error loss and dissipation drives the system to a minimum-energy configuration. Empirically competitive with MLPs for regression, with a thermodynamic perspective that links free-energy changes to learning ability and reveals a learning barrier due to environmental fluctuations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand learning as a physical process by modeling it as a dissipative mechanical system, and to explore how energy landscapes and thermodynamics constrain learning performance and distribution fitting.

Method: Construct a simple dynamical system of springs and sticks capable of piecewise-linear approximation, encode the loss in the potential energy of springs, and allow dissipation to drive the system toward minimum-energy configurations. Evaluate on regression tasks and study thermodynamic properties (free energy changes, fluctuations) to identify any barriers to learning.

Result: The system achieves regression performance comparable to multi-layer perceptrons. There is a discovered relation between the system’s free-energy change and its ability to learn the underlying data distribution. Empirically, a thermodynamic learning barrier is observed due to environmental fluctuations, limiting learning when free-energy changes encounter the barrier.

Conclusion: A minimal physical model offers insights into learning as energy minimization under dissipation and reveals thermodynamic limits (barriers) imposed by environmental noise, contributing to a physical understanding of learning dynamics and potential pathways to neuromorphic implementations.

Abstract: Learning is a physical process. Here, we aim to study a simple dynamical
system composed of springs and sticks capable of arbitrarily approximating any
continuous function. The main idea of our work is to use the sticks to mimic a
piecewise-linear approximation of the given function, use the potential energy
of springs to encode a desired mean squared error loss function, and converge
to a minimum-energy configuration via dissipation. We apply the proposed
simulation system to regression tasks and show that its performance is
comparable to that of multi-layer perceptrons. In addition, we study the
thermodynamic properties of the system and find a relation between the free
energy change of the system and its ability to learn an underlying data
distribution. We empirically find a \emph{thermodynamic learning barrier} for
the system caused by the fluctuations of the environment, whereby the system
cannot learn if its change in free energy hits such a barrier. We believe this
simple model can help us better understand learning systems from a physical
point of view.

Method: Empirical evaluation of four prediction models (including LightGBM, Transformer, Random Forest, etc.) and three encoding strategies (e.g., 2-gram transitions, 2-gram plus repetition features) across four real-life datasets, comparing against a baseline to identify best-performing combinations.

Result: LightGBM and Transformer achieve the best performance with a 2-gram transition encoding; Random Forest benefits most from combining 2-gram transitions with activity repetition features; this combined encoding attains the highest average accuracy across datasets.

Conclusion: Resource-centric next-activity prediction is promising for smarter resource allocation and workforce planning, revealing new research directions in PPM and the value of incorporating resource information into activity forecasting.

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) aims to train models that forecast
upcoming events in process executions. These predictions support early
bottleneck detection, improved scheduling, proactive interventions, and timely
communication with stakeholders. While existing research adopts a control-flow
perspective, we investigate next-activity prediction from a resource-centric
viewpoint, which offers additional benefits such as improved work organization,
workload balancing, and capacity forecasting. Although resource information has
been shown to enhance tasks such as process performance analysis, its role in
next-activity prediction remains unexplored. In this study, we evaluate four
prediction models and three encoding strategies across four real-life datasets.
Compared to the baseline, our results show that LightGBM and Transformer models
perform best with an encoding based on 2-gram activity transitions, while
Random Forest benefits most from an encoding that combines 2-gram transitions
and activity repetition features. This combined encoding also achieves the
highest average accuracy. This resource-centric approach could enable smarter
resource allocation, strategic workforce planning, and personalized employee
support by analyzing individual behavior rather than case-level progression.
The findings underscore the potential of resource-centric next-activity
prediction, opening up new venues for research on PPM.

### [229] [Metric Matters: A Formal Evaluation of Similarity Measures in Active Learning for Cyber Threat Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19019)
*Sidahmed Benabderrahmane,Talal Rahwan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Active-learning anomaly detection for APTs using similarity search and an Attention-Based Autoencoder; similarity metric choice crucial for convergence, accuracy, and label efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: APTs are stealthy and datasets are severely imbalanced; need robust detection with minimal labeling; but sample selection and ranking depend on similarity measures.

Method: An active learning framework that uses similarity search to iteratively refine the decision space; built on an Attention-Based Autoencoder; employs feature-space similarity to separate normal-like and anomaly-like instances; formally evaluates multiple similarity measures for sample selection and anomaly ranking; tests on DARPA APT traces and other datasets.

Result: Similarity metrics significantly influence model convergence, anomaly detection accuracy, and labeling efficiency; provides actionable guidance on choosing similarity functions in active-learning cyber defense pipelines.

Conclusion: Careful selection of similarity metrics is critical for effective active-learning anomaly detection in threat intelligence; the proposed framework offers robust, minimally supervised detection and practical insights for cyber defense practitioners.

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a severe challenge to cyber defense
due to their stealthy behavior and the extreme class imbalance inherent in
detection datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel active
learning-based anomaly detection framework that leverages similarity search to
iteratively refine the decision space. Built upon an Attention-Based
Autoencoder, our approach uses feature-space similarity to identify normal-like
and anomaly-like instances, thereby enhancing model robustness with minimal
oracle supervision. Crucially, we perform a formal evaluation of various
similarity measures to understand their influence on sample selection and
anomaly ranking effectiveness. Through experiments on diverse datasets,
including DARPA Transparent Computing APT traces, we demonstrate that the
choice of similarity metric significantly impacts model convergence, anomaly
detection accuracy, and label efficiency. Our results offer actionable insights
for selecting similarity functions in active learning pipelines tailored for
threat intelligence and cyber defense.

### [230] [GRADSTOP: Early Stopping of Gradient Descent via Posterior Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19028)
*Arash Jamshidi,Lauri Seppäläinen,Katsiaryna Haitsiukevich,Hoang Phuc Hau Luu,Anton Björklund,Kai Puolamäki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GradStop is a gradient-based, stochastic early stopping method that uses gradient information to approximate a Bayesian posterior and stop training without a hold-out validation set, improving data efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard early stopping relies on a validation set, reducing training data and potentially harming performance in data-limited settings. GradStop aims to exploit gradient information produced during training to decide when to stop, preserving full training data.

Method: Estimate a Bayesian posterior from gradient information gathered during gradient descent. Define early stopping as drawing samples from this posterior and use the approximated posterior to form a stopping criterion, allowing ongoing training without a separate validation set.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows GradStop yields small test loss and compares favorably to validation-set-based stopping. It is especially advantageous in data-limited scenarios and can be added with minimal computational overhead; source code is available.

Conclusion: GradStop enables effective early stopping without a held-out set by leveraging gradient information, improving data efficiency and applicability to transfer learning, with easy integration into existing gradient-descent libraries.

Abstract: Machine learning models are often learned by minimising a loss function on
the training data using a gradient descent algorithm. These models often suffer
from overfitting, leading to a decline in predictive performance on unseen
data. A standard solution is early stopping using a hold-out validation set,
which halts the minimisation when the validation loss stops decreasing.
However, this hold-out set reduces the data available for training. This paper
presents {\sc gradstop}, a novel stochastic early stopping method that only
uses information in the gradients, which are produced by the gradient descent
algorithm ``for free.'' Our main contributions are that we estimate the
Bayesian posterior by the gradient information, define the early stopping
problem as drawing sample from this posterior, and use the approximated
posterior to obtain a stopping criterion. Our empirical evaluation shows that
{\sc gradstop} achieves a small loss on test data and compares favourably to a
validation-set-based stopping criterion. By leveraging the entire dataset for
training, our method is particularly advantageous in data-limited settings,
such as transfer learning. It can be incorporated as an optional feature in
gradient descent libraries with only a small computational overhead. The source
code is available at https://github.com/edahelsinki/gradstop.

### [231] [When recalling in-context, Transformers are not SSMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19029)
*Destiny Okpekpe,Antonio Orvieto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Learning-rate stability is crucial for modern recurrent models on associative recall; scaling behavior differs between recurrent/SSM and transformer architectures; 1-layer transformers exhibit induction-head-like dynamics; architectural components strongly influence Transformer and Mamba performance and optimization stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why state-space/recurring models may underperform transformers on reasoning/memorization benchmarks like associative recall (AR) and to dissect how scaling, optimization, and token-mixing strategies affect performance.

Method: Systematic empirical analysis across models (SSMs/recurrent, Transformers, Mamba) on AR. Vary learning rate, width vs. depth scaling, and perform 1-layer transformer experiments and architectural ablations to assess effects on AR performance and training stability.

Result: Learning rate critically affects recurrent model performance and may explain inconsistencies in prior work. Attention-based models show different scaling behavior and struggle with AR when limited to a single layer, while recurrent models scale differently with width/depth. 1-layer transformers display training dynamics reminiscent of induction heads (previously observed in deeper models). Architectural ablations reveal how components influence Transformer and Mamba performance and optimization stability.

Conclusion: Optimization and architectural choices strongly shape AR performance. The findings underscore the need for robust training stabilization for recurrent models, reveal distinct scaling profiles between SSMs and transformers, and highlight how simple architectural components can impact training stability and overall performance in AR tasks.

Abstract: Despite the advantageous subquadratic complexity of modern recurrent deep
learning models -- such as state-space models (SSMs) -- recent studies have
highlighted their potential shortcomings compared to transformers on reasoning
and memorization tasks. In this paper, we dive deeper into one of such
benchmarks: associative recall (AR), which has been shown to correlate well
with language modeling performance, and inspect in detail the effects of
scaling and optimization issues in recently proposed token mixing strategies.
We first demonstrate that, unlike standard transformers, the choice of learning
rate plays a critical role in the performance of modern recurrent models: an
issue that can severely affect reported performance in previous works and
suggests further research is needed to stabilize training. Next, we show that
recurrent and attention-based models exhibit contrasting benefits when scaling
in width as opposed to depth, with attention being notably unable to solve AR
when limited to a single layer. We then further inspect 1-layer transformers,
revealing that despite their poor performance, their training dynamics
surprisingly resemble the formation of induction heads, a phenomenon previously
observed only in their 2-layer counterparts. Finally, through architectural
ablations, we study how components affects Transformer and Mamba's performance
and optimization stability.

### [232] [Breaking the Black Box: Inherently Interpretable Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Imbalanced Seismic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19031)
*Vemula Sreenath,Filippo Gatti,Pierre Jehel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A transparent, HazBinLoss–driven ML approach for ground motion modeling (GMMs) that preserves interpretability by summing input term contributions and addressing data imbalance, achieving performance comparable to traditional GMMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome two limitations of standard ML-based GMMs: lack of interpretability (black-box models) and severe data imbalance between near-field large-magnitude events and distant, smaller ones, which can bias predictions.

Method: Process each input term separately and sum linearly to produce the output, ensuring exact contribution of each term. Train with HazBinLoss, which increases weights for near-field, large-magnitude records and decreases weights for distant, smaller events to prevent underprediction of the most damaging scenarios.

Result: The model captures known seismological principles, achieves performance comparable to established GMMs, and provides transparent term-level contributions suitable for risk assessment and disaster planning.

Conclusion: This transparent HazBinLoss-based framework facilitates broader adoption of ML-based GMMs for seismic risk assessment and disaster planning by delivering interpretable predictions and bias-aware training.

Abstract: Ground motion models (GMMs) predict how strongly the ground will shake during
an earthquake. They are essential for structural analysis, seismic design, and
seismic risk assessment studies. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches
are popular to develop GMMs, due to large earthquake databases worldwide.
However, they operate as "black boxes," which are hard to interpret and trust,
limiting their use in high-stake decisions. Additionally, these databases
suffer from significant data imbalances: fewer large, critically damaging
records near the fault compared to abundant, less severely damaging distant
records. These two limitations are addressed in this work by developing a
transparent ML architecture using the HazBinLoss function. Each input (e.g.,
magnitude, distance, their interaction term, etc.) is processed separately and
added linearly to obtain the output, resulting in exact contribution of each
term. The HazBinLoss function assigns higher weights to critical near-field
large magnitude records and lower weights to less-critical far-field smaller
magnitude records, during training to prevent underprediction of the most
damaging scenarios. Our model captures known seismological principles and
achieves comparable performance with established GMMs while maintaining
transparency. This framework enables broader adoption of ML-based approaches
for risk assessment studies and disaster planning.

### [233] [Automated discovery of finite volume schemes using Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19052)
*Paul Garnier,Jonathan Viquerat,Elie Hachem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GNNs can extrapolate beyond training to generate numerical schemes, rediscovering and discovering FV-type discretizations for the heat equation, using both supervised and unsupervised (PINN-like) losses, and extending to higher-order schemes via 2-hop/2-layer GNNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether GNNs can do more than function approximation and actively contribute to numerical method design by extrapolating from simple training graphs to complex discretizations, and by recovering analytical schemes through symbolic regression.

Method: Train GNNs on a dataset consisting only of two-node graphs to approximate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat equation. Evaluate extrapolation on unstructured meshes; quantify error and relate it to training loss. Use symbolic regression to extract the analytical FV formula. Also apply a residual/PINN-like loss without ground-truth data to recover the FV scheme. Extend with (i) a 2-hop GNN and (ii) a 2-layer GNN trained with the same PINN loss to autonomously discover a second-order correction (with a 2-hop stencil) and the classic second-order midpoint scheme.

Result: The trained GNN achieves an O(epsilon) error with respect to the FV scheme when the training loss is epsilon on two-node graphs, effectively implementing the FV scheme. Symbolic regression recovers the exact FV formulation. In the unsupervised PINN setting, the GNN recovers the FV scheme without ground-truth data. The higher-order experiments yield a second-order correction term via a 2-hop stencil and the classic second-order midpoint scheme, demonstrating automatic discovery of higher-order numerical methods.

Conclusion: GNNs are not only powerful approximators but can actively contribute to developing numerical methods, including rediscovering classical schemes and discovering higher-order accuracy strategies, especially when combined with symbolic regression or PINN-like losses.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have deeply modified the landscape of numerical
simulations by demonstrating strong capabilities in approximating solutions of
physical systems. However, their ability to extrapolate beyond their training
domain (\textit{e.g.} larger or structurally different graphs) remains
uncertain. In this work, we establish that GNNs can serve purposes beyond their
traditional role, and be exploited to generate numerical schemes, in
conjunction with symbolic regression. First, we show numerically and
theoretically that a GNN trained on a dataset consisting solely of two-node
graphs can extrapolate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat
equation on out-of-distribution, unstructured meshes. Specifically, if a GNN
achieves a loss $\varepsilon$ on such a dataset, it implements the FV scheme
with an error of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$. Using symbolic regression, we show
that the network effectively rediscovers the exact analytical formulation of
the standard first-order FV scheme. We then extend this approach to an
unsupervised context: the GNN recovers the first-order FV scheme using only a
residual loss similar to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with no
access to ground-truth data. Finally, we push the methodology further by
considering higher-order schemes: we train (i) a 2-hop and (ii) a 2-layers GNN
using the same PINN loss, that autonomously discover (i) a second-order
correction term to the initial scheme using a 2-hop stencil, and (ii) the
classic second-order midpoint scheme. These findings follows a recent paradigm
in scientific computing: GNNs are not only strong approximators, but can be
active contributors to the development of novel numerical methods.

### [234] [Tackling Federated Unlearning as a Parameter Estimation Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19065)
*Antonio Balordi,Lorenzo Manini,Fabio Stella,Alessio Merlo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Hessian-based, model-agnostic Federated Unlearning framework erases data traces by selectively resetting the most sensitive parameters, enabling minimal retraining while preserving performance and providing backdoor defense.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy regulations require erasing data from models, which is particularly hard in Federated Learning where client data remains on-device and full retraining is often infeasible.

Method: Treats leakage as a parameter-estimation problem using second-order Hessian information to identify sensitive parameters; selectively resets these parameters for forgotten data, followed by minimal federated retraining; model-agnostic and does not require server access to raw client data after initial aggregation; supports categoricals and client unlearning.

Result: Demonstrates strong privacy (MIA near random, categorical knowledge erased) and high utility (normalized accuracy ~0.9 of retrained benchmarks); more efficient than full retraining; effective at neutralizing a targeted backdoor attack.

Conclusion: Provides a practical, efficient, model-agnostic solution for data forgetting in Federated Learning that preserves performance, enhances privacy, and resists backdoor manipulation.

Abstract: Privacy regulations require the erasure of data from deep learning models.
This is a significant challenge that is amplified in Federated Learning, where
data remains on clients, making full retraining or coordinated updates often
infeasible. This work introduces an efficient Federated Unlearning framework
based on information theory, modeling leakage as a parameter estimation
problem. Our method uses second-order Hessian information to identify and
selectively reset only the parameters most sensitive to the data being
forgotten, followed by minimal federated retraining. This model-agnostic
approach supports categorical and client unlearning without requiring server
access to raw client data after initial information aggregation. Evaluations on
benchmark datasets demonstrate strong privacy (MIA success near random,
categorical knowledge erased) and high performance (Normalized Accuracy against
re-trained benchmarks of $\approx$ 0.9), while aiming for increased efficiency
over complete retraining. Furthermore, in a targeted backdoor attack scenario,
our framework effectively neutralizes the malicious trigger, restoring model
integrity. This offers a practical solution for data forgetting in FL.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRIGON learns to select triangles from multiple views to build enriched, non-planar triangulations, rewiring graphs to improve propagation and achieve state-of-the-art node classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome oversquashing and oversmoothing in GNNs by modifying topology through learnable rewiring, using triangulations to enhance information flow.

Method: Jointly learns triangle selection and downstream classification, producing a rewired graph with reduced diameter, larger spectral gap, and lower effective resistance.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art rewiring methods on node classification across homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks; demonstrates improved structural properties.

Conclusion: Learning topology via enriched triangulations is effective for boosting GNN performance; TRIGON demonstrates the viability of data-driven graph rewiring to mitigate topology-induced limitations.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the leading paradigm for
learning over graph-structured data. However, their performance is limited by
issues inherent to graph topology, most notably oversquashing and
oversmoothing. Recent advances in graph rewiring aim to mitigate these
limitations by modifying the graph topology to promote more effective
information propagation. In this work, we introduce TRIGON, a novel framework
that constructs enriched, non-planar triangulations by learning to select
relevant triangles from multiple graph views. By jointly optimizing triangle
selection and downstream classification performance, our method produces a
rewired graph with markedly improved structural properties such as reduced
diameter, increased spectral gap, and lower effective resistance compared to
existing rewiring methods. Empirical results demonstrate that TRIGON
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on node classification tasks across a
range of homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks.

### [236] [APT-LLM: Exploiting Arbitrary-Precision Tensor Core Computing for LLM Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19087)
*Shaobo Ma,Chao Fang,Haikuo Shao,Zhongfeng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: APT-LLM proposes a full-stack, arbitrary-precision LLM acceleration framework and reports substantial speedups over FP16 and INT4 baselines across multiple GPUs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs demand massive compute; ultra-low-bit quantization and arbitrary precision offer efficiency but current GPU/Kernel limitations (Tensor Cores support, memory management, kernel optimization) hinder real-time deployment. The work aims to enable efficient, arbitrary-precision LLM inference on GPUs.

Method: Introduce bipolar-INT data format for lossless signed-INT conversions and parallel-friendly computation; develop a bit-level MatMul that dismantles and reassembles matrices to support arbitrary precision; implement a memory management system leveraging fast shared memory to reduce latency; implement a dynamic kernel mapping method to auto-tune hyperparameters across varying matrix sizes and precisions.

Result: In LLM inference, APT-LLM achieves up to 3.99x speedup vs FP16 baselines and 2.16x vs CUTLASS INT4 on RTX 3090; on RTX 4090 and H800 it achieves up to 2.44x speedup vs FP16 and 1.65x vs CUTLASS integer baselines.

Conclusion: APT-LLM provides a comprehensive, GPU-oriented acceleration strategy for arbitrary-precision LLMs, delivering substantial performance gains and broad hardware applicability through a novel data format, bit-level MatMul, memory optimization, and adaptive kernel tuning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their
enormous computational demands severely limit deployment and real-time
performance. Quantization methods can help reduce computational costs, however,
attaining the extreme efficiency associated with ultra-low-bit quantized LLMs
at arbitrary precision presents challenges on GPUs. This is primarily due to
the limited support for GPU Tensor Cores, inefficient memory management, and
inflexible kernel optimizations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
comprehensive acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLMs, namely APT-LLM.
Firstly, we introduce a novel data format, bipolar-INT, which allows for
efficient and lossless conversion with signed INT, while also being more
conducive to parallel computation. We also develop a matrix multiplication
(MatMul) method allowing for arbitrary precision by dismantling and
reassembling matrices at the bit level. This method provides flexible precision
and optimizes the utilization of GPU Tensor Cores. In addition, we propose a
memory management system focused on data recovery, which strategically employs
fast shared memory to substantially increase kernel execution speed and reduce
memory access latency. Finally, we develop a kernel mapping method that
dynamically selects the optimal configurable hyperparameters of kernels for
varying matrix sizes, enabling optimal performance across different LLM
architectures and precision settings. In LLM inference, APT-LLM achieves up to
a 3.99$\times$ speedup compared to FP16 baselines and a 2.16$\times$ speedup
over NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4 acceleration on RTX 3090. On RTX 4090 and H800,
APT-LLM achieves up to 2.44$\times$ speedup over FP16 and 1.65$\times$ speedup
over CUTLASS integer baselines.

### [237] [Composition and Alignment of Diffusion Models using Constrained Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19104)
*Shervin Khalafi,Ignacio Hounie,Dongsheng Ding,Alejandro Ribeiro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified constrained optimization framework for diffusion model alignment and composition, using Lagrangian primal-dual training to enforce reward constraints and preserve proximity to pre-trained models, with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation in image generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trade-offs in aligning and composing diffusion models can lead to samples that violate some desired properties. There is a need for a principled method that guarantees satisfaction of multiple rewards or closeness to existing models.

Method: Formulate alignment and composition as constrained optimization problems, derive theoretical characterizations of their solutions, and solve via a Lagrangian-based primal-dual training algorithm. Empirically validate on image generation and compare to equally-weighted baselines.

Result: The proposed approach yields aligned or composed models that satisfy constraints effectively and outperform equally-weighted approaches in experiments.

Conclusion: A principled, theoretically grounded framework unifies alignment and composition of diffusion models under reward constraints, providing guarantees and practical algorithms along with open-source code.

Abstract: Diffusion models have become prevalent in generative modeling due to their
ability to sample from complex distributions. To improve the quality of
generated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly
used methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves fine-tuning a diffusion model
to align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several
pre-trained diffusion models, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the
generated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple
rewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing
properties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model
faithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this
gap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and
composition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies
reward constraints and/or remains close to (potentially multiple) pre-trained
models. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the
constrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based
primal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we
demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image
generation, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned
or composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the
equally-weighted approach. Our implementation can be found at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a framework that combines probabilistic crowd modeling and active learning to make preference-based RL robust to noisy, multi-annotator feedback, extending Advise to multiple trainers with online reliability estimation and entropy-based query selection; evaluated on 2D games and a Type 1 Diabetes glucose control task, showing faster learning and superior performance on the diabetes task.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward specification is difficult and human input is costly and often noisy; there is a need to handle multi-annotator feedback and prioritize informative queries to improve data efficiency in preference-based RL.

Method: Extend Advise to support multiple trainers with online reliability estimation; employ probabilistic crowd modelling to handle noisy annotations; use entropy-based query selection and active learning to request feedback on the most informative agent actions; evaluate on Taxi, Pacman, Frozen Lake, and UVA/Padova Type 1 Diabetes simulator.

Result: Preliminary results show faster learning when feedback is provided on uncertain trajectories across most tasks; the approach outperforms baselines on the diabetes blood glucose control task.

Conclusion: Combining probabilistic crowd modelling with active learning and multi-trainer reliability estimation improves data efficiency and robustness of preference-based RL in settings with noisy human feedback, demonstrated across gaming benchmarks and a healthcare simulator.

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning has gained prominence as a strategy
for training agents in environments where the reward signal is difficult to
specify or misaligned with human intent. However, its effectiveness is often
limited by the high cost and low availability of reliable human input,
especially in domains where expert feedback is scarce or errors are costly. To
address this, we propose a novel framework that combines two complementary
strategies: probabilistic crowd modelling to handle noisy, multi-annotator
feedback, and active learning to prioritize feedback on the most informative
agent actions. We extend the Advise algorithm to support multiple trainers,
estimate their reliability online, and incorporate entropy-based query
selection to guide feedback requests. We evaluate our approach in a set of
environments that span both synthetic and real-world-inspired settings,
including 2D games (Taxi, Pacman, Frozen Lake) and a blood glucose control task
for Type 1 Diabetes using the clinically approved UVA/Padova simulator. Our
preliminary results demonstrate that agents trained with feedback on uncertain
trajectories exhibit faster learning in most tasks, and we outperform the
baselines for the blood glucose control task.

*Robin Thériault,Daniele Tantari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A three-layer Boltzmann DAM with Potts units is analyzed via saddle-point equations, enabling a novel stabilizing regularization, interpretable supervised/unsupervised solutions, and a network-growing strategy that leverages a saddle-point hierarchy to dramatically cut training cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by robustness to adversarial examples and links to attention mechanisms and diffusion models, the work seeks a principled, scalable understanding of dense associative memories and practical improvements for training.

Method: Use statistical mechanics to derive saddle-point equations for DAMs trained on real and synthetic data (teacher-student framework); introduce a regularization scheme; develop a network-growing algorithm that exploits saddle-point structure.

Result: Derived saddle-point characterizations for DAMs in both real and synthetic data regimes; proposed a training regularization that stabilizes optimization; demonstrated that small DAMs capture saddle points that are unstable in larger DAMs, and implemented a network-growing process that substantially reduces training cost while preserving performance; empirically shows interpretable solutions for supervised and unsupervised tasks.

Conclusion: The analysis provides a principled bridge between DAM theory and scalable training, revealing a saddle-point hierarchy that informs model growth and yields interpretable, robust solutions for both supervised and unsupervised learning.

Abstract: Dense associative memory (DAM) models have been attracting renewed attention
since they were shown to be robust to adversarial examples and closely related
to state-of-the-art machine learning paradigms, such as the attention
mechanisms in transformers and generative diffusion models. We study a DAM
built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which
represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis,
we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points
of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic
data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a
novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable.
Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to
both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our
theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively
small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a
network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to
drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pre-deployment robustness assessment faces a persistent trade-off between computational cost and measurement precision. There is a need for a practical, rigorous framework to quantify probabilistic robustness in safety-critical deep learning applications.

Method: Perform a comprehensive comparative analysis of existing robustness definitions and assessment methodologies. Introduce tower robustness, a novel metric based on hypothesis testing to quantify probabilistic robustness and streamline pre-deployment evaluations. Validate through extensive evaluations demonstrating advantages and applicability.

Result: Tower robustness yields more rigorous and efficient pre-deployment robustness assessments and demonstrates advantages and applicability over existing approaches.

Conclusion: The work advances the systematic understanding and enhancement of model robustness in safety-critical deep learning by providing a practical measurement framework and clarifying the landscape of robustness definitions and assessment methods.

Abstract: In safety-critical deep learning applications, robustness measures the
ability of neural models that handle imperceptible perturbations in input data,
which may lead to potential safety hazards. Existing pre-deployment robustness
assessment methods typically suffer from significant trade-offs between
computational cost and measurement precision, limiting their practical utility.
To address these limitations, this paper conducts a comprehensive comparative
analysis of existing robustness definitions and associated assessment
methodologies. We propose tower robustness to evaluate robustness, which is a
novel, practical metric based on hypothesis testing to quantitatively evaluate
probabilistic robustness, enabling more rigorous and efficient pre-deployment
assessments. Our extensive comparative evaluation illustrates the advantages
and applicability of our proposed approach, thereby advancing the systematic
understanding and enhancement of model robustness in safety-critical deep
learning applications.

*Jingyao Wu,Matthew Barthet,David Melhart,Georgios N. Yannakakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces ambiguity-aware ordinal emotion representations that model annotation ambiguity via its rate of change and capture temporal dynamics; outperforms prior models on RECOLA/GameVibe for both bounded and unbounded traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotions are ambiguous and dynamic; current continuous emotion recognition overlooks ambiguity or treats it as static; need a framework that integrates ambiguity with temporal dynamics.

Method: Propose ambiguity-aware ordinal representations; model ambiguity through its rate of change; evaluate on RECOLA and GameVibe; test on bounded (arousal, valence) and unbounded (engagement) traces.

Result: Ordinal representations outperform conventional ambiguity-aware models on unbounded traces, achieving top CCC and SDA scores; for bounded traces they excel in SDA, indicating better capture of relative changes.

Conclusion: Ordinal representations effectively model both ambiguity and dynamics in emotion traces and are particularly strong for unbounded targets, with competitive performance in bounded cases.

Abstract: Emotions are inherently ambiguous and dynamic phenomena, yet existing
continuous emotion recognition approaches either ignore their ambiguity or
treat ambiguity as an independent and static variable over time. Motivated by
this gap in the literature, in this paper we introduce \emph{ambiguity-aware
ordinal} emotion representations, a novel framework that captures both the
ambiguity present in emotion annotation and the inherent temporal dynamics of
emotional traces. Specifically, we propose approaches that model emotion
ambiguity through its rate of change. We evaluate our framework on two
affective corpora -- RECOLA and GameVibe -- testing our proposed approaches on
both bounded (arousal, valence) and unbounded (engagement) continuous traces.
Our results demonstrate that ordinal representations outperform conventional
ambiguity-aware models on unbounded labels, achieving the highest Concordance
Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and Signed Differential Agreement (SDA) scores,
highlighting their effectiveness in modeling the traces' dynamics. For bounded
traces, ordinal representations excel in SDA, revealing their superior ability
to capture relative changes of annotated emotion traces.

*Heng Lin,Zhongwen Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) expands LLMs' capabilities by enabling external tool use; the paper provides a formal proof of this expansion, introduces ASPO to guide policy, and reports strong gains on mathematical benchmarks using a Python interpreter.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of a principled theory for why tool integration improves LLM reasoning and performance, and to demonstrate how and when tool use yields gains.

Method: Provide a formal proof that TIR expands empirical and feasible problem-solving space; propose Advantage Shaping Policy Optimization (ASPO) to steer policy by modifying the advantage function; conduct experiments on challenging mathematical benchmarks with a Python interpreter as the tool.

Result: TIR models outperform pure-text baselines on pass@k; benefits extend to problems requiring abstract insight; identify emergent cognitive patterns for tool-based thinking; ASPO improves tool usage with earlier code invocation and longer, more interactive dialogues.

Conclusion: This work delivers the first principled explanation for TIR's success, clarifying how and why tool use enables more powerful reasoning and guiding future research on tool-enabled LLMs.

Abstract: We study why Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) makes Large Language Models
(LLMs) more capable. While LLMs integrated with tools like Python code
interpreters show great promise, a principled theory explaining why this
paradigm is effective has been missing. This work provides the first formal
proof that TIR fundamentally expands an LLM's capabilities. We demonstrate that
tools enable a strict expansion of the model's empirical and feasible support,
breaking the capability ceiling of pure-text models by unlocking
problem-solving strategies that are otherwise impossible or intractably
verbose. To guide model behavior without compromising training stability and
performance, we also introduce Advantage Shaping Policy Optimization (ASPO), a
novel algorithm that directly modifies the advantage function to guide the
policy behavior. We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging
mathematical benchmarks, leveraging a Python interpreter as the external tool.
Our results show that the TIR model decisively outperforms its pure-text
counterpart on the pass@k metric. Crucially, this advantage is not confined to
computationally-intensive problems but extends to those requiring significant
abstract insight. We further identify the emergent cognitive patterns that
illustrate how models learn to think with tools. Finally, we report improved
tool usage behavior with early code invocation and much more interactive turns
with ASPO. Overall, our work provides the first principled explanation for
TIR's success, shifting the focus from the mere fact that tools work to why and
how they enable more powerful reasoning.

### [243] [Predicting the Order of Upcoming Tokens Improves Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19228)
*Zayd M. K. Zuhri,Erland Hilman Fuadi,Alham Fikri Aji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TOP outperforms standard NTP and MTP across model scales by using a learning-to-rank objective that orders upcoming tokens by proximity, instead of predicting exact future tokens.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MTP’s exact future token prediction is too hard and yields inconsistent gains; a proximity-based ranking objective could provide a more reliable, informative auxiliary signal for language modelling.

Method: Introduce Token Order Prediction (TOP) as a learning-to-rank objective that orders upcoming tokens by proximity. Requires only one additional unembedding layer versus MTP’s extra transformer layers. Pretrain 340M, 1.8B, and 7B models with NTP, MTP, and TOP objectives and compare on eight NLP benchmarks.

Result: TOP consistently outperforms both NTP and MTP across all tested scales and benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the ranking-based auxiliary objective.

Conclusion: A simple, scalable, and more effective alternative to MTP for language model pretraining. TOP should be considered as a standard auxiliary objective, with code released for replication.

Abstract: Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) has been proposed as an auxiliary objective to
improve next-token prediction (NTP) in language model training but shows
inconsistent improvements, underperforming in standard NLP benchmarks. We argue
that MTP's exact future token prediction is too difficult as an auxiliary loss.
Instead, we propose Token Order Prediction (TOP), which trains models to order
upcoming tokens by their proximity using a learning-to-rank loss. TOP requires
only a single additional unembedding layer compared to MTP's multiple
transformer layers. We pretrain models of 340M, 1.8B, and 7B parameters using
NTP, MTP, and TOP objectives. Results on eight standard NLP benchmarks show
that TOP overall outperforms both NTP and MTP even at scale. Our code is
