TL;DR: 3D room-scale relighting by distilling diffusion model outputs into a 3D reconstruction to avoid inverse rendering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large room-scale relighting is ill-posed for inverse rendering; existing 2D/3D diffusion-based relighting either targets 2D data or individual objects, not scalable scene-level relighting.

Method: Distill outputs of a video-to-video relighting diffusion model into a 3D reconstruction, bypassing explicit inverse lighting estimation and enabling controllable relighting of room-scale scenes.

Result: Approach yields faithful novel-view renderings under new lighting, validated on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Using diffusion-model outputs to guide 3D relighting enables controllable, scalable relighting of complex scenes without solving a hard inverse rendering problem; demonstrated on room-scale environments.

Abstract: We present a method for relighting 3D reconstructions of large room-scale environments. Existing solutions for 3D scene relighting often require solving under-determined or ill-conditioned inverse rendering problems, and are as such unable to produce high-quality results on complex real-world scenes. Though recent progress in using generative image and video diffusion models for relighting has been promising, these techniques are either limited to 2D image and video relighting or 3D relighting of individual objects. Our approach enables controllable 3D relighting of room-scale scenes by distilling the outputs of a video-to-video relighting diffusion model into a 3D reconstruction. This side-steps the need to solve a difficult inverse rendering problem, and results in a flexible system that can relight 3D reconstructions of complex real-world scenes. We validate our approach on both synthetic and real-world datasets to show that it can faithfully render novel views of scenes under new lighting conditions.

*Dohun Lee,Chun-Hao Paul Huang,Xuelin Chen,Jong Chul Ye,Duygu Ceylan,Hyeonho Jeong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A memory-augmented video-to-video editing framework (Memory-V2V) improves cross-turn consistency by conditioning edits on an external cache of previously edited videos, with retrieval, dynamic tokenization, and a learnable token compressor in the DiT backbone, achieving ~30% speedup and stronger cross-consistency without harming task performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In multi-turn video editing, users iteratively refine results and require consistency across edits. Current video editors struggle to maintain cross-turn coherence, motivating explicit memory and efficient conditioning.

Method: Memory-V2V uses an external cache of previously edited videos and accurate retrieval with dynamic tokenization to condition the current edit on prior results. It also introduces a learnable token compressor inside the DiT backbone to remove redundant conditioning tokens, reducing computation.

Result: Experiments on tasks such as video novel view synthesis and text-conditioned long video editing show Memory-V2V yields substantially more cross-consistent outputs with minimal overhead, while maintaining or improving task-specific performance relative to strong baselines.

Conclusion: Memory-V2V effectively tackles cross-consistency in multi-turn video editing by adding memory and token compression, delivering faster editing with improved coherence and competitive performance.

Abstract: Recent foundational video-to-video diffusion models have achieved impressive results in editing user provided videos by modifying appearance, motion, or camera movement. However, real-world video editing is often an iterative process, where users refine results across multiple rounds of interaction. In this multi-turn setting, current video editors struggle to maintain cross-consistency across sequential edits. In this work, we tackle, for the first time, the problem of cross-consistency in multi-turn video editing and introduce Memory-V2V, a simple, yet effective framework that augments existing video-to-video models with explicit memory. Given an external cache of previously edited videos, Memory-V2V employs accurate retrieval and dynamic tokenization strategies to condition the current editing step on prior results. To further mitigate redundancy and computational overhead, we propose a learnable token compressor within the DiT backbone that compresses redundant conditioning tokens while preserving essential visual cues, achieving an overall speedup of 30%. We validate Memory-V2V on challenging tasks including video novel view synthesis and text-conditioned long video editing. Extensive experiments show that Memory-V2V produces videos that are significantly more cross-consistent with minimal computational overhead, while maintaining or even improving task-specific performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

*Abhijeet Parida,Antonia Alomar,Zhifan Jiang,Pooneh Roshanitabrizi,Austin Tapp,Ziyue Xu,Syed Muhammad Anwar,Maria J. Ledesma-Carbayo,Holger R. Roth,Marius George Linguraru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FeTTL introduces a federated learning framework that jointly learns a global template and a task model to harmonize data distributions across institutions, improving performance under domain shifts in medical imaging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts and data heterogeneity across institutions degrade federated learning performance in medical imaging due to variations in acquisition, scanners, and patient populations.

Method: FeTTL learns a shared global data template along with a task-specific model to align local data distributions across clients in a federated setting, enabling better cross-site generalization.

Result: On retinal fundus optic disc segmentation and histopathology metastasis classification across multiple institutions, FeTTL outperforms state-of-the-art federated baselines (p < 0.002). Joint learning of template and task is crucial for gains.

Conclusion: FeTTL provides a principled, extensible approach to mitigate distribution shifts in federated medical imaging, supporting robust deployment in real-world multi-institutional settings.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across geographically distributed medical centers while preserving data privacy. However, domain shifts and heterogeneity in data often lead to a degradation in model performance. Medical imaging applications are particularly affected by variations in acquisition protocols, scanner types, and patient populations. To address these issues, we introduce Federated Template and Task Learning (FeTTL), a novel framework designed to harmonize multi-institutional medical imaging data in federated environments. FeTTL learns a global template together with a task model to align data distributions among clients. We evaluated FeTTL on two challenging and diverse multi-institutional medical imaging tasks: retinal fundus optical disc segmentation and histopathological metastasis classification. Experimental results show that FeTTL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art federated learning baselines (p-values <0.002) for optical disc segmentation and classification of metastases from multi-institutional data. Our experiments further highlight the importance of jointly learning the template and the task. These findings suggest that FeTTL offers a principled and extensible solution for mitigating distribution shifts in federated learning, supporting robust model deployment in real-world, multi-institutional environments.

### [4] [Where is the multimodal goal post? On the Ability of Foundation Models to Recognize Contextually Important Moments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16333)
*Aditya K Surikuchi,Raquel Fernández,Sandro Pezzelle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dataset on predicting important football sub-events using implicit highlight preferences; models currently near chance and rely on a single modality; modular architectures and better cross-modal training needed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable reliable narration/summarization of temporally-ordered multimodal events by automatically identifying salient sub-events, addressing the challenge of multimodal fusion in real-world video data.

Method: Create a new dataset by extracting importance preferences from football highlight reels (no extra annotation cost) and evaluate several state-of-the-art multimodal models on binary importance of sub-events; plan to publicly release the dataset.

Result: State-of-the-art models perform only slightly above or near chance in distinguishing important vs non-important sub-events; analyses show models rely on a single modality and struggle to synthesize information across modalities.

Conclusion: Highlight the need for modular architectures that handle sample-level heterogeneity in multimodal data and complementary training procedures to maximize cross-modal synergy; dataset release planned to foster progress.

Abstract: Foundation models are used for many real-world applications involving language generation from temporally-ordered multimodal events. In this work, we study the ability of models to identify the most important sub-events in a video, which is a fundamental prerequisite for narrating or summarizing multimodal events. Specifically, we focus on football games and evaluate models on their ability to distinguish between important and non-important sub-events in a game. To this end, we construct a new dataset by leveraging human preferences for importance implicit in football game highlight reels, without any additional annotation costs. Using our dataset, which we will publicly release to the community, we compare several state-of-the-art multimodal models and show that they are not far from chance level performance. Analyses of models beyond standard evaluation metrics reveal their tendency to rely on a single dominant modality and their ineffectiveness in synthesizing necessary information from multiple sources. Our findings underline the importance of modular architectures that can handle sample-level heterogeneity in multimodal data and the need for complementary training procedures that can maximize cross-modal synergy.

### [5] [Coarse-to-Fine Non-rigid Multi-modal Image Registration for Historical Panel Paintings based on Crack Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16348)
*Aline Sindel,Andreas Maier,Vincent Christlein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Coarse-to-fine non-rigid multi-modal registration for historical panel paintings using craquelure-based keypoints and TPS warping, with CNN-based keypoint detection/description and graph neural network matching; validated on a new multi-modal panel painting dataset and outperforming existing keypoint/dense methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automate pixel-precise alignment of multi-modal imagery (visible, IR, UV, X-ray, macro) of historical paintings to reduce manual labor, handle large image sizes and non-rigid distortions, and exploit robust cross-modal features (craquelure).

Method: One-stage non-rigid registration combining: (1) CNN for joint craquelure-based keypoint detection and description; (2) graph neural network for patch-based descriptor matching; (3) match filtering via local homography reprojection errors; (4) coarse-to-fine registration with multi-level keypoint refinement to handle mixed-resolution inputs; (5) thin-plate-spline interpolation; (6) dataset creation with extensive keypoint annotations and a five-domain multi-modal test set; ablation study validating each module; comparisons against keypoint and dense matching and refinement baselines.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art registration accuracy across five multi-modal domains and varying resolutions; ablation confirms contributions of the refinement module and the craquelure-based features; outperforms competing keypoint-based and dense methods.

Conclusion: The proposed craquelure-driven, multi-level keypoint refinement framework provides accurate, efficient alignment for multi-modal historical paintings, enabling more reliable cross-modal analysis and analysis workflows; the created dataset offers a benchmark for future work.

Abstract: Art technological investigations of historical panel paintings rely on acquiring multi-modal image data, including visual light photography, infrared reflectography, ultraviolet fluorescence photography, x-radiography, and macro photography. For a comprehensive analysis, the multi-modal images require pixel-wise alignment, which is still often performed manually. Multi-modal image registration can reduce this laborious manual work, is substantially faster, and enables higher precision. Due to varying image resolutions, huge image sizes, non-rigid distortions, and modality-dependent image content, registration is challenging. Therefore, we propose a coarse-to-fine non-rigid multi-modal registration method efficiently relying on sparse keypoints and thin-plate-splines. Historical paintings exhibit a fine crack pattern, called craquelure, on the paint layer, which is captured by all image systems and is well-suited as a feature for registration. In our one-stage non-rigid registration approach, we employ a convolutional neural network for joint keypoint detection and description based on the craquelure and a graph neural network for descriptor matching in a patch-based manner, and filter matches based on homography reprojection errors in local areas. For coarse-to-fine registration, we introduce a novel multi-level keypoint refinement approach to register mixed-resolution images up to the highest resolution. We created a multi-modal dataset of panel paintings with a high number of keypoint annotations, and a large test set comprising five multi-modal domains and varying image resolutions. The ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of all modules of our refinement method. Our proposed approaches achieve the best registration results compared to competing keypoint and dense matching methods and refinement methods.

### [6] [Cognitively-Inspired Tokens Overcome Egocentric Bias in Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16378)
*Bridget Leonard,Scott O. Murray*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces perspective tokens to enable allocentric perspective-taking in multimodal language models, improving level-2 visual perspective-taking across benchmarks via two token types (embodied body-keypoints and abstract rotation).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal language models show egocentric bias and struggle with perspective-taking; advancing allocentric spatial reasoning is desirable for human-like understanding.

Method: Incorporates perspective tokens into LLaVA-1.5-13B with two modalities: (1) embodied cues derived from body-keypoint orientations and (2) abstract mental-rotation representations. Fine-tunes model and evaluates on Isle Bricks V2, COCO, and 3DSRBench; conducts representational analyses.

Result: Perspective tokens yield higher accuracy on level-2 perspective tasks across synthetic and naturalistic benchmarks; rotation-based tokens generalize to non-human agents; fine-tuning enhances latent orientation sensitivity, indicating MLMs have precursors to allocentric reasoning; token-based spatial structure is lightweight and model-agnostic.

Conclusion: Embedding cognitive spatial structure into token space enables efficient perspective-taking and more human-like spatial reasoning in MLMs, with tokens relativizing egocentric bias and enabling generalization across agents.

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) perform well on semantic vision-language tasks but fail at spatial reasoning that requires adopting another agent's visual perspective. These errors reflect a persistent egocentric bias and raise questions about whether current models support allocentric reasoning. Inspired by human spatial cognition, we introduce perspective tokens, specialized embeddings that encode orientation through either (1) embodied body-keypoint cues or (2) abstract representations supporting mental rotation. Integrating these tokens into LLaVA-1.5-13B yields performance on level-2 visual perspective-taking tasks. Across synthetic and naturalistic benchmarks (Isle Bricks V2, COCO, 3DSRBench), perspective tokens improve accuracy, with rotation-based tokens generalizing to non-human reference agents. Representational analyses reveal that fine-tuning enhances latent orientation sensitivity already present in the base model, suggesting that MLMs contain precursors of allocentric reasoning but lack appropriate internal structure. Overall, embedding cognitively grounded spatial structure directly into token space provides a lightweight, model-agnostic mechanism for perspective-taking and more human-like spatial reasoning.

### [7] [VTFusion: A Vision-Text Multimodal Fusion Network for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16381)
*Yuxin Jiang,Yunkang Cao,Yuqi Cheng,Yiheng Zhang,Weiming Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTFusion introduces adaptive vision-text fusion for few-shot anomaly detection in industrial inspection, with domain-adaptive feature extractors and a multimodal fusion/prediction module, achieving strong image-level AUROC on MVTec AD and VisA, plus high AUPRO on a real-world automotive plastics dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current FSAD methods rely on features pretrained on natural scenes and use simple feature fusion, which leads to suboptimal transfer to industrial data and semantic misalignment between visual and textual modalities, reducing robustness in cross-modal scenarios.

Method: Two core designs: (1) adaptive feature extractors for image and text to learn task-specific representations and bridge domain gaps, augmented by synthetic anomaly generation to diversify features; (2) a dedicated multimodal prediction fusion module with a fusion block enabling rich cross-modal exchange and a segmentation network producing refined pixel-level anomaly maps under multimodal guidance.

Result: Strong performance on standard benchmarks: image-level AUROC 96.8% (2-shot) on MVTec AD and 86.2% on VisA; AUPRO 93.5% on a real-world automotive plastic parts dataset introduced in the paper.

Conclusion: VTFusion effectively bridges domain gaps and addresses semantic misalignment between modalities in FSAD, improving robustness and demonstrating practical industrial applicability.

Abstract: Few-Shot Anomaly Detection (FSAD) has emerged as a critical paradigm for identifying irregularities using scarce normal references. While recent methods have integrated textual semantics to complement visual data, they predominantly rely on features pre-trained on natural scenes, thereby neglecting the granular, domain-specific semantics essential for industrial inspection. Furthermore, prevalent fusion strategies often resort to superficial concatenation, failing to address the inherent semantic misalignment between visual and textual modalities, which compromises robustness against cross-modal interference. To bridge these gaps, this study proposes VTFusion, a vision-text multimodal fusion framework tailored for FSAD. The framework rests on two core designs. First, adaptive feature extractors for both image and text modalities are introduced to learn task-specific representations, bridging the domain gap between pre-trained models and industrial data; this is further augmented by generating diverse synthetic anomalies to enhance feature discriminability. Second, a dedicated multimodal prediction fusion module is developed, comprising a fusion block that facilitates rich cross-modal information exchange and a segmentation network that generates refined pixel-level anomaly maps under multimodal guidance. VTFusion significantly advances FSAD performance, achieving image-level AUROCs of 96.8% and 86.2% in the 2-shot scenario on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets, respectively. Furthermore, VTFusion achieves an AUPRO of 93.5% on a real-world dataset of industrial automotive plastic parts introduced in this paper, further demonstrating its practical applicability in demanding industrial scenarios.

### [8] [ResAgent: Entropy-based Prior Point Discovery and Visual Reasoning for Referring Expression Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16394)
*Yihao Wang,Jusheng Zhang,Ziyi Tang,Keze Wang,Meng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes RES framework EBD-VBR to overcome coarse MLLM bounding boxes and text-only coordinate reasoning by using entropy-based point discovery within coarse boxes and vision-based reasoning for point validation, in a coarse-to-fine pipeline, achieving state-of-the-art on four benchmarks with minimal prompts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RES quality is limited by non-discriminative prompts from coarse MLLM bounding boxes and unreliable text-based coordinate reasoning that confuses targets with distractors; a data-driven, cross-modal point selection and validation approach can yield accurate, semantically grounded segmentation with fewer prompts.

Method: Entropy-Based Point Discovery (EBD) identifies high-information candidate points by modeling spatial uncertainty within coarse bounding boxes; Vision-Based Reasoning (VBR) verifies point correctness through joint visual-semantic alignment, replacing text-only coordinate inference. The system follows a coarse-to-fine workflow: initialize bbox, discover points via entropy, validate with vision, decode mask.

Result: Achieves new state-of-the-art performance on four RES benchmarks (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, ReasonSeg). Demonstrates effective generation of accurate and semantically grounded segmentation masks with minimal prompts.

Conclusion: Integrating EBD and VBR yields robust RES with minimal prompts; information-theoretic point discovery plus vision-grounded validation improves segmentation. Potential extensions include broader applicability to other vision-language tasks and exploring efficiency and robustness under varying data distributions.

Abstract: Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) is a core vision-language segmentation task that enables pixel-level understanding of targets via free-form linguistic expressions, supporting critical applications such as human-robot interaction and augmented reality. Despite the progress of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based approaches, existing RES methods still suffer from two key limitations: first, the coarse bounding boxes from MLLMs lead to redundant or non-discriminative point prompts; second, the prevalent reliance on textual coordinate reasoning is unreliable, as it fails to distinguish targets from visually similar distractors. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{\model}, a novel RES framework integrating \textbf{E}ntropy-\textbf{B}ased Point \textbf{D}iscovery (\textbf{EBD}) and \textbf{V}ision-\textbf{B}ased \textbf{R}easoning (\textbf{VBR}). Specifically, EBD identifies high-information candidate points by modeling spatial uncertainty within coarse bounding boxes, treating point selection as an information maximization process. VBR verifies point correctness through joint visual-semantic alignment, abandoning text-only coordinate inference for more robust validation. Built on these components, \model implements a coarse-to-fine workflow: bounding box initialization, entropy-guided point discovery, vision-based validation, and mask decoding. Extensive evaluations on four benchmark datasets (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and ReasonSeg) demonstrate that \model achieves new state-of-the-art performance across all four benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in generating accurate and semantically grounded segmentation masks with minimal prompts.

### [9] [A Cosine Network for Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16413)
*Chunwei Tian,Chengyuan Zhang,Bob Zhang,Zhiwu Li,C. L. Philip Chen,David Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CSRNet, a CNN for image super-resolution that uses alternating odd/even heterogeneous blocks and a hybrid linear/nonlinear structure, with cosine annealing with warm restarts for training, achieving competitive results with state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preserve and leverage hierarchical structural information during super-resolution by increasing architectural diversity and employing an effective optimization strategy to escape poor local minima.

Method: Design CSRNet with alternating odd and even blocks to enlarge architectural differences; combine linear and nonlinear pathways to capture complementary information; apply cosine annealing with warm restarts to adjust learning rate during training.

Result: Experimental results indicate that CSRNet is competitive with state-of-the-art image super-resolution methods on standard benchmarks, demonstrating robustness and effective use of structural information.

Conclusion: CSRNet demonstrates that enhancing architectural diversity and a cosine-annealing training strategy can preserve structural information and achieve competitive super-resolution performance.

Abstract: Deep convolutional neural networks can use hierarchical information to progressively extract structural information to recover high-quality images. However, preserving the effectiveness of the obtained structural information is important in image super-resolution. In this paper, we propose a cosine network for image super-resolution (CSRNet) by improving a network architecture and optimizing the training strategy. To extract complementary homologous structural information, odd and even heterogeneous blocks are designed to enlarge the architectural differences and improve the performance of image super-resolution. Combining linear and non-linear structural information can overcome the drawback of homologous information and enhance the robustness of the obtained structural information in image super-resolution. Taking into account the local minimum of gradient descent, a cosine annealing mechanism is used to optimize the training procedure by performing warm restarts and adjusting the learning rate. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed CSRNet is competitive with state-of-the-art methods in image super-resolution.

### [10] [DCCS-Det: Directional Context and Cross-Scale-Aware Detector for Infrared Small Target](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16428)
*Shuying Li,Qiang Ma,San Zhang,Chuang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCCS-Det introduces a Dual-stream Saliency Enhancement (DSE) block and a Latent-aware Semantic Extraction and Aggregation (LaSEA) module to improve infrared small target detection by fusing local and directional context with cross-scale features and sampling strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance with competitive efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In infrared small target detection (IRSTD), existing methods struggle with inadequate joint modeling of local-global features and with feature redundancy/semantic dilution, leading to poor target-background discrimination and noisy representations.

Method: Propose DCCS-Det consisting of: (1) a Dual-stream Saliency Enhancement (DSE) block that combines localized perception with direction-aware context aggregation to capture long-range dependencies and fine details; (2) a Latent-aware Semantic Extraction and Aggregation (LaSEA) module that mitigates feature degradation via cross-scale feature extraction and random pooling sampling to enhance discriminative features and suppress noise.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art detection accuracy with competitive efficiency across multiple IRSTD datasets; ablation studies validate the contributions of DSE and LaSEA in improving target perception and feature representation under complex scenarios.

Conclusion: The proposed DSE and LaSEA components effectively enhance target perception and feature representation in infrared small target detection, enabling a high-performance detector (DCCS-Det) with robust performance across datasets.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is critical for applications like remote sensing and surveillance, which aims to identify small, low-contrast targets against complex backgrounds. However, existing methods often struggle with inadequate joint modeling of local-global features (harming target-background discrimination) or feature redundancy and semantic dilution (degrading target representation quality). To tackle these issues, we propose DCCS-Det (Directional Context and Cross-Scale Aware Detector for Infrared Small Target), a novel detector that incorporates a Dual-stream Saliency Enhancement (DSE) block and a Latent-aware Semantic Extraction and Aggregation (LaSEA) module. The DSE block integrates localized perception with direction-aware context aggregation to help capture long-range spatial dependencies and local details. On this basis, the LaSEA module mitigates feature degradation via cross-scale feature extraction and random pooling sampling strategies, enhancing discriminative features and suppressing noise. Extensive experiments show that DCCS-Det achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy with competitive efficiency across multiple datasets. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of DSE and LaSEA in improving target perception and feature representation under complex scenarios. \href{https://huggingface.co/InPeerReview/InfraredSmallTargetDetection-IRSTD.DCCS}{DCCS-Det Official Code is Available Here!}

### [11] [AlphaFace: High Fidelity and Real-time Face Swapper Robust to Facial Pose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16429)
*Jongmin Yu,Hyeontaek Oh,Zhongtian Sun,Angelica I Aviles-Rivero,Moongu Jeon,Jinhong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AlphaFace uses CLIP-based visual and textual semantic contrastive losses to enhance pose robustness in face-swapping while preserving identity and attributes, achieving real-time performance and surpassing state-of-the-art on pose-challenging cases; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome quality degradation under extreme poses without heavy geometric hand-crafted features, and provide real-time processing unlike diffusion-based methods.

Method: Integrates an open-source vision-language model with CLIP image and text embeddings to impose visual and textual semantic contrastive losses, strengthening identity representation and attribute preservation while maintaining real-time speed.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on FF++, MPIE, and LPFF show AlphaFace surpasses state-of-the-art methods in pose-challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: AlphaFace delivers pose-robust, semantically-consistent face swapping with real-time performance; implementation is publicly available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Existing face-swapping methods often deliver competitive results in constrained settings but exhibit substantial quality degradation when handling extreme facial poses. To improve facial pose robustness, explicit geometric features are applied, but this approach remains problematic since it introduces additional dependencies and increases computational cost. Diffusion-based methods have achieved remarkable results; however, they are impractical for real-time processing. We introduce AlphaFace, which leverages an open-source vision-language model and CLIP image and text embeddings to apply novel visual and textual semantic contrastive losses. AlphaFace enables stronger identity representation and more precise attribute preservation, all while maintaining real-time performance. Comprehensive experiments across FF++, MPIE, and LPFF demonstrate that AlphaFace surpasses state-of-the-art methods in pose-challenging cases. The project is publicly available on `https://github.com/andrewyu90/Alphaface_Official.git'.

### [12] [MDAFNet: Multiscale Differential Edge and Adaptive Frequency Guided Network for Infrared Small Target Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16434)
*Shuying Li,Qiang Ma,San Zhang,Wuwei Wang,Chuang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-branch infrared small target detector (MDAFNet) that uses Multi-Scale Differential Edge (MSDE) and Dual-Domain Adaptive Feature Enhancement (DAFE) to mitigate edge degradation and frequency interference, achieving superior detection on several datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IRSTD performance is hindered by edge pixel degradation with deeper networks and by difficulty distinguishing frequency components, causing high-frequency noise to trigger false positives and low-frequency background to suppress targets.

Method: Proposes MSDE module for multi-scale edge extraction/enhancement to preserve target edges during downsampling; proposes DAFE module that blends frequency-domain processing with spatial-domain simulated frequency decomposition and fusion to adaptively boost high-frequency targets and suppress noise.

Result: Experimental results on multiple IRSTD datasets show superior detection performance compared with baseline methods (exact metrics not specified in abstract).

Conclusion: MDAFNet effectively addresses edge degradation and frequency interference in infrared small target detection, providing improved accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) plays a crucial role in numerous military and civilian applications. However, existing methods often face the gradual degradation of target edge pixels as the number of network layers increases, and traditional convolution struggles to differentiate between frequency components during feature extraction, leading to low-frequency backgrounds interfering with high-frequency targets and high-frequency noise triggering false detections. To address these limitations, we propose MDAFNet (Multi-scale Differential Edge and Adaptive Frequency Guided Network for Infrared Small Target Detection), which integrates the Multi-Scale Differential Edge (MSDE) module and Dual-Domain Adaptive Feature Enhancement (DAFE) module. The MSDE module, through a multi-scale edge extraction and enhancement mechanism, effectively compensates for the cumulative loss of target edge information during downsampling. The DAFE module combines frequency domain processing mechanisms with simulated frequency decomposition and fusion mechanisms in the spatial domain to effectively improve the network's capability to adaptively enhance high-frequency targets and selectively suppress high-frequency noise. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior detection performance of MDAFNet.

### [13] [Masked Face Recognition under Different Backbones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16440)
*Bo Zhang,Ming Zhang,Kun Wu,Lei Bian,Yi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Backbone choice materially affects face recognition with masks; the paper provides a multi-architecture comparison and practical deployment guidance for masked vs unmasked scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate how different backbone networks (ResNet-based and ViT variants) perform in face recognition under mask occlusion to guide deployment decisions in the post-pandemic era.

Method: Comparative experimental evaluation across backbone families (r100, r50, r34_mask_v1, r100_mask_v2, r50_mask_v3, Vit-Small/Tiny) on standard (unmasked) and masked recognition tasks, incorporating corrections from an erratum to Table IV and Page 3 data.

Result: Standard tests: r100 series achieve 98%+ accuracy at 0.01% FAR; r50 second; r34_mask_v1 weaker. Masked tests: r100_mask_v2 leads with 90.07% accuracy; r50_mask_v3 best among r50 but still below r100; ViT-Small/Tiny show strong masked performance, indicating robustness to occlusion.

Conclusion: Backbone architecture significantly influences recognition performance under masking; deployment recommendations favor high-capacity ResNet backbones or ViT variants for masked scenarios, while acknowledging trade-offs in latency and resource use; the erratum highlights the importance of data integrity and comprehensive reporting in benchmarking.

Abstract: Erratum to the paper (Zhang et al., 2025): corrections to Table IV and the data in Page 3, Section A. In the post-pandemic era, a high proportion of civil aviation passengers wear masks during security checks, posing significant challenges to traditional face recognition models. The backbone network serves as the core component of face recognition models. In standard tests, r100 series models excelled (98%+ accuracy at 0.01% FAR in face comparison, high top1/top5 in search). r50 ranked second, r34_mask_v1 lagged. In masked tests, r100_mask_v2 led (90.07% accuracy), r50_mask_v3 performed best among r50 but trailed r100. Vit-Small/Tiny showed strong masked performance with gains in effectiveness. Through extensive comparative experiments, this paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of several core backbone networks, aiming to reveal the impacts of different models on face recognition with and without masks, and provide specific deployment recommendations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome explicit face-detector reliance, limited fusion strategies, and data quality/scale limitations of prior Emotion-LLaMA, enabling robust emotion recognition and reasoning in MLLMs with standardized evaluation.

Method: End-to-end multiview encoder; Conv Attention pre-fusion; perception-to-cognition curriculum instruction tuning in LLaMA2; MMEVerse data aggregation from 12 datasets, re-annotated via multi-agent pipeline (Qwen2 Audio, Qwen2.5 VL, GPT-4o) to 130k train and 36k test clips across 18 benchmarks.

Result: Introduces end-to-end pipeline and standardized evaluation; unified multimodal instruction format; 130k train, 36k test; 18 benchmarks; re-annotation pipeline.

Conclusion: Emotion-LLaMAv2 advances emotion reasoning in multimodal LLMs with scalable data and reproducible benchmarks, facilitating more robust affective AI and HRI research.

Abstract: Understanding human emotions from multimodal signals poses a significant challenge in affective computing and human-robot interaction. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have excelled in general vision-language tasks, their capabilities in emotional reasoning remain limited. The field currently suffers from a scarcity of large-scale datasets with high-quality, descriptive emotion annotations and lacks standardized benchmarks for evaluation. Our preliminary framework, Emotion-LLaMA, pioneered instruction-tuned multimodal learning for emotion reasoning but was restricted by explicit face detectors, implicit fusion strategies, and low-quality training data with limited scale. To address these limitations, we present Emotion-LLaMAv2 and the MMEVerse benchmark, establishing an end-to-end pipeline together with a standardized evaluation setting for emotion recognition and reasoning. Emotion-LLaMAv2 introduces three key advances. First, an end-to-end multiview encoder eliminates external face detection and captures nuanced emotional cues via richer spatial and temporal multiview tokens. Second, a Conv Attention pre-fusion module is designed to enable simultaneous local and global multimodal feature interactions external to the LLM backbone. Third, a perception-to-cognition curriculum instruction tuning scheme within the LLaMA2 backbone unifies emotion recognition and free-form emotion reasoning. To support large-scale training and reproducible evaluation, MMEVerse aggregates twelve publicly available emotion datasets, including IEMOCAP, MELD, DFEW, and MAFW, into a unified multimodal instruction format. The data are re-annotated via a multi-agent pipeline involving Qwen2 Audio, Qwen2.5 VL, and GPT 4o, producing 130k training clips and 36k testing clips across 18 evaluation benchmarks.

*Peixian Liang,Songhao Li,Shunsuke Koga,Yutong Li,Zahra Alipour,Yucheng Tang,Daguang Xu,Zhi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTA-PATH is a pathology-focused segmentation foundation model enabling interactive, class-aware multi-class tissue segmentation with expert feedback, trained on a large 1.6M image–mask–text dataset; it outperforms existing models and yields clinically meaningful measures such as Tumor Interaction Score for survival correlation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: General segmentation foundation models are not aligned with pathology; need interactive, class-aware segmentation that handles heterogeneous tissue structures across organs and integrates expert feedback for clinical interpretability.

Method: VISTA-PATH jointly conditions segmentation on visual context, semantic tissue descriptions, and optional expert spatial prompts. Trained on VISTA-PATH Data (1.6M image–mask–text triplets across 9 organs and 93 tissue classes). Supports dynamic human-in-the-loop refinement by propagating sparse, patch-level bounding-box feedback to whole-slide segmentation, enabling pixel-level, class-aware segmentation.

Result: Outperforms existing segmentation foundation models on held-out and external benchmarks; supports dynamic refinement; produces high-fidelity, clinically meaningful segmentations; introduces Tumor Interaction Score (TIS) with strong associations to patient survival.

Conclusion: VISTA-PATH elevates pathology image segmentation from a static prediction to an interactive, clinically grounded representation for digital pathology; serves as a foundation model for pathology segmentation with accessible code and demo.

Abstract: Accurate semantic segmentation for histopathology image is crucial for quantitative tissue analysis and downstream clinical modeling. Recent segmentation foundation models have improved generalization through large-scale pretraining, yet remain poorly aligned with pathology because they treat segmentation as a static visual prediction task. Here we present VISTA-PATH, an interactive, class-aware pathology segmentation foundation model designed to resolve heterogeneous structures, incorporate expert feedback, and produce pixel-level segmentation that are directly meaningful for clinical interpretation. VISTA-PATH jointly conditions segmentation on visual context, semantic tissue descriptions, and optional expert-provided spatial prompts, enabling precise multi-class segmentation across heterogeneous pathology images. To support this paradigm, we curate VISTA-PATH Data, a large-scale pathology segmentation corpus comprising over 1.6 million image-mask-text triplets spanning 9 organs and 93 tissue classes. Across extensive held-out and external benchmarks, VISTA-PATH consistently outperforms existing segmentation foundation models. Importantly, VISTA-PATH supports dynamic human-in-the-loop refinement by propagating sparse, patch-level bounding-box annotation feedback into whole-slide segmentation. Finally, we show that the high-fidelity, class-aware segmentation produced by VISTA-PATH is a preferred model for computational pathology. It improve tissue microenvironment analysis through proposed Tumor Interaction Score (TIS), which exhibits strong and significant associations with patient survival. Together, these results establish VISTA-PATH as a foundation model that elevates pathology image segmentation from a static prediction to an interactive and clinically grounded representation for digital pathology.

*Meng Cao,Haoran Tang,Haoze Zhao,Mingfei Han,Ruyang Liu,Qiang Sun,Xiaojun Chang,Ian Reid,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Leverages gameplay glitches as scalable supervision for physical world understanding; introduces PhysGame (140k glitch-centric QA across 5 physical domains and 16 categories) and GameBench (880 glitch-identified gameplay videos). Uses metadata-guided prompting for QA generation. Reports transfer gains: +2.5% on PhysBench for Qwen2.5VL, +1.9% on MVBench, and +3.7% on GameBench, indicating robustness in detecting physical implausibilities and improved real-world physical reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current physical reasoning datasets either rely on costly real videos or lack realism in synthetic simulations. Glitches in gameplay videos provide natural, scalable signals that violate physical laws, offering a rich supervision source to train and evaluate MLLMs on physical principles.

Method: Construct PhysGame via meta-information guided instruction tuning with 140,057 QA pairs across 5 domains and 16 categories. Employ a prompting strategy that uses gameplay titles/descriptions to guide high-quality QA generation. Build GameBench with 880 expert-annotated glitch-identified gameplay videos to benchmark physical reasoning. Evaluate via transfer tests (Game2Real and Game2General) and robustness on GameBench.

Result: PhysGame enhances real-world physical reasoning and robustness: Qwen2.5VL gains 2.5% on PhysBench, MVBench gains 1.9% in Game2General transfer, and 3.7% absolute improvement on GameBench.

Conclusion: Learning from gameplay anomalies is a scalable and effective pathway to advance physical world understanding in multimodal AI, bridging data efficiency, realism, and transferability.

Abstract: Understanding the physical world, including object dynamics, material properties, and causal interactions, remains a core challenge in artificial intelligence. Although recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive general reasoning capabilities, they still fall short of achieving human-level understanding of physical principles. Existing datasets for physical reasoning either rely on real-world videos, which incur high annotation costs, or on synthetic simulations, which suffer from limited realism and diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that leverages glitches in gameplay videos, referring to visual anomalies that violate predefined physical laws, as a rich and scalable supervision source for physical world understanding. We introduce PhysGame, an meta information guided instruction-tuning dataset containing 140,057 glitch-centric question-answer pairs across five physical domains and sixteen fine-grained categories. To ensure data accuracy, we design a prompting strategy that utilizes gameplay metadata such as titles and descriptions to guide high-quality QA generation. Complementing PhysGame, we construct GameBench, an expert-annotated benchmark with 880 glitch-identified gameplay videos designed to evaluate physical reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments show that PhysGame significantly enhances both Game2Real transferability, improving the real world physical reasoning performance of Qwen2.5VL by 2.5% on PhysBench, and Game2General transferability, yielding a 1.9% gain on the MVBench benchmark. Moreover, PhysGame-tuned models achieve a 3.7% absolute improvement on GameBench, demonstrating enhanced robustness in detecting physical implausibilities. These results indicate that learning from gameplay anomalies offers a scalable and effective pathway toward advancing physical world understanding in multimodal intelligence.

*Yangfan Xu,Lilian Zhang,Xiaofeng He,Pengdong Wu,Wenqi Wu,Jun Mao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-supervised training of Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) for camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction using sequence-wise photometric and geometric constraints on unlabeled data, improving large-scale localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce dependence on labeled data and enable learning from unlabeled, unseen scenes; leverage temporal consistency by extending pair-wise relations to sequence-level geometric constraints.

Method: Extend VGGT with sequence-wise geometric constraints by sampling multiple source frames per sequence and projecting them onto target frames; enforce physical photometric consistency and geometric relations via a joint optimization loss; train across local/global cross-view attention as well as camera and depth heads.

Result: Model converges within hundreds of iterations and achieves significant improvements in large-scale localization; code will be released (GitHub).

Conclusion: Self-supervised sequence-level geometric learning enables VGGT to capture multi-view geometry from unlabeled data, enhancing localization and scalability to large environments.

Abstract: Transformer-based general visual geometry frameworks have shown promising performance in camera pose estimation and 3D scene understanding. Recent advancements in Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) models have shown great promise in camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, these models typically rely on ground truth labels for training, posing challenges when adapting to unlabeled and unseen scenes. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework to train VGGT with unlabeled data, thereby enhancing its localization capability in large-scale environments. To achieve this, we extend conventional pair-wise relations to sequence-wise geometric constraints for self-supervised learning. Specifically, in each sequence, we sample multiple source frames and geometrically project them onto different target frames, which improves temporal feature consistency. We formulate physical photometric consistency and geometric constraints as a joint optimization loss to circumvent the requirement for hard labels. By training the model with this proposed method, not only the local and global cross-view attention layers but also the camera and depth heads can effectively capture the underlying multi-view geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the model converges within hundreds of iterations and achieves significant improvements in large-scale localization. Our code will be released at https://github.com/X-yangfan/GPA-VGGT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wound care faces economic/logistical burdens; 3D segmentation from 2D images can improve healing progress tracking, but producing multi-view consistent 3D structures from 2D data remains challenging; the paper investigates a NeRF-based approach to robust segmentation from auto annotations.

Method: Apply WoundNeRF, a NeRF with signed distance field (SDF) representation, to estimate wound segmentations from automatically generated annotations; compare its performance against state-of-the-art Vision Transformer networks and conventional rasterisation-based algorithms.

Result: The study demonstrates the potential of the NeRF-SDF paradigm for recovering accurate wound segmentations, showing competitive performance relative to ViT and rasterisation baselines.

Conclusion: The WoundNeRF approach is promising for robust 3D wound segmentation from 2D inputs, and the authors plan to release code to facilitate further development.

Abstract: Wound care is often challenged by the economic and logistical burdens that consistently afflict patients and hospitals worldwide. In recent decades, healthcare professionals have sought support from computer vision and machine learning algorithms. In particular, wound segmentation has gained interest due to its ability to provide professionals with fast, automatic tissue assessment from standard RGB images. Some approaches have extended segmentation to 3D, enabling more complete and precise healing progress tracking. However, inferring multi-view consistent 3D structures from 2D images remains a challenge. In this paper, we evaluate WoundNeRF, a NeRF SDF-based method for estimating robust wound segmentations from automatically generated annotations. We demonstrate the potential of this paradigm in recovering accurate segmentations by comparing it against state-of-the-art Vision Transformer networks and conventional rasterisation-based algorithms. The code will be released to facilitate further development in this promising paradigm.

*Basile Van Hoorick,Dian Chen,Shun Iwase,Pavel Tokmakov,Muhammad Zubair Irshad,Igor Vasiljevic,Swati Gupta,Fangzhou Cheng,Sergey Zakharov,Vitor Campagnolo Guizilini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based video framework AnyView enables dynamic view synthesis with minimal inductive biases, trained on 2D monocular, 3D multi-view, and 4D dynamic data to produce zero-shot videos from arbitrary viewpoints, and introduces AnyViewBench for extreme dynamic scenarios; achieves competitive results and robust temporal/spatial consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of maintaining multi-view and spatiotemporal consistency in dynamic real-world videos with existing generative models, which often rely on strong priors or geometry assumptions.

Method: Train a diffusion-based video generation framework (AnyView) using heterogeneous supervision signals from monocular 2D data, static 3D multi-view data, and dynamic 4D multi-view data to learn a generalist spatiotemporal implicit representation capable of zero-shot video generation from arbitrary camera poses and trajectories.

Result: Competitive performance on standard benchmarks; AnyView maintains realism and spatiotemporal consistency in extreme dynamic view synthesis settings where baselines fail; introduction of AnyViewBench as a new challenging benchmark for extreme cases.

Conclusion: A generalist, minimally biased spatiotemporal implicit representation learned from diverse supervision can enable robust zero-shot dynamic view synthesis across arbitrary viewpoints, with strong performance in challenging real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Modern generative video models excel at producing convincing, high-quality outputs, but struggle to maintain multi-view and spatiotemporal consistency in highly dynamic real-world environments. In this work, we introduce \textbf{AnyView}, a diffusion-based video generation framework for \emph{dynamic view synthesis} with minimal inductive biases or geometric assumptions. We leverage multiple data sources with various levels of supervision, including monocular (2D), multi-view static (3D) and multi-view dynamic (4D) datasets, to train a generalist spatiotemporal implicit representation capable of producing zero-shot novel videos from arbitrary camera locations and trajectories. We evaluate AnyView on standard benchmarks, showing competitive results with the current state of the art, and propose \textbf{AnyViewBench}, a challenging new benchmark tailored towards \emph{extreme} dynamic view synthesis in diverse real-world scenarios. In this more dramatic setting, we find that most baselines drastically degrade in performance, as they require significant overlap between viewpoints, while AnyView maintains the ability to produce realistic, plausible, and spatiotemporally consistent videos when prompted from \emph{any} viewpoint.

### [20] [Expert Knowledge-Guided Decision Calibration for Accurate Fine-Grained Tree Species Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16498)
*Chen Long,Dian Chen,Ruifei Ding,Zhe Chen,Zhen Dong,Bisheng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EKDC-Net introduces expert knowledge-guided calibration for fine-grained tree species classification, combining Local Prior Guided Knowledge Extraction (LPKEM) and Uncertainty-Guided Decision Calibration (UDCM). It leverages CAM-driven domain-expert input to identify discriminative features, and uncertainty-based decision calibration to refine predictions, plus a 102-species CU-Tree102 dataset; reports state-of-the-art gains with minimal parameter overhead (0.08M) and released code and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address long-tailed distributions, high inter-class similarity, and limited data in fine-grained forestry classification by incorporating external domain expert knowledge to complement data-driven methods.

Method: Two-module framework: (1) Local Prior Guided Knowledge Extraction Module (LPKEM) uses Class Activation Map (CAM) to guide a domain expert to discriminative features essential for classification; (2) Uncertainty-Guided Decision Calibration Module (UDCM) dynamically corrects local model decisions by jointly considering overall category uncertainty and instance-level prediction uncertainty. Also introduces CU-Tree102, a 102-species dataset.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks; reports backbone accuracy improvement of 6.42% and precision improvement of 11.46% with only 0.08M additional learnable parameters; dataset and code released.

Conclusion: EKDC-Net provides a lightweight, plug-and-play framework that effectively leverages expert knowledge for improved fine-grained tree species classification and enhanced calibration, with potential applicability to other domains; further ablations and cross-domain validations would clarify the generality and dependency on expert input.

Abstract: Accurate fine-grained tree species classification is critical for forest inventory and biodiversity monitoring. Existing methods predominantly focus on designing complex architectures to fit local data distributions. However, they often overlook the long-tailed distributions and high inter-class similarity inherent in limited data, thereby struggling to distinguish between few-shot or confusing categories. In the process of knowledge dissemination in the human world, individuals will actively seek expert assistance to transcend the limitations of local thinking. Inspired by this, we introduce an external "Domain Expert" and propose an Expert Knowledge-Guided Classification Decision Calibration Network (EKDC-Net) to overcome these challenges. Our framework addresses two core issues: expert knowledge extraction and utilization. Specifically, we first develop a Local Prior Guided Knowledge Extraction Module (LPKEM). By leveraging Class Activation Map (CAM) analysis, LPKEM guides the domain expert to focus exclusively on discriminative features essential for classification. Subsequently, to effectively integrate this knowledge, we design an Uncertainty-Guided Decision Calibration Module (UDCM). This module dynamically corrects the local model's decisions by considering both overall category uncertainty and instance-level prediction uncertainty. Furthermore, we present a large-scale classification dataset covering 102 tree species, named CU-Tree102 to address the issue of scarce diversity in current benchmarks. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Crucially, as a lightweight plug-and-play module, EKDC-Net improves backbone accuracy by 6.42% and precision by 11.46% using only 0.08M additional learnable parameters. The dataset, code, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/WHU-USI3DV/TreeCLS.

### [21] [SALAD: Achieve High-Sparsity Attention via Efficient Linear Attention Tuning for Video Diffusion Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16515)
*Tongcheng Fang,Hanling Zhang,Ruiqi Xie,Zhuo Han,Xin Tao,Tianchen Zhao,Pengfei Wan,Wenbo Ding,Wanli Ouyang,Xuefei Ning,Yu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SALAD introduces a parallel lightweight linear attention branch with an input-dependent gate alongside sparse attention in diffusion transformers, achieving 90% sparsity and 1.72× speedup while preserving full-attention quality; finetuning is data-efficient (2,000 video samples, 1,600 steps).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long sequence diffusion transformers suffer from quadratic attention cost; training-free sparse attention is limited in sparsity and speedup, while training-based sparsity needs substantial data/computation. The work seeks high sparsity with quality and practical training efficiency.

Method: A lightweight linear attention branch runs in parallel with the existing sparse attention branch. An input-dependent gating mechanism dynamically balances the two branches to preserve generation quality while maximizing speed. Finetuning uses a small data regimen (2,000 video samples, 1,600 steps, batch size 8).

Result: Achieves 90% sparsity and 1.72× inference speedup with generation quality comparable to the full attention baseline.

Conclusion: SALAD provides an effective, data-efficient approach to accelerate diffusion video generation by coupling sparse and linear attention through gating, achieving high sparsity and speed with maintained quality and a compact finetuning workflow.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in video generation. However, the long input sequences result in high computational latency due to the quadratic complexity of full attention. Various sparse attention mechanisms have been proposed. Training-free sparse attention is constrained by limited sparsity and thus offers modest acceleration, whereas training-based methods can reach much higher sparsity but demand substantial data and computation for training. In this work, we propose SALAD, introducing a lightweight linear attention branch in parallel with the sparse attention. By incorporating an input-dependent gating mechanism to finely balance the two branches, our method attains 90% sparsity and 1.72x inference speedup, while maintaining generation quality comparable to the full attention baseline. Moreover, our finetuning process is highly efficient, requiring only 2,000 video samples and 1,600 training steps with a batch size of 8.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A geometry-grounded TangramPuzzle benchmark and Tangram Construction Expression (TCE) framework evaluate compositional spatial reasoning in Multimodal LLMs, with two tasks (Outline Prediction and End-to-End Code Generation). Findings: models prioritize silhouette matching over strict geometric constraints, leading to distortions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs struggle with precise compositional spatial reasoning; existing benchmarks rely on coarse semantics and lack rigorous, machine-verifiable geometric grounding, leaving a gap in evaluating true spatial compositionality.

Method: Introduce TangramPuzzle, a geometry-grounded benchmark based on Tangram game; define Tangram Construction Expression (TCE) to specify exact coordinates; propose two tasks—Outline Prediction and End-to-End Code Generation; evaluate open-source and proprietary models on the benchmark.

Result: Across models, there is a bias toward matching the target silhouette at the expense of enforcing geometric constraints, resulting in distortions or deformation of pieces; the benchmark reveals a gap in current model capabilities to respect exact geometry.

Conclusion: TangramPuzzle + TCE provide a rigorous, geometry-grounded framework for evaluating compositional spatial reasoning in MLLMs and highlight the need for future work to enforce geometric constraints in model training or decoding strategies.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in visual recognition and semantic understanding. Nevertheless, their ability to perform precise compositional spatial reasoning remains largely unexplored. Existing benchmarks often involve relatively simple tasks and rely on semantic approximations or coarse relative positioning, while their evaluation metrics are typically limited and lack rigorous mathematical formulations. To bridge this gap, we introduce TangramPuzzle, a geometry-grounded benchmark designed to evaluate compositional spatial reasoning through the lens of the classic Tangram game. We propose the Tangram Construction Expression (TCE), a symbolic geometric framework that grounds tangram assemblies in exact, machine-verifiable coordinate specifications, to mitigate the ambiguity of visual approximation. We design two complementary tasks: Outline Prediction, which demands inferring global shapes from local components, and End-to-End Code Generation, which requires solving inverse geometric assembly problems. We conduct extensive evaluation experiments on advanced open-source and proprietary models, revealing an interesting insight: MLLMs tend to prioritize matching the target silhouette while neglecting geometric constraints, leading to distortions or deformations of the pieces.

*Runmao Yao,Junsheng Zhou,Zhen Dong,Yu-Shen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AnchoredDream is a zero-shot, geometry-grounded pipeline for 360° indoor scene generation from a single image, using appearance-geometry mutual boosting and modules (warp-and-inpaint, warp-and-refine, post-optimization, Grouting Block) to ensure seamless transitions and high appearance-geometry consistency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-view 360° indoor scene generation is highly ill-posed. While diffusion models and depth estimators help, they struggle to maintain appearance consistency and geometric plausibility under large viewpoint changes, limiting zero-shot full-scene generation.

Method: 1) Appearance-guided geometry generation to build a reliable 3D scene layout. 2) Progressive scene synthesis via modules: warp-and-inpaint, warp-and-refine, post-optimization, and Grouting Block to ensure seamless transitions between input view and generated regions. 3) An appearance-geometry mutual boosting mechanism anchors 360° generation on high-fidelity geometry.

Result: AnchoredDream reportedly achieves a large improvement over existing methods in appearance consistency and geometric plausibility in a zero-shot setting, as demonstrated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Geometric grounding enhances zero-shot single-view 360° indoor scene generation, with the Grouting Block and the appearance-geometry mutual boosting enabling more seamless transitions and plausible geometry.

Abstract: Single-view indoor scene generation plays a crucial role in a range of real-world applications. However, generating a complete 360° scene from a single image remains a highly ill-posed and challenging problem. Recent approaches have made progress by leveraging diffusion models and depth estimation networks, yet they still struggle to maintain appearance consistency and geometric plausibility under large viewpoint changes, limiting their effectiveness in full-scene generation. To address this, we propose AnchoredDream, a novel zero-shot pipeline that anchors 360° scene generation on high-fidelity geometry via an appearance-geometry mutual boosting mechanism. Given a single-view image, our method first performs appearance-guided geometry generation to construct a reliable 3D scene layout. Then, we progressively generate the complete scene through a series of modules: warp-and-inpaint, warp-and-refine, post-optimization, and a novel Grouting Block, which ensures seamless transitions between the input view and generated regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchoredDream outperforms existing methods by a large margin in both appearance consistency and geometric plausibility--all in a zero-shot manner. Our results highlight the potential of geometric grounding for high-quality, zero-shot single-view scene generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OnlineSI enables continuous spatial understanding in multimodal LLMs by maintaining a finite memory of past observations and fusing 3D point clouds with semantics, evaluated with a fuzzy F1-score on two datasets to support embodied-world deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MLLMs lack sustained spatial reasoning in dynamic, real-world environments and are not readily deployable on embodied systems, limiting long-term autonomy and robustness.

Method: Maintain a bounded spatial memory to prevent growing computation per inference, integrate 3D point cloud data with semantic information to improve object localization and identification, and introduce a fuzzy F1-Score to handle ambiguity in evaluation; test on two representative datasets.

Result: Empirical results indicate improved spatial understanding and robustness of the model in long-duration or evolving scenarios, demonstrating potential for real-world embodied deployment.

Conclusion: OnlineSI advances open-world, continuous spatial reasoning for embodied systems by combining bounded memory with multimodal fusion and a tolerant evaluation metric.

Abstract: In recent years, researchers have increasingly been interested in how to enable Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) to possess spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities. However, most existing methods overlook the importance of the ability to continuously work in an ever-changing world, and lack the possibility of deployment on embodied systems in real-world environments. In this work, we introduce OnlineSI, a framework that can continuously improve its spatial understanding of its surroundings given a video stream. Our core idea is to maintain a finite spatial memory to retain past observations, ensuring the computation required for each inference does not increase as the input accumulates. We further integrate 3D point cloud information with semantic information, helping MLLM to better locate and identify objects in the scene. To evaluate our method, we introduce the Fuzzy $F_1$-Score to mitigate ambiguity, and test our method on two representative datasets. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, paving the way towards real-world embodied systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semi-supervised hierarchical open-set classification via a teacher-student framework using subtree pseudo-labels and age-gating; achieves strong data efficiency on iNaturalist19, rivaling full supervision with limited labels; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable effective hierarchical open-set learning when data is large and uncurated, containing known and unknown classes, by leveraging semi-supervised pseudo-labeling to improve performance while avoiding overconfident predictions.

Method: A teacher-student framework that uses pseudo-labels. Introduces subtree pseudo-labels to supervise unknown data within a taxonomic hierarchy and age-gating to prevent overconfidence in pseudo-labels. Trains on mixed labeled/unlabeled data to improve hierarchical open-set performance.

Result: Outperforms self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised adaptation and, on iNaturalist19, matches fully supervised performance using only 20 labeled samples per class.

Conclusion: The proposed semi-supervised approach with subtree pseudo-labels and age-gating provides effective performance gains for hierarchical open-set classification and is data-efficient, with publicly available code for reproducibility.

Abstract: Hierarchical open-set classification handles previously unseen classes by assigning them to the most appropriate high-level category in a class taxonomy. We extend this paradigm to the semi-supervised setting, enabling the use of large-scale, uncurated datasets containing a mixture of known and unknown classes to improve the hierarchical open-set performance. To this end, we propose a teacher-student framework based on pseudo-labeling. Two key components are introduced: 1) subtree pseudo-labels, which provide reliable supervision in the presence of unknown data, and 2) age-gating, a mechanism that mitigates overconfidence in pseudo-labels. Experiments show that our framework outperforms self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised adaptation, and even matches the fully supervised counterpart when using only 20 labeled samples per class on the iNaturalist19 benchmark.

Method: Propose HA2F, comprising DHFCM that fuses adjacent-level features through perceptual feature selection to align multi-temporal features, and NAFRM that uses dual feature selection to highlight change-sensitive regions and generate spatial masks, suppressing irrelevant regions and shadows. Emphasizes hierarchical and noisy conditions through adaptive aggregation.

Result: Extensive experiments show HA2F achieves state-of-the-art performance on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, SYSU-CD, outperforming existing methods in precision and computational efficiency. Ablation studies confirm effectiveness of both DHFCM and NAFRM.

Conclusion: HA2F offers a robust, efficient solution for RSCD by integrating dynamic hierarchical calibration with noise-adaptive refinement, improving both accuracy and efficiency across multiple CD datasets.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify the spatio-temporal changes of land cover, providing critical support for multi-disciplinary applications (e.g., environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and climate change studies). Existing methods focus either on extracting features from localized patches, or pursue processing entire images holistically, which leads to the cross temporal feature matching deviation and exhibiting sensitivity to radiometric and geometric noise. Following the above issues, we propose a dual-module collaboration guided hierarchical adaptive aggregation framework, namely HA2F, which consists of dynamic hierarchical feature calibration module (DHFCM) and noise-adaptive feature refinement module (NAFRM). The former dynamically fuses adjacent-level features through perceptual feature selection, suppressing irrelevant discrepancies to address multi-temporal feature alignment deviations. The NAFRM utilizes the dual feature selection mechanism to highlight the change sensitive regions and generate spatial masks, suppressing the interference of irrelevant regions or shadows. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed HA2F, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD datasets, surpassing existing comparative methods in terms of both precision metrics and computational efficiency. In addition, ablation experiments show that DHFCM and NAFRM are effective. \href{https://huggingface.co/InPeerReview/RemoteSensingChangeDetection-RSCD.HA2F}{HA2F Official Code is Available Here!}

*Yuqian Zheng,Mariana-Iuliana Georgescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a novel CoVR framework that uses a cross-attention module (X-Aligner) to progressively fuse visual and textual inputs and align with the target video, incorporating the caption as an extra input. Trains in two stages to preserve pretrained VLMs, built on BLIP/BLIP-2, evaluated on Webvid-CoVR with state-of-the-art Recall@1 (63.93%) and shows strong zero-shot CIR generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing CoVR methods fuse modalities in a single stage, yielding limited gains. Leveraging powerful Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with progressive cross-modal alignment and richer textual inputs (captions) can boost multimodal representations and retrieval performance.

Method: Introduce X-Aligner, a cross-attention module that progressively fuses visual and textual inputs and aligns them with the target video representation. Include the caption of the visual query as additional input. Train in two stages: stage 1 train only the new module; stage 2 fine-tune the textual query encoder. Implemented on BLIP/BLIP-2 architectures and trained on Webvid-CoVR data; evaluate in-domain on Webvid-CoVR-Test and zero-shot on CIRCO and Fashion-IQ.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on CoVR with Recall@1 = 63.93% on Webvid-CoVR-Test. Demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on CIR tasks (CIRCO, Fashion-IQ).

Conclusion: Progressive cross-modal fusion via X-Aligner and the inclusion of caption input, combined with a two-stage training strategy over pretrained BLIP models, yields significant CoVR gains and good cross-domain generalization while preserving VLM representations.

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CoVR) facilitates video retrieval by combining visual and textual queries. However, existing CoVR frameworks typically fuse multimodal inputs in a single stage, achieving only marginal gains over initial baseline. To address this, we propose a novel CoVR framework that leverages the representational power of Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our framework incorporates a novel cross-attention module X-Aligner, composed of cross-attention layers that progressively fuse visual and textual inputs and align their multimodal representation with that of the target video. To further enhance the representation of the multimodal query, we incorporate the caption of the visual query as an additional input. The framework is trained in two stages to preserve the pretrained VLM representation. In the first stage, only the newly introduced module is trained, while in the second stage, the textual query encoder is also fine-tuned. We implement our framework on top of BLIP-family architecture, namely BLIP and BLIP-2, and train it on the Webvid-CoVR data set. In addition to in-domain evaluation on Webvid-CoVR-Test, we perform zero-shot evaluations on the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) data sets CIRCO and Fashion-IQ. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on CoVR obtaining a Recall@1 of 63.93% on Webvid-CoVR-Test, and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization on CIR tasks.

Method: Backbone: MobileNetV2 pretrained via a SimCLR-style self-supervised objective on unlabeled data. A lightweight parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) is embedded as a quantum feature enhancer, forming a hybrid classical-quantum architecture. The model is then fine-tuned on limited labeled data.

Conclusion: This work demonstrates a practical and forward-looking solution for high-performance medical AI under resource-constrained settings, highlighting the viability of integrating self-supervised learning with quantum feature modeling in medical imaging.

Abstract: Intelligent medical image analysis is essential for clinical decision support but is often limited by scarce annotations, constrained computational resources, and suboptimal model generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight medical image classification framework that integrates self-supervised contrastive learning with quantum-enhanced feature modeling. MobileNetV2 is employed as a compact backbone and pretrained using a SimCLR-style self-supervised paradigm on unlabeled images. A lightweight parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) is embedded as a quantum feature enhancement module, forming a hybrid classical-quantum architecture, which is subsequently fine-tuned on limited labeled data. Experimental results demonstrate that, with only approximately 2-3 million parameters and low computational cost, the proposed method consistently outperforms classical baselines without self-supervised learning or quantum enhancement in terms of Accuracy, AUC, and F1-score. Feature visualization further indicates improved discriminability and representation stability. Overall, this work provides a practical and forward-looking solution for high-performance medical artificial intelligence under resource-constrained settings.

*Rongxin Huang,Guangfeng Lin,Wenbo Zhou,Zhirong Li,Wenhuan Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BPIM is a boundary-position-information mining framework for small object detection in UAV imagery, integrating PIG, BIG, CSF, TFF, AWF to fuse boundary, position, and scale cues; yields improved performance over Yolov5-P2 on VisDrone2021, DOTA1.0, and WiderPerson with comparable compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Small object detection from UAV images is hampered by scale imbalance and blurred edges; boundary and location cues are underutilized; need a framework that fuses multi-scale and edge cues with attention.

Method: BPIM comprises PIG, BIG, CSF, TFF, AWF modules designed to extract and fuse position, boundary, and semantic features across scales, using attention mechanisms and adaptive weighting to merge deep features; cross-scale fusion gradually aggregates shallow features; TFF progressively combines cues; AWF adaptively merges deep semantic features with boundary/position cues.

Result: Empirical results on VisDrone2021, DOTA1.0, WiderPerson show BPIM outperforms baseline Yolov5-P2 and is competitive with state-of-the-art methods with comparable computation load.

Conclusion: BPIM effectively integrates boundary, position, and scale information for robust small object detection in UAV imagery, offering improved discrimination of contextual features and enhanced small object perception via cross-scale fusion.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) applications have become increasingly prevalent in aerial photography and object recognition. However, there are major challenges to accurately capturing small targets in object detection due to the imbalanced scale and the blurred edges. To address these issues, boundary and position information mining (BPIM) framework is proposed for capturing object edge and location cues. The proposed BPIM includes position information guidance (PIG) module for obtaining location information, boundary information guidance (BIG) module for extracting object edge, cross scale fusion (CSF) module for gradually assembling the shallow layer image feature, three feature fusion (TFF) module for progressively combining position and boundary information, and adaptive weight fusion (AWF) module for flexibly merging the deep layer semantic feature. Therefore, BPIM can integrate boundary, position, and scale information in image for small object detection using attention mechanisms and cross-scale feature fusion strategies. Furthermore, BPIM not only improves the discrimination of the contextual feature by adaptive weight fusion with boundary, but also enhances small object perceptions by cross-scale position fusion. On the VisDrone2021, DOTA1.0, and WiderPerson datasets, experimental results show the better performances of BPIM compared to the baseline Yolov5-P2, and obtains the promising performance in the state-of-the-art methods with comparable computation load.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing need for high-quality facial data for biometric systems is hampered by privacy regulations, data scarcity, and ethical concerns. Synthetic data can mitigate these issues if it preserves identity signals, realism, and diversity while remaining privacy-safe.

Method: SCHIGAND fuses StyleCLIP, HyperStyle, InterfaceGAN, and diffusion models to create controllable facial datasets.

ArcFace-based evaluation demonstrates that synthetic data can be effective for biometric testing and may supplement or replace real data under privacy constraints, addressing limitations of prior generative models.

Conclusion: SCHIGAND offers a scalable, privacy-conscious approach to synthetic facial dataset generation, with potential to supplement or replace real data in biometric applications and to advance privacy-compliant testing workflows.

Abstract: The growing demand for diverse and high-quality facial datasets for training and testing biometric systems is challenged by privacy regulations, data scarcity, and ethical concerns. Synthetic facial images offer a potential solution, yet existing generative models often struggle to balance realism, diversity, and identity preservation. This paper presents SCHIGAND, a novel synthetic face generation pipeline integrating StyleCLIP, HyperStyle, InterfaceGAN, and Diffusion models to produce highly realistic and controllable facial datasets. SCHIGAND enhances identity preservation while generating realistic intra-class variations and maintaining inter-class distinctiveness, making it suitable for biometric testing. The generated datasets were evaluated using ArcFace, a leading facial verification model, to assess their effectiveness in comparison to real-world facial datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SCHIGAND achieves a balance between image quality and diversity, addressing key limitations of prior generative models. This research highlights the potential of SCHIGAND to supplement and, in some cases, replace real data for facial biometric applications, paving the way for privacy-compliant and scalable solutions in synthetic dataset generation.

*Minsu Gong,Nuri Ryu,Jungseul Ok,Sunghyun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Structure Preservation Loss (SPL) to keep pixel-level structure in latent diffusion model editing, via a training-free, local linear-model-based objective integrated into the diffusion process, with post-processing, masking, and color-preservation enhancements; achieves state-of-the-art structural fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent diffusion-based image edits often distort fine edge structures needed for photorealism (e.g., style transfer, tone adjustment). A method that preserves structural edges during editing is highly desirable without heavy retraining.

Method: Proposes a training-free Structure Preservation Loss (SPL) that uses local linear models to quantify and constrain structural differences between input and edited images. SPL is integrated into the diffusion model's generative process. Additional components include a post-processing step to reduce decoding distortions, a masking strategy for precise edit localization, and a color preservation loss to maintain hues in unedited regions.

Result: Experimental results show SPL improves structural fidelity and yields state-of-the-art performance for latent-diffusion-based image editing.

Conclusion: SPL provides a practical, training-free mechanism to preserve pixel-level structure in LDM edits, boosting structural fidelity and overall editing quality, with code to be released publicly.

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing leverage latent diffusion models (LDMs) for versatile, text-prompt-driven edits across diverse tasks. Yet, maintaining pixel-level edge structures-crucial for tasks such as photorealistic style transfer or image tone adjustment-remains as a challenge for latent-diffusion-based editing. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Structure Preservation Loss (SPL) that leverages local linear models to quantify structural differences between input and edited images. Our training-free approach integrates SPL directly into the diffusion model's generative process to ensure structural fidelity. This core mechanism is complemented by a post-processing step to mitigate LDM decoding distortions, a masking strategy for precise edit localization, and a color preservation loss to preserve hues in unedited areas. Experiments confirm SPL enhances structural fidelity, delivering state-of-the-art performance in latent-diffusion-based image editing. Our code will be publicly released at https://github.com/gongms00/SPL.

### [33] [ReWeaver: Towards Simulation-Ready and Topology-Accurate Garment Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16672)
*Ming Li,Hui Shan,Kai Zheng,Chentao Shen,Siyu Liu,Yanwei Fu,Zhen Chen,Xiangru Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReWeaver is a framework for topology-accurate 3D garment reconstruction from sparse multi-view RGBs, predicting sewing seams, panels, and their 2D/3D connectivities to enable high-fidelity simulation; it uses a large synthetic dataset (GCD-TS) and outperforms prior methods in topology accuracy and geometry alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current garment reconstruction methods rely on unstructured representations (e.g., Gaussian splats) and struggle to recover garment topology and sewing structures, limiting physical simulation and robotic manipulation. A topology-aware reconstruction from few views is needed to bridge the sim-to-real gap.

Method: ReWeaver predicts garment seams, panels, and their connectivities in both 2D UV space and 3D space from as few as four input views. It produces topology-accurate, structured 2D–3D garment representations (seams/panels) aligned with multi-view images. Training is supported by a large-scale synthetic dataset (GCD-TS) with multi-view RGBs, 3D garments, textured body meshes, and annotated sewing patterns (over 100k samples).

Result: Empirical evaluation shows ReWeaver consistently outperforms existing methods in topology accuracy, geometry alignment, and seam-panel consistency across diverse garments/topologies.

Conclusion: ReWeaver enables topology-accurate garment reconstruction from sparse views, yielding representations suitable for high-fidelity physical simulation and manipulation, with a supporting large-scale dataset that facilitates training and broader application.

Abstract: High-quality 3D garment reconstruction plays a crucial role in mitigating the sim-to-real gap in applications such as digital avatars, virtual try-on and robotic manipulation. However, existing garment reconstruction methods typically rely on unstructured representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splats, struggling to provide accurate reconstructions of garment topology and sewing structures. As a result, the reconstructed outputs are often unsuitable for high-fidelity physical simulation. We propose ReWeaver, a novel framework for topology-accurate 3D garment and sewing pattern reconstruction from sparse multi-view RGB images. Given as few as four input views, ReWeaver predicts seams and panels as well as their connectivities in both the 2D UV space and the 3D space. The predicted seams and panels align precisely with the multi-view images, yielding structured 2D--3D garment representations suitable for 3D perception, high-fidelity physical simulation, and robotic manipulation. To enable effective training, we construct a large-scale dataset GCD-TS, comprising multi-view RGB images, 3D garment geometries, textured human body meshes and annotated sewing patterns. The dataset contains over 100,000 synthetic samples covering a wide range of complex geometries and topologies. Extensive experiments show that ReWeaver consistently outperforms existing methods in terms of topology accuracy, geometry alignment and seam-panel consistency.

*Hongda Liu,Yunfan Liu,Min Ren,Lin Sui,Yunlong Wang,Zhenan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACLNet introduces Affinity Contrastive Learning with activity superclasses, dynamic temperature, and margin-based contrast to exploit inter-class similarities in skeleton-based learning; shows improvements across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional contrastive skeleton-based methods overlook inter-class affinity and the impact of anomalous positives; there is a need to exploit affinity among classes and robust positive/negative mining to strengthen feature discrimination.

Method: Compute an affinity metric to refine similarity measurements and form activity superclasses; apply a dynamic temperature schedule to adapt penalty strength for different superclasses; use a margin-based contrastive loss to better separate hard positives and negatives within classes.

Result: Achieves superior performance on NTU RGB+D 60/120, Kinetics-Skeleton, PKU-MMD, FineGYM, and CASIA-B across action recognition, gait recognition, and person re-identification tasks.

Conclusion: Affinity-driven superclass construction and margin-based contrast with a dynamic temperature schedule improve discriminative representation learning in skeleton-based tasks and generalize across related domains.

Abstract: In skeleton-based human activity understanding, existing methods often adopt the contrastive learning paradigm to construct a discriminative feature space. However, many of these approaches fail to exploit the structural inter-class similarities and overlook the impact of anomalous positive samples. In this study, we introduce ACLNet, an Affinity Contrastive Learning Network that explores the intricate clustering relationships among human activity classes to improve feature discrimination. Specifically, we propose an affinity metric to refine similarity measurements, thereby forming activity superclasses that provide more informative contrastive signals. A dynamic temperature schedule is also introduced to adaptively adjust the penalty strength for various superclasses. In addition, we employ a margin-based contrastive strategy to improve the separation of hard positive and negative samples within classes. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, PKU-MMD, FineGYM, and CASIA-B demonstrate the superiority of our method in skeleton-based action recognition, gait recognition, and person re-identification.

### [35] [CER-HV: A CER-Based Human-in-the-Loop Framework for Cleaning Datasets Applied to Arabic-Script HTR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16713)
*Sana Al-azzawi,Elisa Barney,Marcus Liwicki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CER-HV framework detects and cleans label errors in Arabic-script HTR using a CER-based detector with human verification; yields improved data quality and state-of-the-art CER on multiple datasets; generalizable to other scripts.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data quality is a major bottleneck in Arabic-script HTR. Published datasets suffer from transcription, segmentation, orientation, and non-text errors; automated detection plus human verification proposed to clean labels.

Method: CER-HV combines a CER-based noise detector built on a carefully configured CRNN with early stopping to prevent overfitting noisy samples, and a human-in-the-loop step that verifies high-ranking samples; evaluated on six datasets across Arabic-script languages.

Result: CRNN achieves state-of-the-art CER on KHATT (8.45%), PHTI (8.26%), Ajami (10.66%), and Muharaf (10.11%); baseline CER on PHTD is 11.3%. CER-HV improves evaluation CER by 0.3-0.6% on cleaner datasets and 1.0-1.8% on noisier ones; Muharaf and PHTI contain previously underreported issues detected with high precision (up to 90% and 80-86%); framework is data-cleaning beneficial.

Conclusion: CER-HV is a general framework for detecting and curating labels in OCR datasets, improving evaluation CER and revealing data-quality problems; applicable to other text-recognition datasets beyond Arabic-script languages.

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition (HTR) for Arabic-script languages still lags behind Latin-script HTR, despite recent advances in model architectures, datasets, and benchmarks. We show that data quality is a significant limiting factor in many published datasets and propose CER-HV (CER-based Ranking with Human Verification) as a framework to detect and clean label errors. CER-HV combines a CER-based noise detector, built on a carefully configured Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) with early stopping to avoid overfitting noisy samples, and a human-in-the-loop (HITL) step that verifies high-ranking samples. The framework reveals that several existing datasets contain previously underreported problems, including transcription, segmentation, orientation, and non-text content errors. These have been identified with up to 90 percent precision in the Muharaf and 80-86 percent in the PHTI datasets.
  We also show that our CRNN achieves state-of-the-art performance across five of the six evaluated datasets, reaching 8.45 percent Character Error Rate (CER) on KHATT (Arabic), 8.26 percent on PHTI (Pashto), 10.66 percent on Ajami, and 10.11 percent on Muharaf (Arabic), all without any data cleaning. We establish a new baseline of 11.3 percent CER on the PHTD (Persian) dataset. Applying CER-HV improves the evaluation CER by 0.3-0.6 percent on the cleaner datasets and 1.0-1.8 percent on the noisier ones. Although our experiments focus on documents written in an Arabic-script language, including Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Ajami, and Pashto, the framework is general and can be applied to other text recognition datasets.

### [36] [Using Shadows in Circular Synthetic Aperture Sonar Imaging for Target Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16733)
*Yann Le Gall,Nicolas Burlet,Mathieu Simon,Fabien Novella,Samantha Dugelay,Jean-Philippe Malkasse*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CSAS shadows recovered via sub-aperture filtering and fixed-focus shadow enhancement to enable space-carving 3D reconstruction, with an interactive visualization interface.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In CSAS, object shadows are often suppressed by the need for azimuth coverage and high-resolution imaging; shadows contain valuable 3D shape cues for target analysis and recognition in mine warfare.

Method: Generate multiple views along the circular path using sub-aperture filtering; apply fixed-focus shadow enhancement (FFSE) to sharpen shadows; provide an interactive interface for shadow visualization; use space-carving to infer 3D object shape from segmented shadows.

Result: Preliminary results indicate that recovered shadows augment CSAS for target analysis and enable plausible 3D reconstructions, demonstrating the potential of shadows in circular SAS.

Conclusion: Shadow information in CSAS can enhance target recognition and enable 3D reconstruction; the proposed workflow shows promise, with avenues for quantitative validation and real-data experiments.

Abstract: Circular Synthetic Aperture Sonar (CSAS) provides a 360° azimuth view of the seabed, surpassing the limited aperture and mono-view image of conventional side-scan SAS. This makes CSAS a valuable tool for target recognition in mine warfare where the diversity of point of view is essential for reducing false alarms. CSAS processing typically produces a very high-resolution two-dimensional image. However, the parallax introduced by the circular displacement of the illuminator fill-in the shadow regions, and the shadow cast by an object on the seafloor is lost in favor of azimuth coverage and resolution. Yet the shadows provide complementary information on target shape useful for target recognition. In this paper, we explore a way to retrieve shadow information from CSAS data to improve target analysis and carry 3D reconstruction. Sub-aperture filtering is used to get a collection of images at various points of view along the circular trajectory and fixed focus shadow enhancement (FFSE) is applied to obtain sharp shadows. An interactive interface is also proposed to allow human operators to visualize these shadows along the circular trajectory. A space-carving reconstruction method is applied to infer the 3D shape of the object from the segmented shadows. The results demonstrate the potential of shadows in circular SAS for improving target analysis and 3D reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Identifies two optimization couplings in 3D Gaussian Splatting (update-step coupling and gradient coupling in the moment), decouples optimization into Sparse Adam, Re-State Regularization, and Decoupled Attribute Regularization, and then re-couples components to form AdamW-GS, achieving improved optimization efficiency and representation quality in 3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address overlooked optimization details in 3DGS that arise from its explicit primitive-based representation, specifically the update-step coupling that causes state rescaling and outside-view attribute updates, and gradient coupling in moments that leads to under-/over-regularization.

Method: Perform a theoretical and empirical study of 3DGS optimization; propose decoupled components (Sparse Adam, Re-State Regularization, Decoupled Attribute Regularization); conduct extensive experiments on 3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC; redesign the optimizer by re-coupling beneficial components into AdamW-GS.

Result: Empirical analysis shows that the proposed decoupled components improve optimization efficiency and representation quality; the re-coupled AdamW-GS further enhances performance.

Conclusion: Tailoring optimizers to the structural peculiarities of 3DGS yields better convergence and rendering quality; AdamW-GS provides a practical, effective optimization framework for 3DGS and related approaches.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful technique for real-time novel view synthesis. As an explicit representation optimized through gradient propagation among primitives, optimization widely accepted in deep neural networks (DNNs) is actually adopted in 3DGS, such as synchronous weight updating and Adam with the adaptive gradient. However, considering the physical significance and specific design in 3DGS, there are two overlooked details in the optimization of 3DGS: (i) update step coupling, which induces optimizer state rescaling and costly attribute updates outside the viewpoints, and (ii) gradient coupling in the moment, which may lead to under- or over-effective regularization. Nevertheless, such a complex coupling is under-explored. After revisiting the optimization of 3DGS, we take a step to decouple it and recompose the process into: Sparse Adam, Re-State Regularization and Decoupled Attribute Regularization. Taking a large number of experiments under the 3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC frameworks, our work provides a deeper understanding of these components. Finally, based on the empirical analysis, we re-design the optimization and propose AdamW-GS by re-coupling the beneficial components, under which better optimization efficiency and representation effectiveness are achieved simultaneously.

### [39] [Flow Matching for Probabilistic Monocular 3D Human Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16763)
*Cuong Le,Pavló Melnyk,Bastian Wandt,Mårten Wadenbäck*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A probabilistic 3D human pose estimation method (FMPose) that uses flow matching generative modeling conditioned on 2D cues to produce plausible 3D pose distributions via continuous normalizing flows, leveraging graph-convolutional conditioning on joints; it outperforms diffusion-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art results on Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D human pose lifting from a single monocular view is highly ill-posed due to depth ambiguity, and prior methods often yield overconfident, incorrect 3D estimates. A probabilistic framework that models the full pose distribution can better capture uncertainty and produce more reliable estimations.

Method: The method, FMPose, employs a flow-matching generative approach conditioned on 2D cues. It learns optimal transport from a simple source distribution to the plausible 3D pose distribution via continuous normalizing flows. 2D lifting information is modeled with graph convolutional networks that exploit the body joint graph structure for feature aggregation. Compared with diffusion-based methods, FMPose aims to generate faster and more accurate 3D poses.

Result: Experimental results show major improvements of FMPose over current state-of-the-art methods on three standard benchmarks for 3D human pose estimation: Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW.

Conclusion: FMPose provides a fast and accurate probabilistic framework for 3D human pose estimation from monocular images by combining flow-matching optimal transport with CNF-based sampling, conditioned on 2D cues via graph-based joint representations, and sets new state-of-the-art on key benchmarks.

Abstract: Recovering 3D human poses from a monocular camera view is a highly ill-posed problem due to the depth ambiguity. Earlier studies on 3D human pose lifting from 2D often contain incorrect-yet-overconfident 3D estimations. To mitigate the problem, emerging probabilistic approaches treat the 3D estimations as a distribution, taking into account the uncertainty measurement of the poses. Falling in a similar category, we proposed FMPose, a probabilistic 3D human pose estimation method based on the flow matching generative approach. Conditioned on the 2D cues, the flow matching scheme learns the optimal transport from a simple source distribution to the plausible 3D human pose distribution via continuous normalizing flows. The 2D lifting condition is modeled via graph convolutional networks, leveraging the learnable connections between human body joints as the graph structure for feature aggregation. Compared to diffusion-based methods, the FMPose with optimal transport produces faster and more accurate 3D pose generations. Experimental results show major improvements of our FMPose over current state-of-the-art methods on three common benchmarks for 3D human pose estimation, namely Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP and 3DPW.

### [40] [AutoRegressive Generation with B-rep Holistic Token Sequence Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16771)
*Jiahao Li,Yunpeng Bai,Yongkang Dai,Hao Guo,Hongping Gan,Yilei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First holistic token-sequence representation for B-rep enabling transformer-based autoregressive generation; achieves SOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of graph-based B-rep representations that disentangle geometry and topology, which hinders the application of sequence models like transformers.

Method: Encode B-rep into three token types: geometry/position tokens for geometric features and face index tokens for topology. Build a hierarchical sequence by first constructing geometry blocks (faces/edges) using these tokens, then sequencing the geometry blocks, and finally assembling the full B-rep sequence. Train a decoder-only transformer with causal masking to model the distribution over holistic token sequences via next-token prediction.

Result: Empirical results show state-of-the-art performance; demonstrates feasibility of representing B-rep as holistic token sequences and enables new directions for B-rep generation.

Conclusion: BrepARG demonstrates that holistic token-based encoding of B-rep is feasible and effective, enabling sequence-based B-rep generation with transformer architectures and opening new research directions.

Abstract: Previous representation and generation approaches for the B-rep relied on graph-based representations that disentangle geometric and topological features through decoupled computational pipelines, thereby precluding the application of sequence-based generative frameworks, such as transformer architectures that have demonstrated remarkable performance. In this paper, we propose BrepARG, the first attempt to encode B-rep's geometry and topology into a holistic token sequence representation, enabling sequence-based B-rep generation with an autoregressive architecture. Specifically, BrepARG encodes B-rep into 3 types of tokens: geometry and position tokens representing geometric features, and face index tokens representing topology. Then the holistic token sequence is constructed hierarchically, starting with constructing the geometry blocks (i.e., faces and edges) using the above tokens, followed by geometry block sequencing. Finally, we assemble the holistic sequence representation for the entire B-rep. We also construct a transformer-based autoregressive model that learns the distribution over holistic token sequences via next-token prediction, using a multi-layer decoder-only architecture with causal masking. Experiments demonstrate that BrepARG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BrepARG validates the feasibility of representing B-rep as holistic token sequences, opening new directions for B-rep generation.

### [41] [CASP: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning with CLS Token Attention Steering Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16773)
*Shuai Huang,Xuhan Lin,Yuwu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CASP introduces CLS-token attention steering by adding class-shared biases to the CLS token's Q/K/V projections, plus attention perturbation and Manifold Token Mixup. It achieves superior FSCIL performance with less parameter overhead and no incremental fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve generalization and transfer in extreme FSCIL by leveraging pretrained knowledge and shared representations, addressing rapid adaptation to new classes with minimal data.

Method: Integrates class-shared trainable bias parameters into CLS token Q/K/V projections to steer self-attention; employs attention perturbation; uses Manifold Token Mixup in shallow feature space to synthesize new class features; evaluated on FSCIL benchmarks (CUB200, CIFAR100, ImageNet-R) with non-finetuning during incremental phases.

Result: CASP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both standard and fine-grained FSCIL settings, with reduced parameter overhead and without requiring fine-tuning during incremental phases.

Conclusion: Explicitly steering CLS-based self-attention with shared biases and augmentation strategies yields better generalization and efficiency for FSCIL; the approach highlights the usefulness of pretrained knowledge and token-level augmentations for continual learning.

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) presents a core challenge in continual learning, requiring models to rapidly adapt to new classes with very limited samples while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Recent prompt-based methods, which integrate pretrained backbones with task-specific prompts, have made notable progress. However, under extreme few-shot incremental settings, the model's ability to transfer and generalize becomes critical, and it is thus essential to leverage pretrained knowledge to learn feature representations that can be shared across future categories during the base session. Inspired by the mechanism of the CLS token, which is similar to human attention and progressively filters out task-irrelevant information, we propose the CLS Token Attention Steering Prompts (CASP). This approach introduces class-shared trainable bias parameters into the query, key, and value projections of the CLS token to explicitly modulate the self-attention weights. To further enhance generalization, we also design an attention perturbation strategy and perform Manifold Token Mixup in the shallow feature space, synthesizing potential new class features to improve generalization and reserve the representation capacity for upcoming tasks. Experiments on the CUB200, CIFAR100, and ImageNet-R datasets demonstrate that CASP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both standard and fine-grained FSCIL settings without requiring fine-tuning during incremental phases and while significantly reducing the parameter overhead.

### [42] [SLD: Segmentation-Based Landmark Detection for Spinal Ligaments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16782)
*Lara Blomenkamp,Ivanna Kramer,Sabine Bauer,Theresa Schöche*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A shape-based vertebral segmentation pipeline with rule-based landmark detection to locate spinal ligament attachments; achieves high accuracy and generalizes across spinal regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise identification of ligament attachment landmarks is essential for realistic spine simulations; current automated methods are region-limited or insufficiently accurate.

Method: First segment vertebrae in 3D using shape-based segmentation; then apply domain-specific rules to identify different ligament attachment points on adjacent vertebrae; landmarks serve as attachment vectors for ligament modeling.

Result: Outperforms existing approaches; MAE 0.7 mm; RMSE 1.1 mm on two independent spinal datasets from multiple patients; demonstrates strong generalization across all spinal regions.

Conclusion: The approach provides accurate, region-generalizable landmark detection for spine biomechanics, enabling more reliable ligament force predictions in simulations.

Abstract: In biomechanical modeling, the representation of ligament attachments is crucial for a realistic simulation of the forces acting between the vertebrae. These forces are typically modeled as vectors connecting ligament landmarks on adjacent vertebrae, making precise identification of these landmarks a key requirement for constructing reliable spine models. Existing automated detection methods are either limited to specific spinal regions or lack sufficient accuracy. This work presents a novel approach for detecting spinal ligament landmarks, which first performs shape-based segmentation of 3D vertebrae and subsequently applies domain-specific rules to identify different types of attachment points. The proposed method outperforms existing approaches by achieving high accuracy and demonstrating strong generalization across all spinal regions. Validation on two independent spinal datasets from multiple patients yielded a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.7 mm and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.1 mm.

### [43] [Incorporating Eye-Tracking Signals Into Multimodal Deep Visual Models For Predicting User Aesthetic Experience In Residential Interiors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16811)
*Chen-Ying Chien,Po-Chih Kuo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dual-branch CNN-LSTM using eye-tracking signals to predict interior aesthetics; achieves 72.2% accuracy for objective dimensions and 66.8% for subjective dimensions; eye-tracking helps during training; pupil signals mainly aid objective predictions; gaze+visual cues boost subjective predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aesthetic prediction in interior design is inherently subjective and multimodal. Incorporating eye-tracking signals (privileged information) can improve model performance and yield more practical tools for design evaluation.

Method: A dual-branch CNN-LSTM model fuses visual features with synchronized eye-tracking data. Training data comprise 224 interior design videos with gaze data from 28 participants, who rated 15 aesthetic dimensions. Evaluations include objective vs. subjective dimensions and ablation analyses comparing visual-only, gaze-only, and fused inputs against state-of-the-art video baselines.

Result: Quantitative: 72.2% accuracy on objective dimensions; 66.8% on subjective dimensions. Outperforms state-of-the-art video baselines. Models trained with eye-tracking retain comparable performance when deployed with visual input alone. Ablations: pupil responses contribute most to objective assessments; combining gaze and visual cues improves subjective evaluations.

Conclusion: Eye-tracking as privileged information during training enhances aesthetic assessment tools in interior design, particularly for subjective judgments, enabling practical deployment with visual input alone.

Abstract: Understanding how people perceive and evaluate interior spaces is essential for designing environments that promote well-being. However, predicting aesthetic experiences remains difficult due to the subjective nature of perception and the complexity of visual responses. This study introduces a dual-branch CNN-LSTM framework that fuses visual features with eye-tracking signals to predict aesthetic evaluations of residential interiors. We collected a dataset of 224 interior design videos paired with synchronized gaze data from 28 participants who rated 15 aesthetic dimensions. The proposed model attains 72.2% accuracy on objective dimensions (e.g., light) and 66.8% on subjective dimensions (e.g., relaxation), outperforming state-of-the-art video baselines and showing clear gains on subjective evaluation tasks. Notably, models trained with eye-tracking retain comparable performance when deployed with visual input alone. Ablation experiments further reveal that pupil responses contribute most to objective assessments, while the combination of gaze and visual cues enhances subjective evaluations. These findings highlight the value of incorporating eye-tracking as privileged information during training, enabling more practical tools for aesthetic assessment in interior design.

### [44] [ColorConceptBench: A Benchmark for Probabilistic Color-Concept Understanding in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16836)
*Chenxi Ruan,Yu Xiao,Yihan Hou,Guosheng Hu,Wei Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ColorConceptBench: a human-annotated benchmark to evaluate T2I models' color-concept associations via probabilistic color distributions; uses 1,281 implicit color concepts and 6,369 annotations; seven leading models show limited sensitivity to abstract color semantics, resistant to scaling and guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill a gap in evaluating how T2I models map abstract color concepts to color distributions, moving beyond explicit colors.

Method: Create ColorConceptBench with 6,369 human annotations for 1,281 implicit color concepts; assess seven top T2I models on probabilistic color distributions to gauge concept-to-color mappings.

Result: Models exhibit poor sensitivity to abstract semantics, and standard interventions do not improve this alignment.

Conclusion: Overcoming human-like color semantics requires fundamental changes in how models learn/represent implicit meaning, not merely scaling models or applying guidance.

Abstract: While text-to-image (T2I) models have advanced considerably, their capability to associate colors with implicit concepts remains underexplored. To address the gap, we introduce ColorConceptBench, a new human-annotated benchmark to systematically evaluate color-concept associations through the lens of probabilistic color distributions. ColorConceptBench moves beyond explicit color names or codes by probing how models translate 1,281 implicit color concepts using a foundation of 6,369 human annotations. Our evaluation of seven leading T2I models reveals that current models lack sensitivity to abstract semantics, and crucially, this limitation appears resistant to standard interventions (e.g., scaling and guidance). This demonstrates that achieving human-like color semantics requires more than larger models, but demands a fundamental shift in how models learn and represent implicit meaning.

### [45] [No Validation, No Problem: Predicting Model Performance from a Single Gradient](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16874)
*Fangzheng Wu,Brian Summa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A single forward-backward pass head-gradient norm (||dL/dW||_F) serves as a validation-free checkpointing and early-stopping proxy across CNNs, Transformers, and diffusion models, achieving near-oracle performance with minimal overhead by selecting the minimum gradient within a tail window.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable validation-free training by providing a lightweight, label-free monitor for optimal checkpoint selection and early stopping that generalizes across architectures and tasks, reducing reliance on labeled validation data.

Method: Compute the Frobenius norm of the classifier-head gradient on one detached feature batch: g = dL/dW, keep W as the head; use ||g||_F as the probe. Evaluate across ImageNet-1k CNNs and Transformers, with head-scale or feature-scale normalization as needed. Select the checkpoint with the minimum head gradient within a short tail window and compare to an oracle. Extend to COCO detection/segmentation mAP, and to diffusion (UNet/DDPM on CIFAR-10) to monitor progress. Report overhead (<0.1% of an epoch) and treat as a drop-in for validation-free checkpointing and early stopping.

Result: The probe shows strong negative correlation with Top-1 accuracy and positive correlation with loss on ImageNet-1k across CNNs and Transformers. Using the minimum head gradient in a short tail window closes most of the gap to the oracle (4.24% ± 2.00% with universal settings; ~1.12% with light per-family tuning). Normalization aids stability: head-scale for classic CNNs (e.g., ResNets), feature-scale for Transformers and modern CNNs. It also predicts COCO mAP. In diffusion (UNet/DDPM on CIFAR-10), it tracks progress and enables near-oracle tail-window selection, correlating positively with same-distribution probe MSE and negatively with FID. Validation labels are not used beyond reporting. Overhead is <0.1% of an epoch; acts as a drop-in for validation-free checkpointing and early stopping.

Conclusion: A lightweight, label-free checkpointing/early-stopping proxy based on a single-head gradient Frobenius norm is effective across diverse architectures and tasks, achieving near-oracle performance with minimal overhead and serving also as a monitoring signal for diffusion models and downstream metrics.

Abstract: We propose a validation-free checkpointing signal from a single forward-backward pass: the Frobenius norm of the classifier-head gradient on one detached-feature batch, ||g||_F = ||dL/dW||_F. Across ImageNet-1k CNNs and Transformers, this proxy is strongly negative with Top-1 and positive with loss. Selecting the checkpoint with the minimum head gradient in a short tail window closes most of the gap to the oracle (4.24% +/- 2.00% with a universal setup, about 1.12% with light per-family tuning). For practical deployment, a head-scale normalization is more stable within classic CNN families (e.g., ResNets), while a feature-scale normalization works well for Transformers and modern CNNs. The same one-batch probe also predicts COCO detection/segmentation mAP. In diffusion (UNet/DDPM on CIFAR-10), it tracks progress and enables near-oracle tail-window selection; it is positively correlated with same-distribution probe MSE and negatively with FID (lower is better), so it can be used as a lightweight, label-free monitor. Validation labels are never used beyond reporting. The probe adds much less than 0.1% of an epoch and works as a drop-in for validation-free checkpoint selection and early stopping.

### [46] [Evaluating Large Vision-language Models for Surgical Tool Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16895)
*Nakul Poudel,Richard Simon,Cristian A. Linte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Qwen2.5 offers the strongest tool-detection performance among the evaluated large VLMs for surgical scenes, with robust zero-shot and LoRA-finetuned results on GraSP; Grounding DINO shows better localization, while LLaVA1.5 and InternVL3.5 underperform in comparison.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The field currently relies on unimodal AI systems that provide limited holistic understanding of surgical workflows. There is a need for general-purpose, multimodal surgical AI capable of modeling interrelated components of surgical scenes. Large vision-language models (VLMs) offer multimodal integration and human-like scene reasoning, but systematic evaluations in surgical settings are scarce.

Method: Comparative evaluation of three state-of-the-art VLMs (Qwen2.5, LLaVA1.5, InternVL3.5) on the GraSP robotic surgery dataset. Assessments conducted in zero-shot and parameter-efficient LoRA-finetuning regimes, with Grounding DINO as an open-set baseline for context.

Result: Qwen2.5 consistently achieves superior detection performance in both zero-shot and LoRA-tuned configurations among the three VLMs. Relative to Grounding DINO, Qwen2.5 exhibits stronger zero-shot generalization and comparable fine-tuned performance. Instrument-level recognition is stronger with Qwen2.5, while Grounding DINO shows stronger localization.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates the promise of large VLMs for surgical tool detection and highlights a trade-off between recognition (instrument identity) and localization. Qwen2.5 emerges as the most effective model among those tested, supporting the potential for VLM-based, general-purpose surgical AI, while also underscoring the need for further work to balance different aspects of scene understanding in surgical contexts.

Abstract: Surgery is a highly complex process, and artificial intelligence has emerged as a transformative force in supporting surgical guidance and decision-making. However, the unimodal nature of most current AI systems limits their ability to achieve a holistic understanding of surgical workflows. This highlights the need for general-purpose surgical AI systems capable of comprehensively modeling the interrelated components of surgical scenes. Recent advances in large vision-language models that integrate multimodal data processing offer strong potential for modeling surgical tasks and providing human-like scene reasoning and understanding. Despite their promise, systematic investigations of VLMs in surgical applications remain limited. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of large VLMs for the fundamental surgical vision task of detecting surgical tools. Specifically, we investigate three state-of-the-art VLMs, Qwen2.5, LLaVA1.5, and InternVL3.5, on the GraSP robotic surgery dataset under both zero-shot and parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning settings. Our results demonstrate that Qwen2.5 consistently achieves superior detection performance in both configurations among the evaluated VLMs. Furthermore, compared with the open-set detection baseline Grounding DINO, Qwen2.5 exhibits stronger zero-shot generalization and comparable fine-tuned performance. Notably, Qwen2.5 shows superior instrument recognition, while Grounding DINO demonstrates stronger localization.

*Justin Cui,Jie Wu,Ming Li,Tao Yang,Xiaojie Li,Rui Wang,Andrew Bai,Yuanhao Ban,Cho-Jui Hsieh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight, training-free fix for sink-collapse in autoregressive long-form video generation using multi-head RoPE jitter, breaking inter-head attention homogenization to enable real-time, infinite-length streaming videos with minimal quality loss (demonstrated up to 12 hours).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive long-form video models suffer error accumulation and loss of long-term coherence. A newly identified failure mode, sink-collapse, occurs when generated content repeatedly cycles to the sink frame due to conflicts between RoPE's periodic structure and multi-head attention.

Method: Introduce multi-head RoPE jitter as a training-free adjustment that perturbs the RoPE positions across attention heads, disrupting homogenization and reducing long-horizon collapse.

Result: Sink-collapse is effectively suppressed while preserving generation quality; the method enables real-time streaming and infinite-length video generation, with long demonstrations up to 12 hours.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a robust, efficient technique to stabilize long-horizon autoregressive video generation, representing a step toward practical real-time infinite-length video generation.

Abstract: Recent research in long-form video generation has shifted from bidirectional to autoregressive models, yet these methods commonly suffer from error accumulation and a loss of long-term coherence. While attention sink frames have been introduced to mitigate this performance decay, they often induce a critical failure mode we term sink-collapse: the generated content repeatedly reverts to the sink frame, resulting in abrupt scene resets and cyclic motion patterns. Our analysis reveals that sink-collapse originates from an inherent conflict between the periodic structure of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and the multi-head attention mechanisms prevalent in current generative models. To address it, we propose a lightweight, training-free approach that effectively suppresses this behavior by introducing multi-head RoPE jitter that breaks inter-head attention homogenization and mitigates long-horizon collapse. Extensive experiments show that our method successfully alleviates sink-collapse while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this work achieves the first demonstration of real-time, streaming, and infinite-length video generation with little quality decay. As an illustration of this robustness, we generate continuous videos up to 12 hours in length, which, to our knowledge, is among the longest publicly demonstrated results in streaming video generation.

*Jingran Zhang,Ning Li,Yuanhao Ban,Andrew Bai,Justin Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Autoregressive video generation guided by reward signals achieves high fidelity and temporal consistency without heavy teacher models, matching or surpassing bidirectional baselines on benchmarks, e.g., 84.92 on VBench vs 84.31 autoregressive with distillation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address reliance on teacher models in autoregressive video generation and scalability drawbacks; enable efficient training and competitive performance without distillation constraints.

Method: Train an autoregressive video generator using reward signals (reinforcement-learning-like objective) to optimize video quality and temporal coherence; avoid teacher architectures.

Result: On standard benchmarks, competitive with existing autoregressive methods; in some cases surpasses similarly sized bidirectional models; on VBench, total score 84.92, close to 84.31 but without heterogeneous distillation.

Conclusion: Reward-guided autoregressive generation is a viable, scalable alternative to teacher-based methods, preserving fidelity and consistency while reducing training complexity.

Abstract: While most prior work in video generation relies on bidirectional architectures, recent efforts have sought to adapt these models into autoregressive variants to support near real-time generation. However, such adaptations often depend heavily on teacher models, which can limit performance, particularly in the absence of a strong autoregressive teacher, resulting in output quality that typically lags behind their bidirectional counterparts. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that uses reward signals to guide the generation process, enabling more efficient and scalable autoregressive generation. By using reward signals to guide the model, our method simplifies training while preserving high visual fidelity and temporal consistency. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, we find that our approach performs comparably to existing autoregressive models and, in some cases, surpasses similarly sized bidirectional models by avoiding constraints imposed by teacher architectures. For example, on VBench, our method achieves a total score of 84.92, closely matching state-of-the-art autoregressive methods that score 84.31 but require significant heterogeneous distillation.

*Ba-Thinh Lam,Thanh-Huy Nguyen,Hoang-Thien Nguyen,Quang-Khai Bui-Tran,Nguyen Lan Vi Vu,Phat K. Huynh,Ulas Bagci,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A domain-invariant mixed-domain semi-supervised segmentation framework using Copy-Paste Mechanism and CMMD within a teacher-student setup to handle unknown domain shifts, achieving strong performance with limited labels on Fundus and M&Ms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotations are scarce and data come from multiple scanners/centers, creating mixed-domain settings with unknown domain labels and large domain gaps. Existing semi-supervised or domain adaptation methods often assume a single domain shift or known domain indices, which is unrealistic in practice.

Method: Copy-Paste Mechanism (CPM) augments training by transferring informative regions across domains; Cluster Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) clusters unlabeled features and aligns them with labeled anchors via an MMD objective to promote domain-invariant representations. This is integrated within a teacher-student framework to enable robust segmentation with few labels and multiple unknown domain discrepancies.

Result: The approach yields robust and accurate segmentation even with very few labeled examples across multiple unknown domain discrepancies. Experiments on Fundus and M&Ms benchmarks show consistent improvements over conventional semi-supervised and domain adaptation methods.

Conclusion: The method offers a viable solution for mixed-domain semi-supervised medical image segmentation and demonstrates the potential to generalize across diverse domain shifts.

Abstract: Deep learning has shown remarkable progress in medical image semantic segmentation, yet its success heavily depends on large-scale expert annotations and consistent data distributions. In practice, annotations are scarce, and images are collected from multiple scanners or centers, leading to mixed-domain settings with unknown domain labels and severe domain gaps. Existing semi-supervised or domain adaptation approaches typically assume either a single domain shift or access to explicit domain indices, which rarely hold in real-world deployment. In this paper, we propose a domain-invariant mixed-domain semi-supervised segmentation framework that jointly enhances data diversity and mitigates domain bias. A Copy-Paste Mechanism (CPM) augments the training set by transferring informative regions across domains, while a Cluster Maximum Mean Discrepancy (CMMD) block clusters unlabeled features and aligns them with labeled anchors via an MMD objective, encouraging domain-invariant representations. Integrated within a teacher-student framework, our method achieves robust and precise segmentation even with very few labeled examples and multiple unknown domain discrepancies. Experiments on Fundus and M&Ms benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses semi-supervised and domain adaptation methods, establishing a potential solution for mixed-domain semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

TL;DR: VisGym presents a 17-environment benchmark to evaluate and train vision-language models on multi-step tasks, revealing strong limitations in long-horizon, interactive settings and showing gains from explicit goal observations, textual feedback, and supervised demonstrations for finetuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are inadequately characterized for multi-step, long-horizon visual interactions that require perception, memory, and action. A flexible, scalable benchmark is needed to diagnose and improve these capabilities across diverse tasks.

Method: Introduce VisGym, a gymnasium with 17 environments spanning symbolic puzzles, real-image understanding, navigation, and manipulation. The suite offers controllable difficulty, input representation, planning horizons, and feedback. Provide multi-step solvers to generate structured demonstrations for supervised finetuning.

Result: Frontier models underperform in interactive settings with low success rates (easy 46.6%; hard 26.0%). Models have difficulty leveraging long context and perform worse with unbounded history than with truncated windows. Some text-based symbolic tasks become harder when rendered visually. Explicit goal observations, textual feedback, and exploratory demonstrations for supervised finetuning yield consistent gains.

Conclusion: VisGym exposes concrete failure modes and actionable pathways to improve multi-step visual decision-making. It supplies benchmark data, code, and models to drive progress in interactive VLM capabilities.

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain poorly characterized in multi-step visual interactions, particularly in how they integrate perception, memory, and action over long horizons. We introduce VisGym, a gymnasium of 17 environments for evaluating and training VLMs. The suite spans symbolic puzzles, real-image understanding, navigation, and manipulation, and provides flexible controls over difficulty, input representation, planning horizon, and feedback. We also provide multi-step solvers that generate structured demonstrations, enabling supervised finetuning. Our evaluations show that all frontier models struggle in interactive settings, achieving low success rates in both the easy (46.6%) and hard (26.0%) configurations. Our experiments reveal notable limitations: models struggle to effectively leverage long context, performing worse with an unbounded history than with truncated windows. Furthermore, we find that several text-based symbolic tasks become substantially harder once rendered visually. However, explicit goal observations, textual feedback, and exploratory demonstrations in partially observable or unknown-dynamics settings for supervised finetuning yield consistent gains, highlighting concrete failure modes and pathways for improving multi-step visual decision-making.

*David Serrano-Lozano,Anand Bhattad,Luis Herranz,Jean-François Lalonde,Javier Vazquez-Corral*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based multi-view relighting framework that propagates lighting edits consistently across uncalibrated viewpoints of a static scene in a single inference step, trained on synthetic and real data, with zero-shot cross-view generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-view relighting advances exist, but multi-view consistency across uncalibrated captures—essential for multi-camera broadcasts, stereoscopic cinema, and virtual production—is not addressed by prior methods. There is a need for principled, controllable, cross-view lighting edits that generalize to arbitrary view counts without camera pose information.

Method: A multi-view diffusion transformer with latent bridge matching trained on a large-scale hybrid dataset (synthetic and real multi-view captures) and conditioned on a single reference lighting edit. The model performs relighting of the entire multi-view image set in one inference step and generalizes zero-shot to any number of viewpoints, despite being trained on image pairs and without camera pose data.

Result: High-fidelity relighting across all views in a single pass; zero-shot cross-view generalization; practical relighting workflows for multi-view systems.

Conclusion: SyncLight enables consistent, parametric relighting across uncalibrated multi-view captures, facilitating advanced production workflows.

Abstract: We present SyncLight, the first method to enable consistent, parametric relighting across multiple uncalibrated views of a static scene. While single-view relighting has advanced significantly, existing generative approaches struggle to maintain the rigorous lighting consistency essential for multi-camera broadcasts, stereoscopic cinema, and virtual production. SyncLight addresses this by enabling precise control over light intensity and color across a multi-view capture of a scene, conditioned on a single reference edit. Our method leverages a multi-view diffusion transformer trained using a latent bridge matching formulation, achieving high-fidelity relighting of the entire image set in a single inference step. To facilitate training, we introduce a large-scale hybrid dataset comprising diverse synthetic environments -- curated from existing sources and newly designed scenes -- alongside high-fidelity, real-world multi-view captures under calibrated illumination. Surprisingly, though trained only on image pairs, SyncLight generalizes zero-shot to an arbitrary number of viewpoints, effectively propagating lighting changes across all views, without requiring camera pose information. SyncLight enables practical relighting workflows for multi-view capture systems.

### [52] [Ordering-based Causal Discovery via Generalized Score Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16249)
*Vy Vo,He Zhao,Trung Le,Edwin V. Bonilla,Dinh Phung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends score-matching causal discovery to discrete data via a leaf discriminant criterion based on the discrete score function; enables topological order identification from observational data and improves DAG recovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal discovery from purely observational data remains challenging, especially with discrete data. Leaf-based topological ordering followed by edge pruning is a promising two-stage approach; this work adapts it to the discrete setting to leverage score-based cues.

Method: Extend the score matching framework to discrete distributions and introduce a novel leaf discriminant criterion derived from the discrete score function. Use this criterion to identify leaf nodes and infer a true causal order, then use this order to guide edge pruning and graph recovery.

Result: Simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate accurate inference of the true causal order from observed discrete data. The identified order substantially improves the accuracy of existing causal discovery baselines across nearly all tested settings.

Conclusion: The paper broadens score-matching causal discovery to discrete data by proposing a discrete-score–based leaf discriminant, enabling reliable order identification and improved DAG structure learning. It suggests practical benefits for causal discovery in categorical domains and sets the stage for further refinements and scalability analyses.

Abstract: Learning DAG structures from purely observational data remains a long-standing challenge across scientific domains. An emerging line of research leverages the score of the data distribution to initially identify a topological order of the underlying DAG via leaf node detection and subsequently performs edge pruning for graph recovery. This paper extends the score matching framework for causal discovery, which is originally designated for continuous data, and introduces a novel leaf discriminant criterion based on the discrete score function. Through simulated and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our theory enables accurate inference of true causal orders from observed discrete data and the identified ordering can significantly boost the accuracy of existing causal discovery baselines on nearly all of the settings.

### [53] [Student Mental Health Screening via Fitbit Data Collected During the COVID-19 Pandemic](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16324)
*Rebecca Lopez,Avantika Shrestha,ML Tlachac,Kevin Hickey,Xingtong Guo,Shichao Liu,Elke Rundensteiner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The paper investigates predicting depression, anxiety, and stress in college students using Fitbit wearable data from the StudentMEH dataset collected during the pandemic, reporting favorable F1 scores (up to ~0.79 for anxiety) across modalities and highlighting the potential of physiological signals for continuous mental health screening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in unobtrusive, continuous mental health screening with physiological data, focusing on college students and exploring how different wearable modalities and data aggregation levels affect screening performance.

Method: Collect the StudentMEH Fitbit dataset from students during the pandemic; evaluate predictive machine learning models across Fitbit modalities (e.g., heart rate, sleep) for screening depression, anxiety, and stress; assess how time-series data aggregation levels influence performance; report F1 scores.

Result: Physiological modalities (notably heart rate and sleep) show potential for screening mental illness, with F1 scores up to 0.79 for anxiety, 0.77 for stress (heart rate), and 0.78 for depression (sleep); the study emphasizes the importance of data aggregation levels and modality selection in model performance.

Conclusion: Wearable devices can support continuous mental health monitoring in college populations; identifying optimal modality-time aggregation combinations is crucial for effective screening; further work is needed to validate generalizability, address labeling and data-collection limitations, and compare across populations.

Abstract: College students experience many stressors, resulting in high levels of anxiety and depression. Wearable technology provides unobtrusive sensor data that can be used for the early detection of mental illness. However, current research is limited concerning the variety of psychological instruments administered, physiological modalities, and time series parameters. In this research, we collect the Student Mental and Environmental Health (StudentMEH) Fitbit dataset from students at our institution during the pandemic. We provide a comprehensive assessment of the ability of predictive machine learning models to screen for depression, anxiety, and stress using different Fitbit modalities. Our findings indicate potential in physiological modalities such as heart rate and sleep to screen for mental illness with the F1 scores as high as 0.79 for anxiety, the former modality reaching 0.77 for stress screening, and the latter modality achieving 0.78 for depression. This research highlights the potential of wearable devices to support continuous mental health monitoring, the importance of identifying best data aggregation levels and appropriate modalities for screening for different mental ailments.

### [54] [Efficient Gaussian process learning via subspace projections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16332)
*Felipe Tobar,Elsa Cazelles*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposed a projected likelihood (PL) training objective for Gaussian Processes using lower-dimensional linear projections of the data; derives a closed-form expression for the information loss due to projection; shows that random projections on the unit sphere can reduce this loss; empirically PL improves accuracy and computational efficiency over exact GP training and variational sparse GP across various optimizers, kernels, and moderately large datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gaussian Process (GP) training is computationally expensive for large datasets. Reducing data dimensionality via linear projections can speed up learning, but introduces information loss. The work provides an analytic handle on this loss and validates a practical projection-based objective.

Method: Introduce PL as a training objective based on lower-dimensional linear projections of the data. Derive a closed-form expression for the information loss caused by projection. Employ random projections on the unit sphere to further reduce information loss. Evaluate PL against exact GP training and variational free-energy based sparse GP across multiple optimizers, kernels, and moderately large datasets.

Result: Closed-form expression for the information loss under projected likelihood is derived. Random projections on the unit sphere effectively reduce this loss. Empirically, PL achieves higher accuracy and greater computational efficiency compared to exact GP training and variational sparse GP across tested optimizers, kernels, and moderately large datasets.

Conclusion: Projected likelihood is a promising training objective for GPs on projected data. Random unit-sphere projections mitigate information loss and yield robust performance improvements across kernels and datasets of moderate size, with favorable computational characteristics.

Abstract: We propose a novel training objective for GPs constructed using lower-dimensional linear projections of the data, referred to as \emph{projected likelihood} (PL). We provide a closed-form expression for the information loss related to the PL and empirically show that it can be reduced with random projections on the unit sphere. We show the superiority of the PL, in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency, over the exact GP training and the variational free energy approach to sparse GPs over different optimisers, kernels and datasets of moderately large sizes.

### [55] [Analyzing Neural Network Information Flow Using Differential Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16366)
*Shuhang Tan,Jayson Sia,Paul Bogdan,Radoslav Ivanov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes neural curvature using Ollivier-Ricci curvature to identify important NN edges for pruning; negative-ORC edges are bottlenecks and critical; method finds more unimportant edges than baselines across MNIST/CIFAR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provides a graph-curvature based alternative to information-theoretic NN data-flow analysis, enabling symbolic NN analysis, robustness assessment, and potential model repair.

Method: Construct a graph from the NN structure and define neural curvature (NC) via Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC). Compute curvatures from activation patterns over a set of input examples, rank edges by NC, and perform pruning experiments. Compare to state-of-the-art pruning methods across datasets.

Result: Edges with negative ORC (bottlenecks) cause rapid performance degradation when removed, while positive-ORC edges have little impact. The approach identifies a larger set of unimportant edges than existing pruning methods.

Conclusion: ORC-based neural curvature effectively identifies critical NN connections, enabling pruning and offering a tool for symbolic NN analysis, robustness evaluation, and potential model repair.

Abstract: This paper provides a fresh view of the neural network (NN) data flow problem, i.e., identifying the NN connections that are most important for the performance of the full model, through the lens of graph theory. Understanding the NN data flow provides a tool for symbolic NN analysis, e.g.,~robustness analysis or model repair. Unlike the standard approach to NN data flow analysis, which is based on information theory, we employ the notion of graph curvature, specifically Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC). The ORC has been successfully used to identify important graph edges in various domains such as road traffic analysis, biological and social networks. In particular, edges with negative ORC are considered bottlenecks and as such are critical to the graph's overall connectivity, whereas positive-ORC edges are not essential. We use this intuition for the case of NNs as well: we 1)~construct a graph induced by the NN structure and introduce the notion of neural curvature (NC) based on the ORC; 2)~calculate curvatures based on activation patterns for a set of input examples; 3)~aim to demonstrate that NC can indeed be used to rank edges according to their importance for the overall NN functionality. We evaluate our method through pruning experiments and show that removing negative-ORC edges quickly degrades the overall NN performance, whereas positive-ORC edges have little impact. The proposed method is evaluated on a variety of models trained on three image datasets, namely MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The results indicate that our method can identify a larger number of unimportant edges as compared to state-of-the-art pruning methods.

### [56] [A Regularized Actor-Critic Algorithm for Bi-Level Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16399)
*Sihan Zeng,Sujay Bhatt,Sumitra Ganesh,Alec Koppel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A single-loop, first-order actor-critic algorithm for a structured bi-level optimization where an upper-level objective optimizes a reward parameter for a lower-level MDP; introduces attenuating entropy in the lower-level RL objective to enable asymptotically unbiased upper-level hyper-gradient estimation without solving the unregularized RL problem exactly; proves finite-time and finite-sample convergence to a stationary point under a Polyak-Lojasiewicz-type condition; validates on GridWorld and RLHF tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing bi-level optimization and RL methods that rely on second-order information, strong lower-level regularization, or nested-loop sampling by providing a scalable, first-order method with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Method: A penalty-based reformulation of the bi-level objective combined with a single-loop, first-order actor-critic algorithm. The lower-level RL objective includes attenuating entropy regularization to enable asymptotically unbiased hyper-gradient estimation. The analysis uses a novel lower-level residual framework under a special Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition.

Result: Finite-time and finite-sample convergence to a stationary point of the original, unregularized bi-level problem. Empirical validation on a GridWorld goal-position task and on RLHF-style happy tweet generation.

Conclusion: The approach yields a scalable, theoretically grounded method for structured bi-level RL, with provable convergence and practical effectiveness demonstrated on standard RL benchmarks and human-feedback-based tasks.

Abstract: We study a structured bi-level optimization problem where the upper-level objective is a smooth function and the lower-level problem is policy optimization in a Markov decision process (MDP). The upper-level decision variable parameterizes the reward of the lower-level MDP, and the upper-level objective depends on the optimal induced policy. Existing methods for bi-level optimization and RL often require second-order information, impose strong regularization at the lower level, or inefficiently use samples through nested-loop procedures. In this work, we propose a single-loop, first-order actor-critic algorithm that optimizes the bi-level objective via a penalty-based reformulation. We introduce into the lower-level RL objective an attenuating entropy regularization, which enables asymptotically unbiased upper-level hyper-gradient estimation without solving the unregularized RL problem exactly. We establish the finite-time and finite-sample convergence of the proposed algorithm to a stationary point of the original, unregularized bi-level optimization problem through a novel lower-level residual analysis under a special type of Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. We validate the performance of our method through experiments on a GridWorld goal position problem and on happy tweet generation through reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).

### [57] [Towards a Theoretical Understanding to the Generalization of RLHF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16403)
*Zhaochun Li,Mingyang Yi,Yue Wang,Shisheng Cui,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLHF for LLMs attains an O(n^{-1/2}) generalization bound under a feature-coverage condition in an end-to-end, linear reward model; the result extends to gradient-based learning (GA/SGA) and aligns with observed empirical generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically understand how RLHF generalizes in high-dimensional LLM settings, moving beyond MLE-based reward-model consistency to an end-to-end framework.

Method: Derives generalization bounds via algorithmic stability for end-to-end RLHF under a linear reward model, assuming feature coverage; shows that empirical optima generalize with rate O(n^{-1/2}); extends the bound to parameters learned by GA/SGA.

Result: Establishes a learning-rate bound on generalization that scales as n^{-1/2} under a feature-coverage condition and for end-to-end RLHF; the bound holds for gradient-based optimizers as well.

Conclusion: Provides theoretical support for the empirical generalization observed in RLHF-tuned LLMs and highlights feature coverage as a key condition; paves the way for further theoretical and practical analyses in high-dimensional RLHF.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and its variants have emerged as the dominant approaches for aligning Large Language Models with human intent. While empirically effective, the theoretical generalization properties of these methods in high-dimensional settings remain to be explored. To this end, we build the generalization theory on RLHF of LLMs under the linear reward model, through the framework of algorithmic stability. In contrast to the existing works built upon the consistency of maximum likelihood estimations on reward model, our analysis is presented under an end-to-end learning framework, which is consistent with practice. Concretely, we prove that under a key \textbf{feature coverage} condition, the empirical optima of policy model have a generalization bound of order $\mathcal{O}(n^{-\frac{1}{2}})$. Moreover, the results can be extrapolated to parameters obtained by gradient-based learning algorithms, i.e., Gradient Ascent (GA) and Stochastic Gradient Ascent (SGA). Thus, we argue that our results provide new theoretical evidence for the empirically observed generalization of LLMs after RLHF.

### [58] [Reasoning-Enhanced Rare-Event Prediction with Balanced Outcome Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16406)
*Vitaly Bulgakov,Alexander Turchin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LPCORP is a two-stage framework that uses reasoning-enhanced predictions followed by a confidence-based correction to address rare-event, highly imbalanced data, improving precision without resampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare-event prediction domains (healthcare, finance, reliability, customer service, aviation) have extreme class imbalance where positive events are infrequent but consequential, leading to biased models and poor precision/calibration.

Method: A two-stage approach: (1) a reasoning model produces enhanced predictions from narrative data; (2) a lightweight logistic-regression classifier evaluates and selectively corrects these outputs to mitigate prevalence bias, preserving the original sample count and avoiding resampling.

Result: On real-world medical and consumer-service datasets, LPCORP markedly improves performance, especially precision, by transforming the data into a more balanced effective setting without resampling; a cost-analysis shows substantial reductions in rare-event-related expenses, with over 50% savings in some cases.

Conclusion: LPCORP provides a practical, resampling-free solution to rare-event prediction bias, delivering improved precision and potential cost savings in high-stakes domains; patent pending.

Abstract: Rare-event prediction is critical in domains such as healthcare, finance, reliability engineering, customer support, aviation safety, where positive outcomes are infrequent yet potentially catastrophic. Extreme class imbalance biases conventional models toward majority-class predictions, limiting recall, calibration, and operational usefulness. We propose LPCORP (Low-Prevalence CORrector for Prediction)*, a two-stage framework that combines reasoningenhanced prediction with confidence-based outcome correction. A reasoning model first produces enriched predictions from narrative inputs, after which a lightweight logistic-regression classifier evaluates and selectively corrects these outputs to mitigate prevalence-driven bias. We evaluate LPCORP on real-world datasets from medical and consumer service domains. The results show that this method transforms a highly imbalanced setting into a well-balanced one while preserving the original number of samples and without applying any resampling strategies. Test-set evaluation demonstrates substantially improved performance, particularly in precision, which is a known weakness in low-prevalence data. We further provide a costreduction analysis comparing the expenses associated with rare-event damage control without preventive measures to those incurred when low-cost, prediction-based preventive interventions are applied that showed more than 50% reduction in some cases. * Patent pending: U.S. Provisional 63/933,518, filed 8 December 2025.

### [59] [A Refinement of Vapnik--Chervonenkis' Theorem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16411)
*A. Iosevich,A. Vagharshakyan,E. Wyman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A moderate-deviation refinement of VC-type uniform convergence bounds via normal approximation with Berry–Esseen error control, improving the leading exponential term by a factor ~1/(ε√n) for large ε√n.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vapnik–Chervonenkis theory provides uniform convergence guarantees for empirical probabilities. The paper aims to sharpen these finite-sample bounds by a tighter probabilistic analysis, enhancing the practical accuracy of VC-type results.

Method: Revisit the probabilistic component of the VC argument and replace the final step based on Hoeffding’s inequality with a normal approximation accompanied by explicit Berry–Esseen error bounds; derive moderate-deviation bounds.

Result: A refined VC-type bound with an additional factor of order (ε√n)^{-1} in the leading exponential term when ε√n is large, i.e., a moderate-deviation sharpening over the classical VC estimate.

Conclusion: Normal-approximation-based analysis yields sharper finite-sample VC bounds in the moderate-deviation regime, highlighting an explicit Berry–Esseen control in the standard uniform convergence framework.

Abstract: Vapnik--Chervonenkis' theorem is a seminal result in machine learning. It establishes sufficient conditions for empirical probabilities to converge to theoretical probabilities, uniformly over families of events. It also provides an estimate for the rate of such uniform convergence.
  We revisit the probabilistic component of the classical argument. Instead of applying Hoeffding's inequality at the final step, we use a normal approximation with explicit Berry--Esseen error control. This yields a moderate-deviation sharpening of the usual VC estimate, with an additional factor of order $(\varepsilon\sqrt{n})^{-1}$ in the leading exponential term when $\varepsilon\sqrt{n}$ is large.

### [61] [Bayesian Experimental Design for Model Discrepancy Calibration: A Rivalry between Kullback--Leibler Divergence and Wasserstein Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16425)
*Huchen Yang,Xinghao Dong,Jin-Long Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KL divergence often speeds convergence in Bayesian experimental design (BED) when the model is accurate; Wasserstein distance offers robustness to model discrepancy, yielding more reliable sequential BED under misspecification. This trade-off informs utility-function choice in BED.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clarify the trade-offs between KL and Wasserstein metrics as BED utility functions and provide practical guidelines for selecting criteria under model misspecification and correct specification.

Method: 1) A toy example showing a pitfall of Wasserstein distance: fixed-shape posterior with non-informative priors can reward mass placement rather than information gain. 2) A systematic comparison on a classical source-inversion BED problem, evaluating performance with and without model discrepancy.

Result: KL-based design converges faster when there is no model discrepancy; Wasserstein-based design is more robust to model mismatch, yielding better sequential performance under discrepancy. The study clarifies the trade-offs and offers guidance for choosing the metric depending on expected model accuracy.

Conclusion: For BED applications: prefer KL divergence when the model is believed accurate; prefer Wasserstein distance when model discrepancy is a concern; consider context-specific guidelines or hybrid criteria to balance speed and robustness.

Abstract: Designing experiments that systematically gather data from complex physical systems is central to accelerating scientific discovery. While Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a principled, information-based framework that integrates experimental planning with probabilistic inference, the selection of utility functions in BED is a long-standing and active topic, where different criteria emphasize different notions of information. Although Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence has been one of the most common choices, recent studies have proposed Wasserstein distance as an alternative. In this work, we first employ a toy example to illustrate an issue of Wasserstein distance - the value of Wasserstein distance of a fixed-shape posterior depends on the relative position of its main mass within the support and can exhibit false rewards unrelated to information gain, especially with a non-informative prior (e.g., uniform distribution). We then further provide a systematic comparison between these two criteria through a classical source inversion problem in the BED literature, revealing that the KL divergence tends to lead to faster convergence in the absence of model discrepancy, while Wasserstein metrics provide more robust sequential BED results if model discrepancy is non-negligible. These findings clarify the trade-offs between KL divergence and Wasserstein metrics for the utility function and provide guidelines for selecting suitable criteria in practical BED applications.

### [62] [Safe Multitask Molecular Graph Networks for Vapor Pressure and Odor Threshold Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16426)
*Shuang Wu,Meijie Wang,Lun Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PNA-based graph neural networks with A20/E17 features achieve strong OOD vapor pressure (VP) prediction; OP needs robust training with A20/E17; a proposed safe multitask strategy (VP main, OP aux) improves VP generalization without harming the primary task; results are supported by reproducibility and ablations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address out-of-distribution generalization in odor-related property prediction (VP and OP) using scaffold-based splits, rich graph features, and backbone comparisons, while developing strategies to balance multiple properties.

Method: Compare GINE and PNA backbones on molecular graphs with A20/E17 features. Evaluate single-task VP and OP predictions under Bemis-Murcko scaffold split. For OP, apply robust training (Huber or Winsorization). Introduce a safe multitask scheme: treat VP as primary task and OP as auxiliary, with delayed activation, gradient clipping, and small task weight.

Result: VP: PNA with a simple regression head achieves validation MSE ≈ 0.21 (normalized space). OP single-task with A20/E17 and robust training achieves validation MSE ≈ 0.60–0.61. Multitask: safe multitask approach yields best VP generalization by using delayed activation, gradient clipping, and small auxiliary weight. Reproducibility, ablation studies, and error-similarity analysis are provided; data noise and method limitations are discussed.

Conclusion: PNA-based representations with simple regression provide strong VP OOD generalization; OP benefits from robust training with A20/E17 features. A safe multitask framework can improve VP performance without sacrificing the auxiliary attribute, and the work offers comprehensive experiments and analysis, highlighting data noise and method limitations.

Abstract: We investigate two important tasks in odor-related property modeling: Vapor Pressure (VP) and Odor Threshold (OP). To evaluate the model's out-of-distribution (OOD) capability, we adopt the Bemis-Murcko scaffold split. In terms of features, we introduce the rich A20/E17 molecular graph features (20-dimensional atom features + 17-dimensional bond features) and systematically compare GINE and PNA backbones. The results show: for VP, PNA with a simple regression head achieves Val MSE $\approx$ 0.21 (normalized space); for the OP single task under the same scaffold split, using A20/E17 with robust training (Huber/winsor) achieves Val MSE $\approx$ 0.60-0.61. For multitask training, we propose a **"safe multitask"** approach: VP as the primary task and OP as the auxiliary task, using delayed activation + gradient clipping + small weight, which avoids harming the primary task and simultaneously yields the best VP generalization performance. This paper provides complete reproducible experiments, ablation studies, and error-similarity analysis while discussing the impact of data noise and method limitations.

*Kanishk Gandhi,Shivam Garg,Noah D. Goodman,Dimitris Papailiopoulos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Autonomous pipeline Endless Terminals enables scalable terminal-use tasks; simple RL with PPO on a large diverse task suite improves performance and transfers to human benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Environments limit self-improving agents; current terminal benchmarks are evaluation datasets, not training pipelines; scalable, autonomous task/environment generation is needed for RL.

Method: Four-stage pipeline: (1) generate diverse task descriptions, (2) build/validate containerized environments, (3) produce completion tests, (4) filter solvable tasks; yields 3255 tasks across file operations, log management, data processing, scripting, and database ops; train agents with vanilla PPO, binary episode rewards, minimal loop (no retrieval/coordination/tools); evaluate on held-out dev set and TerminalBench 2.0.

Result: Significant gains: Llama-3.2-3B 4.0%→18.2%; Qwen2.5-7B 10.7%→53.3%; Qwen3-8B-openthinker-sft 42.6%→59.0% on dev set. Transfers to human benchmarks: TerminalBench 2.0 gains (0.0%→2.2%; 2.2%→3.4%; 1.1%→6.7%); competitive with vocab/sophisticated agentic scaffolds; demonstrates simple RL can succeed with scalable environments.

Conclusion: Simple RL can be effective when the environment distribution is scaled through autonomous generation; Endless Terminals provides a viable training pipeline for self-improving agents.

Abstract: Environments are the bottleneck for self-improving agents. Current terminal benchmarks were built for evaluation, not training; reinforcement learning requires a scalable pipeline, not just a dataset. We introduce Endless Terminals, a fully autonomous pipeline that procedurally generates terminal-use tasks without human annotation. The pipeline has four stages: generating diverse task descriptions, building and validating containerized environments, producing completion tests, and filtering for solvability. From this pipeline we obtain 3255 tasks spanning file operations, log management, data processing, scripting, and database operations. We train agents using vanilla PPO with binary episode level rewards and a minimal interaction loop: no retrieval, multi-agent coordination, or specialized tools. Despite this simplicity, models trained on Endless Terminals show substantial gains: on our held-out dev set, Llama-3.2-3B improves from 4.0% to 18.2%, Qwen2.5-7B from 10.7% to 53.3%, and Qwen3-8B-openthinker-sft from 42.6% to 59.0%. These improvements transfer to human-curated benchmarks: models trained on Endless Terminals show substantial gains on held out human curated benchmarks: on TerminalBench 2.0, Llama-3.2-3B improves from 0.0% to 2.2%, Qwen2.5-7B from 2.2% to 3.4%, and Qwen3-8B-openthinker-sft from 1.1% to 6.7%, in each case outperforming alternative approaches including models with more complex agentic scaffolds. These results demonstrate that simple RL succeeds when environments scale.

*George Awiakye-Marfo,Elijah Agbosu,Victoria Mawuena Barns,Samuel Asante Gyamerah*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces BrownianReLU, a Brownian-motion–induced stochastic activation for LSTMs to stabilize gradients in noisy financial time series, showing improved MSE and R^2 across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard activations (ReLU family) can exhibit gradient instability and dying gradients on non-stationary, noisy financial data; a stochastic, adaptive activation may improve gradient propagation and learning stability.

Method: Define BrownianReLU via Monte Carlo simulation, providing a smooth, adaptive response for negative inputs; integrate into LSTM; evaluate on financial time series (Apple, GCB, S&P 500) and LendingClub loan classification, comparing against conventional activations.

Result: BrownianReLU yields consistently lower MSE and higher R^2, indicating better predictive accuracy and generalization; ROC-AUC is limited in classification, but activation choice meaningfully balances accuracy and sensitivity.

Conclusion: Activation choice materially affects performance; BrownianReLU offers a promising approach to address dying ReLU and gradient instability in financial time-series modeling, with practical gains in regression and classification tasks.

Abstract: Deep learning models are effective for sequential data modeling, yet commonly used activation functions such as ReLU, LeakyReLU, and PReLU often exhibit gradient instability when applied to noisy, non-stationary financial time series. This study introduces BrownianReLU, a stochastic activation function induced by Brownian motion that enhances gradient propagation and learning stability in Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Using Monte Carlo simulation, BrownianReLU provides a smooth, adaptive response for negative inputs, mitigating the dying ReLU problem. The proposed activation is evaluated on financial time series from Apple, GCB, and the S&P 500, as well as LendingClub loan data for classification. Results show consistently lower Mean Squared Error and higher $R^2$ values, indicating improved predictive accuracy and generalization. Although ROC-AUC metric is limited in classification tasks, activation choice significantly affects the trade-off between accuracy and sensitivity, with Brownian ReLU and the selected activation functions yielding practically meaningful performance.

### [65] [On the Expressive Power of Floating-Point Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16450)
*Sejun Park,Yeachan Park,Geonho Hwang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Floating-point transformers extend expressiveness beyond permutation-equivariant functions, allowing some non-permutation-equivariant representations even without positional encoding. When sequence length is bounded, they can represent all permutation-equivariant functions, but not for large lengths. The study identifies the minimal equivariance structure and shows that additive positional encodings harm representability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between idealized, real-parameter transformer theory (permutation equivariance and universal approximation) and practical finite-precision implementations. Understand how floating-point arithmetic and rounding affect representational power and equivariance.

Method: Theoretical analysis of floating-point transformers: characterize the class of functions representable under finite precision, derive limits with respect to sequence length, and analyze the impact of positional encodings on representability. Likely uses finite-precision arithmetic arguments and counterexamples/constructions to establish results.

Result: 1) FP transformers can represent a class of non-permutation-equivariant functions even without positional encoding. 2) They can represent all permutation-equivariant functions when sequence length is bounded. 3) They cannot represent all permutation-equivariant functions when the sequence length is large. 4) Identifies the minimal equivariance structure and shows that non-trivial additive positional encodings harm representability.

Conclusion: Finite-precision constraints modify the landscape: certain desirable universal properties under exact arithmetic fail for long sequences, while new non-permutation-equivariant capabilities emerge. Avoid additive positional encodings if maximizing representational reach in FP transformers.

Abstract: The study on the expressive power of transformers shows that transformers are permutation equivariant, and they can approximate all permutation-equivariant continuous functions on a compact domain. However, these results are derived under real parameters and exact operations, while real implementations on computers can only use a finite set of numbers and inexact machine operations with round-off errors. In this work, we investigate the representability of floating-point transformers that use floating-point parameters and floating-point operations. Unlike existing results under exact operations, we first show that floating-point transformers can represent a class of non-permutation-equivariant functions even without positional encoding. Furthermore, we prove that floating-point transformers can represent all permutation-equivariant functions when the sequence length is bounded, but they cannot when the sequence length is large. We also found the minimal equivariance structure in floating-point transformers, and show that all non-trivial additive positional encoding can harm the representability of floating-point transformers.

### [66] [On the Effects of Adversarial Perturbations on Distribution Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16464)
*Yipei Wang,Zhaoying Pan,Xiaoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adversarial and distribution robustness trade off; a tractable surrogate via perturbed-data training; 𝑙∞ perturbations can boost distribution robustness under moderate bias; gains persist with strong skew due to simplicity bias and improved feature separability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To theoretically analyze how adversarial robustness and distribution robustness interact, explain when one improves or worsens the other, and reveal the role of data geometry and feature separability in this interaction.

Method: Provide a theoretical analysis that derives a tractable surrogate for per-step adversarial training by studying models trained on perturbed data; analyze ℓ∞ perturbations on biased data; connect robustness outcomes to feature separability and simplicity bias.

Result: Reveals a persistent adversarial–distribution robustness tradeoff, with ℓ∞ perturbations sometimes increasing distribution robustness on moderately biased data; on highly skewed data, simplicity bias that promotes reliance on core features can yield distribution robustness gains; overall robustness behavior is governed by feature separability.

Conclusion: Emphasizes that feature separability mediates robustness tradeoffs and that ignoring separability can lead to misleading conclusions about robustness; a refined understanding requires accounting for data geometry and the role of simplicity bias.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness refers to a model's ability to resist perturbation of inputs, while distribution robustness evaluates the performance of the model under data shifts. Although both aim to ensure reliable performance, prior work has revealed a tradeoff in distribution and adversarial robustness. Specifically, adversarial training might increase reliance on spurious features, which can harm distribution robustness, especially the performance on some underrepresented subgroups. We present a theoretical analysis of adversarial and distribution robustness that provides a tractable surrogate for per-step adversarial training by studying models trained on perturbed data. In addition to the tradeoff, our work further identified a nuanced phenomenon that $\ell_\infty$ perturbations on data with moderate bias can yield an increase in distribution robustness. Moreover, the gain in distribution robustness remains on highly skewed data when simplicity bias induces reliance on the core feature, characterized as greater feature separability. Our theoretical analysis extends the understanding of the tradeoff by highlighting the interplay of the tradeoff and the feature separability. Despite the tradeoff that persists in many cases, overlooking the role of feature separability may lead to misleading conclusions about robustness.

TL;DR: SSL-based MRI biomarkers via Residual Noise Contrastive Estimation (R-NCE) that integrates FreeSurfer features, yielding stronger disease prediction and biologically informative Brain Age Gap with genetic signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of hand-crafted MRI features and underperforming SSL methods by discovering disease-relevant biomarkers and linking them to biology.

Method: Introduce R-NCE, an SSL framework that blends auxiliary FreeSurfer-derived features with augmentation-invariant learning, and derive Brain Age Gap (BAG) for downstream genetic analyses.

Result: R-NCE surpasses traditional features and existing SSL methods across AD-related tasks, including conversion prediction; R-NCE-BAG demonstrates high heritability and associations with MAPT and IRAG1, enriched in astrocytes/oligodendrocytes.

Conclusion: Integrated SSL with auxiliary neuroimaging features yields more biologically meaningful MRI biomarkers; BAG-based genetics support relevance to neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular processes.

Abstract: Discovery of sensitive and biologically grounded biomarkers is essential for early detection and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Structural MRI is widely available but typically relies on hand-crafted features such as cortical thickness or volume. We ask whether self-supervised learning (SSL) can uncover more powerful biomarkers from the same data. Existing SSL methods underperform FreeSurfer-derived features in disease classification, conversion prediction, and amyloid status prediction. We introduce Residual Noise Contrastive Estimation (R-NCE), a new SSL framework that integrates auxiliary FreeSurfer features while maximizing additional augmentation-invariant information. R-NCE outperforms traditional features and existing SSL methods across multiple benchmarks, including AD conversion prediction. To assess biological relevance, we derive Brain Age Gap (BAG) measures and perform genome-wide association studies. R-NCE-BAG shows high heritability and associations with MAPT and IRAG1, with enrichment in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, indicating sensitivity to neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular processes.

*Shenghong Cai,Yiqun Zhang,Xiaopeng Luo,Yiu-Ming Cheung,Hong Jia,Peng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces MGCPL and CAME to form MCDC for scalable, robust clustering of categorical data by discovering multi-granular clusters and using encoding for final embeddings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Categorical data lack meaningful Euclidean distance; nested granular clusters are common; need scalable methods to uncover multi-granular structures.

Method: Proposes Multi-Granular Competitive Penalization Learning (MGCPL) to let clusters adapt and converge across stages with varying cluster counts; builds Cluster Aggregation via MGCPL Encoding (CAME) to encode data according to learned distributions; final clustering performed on embeddings (MCDC).

Result: MCDC automatically explores nested multi-granular clusters; robust across diverse categorical datasets; linear time complexity; scalable to large datasets; improves pre-partitioning for distributed computing; outperforms state-of-the-art on public datasets.

Conclusion: The MCDC framework effectively discovers and leverages multi-granular cluster structure in categorical data, offering robustness, scalability, and practical benefits for large-scale and distributed settings.

Abstract: Data set composed of categorical features is very common in big data analysis tasks. Since categorical features are usually with a limited number of qualitative possible values, the nested granular cluster effect is prevalent in the implicit discrete distance space of categorical data. That is, data objects frequently overlap in space or subspace to form small compact clusters, and similar small clusters often form larger clusters. However, the distance space cannot be well-defined like the Euclidean distance due to the qualitative categorical data values, which brings great challenges to the cluster analysis of categorical data. In view of this, we design a Multi-Granular Competitive Penalization Learning (MGCPL) algorithm to allow potential clusters to interactively tune themselves and converge in stages with different numbers of naturally compact clusters. To leverage MGCPL, we also propose a Cluster Aggregation strategy based on MGCPL Encoding (CAME) to first encode the data objects according to the learned multi-granular distributions, and then perform final clustering on the embeddings. It turns out that the proposed MGCPL-guided Categorical Data Clustering (MCDC) approach is competent in automatically exploring the nested distribution of multi-granular clusters and highly robust to categorical data sets from various domains. Benefiting from its linear time complexity, MCDC is scalable to large-scale data sets and promising in pre-partitioning data sets or compute nodes for boosting distributed computing. Extensive experiments with statistical evidence demonstrate its superiority compared to state-of-the-art counterparts on various real public data sets.

*Zekai Chen,Kairui Yang,Xunkai Li,Henan Sun,Zhihan Zhang,Jia Li,Qiangqiang Dai,Rong-Hua Li,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BoostFGL is a boosting-style fairness framework for federated graph learning that targets three coupled sources of unfairness—label skew, topology confounding, and aggregation dilution—via client-side node boosting, client-side topology boosting, and server-side model boosting; reports +8.43 percentage points in Overall-F1 on 9 datasets, with competitive overall accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In federated graph learning, average metrics mask underperformance on disadvantaged node groups. Fairness gaps arise from label skew toward majority patterns, topology confounding during message propagation, and aggregation dilution of updates from hard clients. A coordinated approach is needed to address these coupled sources.

Method: Three coordinated mechanisms: (1) Client-side node boosting: reweights/trains to emphasize systematically under-served nodes; (2) Client-side topology boosting: reallocates propagation emphasis toward reliable but underused structures and attenuates misleading neighborhoods; (3) Server-side model boosting: difficulty- and reliability-aware aggregation to preserve informative updates from hard clients while stabilizing the global model.

Result: Empirical evaluation on 9 datasets shows substantial fairness gains, with Overall-F1 improving by 8.43 percentage points, while maintaining competitive overall performance compared to strong FGL baselines.

Conclusion: BoostFGL demonstrates that fairness in federated graph learning can be significantly improved through coordinated Boosting across client data, topology, and server aggregation, achieving notable fairness gains without sacrificing overall performance; invites further exploration of efficiency and robustness in real-world deployments.

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables collaborative training of graph neural networks (GNNs) across decentralized subgraphs without exposing raw data. While existing FGL methods often achieve high overall accuracy, we show that this average performance can conceal severe degradation on disadvantaged node groups. From a fairness perspective, these disparities arise systematically from three coupled sources: label skew toward majority patterns, topology confounding in message propagation, and aggregation dilution of updates from hard clients. To address this, we propose \textbf{BoostFGL}, a boosting-style framework for fairness-aware FGL. BoostFGL introduces three coordinated mechanisms: \ding{182} \emph{Client-side node boosting}, which reshapes local training signals to emphasize systematically under-served nodes; \ding{183} \emph{Client-side topology boosting}, which reallocates propagation emphasis toward reliable yet underused structures and attenuates misleading neighborhoods; and \ding{184} \emph{Server-side model boosting}, which performs difficulty- and reliability-aware aggregation to preserve informative updates from hard clients while stabilizing the global model. Extensive experiments on 9 datasets show that BoostFGL delivers substantial fairness gains, improving Overall-F1 by 8.43\%, while preserving competitive overall performance against strong FGL baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces CRISPNAM-FG, an intrinsically interpretable competing-risks survival model based on Neural Additive Models with separate risk-specific projections, using the Fine-Gray CIF formulation; achieves competitive predictive performance while providing transparent shape functions and feature importance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for interpretable survival models in medical settings with competing risks to gain clinician trust and ensure AI safety, overcoming the opacity of deep learning models in survival analysis.

Method: Proposes CRISPNAM-FG, an intrinsically interpretable survival model built on Neural Additive Models with separate projection vectors per risk; uses the Fine-Gray formulation to predict the Cumulative Incidence Function; outputs interpretable shape functions and feature importance plots.

Result: Achieves competitive predictive performance against deep survival models on benchmark datasets; validated on a real-world dataset predicting diabetic foot complications across 29 Ontario hospitals (2016-2023); provides transparent, auditable predictions.

Conclusion: CRISPNAM-FG offers an interpretable alternative to black-box deep survival models for competing risks, maintaining predictive power while enabling transparency, which can facilitate clinical adoption.

Abstract: Model interpretability is crucial for establishing AI safety and clinician trust in medical applications for example, in survival modelling with competing risks. Recent deep learning models have attained very good predictive performance but their limited transparency, being black-box models, hinders their integration into clinical practice. To address this gap, we propose an intrinsically interpretable survival model called CRISPNAM-FG. Leveraging the structure of Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with separate projection vectors for each risk, our approach predicts the Cumulative Incidence Function using the Fine-Gray formulation, achieving high predictive power with intrinsically transparent and auditable predictions. We validated the model on several benchmark datasets and applied our model to predict future foot complications in diabetic patients across 29 Ontario hospitals (2016-2023). Our method achieves competitive performance compared to other deep survival models while providing transparency through shape functions and feature importance plots.

*Jiaye Li,Gang Chen,Hang Xu,Shichao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive kNN using an HNSW-based graph with a pre-computed voting mechanism that moves neighbor selection/weighting to training time, enabling real-time inference with maintained accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KNN accuracy comes at high computational cost for large-scale data; existing ANN methods trade speed for precision and lack adaptive neighborhood selection. The work aims to decouple inference latency from computational complexity.

Method: Construct an HNSW graph with a pre-computed voting mechanism. Train-time computation determines adaptive neighborhood sizes; higher graph layers enable fast navigation while lower layers encode precise decision boundaries with node-specific, variable neighbor counts.

Result: Benchmarking against eight state-of-the-art baselines on six datasets shows substantial inference speedups, achieving real-time performance without sacrificing accuracy.

Conclusion: The approach establishes a scalable, robust graph-based nonparametric learning paradigm that decouples neighbor selection from inference, enabling real-time kNN with maintained accuracy.

Abstract: The k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm is a cornerstone of non-parametric classification in artificial intelligence, yet its deployment in large-scale applications is persistently constrained by the computational trade-off between inference speed and accuracy. Existing approximate nearest neighbor solutions accelerate retrieval but often degrade classification precision and lack adaptability in selecting the optimal neighborhood size (k). Here, we present an adaptive graph model that decouples inference latency from computational complexity. By integrating a Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graph with a pre-computed voting mechanism, our framework completely transfers the computational burden of neighbor selection and weighting to the training phase. Within this topological structure, higher graph layers enable rapid navigation, while lower layers encode precise, node-specific decision boundaries with adaptive neighbor counts. Benchmarking against eight state-of-the-art baselines across six diverse datasets, we demonstrate that this architecture significantly accelerates inference speeds, achieving real-time performance, without compromising classification accuracy. These findings offer a scalable, robust solution to the long-standing inference bottleneck of kNN, establishing a new structural paradigm for graph-based nonparametric learning.

*Enes Arda,Semih Cayci,Atilla Eryilmaz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Shallow multi-head Transformers in the kernel regime admit finite-sample guarantees with width growing only logarithmically in data size; optimization error does not depend on sequence length, trading memory for context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To elucidate the optimization landscape of Transformers and why they train well, contrasting with recurrent architectures.

Method: Theoretical analysis of a shallow Transformer with m independent heads trained by projected gradient descent in the kernel regime; derive nonasymptotic width requirements and study optimization error w.r.t. sequence length T; assess memory vs context trade-off and validate numerically in a teacher-student setting.

Result: Width required for nonasymptotic guarantees scales logarithmically with sample size n. Optimization error is independent of sequence length T. Memory to preserve full context grows with T. Numerical validation in a teacher-student setting confirms the predicted scaling laws for Transformers.

Conclusion: In the kernel regime, Transformers exhibit favorable optimization properties with small data-dependent width and sequence-length-insensitive optimization error, at the cost of memory growth with context length; results offer insight into Transformer performance distinctions from RNNs and suggest directions for extending to more general settings.

Abstract: Understanding why Transformers perform so well remains challenging due to their non-convex optimization landscape. In this work, we analyze a shallow Transformer with $m$ independent heads trained by projected gradient descent in the kernel regime. Our analysis reveals two main findings: (i) the width required for nonasymptotic guarantees scales only logarithmically with the sample size $n$, and (ii) the optimization error is independent of the sequence length $T$. This contrasts sharply with recurrent architectures, where the optimization error can grow exponentially with $T$. The trade-off is memory: to keep the full context, the Transformer's memory requirement grows with the sequence length. We validate our theoretical results numerically in a teacher-student setting and confirm the predicted scaling laws for Transformers.

### [73] [DANCE: Dynamic, Available, Neighbor-gated Condensation for Federated Text-Attributed Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16519)
*Zekai Chen,Haodong Lu,Xunkai Li,Henan Sun,Jia Li,Hongchao Qin,Rong-Hua Li,Guoren Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DANCE is a round-wise, model-in-the-loop graph condensation framework for text-attributed federated graph learning (TAG-FGL) that improves performance while reducing LLM overhead and preserving interpretability by storing evidence packs that trace predictions to neighbors and source text spans. It achieves 2.33% accuracy gain at 8% condensation with 33.42% fewer tokens across 8 TAG datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address three challenges in TAG-FGL: (i) overhead of LLMs on long texts, (ii) suboptimality from one-shot, fixed condensation not adapting to the global model, and (iii) lack of interpretability due to black-box condensations.

Method: DANCE uses graph condensation (GC) with round-wise, model-in-the-loop refresh using the latest global model to adaptively update condensed neighborhoods. It also preserves provenance by producing evidence packs that link predictions to specific neighbors and source text spans, enabling local inspection.

Result: Across 8 TAG datasets, DANCE improves accuracy by 2.33% at an 8% condensation ratio and reduces token usage by 33.42% compared to baselines.

Conclusion: DANCE offers a practical TAG-FGL solution that balances accuracy and efficiency while enhancing interpretability through verifiable provenance, enabled by iterative condensation refreshed by the global model.

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) enables collaborative training on graph data across multiple clients. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), textual attributes in FGL graphs are gaining attention. Text-attributed graph federated learning (TAG-FGL) improves FGL by explicitly leveraging LLMs to process and integrate these textual features. However, current TAG-FGL methods face three main challenges: \textbf{(1) Overhead.} LLMs for processing long texts incur high token and computation costs. To make TAG-FGL practical, we introduce graph condensation (GC) to reduce computation load, but this choice also brings new issues. \textbf{(2) Suboptimal.} To reduce LLM overhead, we introduce GC into TAG-FGL by compressing multi-hop texts/neighborhoods into a condensed core with fixed LLM surrogates. However, this one-shot condensation is often not client-adaptive, leading to suboptimal performance. \textbf{(3) Interpretability.} LLM-based condensation further introduces a black-box bottleneck: summaries lack faithful attribution and clear grounding to specific source spans, making local inspection and auditing difficult. To address the above issues, we propose \textbf{DANCE}, a new TAG-FGL paradigm with GC. To improve \textbf{suboptimal} performance, DANCE performs round-wise, model-in-the-loop condensation refresh using the latest global model. To enhance \textbf{interpretability}, DANCE preserves provenance by storing locally inspectable evidence packs that trace predictions to selected neighbors and source text spans. Across 8 TAG datasets, DANCE improves accuracy by \textbf{2.33\%} at an \textbf{8\%} condensation ratio, with \textbf{33.42\%} fewer tokens than baselines.

*Xianya Fang,Feiyang Ren,Xiang Chen,Yu Tian,Zhen Bi,Haiyang Yu,Sheng-Jun Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces SARE, a geometric-stability driven unlearning framework for multimodal LLMs to suppress hallucinations robustly via targeted min-max optimization and Targeted-SAM, outperforming baselines and resisting relearning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current unlearning approaches for hallucinations in multimodal LLMs only achieve superficial erasure and are fragile to weight updates, leading to resurgent hallucinations. A geometry-aware, robust solution is needed to achieve durable suppression.

Method: Formulate unlearning as a targeted min-max optimization. Implement Targeted-SAM to flatten the loss landscape around hallucinated concepts. Train under simulated worst-case parameter perturbations to ensure robustness against weight shifts, while preserving general generation quality.

Result: SARE significantly improves erasure efficacy compared to baselines and maintains generation quality. It achieves persistent suppression of hallucinations even after relearning and parameter updates, validating geometric stabilization.

Conclusion: Geometric stabilization via targeted min-max optimization and Targeted-SAM yields robust, durable removal of hallucinations in multimodal LLMs, offering a practical and resilient unlearning approach.

Abstract: Multimodal LLMs are powerful but prone to object hallucinations, which describe non-existent entities and harm reliability. While recent unlearning methods attempt to mitigate this, we identify a critical flaw: structural fragility. We empirically demonstrate that standard erasure achieves only superficial suppression, trapping the model in sharp minima where hallucinations catastrophically resurge after lightweight relearning. To ensure geometric stability, we propose SARE, which casts unlearning as a targeted min-max optimization problem and uses a Targeted-SAM mechanism to explicitly flatten the loss landscape around hallucinated concepts. By suppressing hallucinations under simulated worst-case parameter perturbations, our framework ensures robust removal stable against weight shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SARE significantly outperforms baselines in erasure efficacy while preserving general generation quality. Crucially, it maintains persistent hallucination suppression against relearning and parameter updates, validating the effectiveness of geometric stabilization.

### [75] [A Collision-Free Hot-Tier Extension for Engram-Style Conditional Memory: A Controlled Study of Training Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16531)
*Tao Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Collision-free Engram-Nine (MPHF for frequent n-grams) does not universally improve validation loss; hot-to-cold loss dynamics reveal that collisions may act as regularization, and gating credit assignment, not index accuracy, limits training; collisions are not simply detrimental or beneficial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether high-frequency key collisions hinder Engram-style conditional memory and whether a collision-free design yields consistent training gains.

Method: Introduce Engram-Nine with a minimal perfect hash function mapping frequent n-grams as a hot tier, keep original multi-head hashed lookup as a cold tier, under iso-parameter settings; evaluate via route-stratified loss decomposition into hot/cold components; compare collision-prone and collision-free configurations.

Result: Collision-free design flips earlier than collision-prone baselines; hot positions start with lower loss but cold positions rise and surpass them; hot-to-cold advantage flip occurs earlier in collision-free setups; gating learns to prefer hot positions early and maintains high-weight assignment to higher-loss positions even after the flip; collisions appear to provide implicit regularization through noise.

Conclusion: Improving lookup precision alone is not sufficient; the main limitation lies in gating credit assignment. Collision-induced noise may offer beneficial regularization; naive elimination of collisions could remove this beneficial effect. Future work should explore how to align gating signals with loss dynamics and whether controlled collision noise can be leveraged for regularization.

Abstract: We investigate whether high-frequency key collisions are a primary bottleneck in Engram-style conditional memory. To isolate the effect of collisions, we introduce Engram-Nine, a collision-free hot-tier extension that maps the most frequent n-grams through a Minimal Perfect Hash Function (MPHF) while retaining the original multi-head hashed lookup as a cold tier. Under a strictly iso-parameter setup, the collision-free design does not consistently improve validation loss.
  Through route-stratified evaluation (decomposing per-token loss into hot/cold contributions), we uncover a consistent "hot-to-cold advantage flip" during training: hot (high-frequency) positions initially have lower loss, but cold positions eventually surpass them. Crucially, collision-free configurations flip earlier than collision-prone baselines, suggesting that collisions act as implicit regularization. We also identify a gating mismatch: the gate learns to favor hot positions early in training, but this preference persists even after the flip, assigning higher weights to positions with higher loss.
  Our findings suggest that improving lookup precision alone does not guarantee better training outcomes. The dominant limitation may lie in gating credit assignment rather than index accuracy, and collision-induced noise may provide beneficial regularization that should not be naively eliminated.

*Xiaobin Li,Run Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JORC-UMAP adds Ollivier-Ricci curvature and a Jaccard-based topological prior to UMAP to stabilize manifold geometry, reducing tearing and collapse and improving preservation as measured by SVM accuracy and triplet scores while remaining efficient.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UMAP’s local Euclidean distance assumption and sensitivity to the k-NN graph can distort intrinsic manifold geometry, causing topological tearing and structural collapse. A geometric/topological prior could stabilize edge structure and preserve true neighborhoods.

Method: Introduce Ollivier-Ricci curvature as a geometric prior to reinforce edges at geometric bottlenecks and prune redundant links. Add a Jaccard-based topological prior to enforce neighborhood consistency amid noise in curvature estimation. Integrate these priors into UMAP to form JORC-UMAP.

Result: Empirical evaluation on synthetic and real-world datasets shows JORC-UMAP reduces tearing and collapse more effectively than standard UMAP and other dimensionality reduction methods, as evidenced by higher SVM accuracy and better triplet preservation scores, with maintained computational efficiency.

Conclusion: A geometry-aware enhancement of UMAP that combines curvature-based and topological priors improves faithful visualization of high-dimensional data by better capturing intrinsic manifold structure and reducing spurious connections.

Abstract: Nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques, particularly UMAP, are widely used for visualizing high-dimensional data. However, UMAP's local Euclidean distance assumption often fails to capture intrinsic manifold geometry, leading to topological tearing and structural collapse. We identify UMAP's sensitivity to the k-nearest neighbor graph as a key cause. To address this, we introduce Ollivier-Ricci curvature as a geometric prior, reinforcing edges at geometric bottlenecks and reducing redundant links. Since curvature estimation is noise-sensitive, we also incorporate a topological prior using Jaccard similarity to ensure neighborhood consistency. The resulting method, JORC-UMAP, better distinguishes true manifold structure from spurious connections. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that JORC-UMAP reduces tearing and collapse more effectively than standard UMAP and other DR methods, as measured by SVM accuracy and triplet preservation scores, while maintaining computational efficiency. This work offers a geometry-aware enhancement to UMAP for more faithful data visualization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes kNN-ICL, a k-nearest-neighbor in-context learning framework for startup success prediction using LLMs in data-scarce VC settings; uses Crunchbase data; claims higher accuracy than baselines and good performance with ~50 demonstrations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity in early-stage startup prediction makes traditional supervised learning ineffective; need zero-/few-shot methods that leverage LLMs without additional model training.

Method: Introduce kNN-ICL that selects the most similar past startups as in-context demonstration examples for prompting an LLM to predict startup success; investigate effect of number of in-context examples and use real Crunchbase profiles.

Result: kNN-ICL outperforms supervised ML baselines and vanilla ICL; achieves high balanced accuracy with as few as 50 examples.

Conclusion: kNN-ICL offers a practical, data-efficient decision-support tool for VC firms operating in data-scarce environments, illustrating the viability of in-context learning for startup success prediction.

Abstract: Venture capital (VC) investments in early-stage startups that end up being successful can yield high returns. However, predicting early-stage startup success remains challenging due to data scarcity (e.g., many VC firms have information about only a few dozen of early-stage startups and whether they were successful). This limits the effectiveness of traditional machine learning methods that rely on large labeled datasets for model training. To address this challenge, we propose an in-context learning framework for startup success prediction using large language models (LLMs) that requires no model training and leverages only a small set of labeled startups as demonstration examples. Specifically, we propose a novel k-nearest-neighbor-based in-context learning framework, called kNN-ICL, which selects the most relevant past startups as examples based on similarity. Using real-world profiles from Crunchbase, we find that the kNN-ICL approach achieves higher prediction accuracy than supervised machine learning baselines and vanilla in-context learning. Further, we study how performance varies with the number of in-context examples and find that a high balanced accuracy can be achieved with as few as 50 examples. Together, we demonstrate that in-context learning can serve as a decision-making tool for VC firms operating in data-scarce environments.

Dataset spans 2018–2024 and comprises ~38.5 million observations across Finland’s 5,915 km rail network.

Result: Key findings include seasonal delay patterns (winter delays >25%), geographic clustering of high-delay corridors in central/northern Finland, and a baseline ML result: XGBoost regression MAE = 2.73 minutes for station-specific delay prediction.

Conclusion: The dataset enables diverse ML applications in railway operations (delay prediction, weather impact assessment, infrastructure vulnerability mapping) and represents the first public resource of its kind for Finland, supporting reliability analysis and resilience planning.

Abstract: Train delays result from complex interactions between operational, technical, and environmental factors. While weather impacts railway reliability, particularly in Nordic regions, existing datasets rarely integrate meteorological information with operational train data. This study presents the first publicly available dataset combining Finnish railway operations with synchronized meteorological observations from 2018-2024. The dataset integrates operational metrics from Finland Digitraffic Railway Traffic Service with weather measurements from 209 environmental monitoring stations, using spatial-temporal alignment via Haversine distance. It encompasses 28 engineered features across operational variables and meteorological measurements, covering approximately 38.5 million observations from Finland's 5,915-kilometer rail network. Preprocessing includes strategic missing data handling through spatial fallback algorithms, cyclical encoding of temporal features, and robust scaling of weather data to address sensor outliers. Analysis reveals distinct seasonal patterns, with winter months exhibiting delay rates exceeding 25\% and geographic clustering of high-delay corridors in central and northern Finland. Furthermore, the work demonstrates applications of the data set in analysing the reliability of railway traffic in Finland. A baseline experiment using XGBoost regression achieved a Mean Absolute Error of 2.73 minutes for predicting station-specific delays, demonstrating the dataset's utility for machine learning applications. The dataset enables diverse applications, including train delay prediction, weather impact assessment, and infrastructure vulnerability mapping, providing researchers with a flexible resource for machine learning applications in railway operations research.

*Lin Huang,Chengxiang Huang,Ziang Wang,Yiyue Du,Chu Wang,Haocheng Lu,Yunyang Li,Xiaoli Liu,Arthur Jiang,Jia Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: E2Former-V2 proposes algebraic sparsity (EAAS) and on-the-fly equivariant attention to scale E(3)-equivariant GNNs by avoiding dense edge tensors, achieving ~20x TFLOPS speedups with comparable accuracy on SPICE/OMol25.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scalability bottlenecks in equivariant GNNs due to explicit construction of geometric features and dense tensor products on every edge, hindering inference and training on large 3D datasets.

Method: Introduce EAAS via Wigner-6j convolution with an SO(3)->SO(2) change of basis, transforming dense contractions into sparse parity re-indexing. Add On-the-Fly Equivariant Attention implemented as a fused Triton kernel, eliminating materialized edge tensors and maximizing SRAM utilization, resulting in a node-centric computation.

Result: Achieves ~20× TFLOPS improvement over standard implementations. Maintains comparable predictive performance on SPICE and OMol25 datasets while accelerating inference. Code available at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that large equivariant transformers can be trained efficiently on widely accessible GPUs using algebraic sparsity and hardware-aware kernels, enabling scalable 3D molecular modeling.

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNNs) have become a widely used approach for modeling 3D atomistic systems. However, mainstream architectures face critical scalability bottlenecks due to the explicit construction of geometric features or dense tensor products on \textit{every} edge. To overcome this, we introduce \textbf{E2Former-V2}, a scalable architecture that integrates algebraic sparsity with hardware-aware execution. We first propose \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{A}xis-\textbf{A}ligned \textbf{S}parsification (EAAS). EAAS builds on Wigner-$6j$ convolution by exploiting an $\mathrm{SO}(3) \rightarrow \mathrm{SO}(2)$ change of basis to transform computationally expensive dense tensor contractions into efficient, sparse parity re-indexing operations. Building on this representation, we introduce \textbf{On-the-Fly Equivariant Attention}, a fully node-centric mechanism implemented via a custom fused Triton kernel. By eliminating materialized edge tensors and maximizing SRAM utilization, our kernel achieves a \textbf{20$\times$ improvement in TFLOPS} compared to standard implementations. Extensive experiments on the SPICE and OMol25 datasets demonstrate that E2Former-V2 maintains comparable predictive performance while notably accelerating inference. This work demonstrates that large equivariant transformers can be trained efficiently using widely accessible GPU platforms.

*Haonan Yang,Jianchao Tang,Zhuo Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DPAD introduces a Dynamic Dual-Prototype bank with context-aware routing and a disentanglement loss to dynamically capture common and rare temporal patterns, improving forecasting performance and reliability across diverse benchmarks in a model-agnostic manner.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series forecasting models often learn static, averaged representations by entangling multiple temporal patterns, failing to disentangle prevalent trends/seasonality from rare events and lacking context-aware adaptation.

Method: DPAD comprises a Dynamic Dual-Prototype bank (DDP) with a common pattern bank (strong temporal priors) and a rare pattern bank (infrequent, critical events); a Dual-Path Context-aware routing (DPC) retrieves context-specific prototypes; a Disentanglement-Guided Loss (DGLoss) promotes specialization and comprehensive coverage; the framework is model-agnostic and acts as an auxiliary module.

Result: Extensive experiments show DPAD consistently improves forecasting accuracy and reliability of state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world benchmarks.

Conclusion: DPAD offers a plug-in, generalizable approach to pattern disentanglement and context-aware adaptation for time series forecasting, enhancing performance and robustness by leveraging distinct prototype banks and selective routing.

Abstract: Time series forecasting has witnessed significant progress with deep learning. While prevailing approaches enhance forecasting performance by modifying architectures or introducing novel enhancement strategies, they often fail to dynamically disentangle and leverage the complex, intertwined temporal patterns inherent in time series, thus resulting in the learning of static, averaged representations that lack context-aware capabilities. To address this, we propose the Dual-Prototype Adaptive Disentanglement framework (DPAD), a model-agnostic auxiliary method that equips forecasting models with the ability of pattern disentanglement and context-aware adaptation. Specifically, we construct a Dynamic Dual-Prototype bank (DDP), comprising a common pattern bank with strong temporal priors to capture prevailing trend or seasonal patterns, and a rare pattern bank dynamically memorizing critical yet infrequent events, and then an Dual-Path Context-aware routing (DPC) mechanism is proposed to enhance outputs with selectively retrieved context-specific pattern representations from the DDP. Additionally, we introduce a Disentanglement-Guided Loss (DGLoss) to ensure that each prototype bank specializes in its designated role while maintaining comprehensive coverage. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DPAD consistently improves forecasting performance and reliability of state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world benchmarks.

### [81] [Provably Robust Bayesian Counterfactual Explanations under Model Changes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16659)
*Jamie Duell,Xiuyi Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Probabilistically Safe Counterfactual Explanations (PSCE) that are δ-safe and ε-robust to model updates, using Bayesian methods to provide probabilistic guarantees under changing models, evaluated against Bayesian CE baselines with favorable results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Counterfactual explanations can become invalid when deployed models are updated. There is a need for explanations that maintain high predictive confidence and low variance despite model changes, enabling reliable interpretability in dynamic settings.

Method: Develop PSCE within a Bayesian framework, define a ⟨δ, ε⟩-set with δ-safety (high predictive confidence) and ε-robustness (low predictive variance). Integrate uncertainty-aware constraints into the optimization objective to produce counterfactuals that remain plausible under model updates; provide formal probabilistic guarantees under model changes.

Result: Empirical evaluation on diverse datasets shows that PSCE yields more plausible and discriminative counterfactuals and offers provable robustness under model change, outperforming state-of-the-art Bayesian CE methods.

Conclusion: PSCE offers formal probabilistic guarantees for counterfactual explanations under evolving models and can be optimized with uncertainty-aware constraints to generate robust and reliable explanations in practice.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CEs) offer interpretable insights into machine learning predictions by answering ``what if?" questions. However, in real-world settings where models are frequently updated, existing counterfactual explanations can quickly become invalid or unreliable. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistically Safe CEs (PSCE), a method for generating counterfactual explanations that are $δ$-safe, to ensure high predictive confidence, and $ε$-robust to ensure low predictive variance. Based on Bayesian principles, PSCE provides formal probabilistic guarantees for CEs under model changes which are adhered to in what we refer to as the $\langle δ, ε\rangle$-set. Uncertainty-aware constraints are integrated into our optimization framework and we validate our method empirically across diverse datasets. We compare our approach against state-of-the-art Bayesian CE methods, where PSCE produces counterfactual explanations that are not only more plausible and discriminative, but also provably robust under model change.

### [82] [Dynamic Expert-Guided Model Averaging for Causal Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16715)
*Adrick Tench,Thomas Demeester*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dynamic model-averaging ensemble for causal discovery that harnesses expert feedback, including imperfect sources like LLMs, to combine diverse algorithms. It shows robustness and practical gains on clean and noisy data, with implications for clinical causal discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Causal discovery faces a proliferation of algorithms with varying assumptions; real-world data often violate these assumptions. Ensemble methods and integration of expert knowledge (including LLMs) can improve reliability and interpretability, especially in clinical settings.

Method: A flexible, dynamically requested expert-knowledge–driven model-averaging framework that ensembles a diverse set of causal discovery algorithms. Expert inputs dynamically weight or select components, with on-demand querying of experts (e.g., LLMs).

Result: Empirical evaluation demonstrates improved performance with imperfect experts like LLMs on both clean and noisy data. The study analyzes how varying levels of expert correctness affect outcomes and showcases LLMs’ potential for clinical causal discovery.

Conclusion: Dynamic, expert-informed ensembling provides a practical path to robust causal discovery under imperfect knowledge, enhancing interpretability and utility for treatment effect estimation, with actionable guidance for practitioners.

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships is critical for healthcare. Accurate causal models provide a means to enhance the interpretability of predictive models, and furthermore a basis for counterfactual and interventional reasoning and the estimation of treatment effects. However, would-be practitioners of causal discovery face a dizzying array of algorithms without a clear best choice. This abundance of competitive algorithms makes ensembling a natural choice for practical applications. At the same time, real-world use cases frequently face challenges that violate the assumptions of common causal discovery algorithms, forcing heavy reliance on expert knowledge. Inspired by recent work on dynamically requested expert knowledge and LLMs as experts, we present a flexible model averaging method leveraging dynamically requested expert knowledge to ensemble a diverse array of causal discovery algorithms. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our method with imperfect experts such as LLMs on both clean and noisy data. We also analyze the impact of different degrees of expert correctness and assess the capabilities of LLMs for clinical causal discovery, providing valuable insights for practitioners.

*Francesca Lanzillotta,Chiara Albisani,Davide Pucci,Daniele Baracchi,Alessandro Piva,Matteo Lapucci*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A sequential penalty framework for enforcing hard constraints in deep learning optimization, with convergence guarantees and practical viability demonstrated on image processing tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hard per-sample processing requirements should be formalized as strict constraints in the optimization problem, not as arbitrary penalties, to ensure correct and reliable behavior.

Method: Introduces a sequential penalty method that iteratively enforces constraints during training; provides convergence guarantees under assumptions that are reasonable in deep learning settings.

Result: Empirical evaluation on image processing tasks shows the method is practical and viable for use in real-world deep learning workflows.

Conclusion: Hard constraints on data processing can be effectively integrated into deep learning via a sequential penalty approach, yielding both theoretical convergence and practical viability.

Abstract: In many learning tasks, certain requirements on the processing of individual data samples should arguably be formalized as strict constraints in the underlying optimization problem, rather than by means of arbitrary penalties. We show that, in these scenarios, learning can be carried out exploiting a sequential penalty method that allows to properly deal with constraints. The proposed algorithm is shown to possess convergence guarantees under assumptions that are reasonable in deep learning scenarios. Moreover, the results of experiments on image processing tasks show that the method is indeed viable to be used in practice.

### [84] [Uncertainty propagation through trained multi-layer perceptrons: Exact analytical results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16830)
*Andrew Thompson,Miles McCrory*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Exact analytical expressions for the mean and variance of a one-hidden-layer MLP with ReLU under Gaussian input, without using series expansions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty propagation through neural networks is important for reliable predictions. Prior work often relies on approximate series expansions or moment-matching; providing exact moment expressions for a simple yet representative architecture aids understanding and offers a baseline for more complex models.

Method: Model setup: input x ~ N(μ, Σ). Pre-activation u = W1 x + b1 ~ N(μ_u, Σ_u) with μ_u = W1 μ + b1 and Σ_u = W1 Σ W1^T. Output is y = W2 ReLU(u) + b2. Let h = ReLU(u) = max(0, u). Compute E[h] and Cov(h) via moments of a truncated multivariate normal on the positive orthant (u_i > 0). Then y = W2 h + b2 yields E[y] = W2 E[h] + b2 and Cov(y) = W2 Cov(h) W2^T. The key claim is that these expressions are exact (not series-approximated).

Result: Provides exact formulas for the output mean and variance in terms of the Gaussian input parameters and network weights, using truncated-normal moments for the hidden layer and a linear transform to obtain the final moment expressions.

Conclusion: The work delivers a rigorous method for exact moment propagation through a simple neural architecture, enabling precise uncertainty quantification with low to moderate computational complexity. Limitations include restriction to a single hidden layer, ReLU activation, Gaussian inputs, and potential computational burden of multivariate normal integrals for high-dimensional hidden layers; extensions to deeper nets and non-Gaussian inputs are natural future directions.

Abstract: We give analytical results for propagation of uncertainty through trained multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with a single hidden layer and ReLU activation functions. More precisely, we give expressions for the mean and variance of the output when the input is multivariate Gaussian. In contrast to previous results, we obtain exact expressions without resort to a series expansion.

### [85] [Calibrated Probabilistic Interpolation for GEDI Biomass](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16834)
*Robin Young,Srinivasan Keshav*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Attentive Neural Processes (ANPs) yield calibrated, uncertainty-aware wall-to-wall biomass mapping from sparse GEDI data by conditioning on local observations and geospatial embeddings, outperforming standard ensembles in heterogeneous landscapes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To obtain reliable uncertainty estimates and leverage local spatial context in sparse-LiDAR-based biomass mapping across diverse, heterogeneous biomes where traditional ensemble methods fail to calibrate predictions.

Method: Introduce Attentive Neural Processes (ANPs), a probabilistic meta-learning framework that conditions predictions on local observation sets and geospatial foundation model embeddings, learns a flexible spatial covariance, and enables few-shot adaptation across regions; compared to Random Forest and XGBoost ensembles.

Result: ANPs achieve competitive biomass mapping accuracy across five biomes (Tropical Amazonian forests, Boreal, Alpine ecosystems) while delivering near-ideal uncertainty calibration; effective cross-region transfer with minimal local data.

Conclusion: ANPs provide a scalable, theoretically grounded alternative to ensemble variance for continental-scale earth observation, enabling calibrated uncertainty and adaptive performance in heterogeneous landscapes.

Abstract: Reliable wall-to-wall biomass mapping from NASA's GEDI mission requires interpolating sparse LiDAR observations across heterogeneous landscapes. While machine learning approaches like Random Forest and XGBoost are standard for this task, they treat spatial predictions of GEDI observations from multispectral or SAR remote sensing data as independent without adapting to the varying difficulty of heterogeneous landscapes. We demonstrate these approaches generally fail to produce calibrated prediction intervals. We identify that this stems from conflating ensemble variance with aleatoric uncertainty and ignoring local spatial context.
  To resolve this, we introduce Attentive Neural Processes (ANPs), a probabilistic meta-learning framework that explicitly conditions predictions on local observation sets and geospatial foundation model embeddings. Unlike static ensembles, ANPs learn a flexible spatial covariance function, allowing uncertainty estimates to expand in complex landscapes and contract in homogeneous areas. We validate this approach across five distinct biomes ranging from Tropical Amazonian forests to Boreal and Alpine ecosystems, demonstrating that ANPs achieve competitive accuracy while maintaining near-ideal uncertainty calibration. We demonstrate the operational utility of the method through few-shot adaptation, where the model recovers most of the performance gap in cross-region transfer using minimal local data. This work provides a scalable, theoretically rigorous alternative to ensemble variance for continental scale earth observation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLM-guided refinement of FunSearch outputs yields new adversarial constructions and improved lower bounds for hierarchical k-median, bin packing, knapsack, and a Lovász gasoline generalization; demonstrates essential human oversight for turning patterns into rigorous results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore whether human-LLM collaboration can advance open problems in theoretical CS by deriving rigorous constructions and tighter lower bounds from LLM-generated patterns.

Method: Seed FunSearch outputs with human-guided refinement to generate adversarial instances; iteratively optimize constructions across multiple problems (hierarchical k-median, bin packing, knapsack, Lovász gasoline generalization) to tighten lower bounds.

Result: Obtained state-of-the-art lower bounds for standard heuristics; produced improved constructions previously stagnant for over a decade for several problems; demonstrates practical value of combining LLM evolution with expert oversight.

Conclusion: LLMs can be a strong collaborative tool in mathematics and CS; however, human expertise is essential to transform LLM-derived patterns into rigorous, insightful results and to break long-standing barriers.

Abstract: We demonstrate the power of human-LLM collaboration in tackling open problems in theoretical computer science. Focusing on combinatorial optimization, we refine outputs from the FunSearch algorithm [Romera-Paredes et al., Nature 2023] to derive state-of-the-art lower bounds for standard heuristics. Specifically, we target the generation of adversarial instances where these heuristics perform poorly. By iterating on FunSearch's outputs, we identify improved constructions for hierarchical $k$-median clustering, bin packing, the knapsack problem, and a generalization of Lovász's gasoline problem - some of these have not seen much improvement for over a decade, despite intermittent attention. These results illustrate how expert oversight can effectively extrapolate algorithmic insights from LLM-based evolutionary methods to break long-standing barriers.
  Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs provide critical initial patterns, human expertise is essential for transforming these patterns into mathematically rigorous and insightful constructions. This work highlights that LLMs are a strong collaborative tool in mathematics and computer science research.

### [87] [Provably Learning Attention with Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16873)
*Satwik Bhattamishra,Kulin Shah,Michael Hahn,Varun Kanade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work analyzes learning Transformer-based models from black-box real-valued outputs. It proves exact learnability for single-head attention with O(d^2) queries, extends to one-layer Transformers given a learnable ReLU FFN, and provides a randomized O(rd) query method when head dimension r is small. It also shows robustness to noise under mild conditions and demonstrates non-identifiability of multi-head attention from value queries without extra structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how and when Transformer components can be recovered from black-box, value-based queries, and to establish fundamental limits on identifiability and sample/query efficiency in this setting.

Method: - Constructive algorithms for exact learning of single-head softmax-attention with O(d^2) queries. - Show that if a ReLU FFN can be learned, the single-head method extends to one-layer Transformers. - Develop a randomized compressed-sensing-based algorithm to learn single-head models with O(rd) queries when head dimension r << d. - Analyze robustness to noisy oracle outputs under norm/margin conditions. - Argue non-identifiability of multi-head parameters from value queries in general.

Result: - Exact parameter recovery for single-head attention with O(d^2) queries. - One-layer Transformer with single-head attention can be learned if FFN is learnable. - For r << d, a randomized algorithm achieves O(rd) queries via compressed sensing. - Parameters can be estimated to ε accuracy under mild noise with polynomial queries. - Multi-head attention parameters are not identifiable from value queries without extra assumptions; analogous guarantees do not hold in general.

Conclusion: The paper delineates a tractable, query-efficient pathway to learn single-head Transformer components from black-box outputs and highlights fundamental identifiability limitations for multi-head attention. It also connects learnability to existing FFN learning assumptions, and demonstrates robustness to noise under practical conditions.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning Transformer-based sequence models with black-box access to their outputs. In this setting, a learner may adaptively query the oracle with any sequence of vectors and observe the corresponding real-valued output. We begin with the simplest case, a single-head softmax-attention regressor. We show that for a model with width $d$, there is an elementary algorithm to learn the parameters of single-head attention exactly with $O(d^2)$ queries. Further, we show that if there exists an algorithm to learn ReLU feedforward networks (FFNs), then the single-head algorithm can be easily adapted to learn one-layer Transformers with single-head attention. Next, motivated by the regime where the head dimension $r \ll d$, we provide a randomised algorithm that learns single-head attention-based models with $O(rd)$ queries via compressed sensing arguments. We also study robustness to noisy oracle access, proving that under mild norm and margin conditions, the parameters can be estimated to $\varepsilon$ accuracy with a polynomial number of queries even when outputs are only provided up to additive tolerance. Finally, we show that multi-head attention parameters are not identifiable from value queries in general -- distinct parameterisations can induce the same input-output map. Hence, guarantees analogous to the single-head setting are impossible without additional structural assumptions.

*Bethan Evans,Jared Tanner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Derives minimal-norm weight perturbations for DNNs to induce a specified output change, and contrasts single-layer exact formulas with multi-layer Lipschitz-based robustness bounds. Applies the theory to precision-modification backdoor attacks, establishing provable compression thresholds that block such attacks; shows low-rank compression can trigger latent backdoors while preserving full-precision accuracy. Reveals how back-propagated margins govern layer-wise sensitivity and yields certifiable guarantees on the smallest parameter updates compatible with a given output shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantify and compare robustness of neural networks to parameter perturbations, unify exact perturbation expressions with Lipschitz-based guarantees, and assess security implications of backdoor attacks under model compression.

Method: Analytical derivation of minimal-norm perturbations for single-layer networks; comparison with multi-layer Lipschitz-constant-based bounds; derivation of back-propagated margins linking layer sensitivity to input-output changes; empirical evaluation on backdoor attacks under precision modification and low-rank compression.

Result: Exact single-layer perturbation formulas and multi-layer Lipschitz bounds are of the same order, indicating similar robustness guarantees. Provable compression thresholds exist below which precision-modification backdoors cannot succeed. Empirically, low-rank compression can reliably activate latent backdoors while maintaining full-precision accuracy. The framework shows how back-propagated margins govern layer-wise sensitivity and provides certifiable guarantees on the smallest parameter updates for a given output shift.

Conclusion: Margin-driven perturbation analysis provides tight, certifiable guarantees on the minimal parameter updates needed for a desired output change, bridging exact single-layer results and Lipschitz-based robustness. The findings highlight security implications of compression: thresholds can block certain backdoor attacks, while compression (notably low-rank) may expose latent backdoors, underscoring the need for margin-aware robustness and defense strategies.

Abstract: The minimal norm weight perturbations of DNNs required to achieve a specified change in output are derived and the factors determining its size are discussed. These single-layer exact formulae are contrasted with more generic multi-layer Lipschitz constant based robustness guarantees; both are observed to be of the same order which indicates similar efficacy in their guarantees. These results are applied to precision-modification-activated backdoor attacks, establishing provable compression thresholds below which such attacks cannot succeed, and show empirically that low-rank compression can reliably activate latent backdoors while preserving full-precision accuracy. These expressions reveal how back-propagated margins govern layer-wise sensitivity and provide certifiable guarantees on the smallest parameter updates consistent with a desired output shift.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MGDL trains deep networks grade-by-grade, freezing earlier grades, to ensure residuals shrink and converge to zero with a fixed-width ReLU scheme; provides the first theoretical guarantee of vanishing approximation error under grade-wise training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address optimization challenges in deep networks by leveraging stable, convex-like training for shallow networks and extending this stability to deeper architectures through structured, stage-wise refinement.

Method: Develop an operator-theoretic foundation for MGDL, introduce a fixed-width multigrade ReLU scheme, prove that residuals decrease strictly across grades and converge uniformly to zero for any continuous target function, and validate with numerical experiments.

Result: Existence of a fixed-width multigrade ReLU scheme with strictly decreasing residuals across grades and uniform convergence of the approximation error to zero; empirical results corroborate the theory.

Conclusion: This work provides the first rigorous guarantee that grade-wise training yields vanishing approximation error in deep networks, offering a principled, stable path to deep learning with provable properties.

Abstract: We study multigrade deep learning (MGDL) as a principled framework for structured error refinement in deep neural networks. While the approximation power of neural networks is now relatively well understood, training very deep architectures remains challenging due to highly non-convex and often ill-conditioned optimization landscapes. In contrast, for relatively shallow networks, most notably one-hidden-layer $\texttt{ReLU}$ models, training admits convex reformulations with global guarantees, motivating learning paradigms that improve stability while scaling to depth. MGDL builds upon this insight by training deep networks grade by grade: previously learned grades are frozen, and each new residual block is trained solely to reduce the remaining approximation error, yielding an interpretable and stable hierarchical refinement process. We develop an operator-theoretic foundation for MGDL and prove that, for any continuous target function, there exists a fixed-width multigrade $\texttt{ReLU}$ scheme whose residuals decrease strictly across grades and converge uniformly to zero. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first rigorous theoretical guarantee that grade-wise training yields provable vanishing approximation error in deep networks. Numerical experiments further illustrate the theoretical results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable federated learning under functional constraints while operating under limited communication, multiple local updates, and partial client participation, without relying on dual variables or inner solvers.

Method: Builds on the switching gradient method to produce projection-free, primal-only updates; incorporates bi-directional error feedback to correct compression bias; analyzes interaction between compression noise and multi-step local updates; introduces a soft switching variant to stabilize near the feasibility boundary.

Result: Proves convergence: the averaged iterate attains the canonical O(1/√T) rate with high-probability bounds that separate optimization progress from sampling noise due to partial participation.

Conclusion: FedSGM is the first framework unifying functional constraints, compression, multiple local updates, and partial participation in federated learning, providing a theoretically grounded foundation; validated experimentally on Neyman-Pearson classification and constrained MDP tasks.

Abstract: We introduce FedSGM, a unified framework for federated constrained optimization that addresses four major challenges in federated learning (FL): functional constraints, communication bottlenecks, local updates, and partial client participation. Building on the switching gradient method, FedSGM provides projection-free, primal-only updates, avoiding expensive dual-variable tuning or inner solvers. To handle communication limits, FedSGM incorporates bi-directional error feedback, correcting the bias introduced by compression while explicitly understanding the interaction between compression noise and multi-step local updates. We derive convergence guarantees showing that the averaged iterate achieves the canonical $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate, with additional high-probability bounds that decouple optimization progress from sampling noise due to partial participation. Additionally, we introduce a soft switching version of FedSGM to stabilize updates near the feasibility boundary. To our knowledge, FedSGM is the first framework to unify functional constraints, compression, multiple local updates, and partial client participation, establishing a theoretically grounded foundation for constrained federated learning. Finally, we validate the theoretical guarantees of FedSGM via experimentation on Neyman-Pearson classification and constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crop type maps derived from satellite data are critical for food security and livelihoods in smallholder regions, but many satellite-based methods fail under smallholder conditions. This work proposes an embedding-based approach evaluated with TESSERA and AlphaEarth to address performance, plausibility, transferability, and accessibility.

Method: Define a four-part criteria for embedding-based crop mapping and evaluate FM embeddings (TESSERA and AlphaEarth) against current baselines for a region in the groundnut basin of Senegal; assess land cover and crop type mapping; include a temporal transfer example.

Result: TESSERA-based approach fulfills the criteria best, achieving up to 28% higher accuracy in a temporal transfer example compared with the next best method; embeddings are effective for crop type classification in Senegal.

Conclusion: TESSERA embeddings are a promising approach for crop type mapping in smallholder regions like Senegal; suggests broader applicability, with future work needed on transferability, reproducibility, and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Crop type maps from satellite remote sensing are important tools for food security, local livelihood support and climate change mitigation in smallholder regions of the world, but most satellite-based methods are not well suited to smallholder conditions. To address this gap, we establish a four-part criteria for a useful embedding-based approach consisting of 1) performance, 2) plausibility, 3) transferability and 4) accessibility and evaluate geospatial foundation model (FM) embeddings -based approaches using TESSERA and AlphaEarth against current baseline methods for a region in the groundnut basin of Senegal. We find that the TESSERA -based approach to land cover and crop type mapping fulfills the selection criteria best, and in one temporal transfer example shows 28% higher accuracy compared to the next best method. These results indicate that TESSERA embeddings are an effective approach for crop type classification and mapping tasks in Senegal.

Motivation: Existing unlearning methods on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures exploit router manipulations to hide forgetting, by redirecting queries rather than erasing knowledge, which harms utility. A mechanism that enforces forgetting in the expert parameters—while keeping routing decisions stable—is needed to generalize unlearning to MoEs.

Method: Introduce Geometric Routing Invariance Preservation (GRIP), an adapter that projects router gradient updates into expert-specific null spaces. This decouples routing stability from parameter rigidity: discrete expert selections remain stable for retained knowledge, while continuous router parameters remain plastic within the null space to permit reconfiguration for unlearning. Acts as a model-agnostic constraint that does not alter the core unlearning algorithm.

Result: Empirical demonstrations on large-scale MoEs show that GRIP eliminates expert selection shift (routing stability >95%) across tested unlearning methods while preserving their utility.

Conclusion: GRIP provides an algorithm-agnostic, modular solution that adapts dense-architecture unlearning methods to MoEs by preventing router-vulnerability exploitation and forcing forgetting to occur within expert parameters, enabling more robust, generalizable unlearning in MoEs.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) for large language models has become critical for AI safety, yet existing methods fail to generalize to Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We identify that traditional unlearning methods exploit MoE's architectural vulnerability: they manipulate routers to redirect queries away from knowledgeable experts rather than erasing knowledge, causing a loss of model utility and superficial forgetting. We propose Geometric Routing Invariance Preservation (GRIP), an algorithm-agnostic framework for unlearning for MoE. Our core contribution is a geometric constraint, implemented by projecting router gradient updates into an expert-specific null-space. Crucially, this decouples routing stability from parameter rigidity: while discrete expert selections remain stable for retained knowledge, the continuous router parameters remain plastic within the null space, allowing the model to undergo necessary internal reconfiguration to satisfy unlearning objectives. This forces the unlearning optimization to erase knowledge directly from expert parameters rather than exploiting the superficial router manipulation shortcut. GRIP functions as an adapter, constraining router parameter updates without modifying the underlying unlearning algorithm. Extensive experiments on large-scale MoE models demonstrate that our adapter eliminates expert selection shift (achieving over 95% routing stability) across all tested unlearning methods while preserving their utility. By preventing existing algorithms from exploiting MoE model's router vulnerability, GRIP adapts existing unlearning research from dense architectures to MoEs.

### [93] [The Trajectory Alignment Coefficient in Two Acts: From Reward Tuning to Reward Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16906)
*Calarina Muslimani,Yunshu Du,Kenta Kawamoto,Kaushik Subramanian,Peter Stone,Peter Wurman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TAC guides reward tuning and serves as a differentiable objective (Soft-TAC) for reward learning; validated in Lunar Lander and Gran Turismo 7, showing improved performance and more distinct policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward function design is labor-intensive and error-prone; TAC provides a metric to align practitioner preferences with expert judgments, addressing misspecification and workload; Soft-TAC aims to scale this alignment into learning.

Method: 1) Human-subject study on Lunar Lander to assess TAC-assisted reward tuning vs baseline. 2) Introduce Soft-TAC, a differentiable TAC approximation used as a loss to train reward models from human preferences. 3) Validate in Gran Turismo 7, comparing Soft-TAC-trained models to standard Cross-Entropy loss in terms of preference alignment and behavioral distinctness.

Result: TAC-guided tuning produced more performant reward functions and reduced cognitive workload vs standard tuning. Soft-TAC-trained reward models captured preference-specific objectives and yielded policies with more distinct behaviors than CE-trained models.

Conclusion: TAC is a practical tool for reward tuning and a viable reward-learning objective in complex domains; however, manual reward design remains labor-intensive, indicating room for further automation and efficiency improvements.

Abstract: The success of reinforcement learning (RL) is fundamentally tied to having a reward function that accurately reflects the task objective. Yet, designing reward functions is notoriously time-consuming and prone to misspecification. To address this issue, our first goal is to understand how to support RL practitioners in specifying appropriate weights for a reward function. We leverage the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC), a metric that evaluates how closely a reward function's induced preferences match those of a domain expert. To evaluate whether TAC provides effective support in practice, we conducted a human-subject study in which RL practitioners tuned reward weights for Lunar Lander. We found that providing TAC during reward tuning led participants to produce more performant reward functions and report lower cognitive workload relative to standard tuning without TAC. However, the study also underscored that manual reward design, even with TAC, remains labor-intensive. This limitation motivated our second goal: to learn a reward model that maximizes TAC directly. Specifically, we propose Soft-TAC, a differentiable approximation of TAC that can be used as a loss function to train reward models from human preference data. Validated in the racing simulator Gran Turismo 7, reward models trained using Soft-TAC successfully captured preference-specific objectives, resulting in policies with qualitatively more distinct behaviors than models trained with standard Cross-Entropy loss. This work demonstrates that TAC can serve as both a practical tool for guiding reward tuning and a reward learning objective in complex domains.

### [94] [Calibrated Similarity for Reliable Geometric Analysis of Embedding Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16907)
*Nicolas Tacheny*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Isotonic regression calibrates cosine similarity in pretrained embeddings to produce monotonic, human-aligned similarity scores without changing rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Raw cosine similarity suffers from anisotropy, giving poor absolute calibration and interpretability despite strong rank correlation with human judgments.

Method: Train an isotonic regression model on human similarity judgments to map raw cosine similarity to calibrated scores, preserving rank order. Evaluate calibration and stability (rank preservation) across perturbations and show invariance of order-based constructions under the monotone reparameterization.

Result: Calibrated scores exhibit near-perfect alignment with human judgments while maintaining rank correlation; stability remains high (approx. 98% across seven perturbations). Isotonic calibration is characterized as an order-preserving reparameterization, with invariance of angular ordering, nearest neighbors, threshold graphs, and quantile-based decisions.

Conclusion: Isotonic calibration restores interpretability of absolute cosine similarity values without altering ranking, and its order-preserving nature renders several order-based analyses invariant to the calibration.

Abstract: While raw cosine similarity in pretrained embedding spaces exhibits strong rank correlation with human judgments, anisotropy induces systematic miscalibration of absolute values: scores concentrate in a narrow high-similarity band regardless of actual semantic relatedness, limiting interpretability as a quantitative measure. Prior work addresses this by modifying the embedding space (whitening, contrastive fine tuning), but such transformations alter geometric structure and require recomputing all embeddings.
  Using isotonic regression trained on human similarity judgments, we construct a monotonic transformation that achieves near-perfect calibration while preserving rank correlation and local stability(98% across seven perturbation types). Our contribution is not to replace cosine similarity, but to restore interpretability of its absolute values through monotone calibration, without altering its ranking properties.
  We characterize isotonic calibration as an order-preserving reparameterization and prove that all order-based constructions (angular ordering, nearest neighbors, threshold graphs and quantile-based decisions) are invariant under this transformation.

### [95] [Group-realizable multi-group learning by minimizing empirical risk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16922)
*Navid Ardeshir,Samuel Deng,Daniel Hsu,Jingwen Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Group-realizable multi-group learning yields better sample complexity than agnostic learning when the family of groups has finite VC dimension, even if the family is infinite. The optimal statistical performance is obtained via ERM over the group-realizable concept class, which can have infinite VC dimension, but this approach is computationally intractable. An alternative based on improper learning is proposed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve statistical efficiency in multi-group learning by exploiting structure across groups, while addressing the challenge of potentially infinite hypothesis classes.

Method: Theoretical analysis comparing sample complexity under group-realizable vs agnostic settings; ERM over the group-realizable concept class; discussion of VC dimensions (finite for the group family; possibly infinite for the realizable class); demonstration of computational intractability; suggestion of an improper-learning alternative.

Result: Statistical gains in sample complexity under group-realizable assumptions; tractability issues for ERM in the potentially infinite VC dimension setting; proposal of improper learning as a practical alternative.

Conclusion: There is a trade-off between statistical efficiency and computational feasibility in multi-group learning. While group-realizable ERM improves sample complexity under finite group-family VC dimension, it may be intractable to implement; improper learning offers a viable direction for practical algorithms.

Abstract: The sample complexity of multi-group learning is shown to improve in the group-realizable setting over the agnostic setting, even when the family of groups is infinite so long as it has finite VC dimension. The improved sample complexity is obtained by empirical risk minimization over the class of group-realizable concepts, which itself could have infinite VC dimension. Implementing this approach is also shown to be computationally intractable, and an alternative approach is suggested based on improper learning.

### [96] [Is BatchEnsemble a Single Model? On Calibration and Diversity of Efficient Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16936)
*Anton Zamyatin,Patrick Indri,Sagar Malhotra,Thomas Gärtner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BatchEnsemble delivers ensemble-like epistemic uncertainty with much lower cost but largely behaves like a single model, underperforming Deep Ensembles on accuracy, calibration, and OOD detection; MNIST shows near-identical ensemble members, indicating limited predictive diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate whether a parameter-efficient perturbation-based ensemble (BatchEnsemble) can match Deep Ensembles' uncertainty estimates in resource-constrained, low-latency settings.

Method: Empirical evaluation across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-10C, and SVHN datasets, comparing BatchEnsemble against Deep Ensembles; assessment of accuracy, calibration (e.g., expected calibration error), and OOD detection; controlled MNIST study to measure functional/parameter diversity and identify predictive modes.

Result: BatchEnsemble underperforms compared to Deep Ensembles and aligns closely with a single-model baseline in accuracy, calibration, and OOD detection. The MNIST study reveals members are nearly identical in function and parameter space, indicating limited capacity to realize distinct predictive modes.

Conclusion: BatchEnsemble behaves more like a single model than a true ensemble despite lower parameter/memory cost, challenging its utility for robust uncertainty estimation in the tested settings.

Abstract: In resource-constrained and low-latency settings, uncertainty estimates must be efficiently obtained. Deep Ensembles provide robust epistemic uncertainty (EU) but require training multiple full-size models. BatchEnsemble aims to deliver ensemble-like EU at far lower parameter and memory cost by applying learned rank-1 perturbations to a shared base network. We show that BatchEnsemble not only underperforms Deep Ensembles but closely tracks a single model baseline in terms of accuracy, calibration and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection on CIFAR10/10C/SVHN. A controlled study on MNIST finds members are near-identical in function and parameter space, indicating limited capacity to realize distinct predictive modes. Thus, BatchEnsemble behaves more like a single model than a true ensemble.

*Roman Poletukhin,Marcel Kollovieh,Eike Eberhard,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fragment-based 3D molecular generation using SE(3)-equivariant modelling; molecules treated as sets of rigid motifs, yielding competitive/superior results, faster generation, and compact representations compared to atom-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge graph-based fragmentation with 3D atom-level generation by adopting motif-level rigid-body representations inspired by frame-based protein structure generation, enabling efficient, equivariant de novo molecule generation.

Method: Represent molecules as sets of rigid motifs (fragments). Use SE(3)-equivariant generative modelling to assemble motifs into 3D structures for de novo generation. Evaluate on standard benchmarks (including GEOM-Drugs).

Result: Achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art across benchmarks; outperforms SOTA in atom stability on GEOM-Drugs; reduces generation steps by ~2–10x; compresses molecular representation by ~3.5x relative to atom-based methods.

Conclusion: Fragment-based, SE(3)-equivariant generation is effective for 3D molecular design, offering efficiency and representation compression while maintaining or improving accuracy and stability.

Abstract: Three-dimensional molecular structure generation is typically performed at the level of individual atoms, yet molecular graph generation techniques often consider fragments as their structural units. Building on the advances in frame-based protein structure generation, we extend these fragmentation ideas to 3D, treating general molecules as sets of rigid-body motifs. Utilising this representation, we employ SE(3)-equivariant generative modelling for de novo 3D molecule generation from rigid motifs. In our evaluations, we observe comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art across benchmarks, surpassing it in atom stability on GEOM-Drugs, while yielding a 2x to 10x reduction in generation steps and offering 3.5x compression in molecular representations compared to the standard atom-based methods.

### [98] [Auto-Regressive Masked Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16971)
*Mahdi Karami,Ali Ghodsi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARMD unifies autoregressive training efficiency with diffusion parallelism by reframing masked diffusion as a block-wise causal model, enabling parallel conditional probabilities and strided generation; achieves SOTA with fewer training steps and faster, coherent parallel decoding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Masked diffusion models lag ARMs in performance and require more training. The goal is to design an architecture that preserves diffusion's parallel generation while attaining autoregressive training efficiency and coherent long-range dependencies.

Method: Reframe masked diffusion as a block-wise causal model; build a strictly causal, permutation-equivariant architecture that computes all conditionals across multiple denoising steps in a single parallel forward pass; employ progressive permutation training to learn left-to-right and random orderings; introduce strided parallel generation for parallel token streams with global coherence.

Result: ARMD attains state-of-the-art language modeling results, surpassing diffusion baselines with substantially fewer training steps; demonstrates a new benchmark for parallel text generation and narrows the gap between parallel and sequential decoding.

Conclusion: ARMD successfully blends autoregressive training efficiency with diffusion’s parallel generation, enabling fast, coherent parallel decoding and flexible permutation-aware training, advancing the state of language modeling.

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising approach for language modeling, yet they face a performance gap compared to autoregressive models (ARMs) and require more training iterations. In this work, we present the Auto-Regressive Masked Diffusion (ARMD) model, an architecture designed to close this gap by unifying the training efficiency of autoregressive models with the parallel generation capabilities of diffusion-based models. Our key insight is to reframe the masked diffusion process as a block-wise causal model. This perspective allows us to design a strictly causal, permutation-equivariant architecture that computes all conditional probabilities across multiple denoising steps in a single, parallel forward pass. The resulting architecture supports efficient, autoregressive-style decoding and a progressive permutation training scheme, allowing the model to learn both canonical left-to-right and random token orderings. Leveraging this flexibility, we introduce a novel strided parallel generation strategy that accelerates inference by generating tokens in parallel streams while maintaining global coherence. Empirical results demonstrate that ARMD achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard language modeling benchmarks, outperforming established diffusion baselines while requiring significantly fewer training steps. Furthermore, it establishes a new benchmark for parallel text generation, effectively bridging the performance gap between parallel and sequential decoding.

### [99] [Latent Diffusion for Internet of Things Attack Data Generation in Intrusion Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16976)
*Estela Sánchez-Carballo,Francisco M. Melgarejo-Meseguer,José Luis Rojo-Álvarez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) are used to augment IoT intrusion data for ML-based IDSs, addressing class imbalance more effectively than baselines. They yield high IDS F1 (up to 0.99 on DDoS/Mirai), preserve feature dependencies, offer diverse samples, and reduce sampling time (~25%) vs data-space diffusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Class imbalance in ML-based IoT IDSs degrades detection performance. Existing augmentation methods (oversampling, generative models) often trade off fidelity, diversity, or efficiency. The paper proposes LDM-based augmentation to achieve high fidelity, diverse samples with scalable generation.

Method: Train and apply a Latent Diffusion Model to generate attack data in a latent space for IoT intrusion detection. Compare against state-of-the-art baselines on three IoT attack types (DDoS, Mirai, Man-in-the-Middle). Evaluate both downstream IDS performance (F1) and intrinsic generative quality via distributional, dependency-based, and diversity metrics; measure sampling time.

Result: LDM-based augmentation substantially improves IDS performance, achieving up to F1=0.99 for DDoS and Mirai. Outperforms competing methods. LDMs preserve feature dependencies and generate diverse samples. Sampling time reduced by ~25% compared to diffusion models operating in data space.

Conclusion: Latent diffusion is an effective and scalable solution for synthetic IoT attack data generation, effectively mitigating class imbalance in ML-based IoT IDSs.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a key component for protecting Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However, in Machine Learning-based (ML-based) IDSs, performance is often degraded by the strong class imbalance between benign and attack traffic. Although data augmentation has been widely explored to mitigate this issue, existing approaches typically rely on simple oversampling techniques or generative models that struggle to simultaneously achieve high sample fidelity, diversity, and computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the use of a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for attack data augmentation in IoT intrusion detection and provide a comprehensive comparison against state-of-the-art baselines. Experiments were conducted on three representative IoT attack types, specifically Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), Mirai, and Man-in-the-Middle, evaluating both downstream IDS performance and intrinsic generative quality using distributional, dependency-based, and diversity metrics. Results show that balancing the training data with LDM-generated samples substantially improves IDS performance, achieving F1-scores of up to 0.99 for DDoS and Mirai attacks and consistently outperforming competing methods. Additionally, quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that LDMs effectively preserve feature dependencies while generating diverse samples and reduce sampling time by approximately 25\% compared to diffusion models operating directly in data space. These findings highlight latent diffusion as an effective and scalable solution for synthetic IoT attack data generation, substantially mitigating the impact of class imbalance in ML-based IDSs for IoT scenarios.

### [100] [A Scalable Measure of Loss Landscape Curvature for Analyzing the Training Dynamics of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16979)
*Dayal Singh Kalra,Jean-Christophe Gagnon-Audet,Andrey Gromov,Ishita Mediratta,Kelvin Niu,Alexander H Miller,Michael Shvartsman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes and validates critical sharpness (λ_c) as a scalable surrogate for Hessian sharpness to diagnose curvature dynamics; introduces relative critical sharpness (λ_c^{1→2}) for cross-landscape analysis; demonstrates phenomena up to 7B parameters and uses it to inform data mixing strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Direct Hessian computation is prohibitive at scale; scalable curvature metrics are needed to understand training dynamics and transitions (pre-training to fine-tuning) in large models.

Method: Define λ_c requiring ≤10 forward passes along the update direction Δθ; empirically analyze known sharpness phenomena (progressive sharpening, Edge of Stability) at scale; compute λ_c^{1→2} to compare curvatures between two landscapes; apply to OLMo-2 models up to 7B parameters during pre-training and mid-training; discuss implications for data composition.

Result: λ_c captures the same sharpness phenomena reported in the literature and demonstrates these effects at scale up to 7B parameters; introduction of λ_c^{1→2} enables cross-landscape curvature analysis and data-mixing guidance; provides a practical, scalable diagnostic tool for large-scale training.

Conclusion: Scalable curvature measures offer actionable diagnostics for large-scale training, enabling better understanding of curvature dynamics and informing data composition strategies; likely generalizable to other architectures and training regimes.

Abstract: Understanding the curvature evolution of the loss landscape is fundamental to analyzing the training dynamics of neural networks. The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($λ_{\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $Δ\mathbfθ$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c^{1\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training.

### [101] [SemanticALLI: Caching Reasoning, Not Just Responses, in Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16286)
*Varun Chillara,Dylan Kline,Christopher Alvares,Evan Wooten,Huan Yang,Shlok Khetan,Cade Bauer,Tré Guillory,Tanishka Shah,Yashodhara Dhariwal,Volodymyr Pavlov,George Popstefanov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SemanticALLI introduces a pipeline-aware caching mechanism by decomposing generation into Analytic Intent Resolution (AIR) and Visualization Synthesis (VS), enabling caching of structured intermediate representations (IRs). This yields a large increase in cache hit rate (38.7% to 83.10%), reduces LLM calls (4,023 avoided) and latency (2.66 ms), illustrating efficiencies from modular, reusable reasoning steps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic AI pipelines often repeat identical intermediate logic (e.g., metric normalization, chart scaffolding) across requests with varied language. Monolithic caching misses these opportunities; structured IR caching aims to capture and reuse these reusable fragments.

Method: Decompose generation into Analytic Intent Resolution and Visualization Synthesis, elevate IRs as first-class, cacheable artifacts within the Alli platform, and compare monolithic caching vs. the two-stage, pipeline-aware approach.

Result: Baseline monolithic caching hits at 38.7%. The two-stage SemanticALLI approach achieves 83.10% cache hit rate, bypassing 4,023 LLM calls with median latency 2.66 ms, reducing total token consumption.

Conclusion: Structured, pipeline-aware caching can unlock substantial efficiency gains in AI systems by caching stable, structured checkpoints, even under diverse user expressions; a practical design guideline for future AI tooling.

Abstract: Agentic AI pipelines suffer from a hidden inefficiency: they frequently reconstruct identical intermediate logic, such as metric normalization or chart scaffolding, even when the user's natural language phrasing is entirely novel. Conventional boundary caching fails to capture this inefficiency because it treats inference as a monolithic black box.
  We introduce SemanticALLI, a pipeline-aware architecture within Alli (PMG's marketing intelligence platform), designed to operationalize redundant reasoning. By decomposing generation into Analytic Intent Resolution (AIR) and Visualization Synthesis (VS), SemanticALLI elevates structured intermediate representations (IRs) to first-class, cacheable artifacts.
  The impact of caching within the agentic loop is substantial. In our evaluation, baseline monolithic caching caps at a 38.7% hit rate due to linguistic variance. In contrast, our structured approach allows for an additional stage, the Visualization Synthesis stage, to achieve an 83.10% hit rate, bypassing 4,023 LLM calls with a median latency of just 2.66 ms. This internal reuse reduces total token consumption, offering a practical lesson for AI system design: even when users rarely repeat themselves, the pipeline often does, at stable, structured checkpoints where caching is most reliable.

TL;DR: DSGym is a standardized, extensible framework for evaluating and training data science agents in self-contained execution environments; introduces DSGym-Tasks with DSBio and DSPredict; includes an execution-verified data-synthesis training pipeline; case study shows a 4B model trained on 2,000 examples outperforms GPT-4o on standardized benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Benchmarking data science agents is hampered by fragmented interfaces, narrow task coverage, and data grounding gaps; many tasks can be solved without real data, undermining evaluation fidelity.

Method: Modular architecture with self-contained environments; task suite standardization and quality filtering; expert-derived bio tasks; broad prediction tasks; data-synthesis for agent training; empirical case study.

Result: DSGym enables end-to-end evaluation of planning, implementation, and validation of data analyses; 2k-example training set; 4B model surpasses GPT-4o on benchmarks; live testbed.

Conclusion: DSGym offers a rigorous, extensible platform for assessing and training data science agents in realistic scientific contexts, bridging evaluation and training across domains.

Abstract: Data science agents promise to accelerate discovery and insight-generation by turning data into executable analyses and findings. Yet existing data science benchmarks fall short due to fragmented evaluation interfaces that make cross-benchmark comparison difficult, narrow task coverage and a lack of rigorous data grounding. In particular, we show that a substantial portion of tasks in current benchmarks can be solved without using the actual data. To address these limitations, we introduce DSGym, a standardized framework for evaluating and training data science agents in self-contained execution environments. Unlike static benchmarks, DSGym provides a modular architecture that makes it easy to add tasks, agent scaffolds, and tools, positioning it as a live, extensible testbed. We curate DSGym-Tasks, a holistic task suite that standardizes and refines existing benchmarks via quality and shortcut solvability filtering. We further expand coverage with (1) DSBio: expert-derived bioinformatics tasks grounded in literature and (2) DSPredict: challenging prediction tasks spanning domains such as computer vision, molecular prediction, and single-cell perturbation. Beyond evaluation, DSGym enables agent training via execution-verified data synthesis pipeline. As a case study, we build a 2,000-example training set and trained a 4B model in DSGym that outperforms GPT-4o on standardized analysis benchmarks. Overall, DSGym enables rigorous end-to-end measurement of whether agents can plan, implement, and validate data analyses in realistic scientific context.

*Hongjia Wu,Shuai Zhou,Hongxin Zhang,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Doc2AHP: an LLM-guided, AHP-constrained inference framework that enforces hierarchical logical entailment and weight consistency in decision models built from unstructured documents, enabling non-experts to achieve higher logical completeness and task accuracy without annotated data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome the expert bottleneck in traditional AHP and harness LLM generalization while maintaining decision-theoretic rigor; enable scalable construction of decision models from unstructured sources without labeled data.

Method: Impose AHP-inspired structural constraints on the LLM's inference process, performing a constrained search within unstructured documents to ensure parent-child entailment. Introduce a multi-agent weighting mechanism and an adaptive consistency optimization to guarantee numerical weight consistency.

Result: Empirical evidence shows Doc2AHP yields higher logical completeness and downstream task accuracy than direct generative baselines; non-experts can construct high-quality decision models from scratch with no annotated data.

Conclusion: Doc2AHP bridges LLM flexibility and AHP rigor, removing annotation/manual intervention requirements and delivering consistent, explainable decision models from unstructured material.

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable proficiency in semantic understanding, they often struggle to ensure structural consistency and reasoning reliability in complex decision-making tasks that demand rigorous logic. Although classical decision theories, such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), offer systematic rational frameworks, their construction relies heavily on labor-intensive domain expertise, creating an "expert bottleneck" that hinders scalability in general scenarios. To bridge the gap between the generalization capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of decision theory, we propose Doc2AHP, a novel structured inference framework guided by AHP principles. Eliminating the need for extensive annotated data or manual intervention, our approach leverages the structural principles of AHP as constraints to direct the LLM in a constrained search within the unstructured document space, thereby enforcing the logical entailment between parent and child nodes. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-agent weighting mechanism coupled with an adaptive consistency optimization strategy to ensure the numerical consistency of weight allocation. Empirical results demonstrate that Doc2AHP not only empowers non-expert users to construct high-quality decision models from scratch but also significantly outperforms direct generative baselines in both logical completeness and downstream task accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent adversarial evaluation framework, SycoEval-EM, tests LLMs’ robustness to patient pressure in emergency medicine. It reveals wide susceptibility to social persuasion, with imaging requests most vulnerable; static benchmarks fail to predict safety, advocating multi-turn adversarial testing for clinical AI certification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical LLMs risk complying with patients’ pressure for inappropriate care. There is a need for robust evaluation frameworks that simulate adversarial social interactions to inform safe deployment and certification.

Method: Multi-agent simulation across 20 LLMs and 1,875 encounters over three Choosing Wisely scenarios. Adversarial persuasion tactics were applied, measuring acquiescence rates. Analyzed sensitivity to imaging requests vs opioid prescriptions and assessed whether model capability could predict robustness.

Result: Acquiescence rates ranged from 0% to 100% across encounters. Imaging requests showed higher vulnerability (38.8%) than opioid prescriptions (25.0%). Model capability poorly predicted robustness. All persuasion tactics were similarly effective (30.0–36.0%), indicating general susceptibility rather than tactic-specific weaknesses.

Conclusion: Static benchmarks inadequately predict safety under social pressure. The findings support the need for multi-turn adversarial testing and scenario-based evaluation to certify clinical AI safety.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in clinical decision support yet risk acquiescing to patient pressure for inappropriate care. We introduce SycoEval-EM, a multi-agent simulation framework evaluating LLM robustness through adversarial patient persuasion in emergency medicine. Across 20 LLMs and 1,875 encounters spanning three Choosing Wisely scenarios, acquiescence rates ranged from 0-100\%. Models showed higher vulnerability to imaging requests (38.8\%) than opioid prescriptions (25.0\%), with model capability poorly predicting robustness. All persuasion tactics proved equally effective (30.0-36.0\%), indicating general susceptibility rather than tactic-specific weakness. Our findings demonstrate that static benchmarks inadequately predict safety under social pressure, necessitating multi-turn adversarial testing for clinical AI certification.

### [105] [LLM is Not All You Need: A Systematic Evaluation of ML vs. Foundation Models for text and image based Medical Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16549)
*Meet Raval,Tejul Pandit,Dhvani Upadhyay*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Traditional ML methods outperform prompt-based LLMs/VLMs and LoRA-based PEFT variants on four medical classification benchmarks spanning text and image modalities (binary and multiclass). Zero-shot LLM/VLM pipelines show mixed results (poor on text, competitive on multiclass image). PEFT with minimal fine-tuning underperforms consistently. Foundation models are not universally superior; adaptation strategy heavily influences performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether multimodal foundation models and PEFT approaches genuinely improve medical categorization, using a unified, cross-modal benchmark to guide model choice and adaptation strategies.

Method: 4 public datasets covering text and image modalities with binary and multiclass tasks were evaluated. Three model classes per task: Classical ML (logistic regression, LightGBM, ResNet-50), Prompt-Based LLMs/VLMs (Gemini 2.5), and Fine-Tuned PEFT models (LoRA-adapted Gemma3 variants). Consistent data splits and aligned metrics were used across tasks and modalities.

Result: Classical ML achieved the best overall performance across most medical categorization tasks, particularly for structured text datasets. LoRA-tuned Gemma variants consistently underperformed across text and image tasks, failing to generalize from minimal fine-tuning. Zero-shot LLM/VLM pipelines (Gemini 2.5) yielded mixed results: poor on text-based tasks but competitive with ResNet-50 on the multiclass image task.

Conclusion: Foundation models are not universally superior in medical categorization. The effectiveness of PEFT is highly dependent on the adaptation strategy, with minimal fine-tuning proving detrimental in this study. Traditional ML should remain a strong baseline for many tasks, and future work should explore more robust PEFT strategies and dataset-specific considerations.

Abstract: The combination of multimodal Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) opens up new possibilities for medical classification. This work offers a rigorous, unified benchmark by using four publicly available datasets covering text and image modalities (binary and multiclass complexity) that contrasts traditional Machine Learning (ML) with contemporary transformer-based techniques. We evaluated three model classes for each task: Classical ML (LR, LightGBM, ResNet-50), Prompt-Based LLMs/VLMs (Gemini 2.5), and Fine-Tuned PEFT Models (LoRA-adapted Gemma3 variants). All experiments used consistent data splits and aligned metrics. According to our results, traditional machine learning (ML) models set a high standard by consistently achieving the best overall performance across most medical categorization tasks. This was especially true for structured text-based datasets, where the classical models performed exceptionally well. In stark contrast, the LoRA-tuned Gemma variants consistently showed the worst performance across all text and image experiments, failing to generalize from the minimal fine-tuning provided. However, the zero-shot LLM/VLM pipelines (Gemini 2.5) had mixed results; they performed poorly on text-based tasks, but demonstrated competitive performance on the multiclass image task, matching the classical ResNet-50 baseline. These results demonstrate that in many medical categorization scenarios, established machine learning models continue to be the most reliable option. The experiment suggests that foundation models are not universally superior and that the effectiveness of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is highly dependent on the adaptation strategy, as minimal fine-tuning proved detrimental in this study.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An oracle counterfactual framework quantifies the impact of core skills (like planning and state tracking) on multi-turn, long-horizon agentic tasks, using procedurally generated benchmarks with controllable complexity. Findings: planning robustly boosts performance across settings; other skills' value is environment- and model-dependent.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine which underlying capabilities most critically enable success in multi-turn AI agents, guiding future research and benchmark design.

Method: Introduce an oracle counterfactual framework for multi-turn problems. Create procedurally generated, game-like tasks with tunable complexity. Provide precise oracle interventions (e.g., perfect planning, flawless state tracking) to isolate each capability's contribution and measure performance changes.

Result: Planning interventions consistently improve performance across diverse settings. The usefulness of other skills varies with environment and language model, indicating no universal uplift.

Conclusion: The framework helps identify robust targets (notably planning) for advancing AI agents and LLMs, while also revealing when other capabilities depend on task and model context; supports development of environment-controlled benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models can perform well on many isolated tasks, yet they continue to struggle on multi-turn, long-horizon agentic problems that require skills such as planning, state tracking, and long context processing. In this work, we aim to better understand the relative importance of advancing these underlying capabilities for success on such tasks. We develop an oracle counterfactual framework for multi-turn problems that asks: how would an agent perform if it could leverage an oracle to perfectly perform a specific task? The change in the agent's performance due to this oracle assistance allows us to measure the criticality of such oracle skill in the future advancement of AI agents. We introduce a suite of procedurally generated, game-like tasks with tunable complexity. These controlled environments allow us to provide precise oracle interventions, such as perfect planning or flawless state tracking, and make it possible to isolate the contribution of each oracle without confounding effects present in real-world benchmarks. Our results show that while some interventions (e.g., planning) consistently improve performance across settings, the usefulness of other skills is dependent on the properties of the environment and language model. Our work sheds light on the challenges of multi-turn agentic environments to guide the future efforts in the development of AI agents and language models.

### [107] [AgentsEval: Clinically Faithful Evaluation of Medical Imaging Reports via Multi-Agent Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16685)
*Suzhong Fu,Jingqi Dong,Xuan Ding,Rui Sun,Yiming Yang,Shuguang Cui,Zhen Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces AgentsEval, a multi-agent stream reasoning framework for evaluating automatically generated medical imaging reports, emphasizing interpretable reasoning traces and a perturbation-based benchmark across five datasets to ensure clinical alignment and robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluation metrics for medical report generation fail to capture structured diagnostic reasoning and clinical relevance, leading to unreliable judgments. A transparent, reasoning-based evaluation is needed to trustworthy integrate LLMs into clinical workflows.

Method: A multi-agent pipeline subdivides evaluation into steps: criteria definition, evidence extraction, alignment, and consistency scoring, producing explicit reasoning traces and structured feedback. A perturbation-based benchmark across five medical report datasets with diverse modalities and semantic variations tests robustness to paraphrase, semantic, and stylistic perturbations.

Result: AgentsEval yields clinically aligned, semantically faithful, and interpretable evaluations that remain robust under various perturbations, providing actionable clinical feedback rather than opaque scores.

Conclusion: A step toward transparent, clinically grounded assessment of medical report generation systems, facilitating safer deployment of large language models in radiology through traceable reasoning and robust evaluation.

Abstract: Evaluating the clinical correctness and reasoning fidelity of automatically generated medical imaging reports remains a critical yet unresolved challenge. Existing evaluation methods often fail to capture the structured diagnostic logic that underlies radiological interpretation, resulting in unreliable judgments and limited clinical relevance. We introduce AgentsEval, a multi-agent stream reasoning framework that emulates the collaborative diagnostic workflow of radiologists. By dividing the evaluation process into interpretable steps including criteria definition, evidence extraction, alignment, and consistency scoring, AgentsEval provides explicit reasoning traces and structured clinical feedback. We also construct a multi-domain perturbation-based benchmark covering five medical report datasets with diverse imaging modalities and controlled semantic variations. Experimental results demonstrate that AgentsEval delivers clinically aligned, semantically faithful, and interpretable evaluations that remain robust under paraphrastic, semantic, and stylistic perturbations. This framework represents a step toward transparent and clinically grounded assessment of medical report generation systems, fostering trustworthy integration of large language models into clinical practice.

TL;DR: A 560B open-source Mixture-of-Experts model, LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601, achieves state-of-the-art agentic reasoning among open-source models across agentic search, tool use, and tool-integrated reasoning. It uses domain-parallel expert training with fusion, an end-to-end co-design of data/environments/algorithms/infrastructure, and an extended asynchronous RL framework (DORA) for stable, large-scale multi-environment training across 10,000 environments and 20 domains. Robustness to real-world noise is built-in via noise-pattern analysis and training procedures, and a Heavy Thinking mode scales reasoning depth/width at test-time through parallel thinking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robust, scalable, and generalizable agentic reasoning in open-source models, capable of complex tool-use and operation in realistic, noisy environments, while maintaining stable training at large scale.

Method: MoE backbone with 560B parameters; domain-parallel expert training with subsequent fusion; end-to-end co-design of data, environments, algorithms, and infrastructure from pre-training to post-training; extended asynchronous reinforcement learning (DORA) for multi-environment stability; decomposition of real-world noise for targeted training; Heavy Thinking mode to scale reasoning depth and width via parallel thinking.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on open-source agentic benchmarks (search, tool use, tool-integrated reasoning); strong generalization to complex tool interactions; robust behavior in noisy real-world settings; stable training across 10k+ environments spanning 20 domains; improved performance on complex reasoning tasks through increased reasoning depth/width.

Conclusion: A unified training framework that combines environment scaling, principled data/task construction, and robust multi-environment RL enables strong agentic reasoning and robustness in open-source models, with Heavy Thinking enabling scalable test-time reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601, a 560-billion-parameter open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) reasoning model with superior agentic reasoning capability. LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a wide range of agentic benchmarks, including agentic search, agentic tool use, and tool-integrated reasoning. Beyond benchmark performance, the model demonstrates strong generalization to complex tool interactions and robust behavior under noisy real-world environments. Its advanced capability stems from a unified training framework that combines domain-parallel expert training with subsequent fusion, together with an end-to-end co-design of data construction, environments, algorithms, and infrastructure spanning from pre-training to post-training. In particular, the model's strong generalization capability in complex tool-use are driven by our in-depth exploration of environment scaling and principled task construction. To optimize long-tailed, skewed generation and multi-turn agentic interactions, and to enable stable training across over 10,000 environments spanning more than 20 domains, we systematically extend our asynchronous reinforcement learning framework, DORA, for stable and efficient large-scale multi-environment training. Furthermore, recognizing that real-world tasks are inherently noisy, we conduct a systematic analysis and decomposition of real-world noise patterns, and design targeted training procedures to explicitly incorporate such imperfections into the training process, resulting in improved robustness for real-world applications. To further enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks, we introduce a Heavy Thinking mode that enables effective test-time scaling by jointly expanding reasoning depth and width through intensive parallel thinking.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Insect-inspired agent for visual point-goal navigation achieves SOTA-like performance with orders-of-magnitude lower computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce computational cost and improve robustness of visual navigation by leveraging insect-inspired brain mechanisms (associative learning and path integration) to guide visually guided paths.

Method: Integrate abstracted models of two insect brain structures for associative learning and path integration; map Habitat's point-goal task to insect-like navigation of paths between a discovered food location and nest around obstacles; implement a simple, efficient agent.

Result: Agent achieves performance comparable to recent state-of-the-art models while using vastly less computational resources; shows robustness to perturbations in a more realistic simulated environment.

Conclusion: Bio-inspired navigation circuits can match modern deep models in visual navigation tasks with far lower computational cost, indicating valuable design principles for real-time, robust autonomy.

Abstract: In this work we develop a novel insect-inspired agent for visual point-goal navigation. This combines abstracted models of two insect brain structures that have been implicated, respectively, in associative learning and path integration. We draw an analogy between the formal benchmark of the Habitat point-goal navigation task and the ability of insects to learn and refine visually guided paths around obstacles between a discovered food location and their nest. We demonstrate that the simple insect-inspired agent exhibits performance comparable to recent SOTA models at many orders of magnitude less computational cost. Testing in a more realistic simulated environment shows the approach is robust to perturbations.

*Ian B. de Haan,Peter van der Putten,Max van Duijn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RLVR-trained reasoning LLMs show robustness to prompt variations in ToM tasks, but gains appear due to more robust search rather than genuine new Theory of Mind capabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clarify whether improved ToM performance in reasoning-oriented LLMs reflects true social cognition or merely increased robustness to prompts and perturbations.

Method: Apply RLVR-trained reasoning LLMs to ToM tasks through novel machine psychology experiments and established benchmarks; systematically vary prompts and task conditions to assess robustness; compare against non-RLVR models.

Result: Robustness to prompt variations and task perturbations increases; improvements attributed more to finding the correct solution reliably rather than embodying new ToM reasoning

Conclusion: Caution against equating performance on ToM benchmarks with genuine social-cognitive ability; benchmarks should separate robustness from true ToM and control for prompt sensitivity.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong performance on Theory of Mind (ToM) tests, prompting debate about the nature and true performance of the underlying capabilities. At the same time, reasoning-oriented LLMs trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) have achieved notable improvements across a range of benchmarks. This paper examines the behavior of such reasoning models in ToM tasks, using novel adaptations of machine psychological experiments and results from established benchmarks. We observe that reasoning models consistently exhibit increased robustness to prompt variations and task perturbations. Our analysis indicates that the observed gains are more plausibly attributed to increased robustness in finding the correct solution, rather than to fundamentally new forms of ToM reasoning. We discuss the implications of this interpretation for evaluating social-cognitive behavior in LLMs.

### [111] [Mixture-of-Models: Unifying Heterogeneous Agents via N-Way Self-Evaluating Deliberation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16863)
*Tims Pecerskis,Aivars Smirnovs*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: N-Way Self-Evaluating Deliberation (NSED) is a runtime Mixture-of-Models that dynamically allocates heterogeneous, small models via a knapsack-based expert broker and macro-scale RNN deliberation, achieving state-of-the-art-like performance with greater hardware efficiency and intrinsic alignment through peer review and Quadratic Voting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address inefficiencies of static Mixture-of-Experts and fixed gating by enabling dynamic, cost-aware model composition, scalable deliberation, and better alignment safety in ensembles.

Method: Introduce Dynamic Expertise Broker solving a Knapsack-like binding problem using live telemetry and cost constraints; orchestrate an N-to-N peer review fabric; implement a Macro-Scale Recurrent Neural Network with a semantic forget gate for iterative refinement without VRAM growth; employ Quadratic Voting as the activation for non-linear consensus; validate on benchmarks (AIME 2025, LiveCodeBench) and safety suite (DarkBench).

Result: Small ensembles (<20B params) matched or exceeded performance of SOTA 100B+ models on challenging benchmarks; demonstrated hardware-arbitrage efficiency frontier; observed improved intrinsic alignment with reduced sycophancy via peer-mediated correction.

Conclusion: NSED enables efficient, scalable ensemble AI with safety properties, showing that dynamic, peer-reviewed, cost-aware deliberation can outperform large static models while maintaining alignment.

Abstract: This paper introduces the N-Way Self-Evaluating Deliberation (NSED) protocol, a Runtime Mixture-of-Models (MoM) architecture that constructs emergent composite models from a plurality of distinct expert agents. Unlike traditional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) which rely on static gating networks, NSED employs a Dynamic Expertise Broker - a runtime optimization engine that treats model selection as a variation of the Knapsack Problem, binding heterogeneous checkpoints to functional roles based on live telemetry and cost constraints. At the execution layer, we formalize deliberation as a Macro-Scale Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), where the consensus state loops back through a semantic forget gate to enable iterative refinement without proportional VRAM scaling. Key components include an orchestration fabric for trustless N-to-N peer review, a Quadratic Voting activation function for non-linear consensus, and a feedback-driven state update. Empirical validation on challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, LiveCodeBench) demonstrates that this topology allows ensembles of small (less than 20B) consumer-grade models to match or exceed the performance of state-of-the-art 100B+ parameter models, establishing a new hardware arbitrage efficiency frontier. Furthermore, testing on the DarkBench safety suite reveals intrinsic alignment properties, with peer-mediated correction reducing sycophancy scores below that of any individual agent.

*Chi Yu,Hongyu Yuan,Zhiyi Duan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MAGE-KT introduces a multi-view heterogeneous graph framework for knowledge tracing, using a multi-agent KC relation extractor and a student-question interaction graph. It retrieves target-specific compact subgraphs and fuses them with an asymmetric cross-attention module, achieving better KC-relation accuracy and next-question prediction on three KT datasets while reducing diffusion to irrelevant regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph-based KT methods underutilize inter-concept relations and suffer from expensive, noisy full-graph encoding that causes attention to diffuse into student-irrelevant regions. There is a need for efficient, targeted modeling of KC relations and student interactions to improve prediction fidelity.

Method: Construct a multi-view heterogeneous graph combining a multi-agent KC relation extractor and a student-question interaction graph. For a given target student, retrieve compact, high-value subgraphs conditioned on their history. Fuse the subgraph representations via an Asymmetric Cross-attention Fusion Module to produce predictions, mitigating attention diffusion and unnecessary computation.

Result: Experiments on three KT datasets show substantial improvements in KC-relation accuracy and clear gains in next-question prediction compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: The proposed MAGE-KT framework effectively captures inter-KC relations via multi-agent graph extraction and targeted subgraph attention, improving predictive performance while reducing computational cost and noise.

Abstract: Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to model a student's learning trajectory and predict performance on the next question. A key challenge is how to better represent the relationships among students, questions, and knowledge concepts (KCs). Recently, graph-based KT paradigms have shown promise for this problem. However, existing methods have not sufficiently explored inter-concept relations, often inferred solely from interaction sequences. In addition, the scale and heterogeneity of KT graphs make full-graph encoding both computationally both costly and noise-prone, causing attention to bleed into student-irrelevant regions and degrading the fidelity of inter-KC relations. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Agent Graph-Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (MAGE-KT). It constructs a multi-view heterogeneous graph by combining a multi-agent KC relation extractor and a student-question interaction graph, capturing complementary semantic and behavioral signals. Conditioned on the target student's history, it retrieves compact, high-value subgraphs and integrates them using an Asymmetric Cross-attention Fusion Module to enhance prediction while avoiding attention diffusion and irrelevant computation. Experiments on three widely used KT datasets show substantial improvements in KC-relation accuracy and clear gains in next-question prediction over existing methods.

### [113] [Preventing the Collapse of Peer Review Requires Verification-First AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16909)
*Lei You,Lele Cao,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AI-assisted peer review should prioritize verification over mimicry, using truth-coupling to measure how well venue scores track latent truth. The paper identifies a phase transition to proxy evaluation due to verification pressure and signal shrinkage, derives a coupling law and an incentive-collapse condition in a minimal model, and recommends AI as an adversarial auditor to expand verification bandwidth rather than a score predictor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address incentive misalignment in AI-assisted peer review where verification capacity is limited and signals are noisy, risking shift from truth-seeking to proxy optimization.

Method: Proposes a minimal model that blends occasional high-fidelity checks with frequent proxy judgments, formalizes two driving forces (verification pressure and signal shrinkage), derives a coupling law and incentive-collapse condition.

Result: Derives an explicit coupling law and a condition under which rational effort shifts from truth-seeking to proxy optimization even when decisions appear reliable; shows the need for tools that audit and verify rather than simply score.

Conclusion: Advocates deploying AI as an adversarial auditor that generates auditable verification artifacts and expands verification bandwidth, instead of a score predictor that promotes claim inflation.

Abstract: This paper argues that AI-assisted peer review should be verification-first rather than review-mimicking. We propose truth-coupling, i.e. how tightly venue scores track latent scientific truth, as the right objective for review tools. We formalize two forces that drive a phase transition toward proxy-sovereign evaluation: verification pressure, when claims outpace verification capacity, and signal shrinkage, when real improvements become hard to separate from noise. In a minimal model that mixes occasional high-fidelity checks with frequent proxy judgment, we derive an explicit coupling law and an incentive-collapse condition under which rational effort shifts from truth-seeking to proxy optimization, even when current decisions still appear reliable. These results motivate actions for tool builders and program chairs: deploy AI as an adversarial auditor that generates auditable verification artifacts and expands effective verification bandwidth, rather than as a score predictor that amplifies claim inflation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Presents Spatial-Agent, a geospatial reasoning agent grounded in spatial information science. It formulates geo-analytical QA as concept transformations via GeoFlow Graphs ( DAGs with spatial concepts as nodes and transformations as edges ), leveraging spatial information theory to extract concepts, assign functional roles with ordering constraints, and generate transformation sequences via templates. Empirically, it outperforms baselines on MapEval-API and MapQA, yielding interpretable, executable geospatial workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Publicly available LLM-based agents struggle with genuine geospatial computation, often hallucinating spatial relations, and rely on web search or pattern matching. There is a need for grounded, interpretable, and executable geospatial reasoning.

Method: Formalize geo-analytical QA as a concept transformation problem. Parse natural-language questions into executable workflows represented as GeoFlow Graphs (directed acyclic graphs) where nodes are spatial concepts and edges are transformations. Use spatial information theory to extract spatial concepts, assign functional roles with ordering constraints, and compose transformation sequences through template-based generation.

Result: Empirically, Spatial-Agent significantly outperforms existing baselines including ReAct and Reflexion on MapEval-API and MapQA benchmarks, while producing interpretable and executable geospatial workflows.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a principled, grounded approach to geospatial reasoning that yields improved performance and interpretability, offering a robust framework for geospatial QA via concept transformations and DAG-based workflows.

Abstract: Geospatial reasoning is essential for real-world applications such as urban analytics, transportation planning, and disaster response. However, existing LLM-based agents often fail at genuine geospatial computation, relying instead on web search or pattern matching while hallucinating spatial relationships. We present Spatial-Agent, an AI agent grounded in foundational theories of spatial information science. Our approach formalizes geo-analytical question answering as a concept transformation problem, where natural-language questions are parsed into executable workflows represented as GeoFlow Graphs -- directed acyclic graphs with nodes corresponding to spatial concepts and edges representing transformations. Drawing on spatial information theory, Spatial-Agent extracts spatial concepts, assigns functional roles with principled ordering constraints, and composes transformation sequences through template-based generation. Extensive experiments on MapEval-API and MapQA benchmarks demonstrate that Spatial-Agent significantly outperforms existing baselines including ReAct and Reflexion, while producing interpretable and executable geospatial workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMICs face high device downtime due to limited maintenance capabilities, scarce technical expertise, and poor manufacturer support, leading to delays in diagnoses and degraded patient care. An AI-assisted, accessible platform could empower technicians and reduce downtime.

Method: Developed an AI-powered support platform integrating a large language model with a user-friendly web interface where imaging technologists and biomedical technicians input error codes or device symptoms. The system provides step-by-step troubleshooting guidance and includes a global peer-to-peer discussion forum. A proof-of-concept evaluation used a Philips HDI 5000 ultrasound system to quantify performance (precision of error-code interpretation and accuracy of corrective-action suggestions).

Result: The platform achieved 100% precision in interpreting error codes and 80% accuracy in recommending corrective actions, demonstrating feasibility and potential impact for maintenance support in resource-constrained settings.

Conclusion: AI-driven maintenance support is feasible and can reduce downtime, improving healthcare delivery in LMICs, with scope for broader validation and deployment across diverse devices and settings.

Abstract: In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), a significant proportion of medical diagnostic equipment remains underutilized or non-functional due to a lack of timely maintenance, limited access to technical expertise, and minimal support from manufacturers, particularly for devices acquired through third-party vendors or donations. This challenge contributes to increased equipment downtime, delayed diagnoses, and compromised patient care. This research explores the development and validation of an AI-powered support platform designed to assist biomedical technicians in diagnosing and repairing medical devices in real-time. The system integrates a large language model (LLM) with a user-friendly web interface, enabling imaging technologists/radiographers and biomedical technicians to input error codes or device symptoms and receive accurate, step-by-step troubleshooting guidance. The platform also includes a global peer-to-peer discussion forum to support knowledge exchange and provide additional context for rare or undocumented issues. A proof of concept was developed using the Philips HDI 5000 ultrasound machine, achieving 100% precision in error code interpretation and 80% accuracy in suggesting corrective actions. This study demonstrates the feasibility and potential of AI-driven systems to support medical device maintenance, with the aim of reducing equipment downtime to improve healthcare delivery in resource-constrained environments.

### [116] [Cauchy's Surface Area Formula in the Funk Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16468)
*Sunil Arya,David M. Mount*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: An analytic extension of Cauchy's surface area formula to Funk geometry with Holmes-Thompson measure, using central projections to boundary points; polytope case reduces to vertex-based sums; generalizes Crofton-type formulas and unifies Euclidean, Minkowski, Hilbert, and hyperbolic geometries as special cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend the classical Cauchy surface area formula from Euclidean space to the Funk geometry framework, providing a unified approach to surface area across multiple geometries and enabling applications in geometric tomography and approximation theory.

Method: Develop a Funk-geometry analogue of Cauchy's formula via central projections to boundary points of a convex body K, with the Holmes-Thompson measure; derive a simple, projection-based expression; specialize to polytopes where the formula becomes a vertex-weighted sum; derive a Crofton-type surface-area formula in Funk geometry.

Result: A simple, projection-based expression for Funk-area of a convex body; for polytopes the area is a weighted sum of central projections at the vertices; Crofton-type formula for surface areas in Funk geometry; by considering Euclidean, Minkowski, Hilbert, and hyperbolic geometries as limits/special cases, a unified framework for these surface-area formulas.

Conclusion: The work provides a unified, simple framework for surface-area formulas across several geometries via Funk geometry and Holmes-Thompson measure, with concrete polytope reductions and a generalized Crofton formula, potentially impacting geometric tomography and approximation theory.

Abstract: Cauchy's surface area formula expresses the surface area of a convex body as the average area of its orthogonal projections over all directions. While this tool is fundamental in Euclidean geometry, with applications ranging from geometric tomography to approximation theory, extensions to non-Euclidean settings remain less explored. In this paper, we establish an analog of Cauchy's formula for the Funk geometry induced by a convex body $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, under the Holmes-Thompson measure. Our formula is simple and is based on central projections to points on the boundary of $K$. We show that when $K$ is a convex polytope, the formula reduces to a weighted sum involving central projections at the vertices of $K$. Finally, as a consequence of our analysis, we derive a generalization of Crofton's formula for surface areas in the Funk geometry. By viewing Euclidean, Minkowski, Hilbert, and hyperbolic geometries as limiting or special cases of the Funk setting, our results provide a single framework that unifies these classical surface area formulas.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A scalable screw-theoretic PDE-based multibody framework for serial manipulators with arbitrary flexible links, yielding an index-1 DAE and a well-posed abstract Cauchy problem with explicit deformation-field states.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable, rigorous PDE-based modeling of serial robotic manipulators with many flexible links in 3D, ensuring proper constraint handling and unified dynamics across subsystems.

Method: For each flexible link, formulate dual screws in body-fixed coordinates (motion relative to inertial frame, body-fixed to undeformed configuration, elastic deformation); enforce holonomic joint constraints via interaction forces; derive dynamics from energy via variational principles; synthesize into a global semi-explicit index-1 DAE; recast via separation of variables into an abstract Cauchy problem and establish well-posedness.

Result: An infinitely scalable multibody representation that captures both local and global dynamics; explicit recovery of all dynamic states including deformation fields; a semi-explicit index-1 DAE formulation; well-posed abstract Cauchy problem.

Conclusion: The framework provides a rigorous, scalable approach for PDE-based modeling of flexible-link serial manipulators, with complete state accessibility and mathematical guarantees, suitable for analysis and computation.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel and scalable screw-theoretic multibody synthesis framework for PDE-based dynamic modeling of serial robotic manipulators with an arbitrary number of flexible links in three-dimensional space. The proposed approach systematically constructs screw-theoretic PDE models for individual flexible links and rigorously enforces holonomic joint constraints through interaction forces. The dynamics of each link are formulated using a set of dual screws expressed in body-fixed coordinates: one describing the motion of the body-fixed frame relative to the inertial frame, a second relating the body-fixed frame to the undeformed configuration, and a third capturing elastic deformations. By expressing the system energy and applying variational principles, the governing dynamics of each link had been previously derived in a unified manner. Synthesizing the individual link models yields an infinitely scalable multibody representation capable of capturing both local (subsystem-level) and global (system-level) dynamics. The framework explicitly recovers all dynamic states, including the motion of each body-fixed frame and the distributed deformation fields of the flexible links. For computational tractability and mathematical rigor, the resulting governing equations are formulated as a semi-explicit index-1 differential-algebraic system. Furthermore, by applying separation of variables, the PDE model is recast as an abstract Cauchy problem, and well-posedness of the resulting system is established.

Conclusion: DMAVA-based distributed AVP system successfully supports cooperative AVP simulation and serves as a foundation for future real-world deployment and hardware-in-the-loop testing; source code and demos provided.

Abstract: This paper presents the DMV-AVP System, a distributed simulation of Multi-Vehicle Autonomous Valet Parking (AVP). The system was implemented as an application of the Distributed Multi-Vehicle Architecture (DMAVA) for synchronized multi-host execution. Most existing simulation approaches rely on centralized or non-distributed designs that constrain scalability and limit fully autonomous control. This work introduces two modules built on top of the DMAVA: 1) a Multi-Vehicle AVP Node that performs state-based coordination, queuing, and reservation management across multiple vehicles, and 2) a Unity-Integrated YOLOv5 Parking Spot Detection Module that provides real-time, vision-based perception within AWSIM Labs. Both modules integrate seamlessly with the DMAVA and extend it specifically for multi-vehicle AVP operation, supported by a Zenoh-based communication layer that ensures low-latency topic synchronization and coordinated behavior across hosts. Experiments conducted on two- and three-host configurations demonstrate deterministic coordination, conflict-free parking behavior, and scalable performance across distributed Autoware instances. The results confirm that the proposed Distributed Multi-Vehicle AVP System supports cooperative AVP simulation and establishes a foundation for future real-world and hardware-in-the-loop validation.

Abstract: This paper presents a terrestrial GNSS-based orbit and clock estimation framework for lunar navigation satellites. To enable high-precision estimation under the low-observability conditions encountered at lunar distances, we develop a stochastic-cloning UD-factorized filter and delayed-state smoother that provide enhanced numerical stability when processing precise time-differenced carrier phase (TDCP) measurements. A comprehensive dynamics and measurement model is formulated, explicitly accounting for relativistic coupling between orbital and clock states, lunar time-scale transformations, and signal propagation delays including ionospheric, plasmaspheric, and Shapiro effects. The proposed approach is evaluated using high-fidelity Monte-Carlo simulations incorporating realistic multi-constellation GNSS geometry, broadcast ephemeris errors, lunar satellite dynamics, and ionospheric and plasmaspheric delay computed from empirical electron density models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CPP in agriculture often ignores energy constraints, causing incomplete missions in large-scale or resource-limited settings. An energy-aware, learning-based approach is needed for robust, scalable operation under energy limits.

Method: A Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning framework for grid-based CPP with obstacles and charging stations, integrating CNNs for spatial feature extraction and LSTMs for temporal dynamics. A reward function jointly optimizes coverage efficiency, energy consumption, and return-to-base behavior. Comparisons are made against RRT, PSO, and ACO baselines.

Conclusion: SAC-based energy-aware CPP is effective for agricultural robotics in energy-constrained scenarios, offering scalable performance and robustness in grid-based environments with charging infrastructure; suitable for deployment with future refinements for real-world variability.

Abstract: Coverage Path Planning (CPP) is a fundamental capability for agricultural robots; however, existing solutions often overlook energy constraints, resulting in incomplete operations in large-scale or resource-limited environments. This paper proposes an energy-aware CPP framework grounded in Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) reinforcement learning, designed for grid-based environments with obstacles and charging stations. To enable robust and adaptive decision-making under energy limitations, the framework integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spatial feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for temporal dynamics. A dedicated reward function is designed to jointly optimize coverage efficiency, energy consumption, and return-to-base constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently achieves over 90% coverage while ensuring energy safety, outperforming traditional heuristic algorithms such as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) baselines by 13.4-19.5% in coverage and reducing constraint violations by 59.9-88.3%. These findings validate the proposed SAC-based framework as an effective and scalable solution for energy-constrained CPP in agricultural robotics.

*Philip Tobuschat,Simon Duenser,Markus Bambach,Ivo Aschwanden*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Unified static calibration for articulated robots using virtual joints and Gauss-Newton identification from a single experiment; significantly improves accuracy over purely geometric calibration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address multiple sources of tool positioning errors (geometric and non-geometric like bending, thermal, gear errors) with a single, unified calibration approach instead of requiring separate experiments and models.

Method: Augment the robot kinematic chain with virtual joints representing geometric and non-geometric effects; identify parameters via Gauss-Newton optimization with analytic gradients; use a single straightforward data-collection experiment; assess conditioning with Fisher information spectra; validate via temporal cross-validation and model ablations.

Result: Mean position error of 26.8 μm on a KUKA KR30, compared to 102.3 μm from purely geometric calibration; robust, well-conditioned estimation with near-minimal parameterization.

Conclusion: A unified, robust calibration method that captures both geometric and non-geometric effects improves accuracy and reduces experimental burden, yielding precise robot models suitable for high-precision tasks.

Abstract: Researchers have identified various sources of tool positioning errors for articulated industrial robots and have proposed dedicated compensation strategies. However, these typically require individual, specialized experiments with separate models and identification procedures. This article presents a unified approach to the static calibration of industrial robots that identifies a robot model, including geometric and non-geometric effects (compliant bending, thermal deformation, gear transmission errors), using only a single, straightforward experiment for data collection. The model augments the kinematic chain with virtual joints for each modeled effect and realizes the identification using Gauss-Newton optimization with analytic gradients. Fisher information spectra show that the estimation is well-conditioned and the parameterization near-minimal, whereas systematic temporal cross-validation and model ablations demonstrate robustness of the model identification. The resulting model is very accurate and its identification robust, achieving a mean position error of 26.8 $μm$ on a KUKA KR30 industrial robot compared to 102.3 $μm$ for purely geometric calibration.

### [125] [ReViP: Reducing False Completion in Vision-Language-Action Models with Vision-Proprioception Rebalance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16667)
*Zhuohao Li,Yinghao Li,Jian-Jian Jiang,Lang Zhou,Tianyu Zhang,Wei-Shi Zheng*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReViP introduces Vision-Proprioception Rebalance for Vision-Language-Action models to reduce state-driven bias and false completions in robotic manipulation, by using an external vision-language model as a task-stage observer and FiLM-based modulation to reweight sensory streams; also proposes a False-Completion Benchmark Suite to evaluate robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modality imbalance in VLA systems causes overreliance on proprioception and underutilization of visual evidence, leading to state-dominant policies and false completions despite visible failures.

Method: Propose ReViP: a framework that uses an external VLM as a task-stage observer to extract real-time task-centric visual cues. These cues drive a Vision-Proprioception Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to adaptively rebalance sensor fusion. Introduces auxiliary task-aware environment priors for adaptive coupling. Builds a False-Completion Benchmark Suite on LIBERO with controlled perturbations (e.g., Object-Drop) to evaluate false completions.

Result: Extensive experiments show ReViP reduces false-completion rates and boosts success rates against strong VLA baselines on the proposed suite, with transferable gains to LIBERO, RoboTwin 2.0, and real-world evaluations.

Conclusion: Balancing vision and proprioception via task-aware priors and FiLM-based modulation improves visual grounding and robustness in VLA robotic manipulation; the False-Completion Benchmark Suite provides a standardized evaluation for false completions and generalization across platforms.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic manipulation by combining vision, language, and proprioception to predict actions. However, previous methods fuse proprioceptive signals directly with VLM-encoded vision-language features, resulting in state-dominant bias and false completions despite visible execution failures. We attribute this to modality imbalance, where policies over-rely on internal state while underusing visual evidence. To address this, we present ReViP, a novel VLA framework with Vision-Proprioception Rebalance to enhance visual grounding and robustness under perturbations. The key insight is to introduce auxiliary task-aware environment priors to adaptively modulate the coupling between semantic perception and proprioceptive dynamics. Specifically, we use an external VLM as a task-stage observer to extract real-time task-centric visual cues from visual observations, which drive a Vision-Proprioception Feature-wise Linear Modulation to enhance environmental awareness and reduce state-driven errors. Moreover, to evaluate false completion, we propose the first False-Completion Benchmark Suite built on LIBERO with controlled settings such as Object-Drop. Extensive experiments show that ReViP effectively reduces false-completion rates and improves success rates over strong VLA baselines on our suite, with gains extending to LIBERO, RoboTwin 2.0, and real-world evaluations.

*Lucía Güitta-López,Lionel Güitta-López,Jaime Boal,Álvaro Jesús López-López*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes StyleID-CycleGAN (SICGAN) to translate virtual observations into real-synthetic visuals, enabling zero-shot sim-to-real transfer for industrial robot pick-and-place with high virtual success (90–100%) and real-world accuracy (>95%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DRL suffers from sample inefficiency and a sizable sim-to-real gap, hindering industrial deployment. Zero-shot transfer—deploying policies trained in simulation directly on real hardware—is highly desirable but challenging due to visual and dynamic discrepancies.

Method: Introduce StyleID-CycleGAN, an extension of CycleGAN that identifies and leverages style cues to produce a hybrid domain (virtual dynamics with real-like visuals). Train DRL agents in the SICGAN-translated visuals in virtual environments; deploy directly to real robots. Evaluation uses augmented reality targets and tests with two industrial robots on an approaching phase of a pick-and-place task; tests with objects of varying colors/shapes including LEGO cubes and a mug.

Result: In virtual settings, agents achieve 90–100% success. In real-world tests, zero-shot transfer succeeds with accuracies above 95% for most workspace regions, indicating robust transfer. The approach generalizes to real objects of different colors and shapes.

Conclusion: The SICGAN-based pipeline offers an efficient, scalable solution to the sim-to-real problem, enabling practical zero-shot transfer for industrial DRL applications.

Abstract: The sample efficiency challenge in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) compromises its industrial adoption due to the high cost and time demands of real-world training. Virtual environments offer a cost-effective alternative for training DRL agents, but the transfer of learned policies to real setups is hindered by the sim-to-real gap. Achieving zero-shot transfer, where agents perform directly in real environments without additional tuning, is particularly desirable for its efficiency and practical value. This work proposes a novel domain adaptation approach relying on a Style-Identified Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (StyleID-CycleGAN or SICGAN), an original Cycle Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) based model. SICGAN translates raw virtual observations into real-synthetic images, creating a hybrid domain for training DRL agents that combines virtual dynamics with real-like visual inputs. Following virtual training, the agent can be directly deployed, bypassing the need for real-world training. The pipeline is validated with two distinct industrial robots in the approaching phase of a pick-and-place operation. In virtual environments agents achieve success rates of 90 to 100\%, and real-world deployment confirms robust zero-shot transfer (i.e., without additional training in the physical environment) with accuracies above 95\% for most workspace regions. We use augmented reality targets to improve the evaluation process efficiency, and experimentally demonstrate that the agent successfully generalizes to real objects of varying colors and shapes, including LEGO\textsuperscript{\textregistered}~cubes and a mug. These results establish the proposed pipeline as an efficient, scalable solution to the sim-to-real problem.

*Ning Liu,Sen Shen,Zheng Li,Matthew D'Souza,Jen Jen Chung,Thomas Braunl*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hybrid learning-control framework (ARMS) combining PPO-based RL follower with an MPC safety filter, using an adaptive neural switcher for context-aware fusion to navigate safely and efficiently in proximity to humans. Demonstrates higher success in cluttered environments and lower latency than baselines; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address robust, safe human-guided navigation for mobile collaborative robots under proximity constraints and partial observability, with non-stationary human motion requiring both learning-based adaptability and safety guarantees.

Method: Hybrid framework ARMS: a PPO-trained RL follower and a one-step MPC safety filter formulated as a quadratic program. Perception uses decoupled sensing with an LSTM temporal encoder for relative state and a 360-degree LiDAR spatial encoder. A learned adaptive switcher performs context-aware soft fusion between controllers, prioritizing safety (QP) in low-risk regions and shifting to the learned follower when maneuverability is needed; reverts to follower if QP infeasible.

Result: In challenging cluttered environments, ARMS achieves 82.5% success, outperforming Pure Pursuit, DWA, and RL-only baselines by 7.1% and 3.1% respectively. Reduces average computation latency by 33% to 5.2 ms relative to a multi-step MPC baseline. Sim-to-real transfer (Gazebo) and initial real-world deployment show practicality and robustness.

Conclusion: ARMS provides a practical, adaptive control framework that blends safety-oriented MPC with learning-based navigation, yielding higher success in cluttered scenarios and lower latency, suitable for safe human-robot collaboration; source code and demo video are available.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of human-guided navigation for mobile collaborative robots under simultaneous proximity regulation and safety constraints. We introduce Adaptive Reinforcement and Model Predictive Control Switching (ARMS), a hybrid learning-control framework that integrates a reinforcement learning follower trained with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and an analytical one-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) formulated as a quadratic program safety filter. To enable robust perception under partial observability and non-stationary human motion, ARMS employs a decoupled sensing architecture with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) temporal encoder for the human-robot relative state and a spatial encoder for 360-degree LiDAR scans. The core contribution is a learned adaptive neural switcher that performs context-aware soft action fusion between the two controllers, favoring conservative, constraint-aware QP-based control in low-risk regions while progressively shifting control authority to the learned follower in highly cluttered or constrained scenarios where maneuverability is critical, and reverting to the follower action when the QP becomes infeasible. Extensive evaluations against Pure Pursuit, Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), and an RL-only baseline demonstrate that ARMS achieves an 82.5 percent success rate in highly cluttered environments, outperforming DWA and RL-only approaches by 7.1 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively, while reducing average computational latency by 33 percent to 5.2 milliseconds compared to a multi-step MPC baseline. Additional simulation transfer in Gazebo and initial real-world deployment results further indicate the practicality and robustness of ARMS for safe and efficient human-robot collaboration.

*Siyuan Sun,Eugene H. Lin,Nathan Brown,Hsin-Yi Hung,Andrew Gordus,Jochen Mueller,Chen Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Eight-legged spider robot with four joints per leg and tunable leg stiffness reproduces key web vibration features, enabling study of how leg crouching modulates vibration sensing with greater biological realism.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how leg crouching enhances vibration sensing in orb-weaving spiders and to overcome measurement challenges in behaving animals by using a robophysical model.

Method: Developed an eight-legged robospider with four joints per leg, 3D-printed exoskeletons, silicone-based variable stiffness, tendon-driven actuation to crouch all legs deeply, and accelerometers at leg joints to record vibrations.

Result: The robot reproduced key vibration features observed in a prior simpler robot and achieved improved biological realism, providing a more accurate platform to study leg-mediated sensing on a web.

Conclusion: The enhanced robophysical model offers a biologically realistic tool for investigating how leg behaviors modulate vibration sensing, advancing understanding of active sensing strategies in spiders.

Abstract: Orb-weaving spiders detect prey on a web using vibration sensors at leg joints. They often dynamically crouch their legs during prey sensing, likely an active sensing strategy. However, how leg crouching enhances sensing is poorly understood, because measuring system vibrations in behaving animals is difficult. We use robophysical modeling to study this problem. Our previous spider robot had only four legs, simplified leg morphology, and a shallow crouching range of motion. Here, we developed a new spider robot, with eight legs, each with four joints that better approximated spider leg morphology. Leg exoskeletons were 3-D printed and joint stiffness was tuned using integrated silicone molding with variable materials and geometry. Tendon-driven actuation allowed a motor in the body to crouch all eight legs deeply as spiders do, while accelerometers at leg joints record leg vibrations. Experiments showed that our new spider robot reproduced key vibration features observed in the previous robot while improving biological accuracy. Our new robot provides a biologically more accurate robophysical model for studying how leg behaviors modulate vibration sensing on a web.

TL;DR: 8-channel sEMG feature extraction with an MLP/TCN to predict elbow/shoulder joint torques; MLP performance matched TCN under limited data conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate joint torque prediction is critical for personalized, robot-assisted rehabilitation; reducing data and model complexity while maintaining accuracy is desirable for patient care.

Method: Developed an 8-channel sEMG feature extraction pipeline and evaluated with two neural networks (MLP and TCN) on data from a single subject performing elbow/shoulder movements under three load conditions; reference torques estimated from center-of-mass kinematics assuming static equilibrium.

Result: MLP achieved mean RMSE of 0.963 N·m (elbow), 1.403 N·m (front-shoulder), 1.434 N·m (side-shoulder) across five seeds, comparable to TCN performance.

Conclusion: The feature extraction pipeline enables a simple MLP to attain performance comparable to a temporally specialized network, highlighting suitability for scenarios with limited training data in patient care.

Abstract: Robot-assisted rehabilitation offers an effective approach, wherein exoskeletons adapt to users' needs and provide personalized assistance. However, to deliver such assistance, accurate prediction of the user's joint torques is essential. In this work, we propose a feature extraction pipeline using 8-channel surface electromyography (sEMG) signals to predict elbow and shoulder joint torques. For preliminary evaluation, this pipeline was integrated into two neural network models: the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Data were collected from a single subject performing elbow and shoulder movements under three load conditions (0 kg, 1.10 kg, and 1.85 kg) using three motion-capture cameras. Reference torques were estimated from center-of-mass kinematics under the assumption of static equilibrium. Our offline analyses showed that, with our feature extraction pipeline, MLP model achieved mean RMSE of 0.963 N m, 1.403 N m, and 1.434 N m (over five seeds) for elbow, front-shoulder, and side-shoulder joints, respectively, which were comparable to the TCN performance. These results demonstrate that the proposed feature extraction pipeline enables a simple MLP to achieve performance comparable to that of a network designed explicitly for temporal dependencies. This finding is particularly relevant for applications with limited training data, a common scenario patient care.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a powerful framework for solving complex sequential decision-making problems, particularly in robotic control. However, its practical deployment is often hindered by the substantial amount of experience required for learning, which results in high computational and time costs. In this work, we propose a novel integration of DRL with semantic knowledge in the form of Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs), aiming to enhance learning efficiency by providing contextual information to the agent. Our architecture combines KGEs with visual observations, enabling the agent to exploit environmental knowledge during training. Experimental validation with robotic manipulators in environments featuring both fixed and randomized target attributes demonstrates that our method achieves up to {60}{\%} reduction in learning time and improves task accuracy by approximately 15 percentage points, without increasing training time or computational complexity. These results highlight the potential of semantic knowledge to reduce sample complexity and improve the effectiveness of DRL in robotic applications.

Motivation: Address the scarcity of multimodal datasets that capture natural HRI and dialogue-driven ambiguity in assistive control, aiming to improve flexible, intuitive interfaces for WMRAs.

Method: Two-room Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) setup with a dialogue-based interaction protocol to simulate robot autonomy. Data collected from five synchronized modalities—RGB-D video, conversational audio, IMU signals, end-effector Cartesian pose, and whole-body joint states—across five assistive tasks. Pilot dataset comprises 53 trials from five participants.

Result: Validation of data quality via motion-smoothness analysis and user feedback. The framework captures diverse ambiguity types and supports natural dialogue-driven interaction, showing potential for scaling to larger datasets for learning, benchmarking, and evaluation of ambiguity-aware assistive control.

Conclusion: The framework is suitable for scaling to larger datasets and provides a robust foundation for learning-based and benchmarking work in ambiguity-aware assistive control for wheelchairs and WMRAs.

Abstract: Integrated control of wheelchairs and wheelchair-mounted robotic arms (WMRAs) has strong potential to increase independence for users with severe motor limitations, yet existing interfaces often lack the flexibility needed for intuitive assistive interaction. Although data-driven AI methods show promise, progress is limited by the lack of multimodal datasets that capture natural Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), particularly conversational ambiguity in dialogue-driven control. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal data collection framework that employs a dialogue-based interaction protocol and a two-room Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) setup to simulate robot autonomy while eliciting natural user behavior. The framework records five synchronized modalities: RGB-D video, conversational audio, inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals, end-effector Cartesian pose, and whole-body joint states across five assistive tasks. Using this framework, we collected a pilot dataset of 53 trials from five participants and validated its quality through motion smoothness analysis and user feedback. The results show that the framework effectively captures diverse ambiguity types and supports natural dialogue-driven interaction, demonstrating its suitability for scaling to a larger dataset for learning, benchmarking, and evaluation of ambiguity-aware assistive control.
