### [1] [DrivingScene: A Multi-Task Online Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting Method for Dynamic Driving Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24734)
*Qirui Hou,Wenzhang Sun,Chang Zeng,Chunfeng Wang,Hao Li,Jianxun Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DrivingScene offers real-time, online 4D dynamic scene reconstruction from two consecutive surround-view images by using a lightweight residual flow network atop a static scene prior, with coarse-to-fine training; it outputs depth, scene flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds, surpassing state-of-the-art in dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis on nuScenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes from sparse views is challenging due to complex dynamics and computational constraints. Improving efficiency while maintaining quality is critical for autonomous driving and related applications.

Method: Propose DrivingScene, an online, feed-forward framework that takes two consecutive surround-view images. It deploys a lightweight residual flow network to predict non-rigid object motion per camera on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene flow. A coarse-to-fine training paradigm is used to mitigate instabilities common in end-to-end approaches.

Result: On the nuScenes dataset, the image-only approach simultaneously produces high-quality depth, scene flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that accurate, real-time 4D dynamic scene reconstruction from sparse visual input is feasible with a per-camera residual flow on a static prior and a coarse-to-fine training regime, with strong implications for real-time autonomy and scene understanding.

Abstract: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is
challenged by complex dynamics and sparse views, with prior methods struggling
to balance quality and efficiency. We propose DrivingScene, an online,
feed-forward framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from only two
consecutive surround-view images. Our key innovation is a lightweight residual
flow network that predicts the non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera
on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene
flow. We also introduce a coarse-to-fine training paradigm that circumvents the
instabilities common to end-to-end approaches. Experiments on nuScenes dataset
show our image-only method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene
flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view
synthesis.

### [2] [Towards Fine-Grained Human Motion Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24767)
*Guorui Song,Guocun Wang,Zhe Huang,Jing Lin,Xuefei Zhe,Jian Li,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Motion-augmented captioning using human-mesh motion cues to produce accurate, fine-grained action descriptions; introduces the HMI dataset and benchmark; outperforms prior methods in motion-focused captioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Capturing fine-grained human motion in videos is challenging; existing captions are vague and semantically inconsistent. Incorporating explicit motion cues via human mesh recovery aims to reduce hallucinations and improve fidelity and spatial alignment.

Method: Proposes the Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM) that integrates motion representations from human mesh recovery into motion-aware decoding. Introduces the Human Motion Insight (HMI) dataset (115K video-description pairs) and HMI-Bench benchmark for evaluating motion-focused captioning.

Result: M-ACM significantly improves accuracy in describing complex human motions and subtle temporal variations, outperforming previous methods in motion-centric captioning.

Conclusion: Emphasizing body dynamics via motion representations yields more faithful captions. The HMI dataset/benchmark facilitates motion-focused research and sets a new standard for motion-centric video captioning.

Abstract: Generating accurate descriptions of human actions in videos remains a
challenging task for video captioning models. Existing approaches often
struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, resulting in vague or
semantically inconsistent captions. In this work, we introduce the
Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM), a novel generative framework that
enhances caption quality by incorporating motion-aware decoding. At its core,
M-ACM leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to
explicitly highlight human body dynamics, thereby reducing hallucinations and
improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated
captions. To support research in this area, we present the Human Motion Insight
(HMI) Dataset, comprising 115K video-description pairs focused on human
movement, along with HMI-Bench, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating
motion-focused video captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that M-ACM
significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex
human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for
motion-centric video captioning.

### [3] [Combining SAR Simulators to Train ATR Models with Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24768)
*Benjamin Camus,Julien Houssay,Corentin Le Barbu,Eric Monteux,Cédric Saleun,Christian Cochin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A study on SAR ATR using synthetic data from two simulators (MOCEM and Salsa) to mitigate sim-to-real gaps, introducing the ADASCA DL approach; achieves ~88% accuracy on MSTAR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Synthetic SAR data enables large, diverse datasets but often fails to generalize to real measurements due to simplifying physical models. The work seeks to quantify this simulation-induced gap and improve generalization by combining simulators with complementary paradigms.

Method: Generate synthetic SAR data using two simulators: MOCEM (scattering centers model) and Salsa (ray tracing); train a deep learning model named ADASCA on this synthetic data; evaluate on real measurements (MSTAR).

Result: Demonstrates the impact of the simulation paradigm on ATR performance and reports an accuracy of almost 88% on MSTAR.

Conclusion: Combining complementary SAR simulators can improve realism and generalization of DL-based ATR, offering a viable path to bridging the reality gap in synthetic data for SAR.

Abstract: This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the
lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR
simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which
enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However,
simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real
world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as
representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on
synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions
to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the
impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a
new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are
grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic
datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a
scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing
strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM
and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of
almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.

### [4] [Point-level Uncertainty Evaluation of Mobile Laser Scanning Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24773)
*Ziyang Xu,Olaf Wysocki,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data-driven ML framework (Random Forest and XGBoost) quantifies MLS point-level uncertainty by learning relationships between local geometric features and errors, avoiding costly ground-truth data; achieves ROC-AUC >0.87 on spatially partitioned data; highlights elevation variation, density, and local complexity as key predictors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) is crucial for reliable 3D mapping and analysis but traditional methods rely on expensive high-precision references unavailable at large scales. A scalable, ground-truth-light approach is needed.

Method: Train and validate two ensemble models (Random Forest and XGBoost) on features derived from local geometry. Use a spatial partitioning scheme to prevent data leakage and evaluate point-level uncertainty (likely a binary/classification task using ROC-AUC). Analyze feature importance to identify dominant geometric predictors (elevation variation, point density, local structure).

Result: Both RF and XGBoost effectively model nonlinear relationships between geometric features and uncertainty, achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. Elevation variation, density, and local structural complexity are among the dominant predictive features. The framework demonstrates scalability and adaptability for quality control and error analysis in large-scale MLS point clouds.

Conclusion: A data-driven, scalable framework for point-level uncertainty evaluation in MLS that reduces dependence on costly reference data and supports QC and error analysis across large datasets.

Abstract: Reliable quantification of uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point
clouds is essential for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of downstream
applications such as 3D mapping, modeling, and change analysis. Traditional
backward uncertainty modeling heavily rely on high-precision reference data,
which are often costly or infeasible to obtain at large scales. To address this
issue, this study proposes a machine learning-based framework for point-level
uncertainty evaluation that learns the relationship between local geometric
features and point-level errors. The framework is implemented using two
ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and
validated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage.
Experimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the
nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty,
achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that
geometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local
structural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The
proposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation,
providing a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and
error analysis of large-scale point clouds.

### [5] [Cross-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion of Eye-Tracking and Facial Features for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24777)
*Yujie Nie,Jianzhang Ni,Yonglong Ye,Yuan-Ting Zhang,Yun Kwok Wing,Xiangqing Xu,Xin Ma,Lizhou Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework combining eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection, featuring two modules (CEFAM and DACM); built a synchronized multimodal dataset; achieves 95.11% accuracy, surpassing late fusion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve Alzheimer's disease diagnosis by leveraging complementary information from eye-tracking and facial cues, addressing the gap in joint multimodal integration for AD detection.

Method: Introduce Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module (CEFAM) that uses cross-attention and global enhancement to model inter-modal interactions, and a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM) that captures directional facial features with horizontal-vertical receptive fields. Train a multimodal fusion model on a synchronized dataset of 25 AD and 25 healthy controls recorded during a visual memory-search task.

Result: The method outperforms traditional late fusion and feature concatenation baselines, achieving 95.11% accuracy in distinguishing AD from HC, indicating strong inter-modal dependency modeling and modality-specific contributions.

Conclusion: The proposed cross-modal fusion framework is effective for AD detection using eye-tracking and facial features, highlighting the benefit of explicit inter-modal modeling; external validation on larger, diverse cohorts is needed to confirm generalizability.

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling
timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic
approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information
across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in
particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting
attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have
explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we
propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically
leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework
incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module
(CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and
global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which
captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical
receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative
multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a
synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy
controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences
during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid
resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and
feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in
distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic
performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and
modality-specific contributions.

### [6] [FPGA-based Lane Detection System incorporating Temperature and Light Control Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24778)
*Ibrahim Qamar,Saber Mahmoud,Seif Megahed,Mohamed Khaled,Saleh Hesham,Ahmed Matar,Saif Gebril,Mervat Mahmoud*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FPGA-based Lane Detector Vehicle (LDV) uses Sobel edge detection to perform real-time lane detection on 416x416 images, delivering outputs in 1.17 ms with lane count, current index, and left/right boundaries, plus environmental control features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time, robust lane detection is critical for intelligent vehicles; hardware acceleration on FPGA can meet strict latency and adapt to changing environmental conditions.

Method: An FPGA-based LDV architecture implementing Sobel edge detection on 416x416 images at 150 MHz, producing valid outputs every 1.17 ms, including the number of lanes, current lane index, and left/right boundaries; includes automated light and temperature control units to adapt to environmental factors.

Result: High-throughput, low-latency lane-detection output with boundary information; fast processing rate (1.17 ms per valid output) and environmental adaptability.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a fast, environment-adaptive FPGA lane-detection system using Sobel-based edge detection, suitable for intelligent vehicles and real-time lane tracking.

Abstract: Intelligent vehicles are one of the most important outcomes gained from the
world tendency toward automation. Applications of IVs, whether in urban roads
or robot tracks, do prioritize lane path detection. This paper proposes an
FPGA-based Lane Detector Vehicle LDV architecture that relies on the Sobel
algorithm for edge detection. Operating on 416 x 416 images and 150 MHz, the
system can generate a valid output every 1.17 ms. The valid output consists of
the number of present lanes, the current lane index, as well as its right and
left boundaries. Additionally, the automated light and temperature control
units in the proposed system enhance its adaptability to the surrounding
environmental conditions.

### [7] [ESCA: Enabling Seamless Codec Avatar Execution through Algorithm and Hardware Co-Optimization for Virtual Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24787)
*Mingzhi Zhu,Ding Shang,Sai Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: End-to-end optimization (PTQ, hardware accelerator, and ESCA framework) enables real-time, high-fidelity Codec Avatar renderings on edge VR devices, achieving up to 3.36× latency reduction, 100 FPS, and quality gains over 4-bit baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Photorealistic Codec Avatars offer immersive facial rendering in VR but require heavy compute and power; real-time inference on resource-constrained head-mounted displays is challenging, motivating low-precision computation and dedicated hardware to improve latency and energy efficiency.

Method: Proposes a tailored post-training quantization (PTQ) for Codec Avatar models, a custom hardware accelerator integrated into the VR device’s SoC, and a full-stack ESCA framework that optimizes PCA inference across model, hardware, and rendering pipelines.

Result: Experimental results show FovVideoVDP quality improvement of up to +0.39 over the best 4-bit baseline, up to 3.36× latency reduction, and sustained 100 FPS in end-to-end tests, meeting real-time VR demands.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices and paves the way for more immersive and portable VR experiences.

Abstract: Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA), which generate high-fidelity human face
renderings, are increasingly being used in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to
enable immersive communication and interaction through deep learning-based
generative models. However, these models impose significant computational
demands, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR
devices such as head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are
critical. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient post-training
quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models, enabling
low-precision execution without compromising output quality. In addition, we
design a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into the
system-on-chip of VR devices to further enhance processing efficiency. Building
on these components, we introduce ESCA, a full-stack optimization framework
that accelerates PCA inference on edge VR platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to $+0.39$ over
the best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to $3.36\times$ latency reduction, and
sustains a rendering rate of 100 frames per second in end-to-end tests,
satisfying real-time VR requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility
of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices,
opening the door to more immersive and portable VR experiences.

### [8] [The Underappreciated Power of Vision Models for Graph Structural Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24788)
*Xinjian Zhao,Wei Pang,Zhongkai Xue,Xiangru Jian,Lei Zhang,Yaoyao Xu,Xiaozhuang Song,Shu Wu,Tianshu Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision models can rival or exceed GNNs in global-structure understanding of graphs, especially for holistic and scale-invariant tasks, as shown by the GraphAbstract benchmark; GNNs lag on global abstractions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing graph benchmarks often conflate domain features with topology, while humans naturally grasp global graph structures. The paper explores the underutilized potential of vision models for graph understanding and introduces GraphAbstract to assess holistic/topology-aware reasoning.

Method: A comparative study between vision models and GNNs on standard graph benchmarks and the proposed GraphAbstract tasks (organizational archetypes, symmetry, connectivity strength, critical element identification) across varying graph sizes, analyzing generalization and learning patterns.

Result: Vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic structural understanding and generalize across graph scales; GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade as graph size increases; performance on standard benchmarks is mixed.

Conclusion: Vision models possess strong, underutilized capabilities for graph-level understanding, especially for global/topology-aware reasoning. GraphAbstract reveals this potential and motivates developing graph foundation models that leverage holistic pattern recognition.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks operate through bottom-up message-passing,
fundamentally differing from human visual perception, which intuitively
captures global structures first. We investigate the underappreciated potential
of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance
comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly
different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with
limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with
topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This
benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as
humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing
connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal
that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic
structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph
scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with
increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess
remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding,
particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and
scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this
underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation
models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.

### [9] [A Re-node Self-training Approach for Deep Graph-based Semi-supervised Classification on Multi-view Image Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24791)
*Jingjun Bi,Fadi Dornaika*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Re-node Self-taught Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-view Data (RSGSLM), a graph-based SSL framework within GCNs that fuses multi-view graphs, uses dynamic pseudo-labeling, corrects topological imbalances, and adds an unsupervised smoothing loss to improve multi-view image classification efficiently.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the challenge of scarce annotations and the difficulty of integrating graph structures in multi-view data, aiming to improve semi-supervised learning effectiveness and efficiency for multi-view images.

Method: 1) Linear feature transformation combined with multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). 2) Dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the GCN loss to leverage unlabeled data across views. 3) Adjusting weights of labeled samples near class boundaries to correct topological imbalances. 4) Introducing an unsupervised smoothing loss applicable to all samples. 5) Emphasis on computational efficiency.

Result: Experimentally, RSGSLM outperforms existing semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts on benchmark multi-view image datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively integrates multi-view graph information with pseudo-labeling while addressing topological imbalance and providing unsupervised smoothing, yielding improved performance and efficiency in multi-view SSL.

Abstract: Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning and pseudo-labeling have
gained attention due to their effectiveness in reducing the need for extensive
data annotations. Pseudo-labeling uses predictions from unlabeled data to
improve model training, while graph-based methods are characterized by
processing data represented as graphs. However, the lack of clear graph
structures in images combined with the complexity of multi-view data limits the
efficiency of traditional and existing techniques. Moreover, the integration of
graph structures in multi-view data is still a challenge. In this paper, we
propose Re-node Self-taught Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-view
Data (RSGSLM). Our method addresses these challenges by (i) combining linear
feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) framework, (ii) dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the
GCN loss function to improve classification in multi-view data, and (iii)
correcting topological imbalances by adjusting the weights of labeled samples
near class boundaries. Additionally, (iv) we introduce an unsupervised
smoothing loss applicable to all samples. This combination optimizes
performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on
multi-view benchmark image datasets demonstrate that RSGSLM surpasses existing
semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

### [10] [PISA-Bench: The PISA Index as a Multilingual and Multimodal Metric for the Evaluation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24792)
*Patrick Haller,Fabio Barth,Jonas Golde,Georg Rehm,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PISA-Bench introduces a multilingual, human-verified vision-language benchmark derived from English PISA items, creating a six-language parallel corpus (English plus Spanish, German, Chinese, French, Italian) with instructions, questions, options, and images; evaluation shows small VLMs (<20B params) underperform, non-English shifts degrade performance, and spatial/geometric reasoning remains challenging; dataset and evaluation framework released to advance multilingual multimodal reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a shortage of high-quality, human-verified multilingual benchmarks for vision-language reasoning. Existing datasets are English-centric or rely on synthetic data from LLMs; translating samples is costly. PISA-Bench fills the gap by leveraging expert-created PISA items to create a multilingual, real-reasoning benchmark across six languages.

Method: Create a fully parallel multilingual benchmark by taking English PISA items (instructions, questions, options, images) and translating them into five additional languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, Italian). Annotate each instance with question-type categories and assemble a unified evaluation framework.

Result: Evaluation across state-of-the-art VLMs shows small models (<20B parameters) struggle to achieve high scores. Notable performance degradation on non-English splits and high error rates in spatial/geometric reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Release the dataset and evaluation framework to support ongoing research in multilingual multimodal reasoning and benchmark development.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of
high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on
synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore,
most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated
samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce
PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the
expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student
competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted
instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question
type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional
languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully
parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models
(<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial
performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when
models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the
dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research
on multilingual multimodal reasoning.

*Zhaoshu Yu,Bo Wang,Pengpeng Zeng,Haonan Zhang,Ji Zhang,Lianli Gao,Jingkuan Song,Nicu Sebe,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A survey establishing a unified taxonomy and review of Efficient Vision-Language-Action (Efficient VLA) models, outlining three pillars (Efficient Model Design, Efficient Training, Efficient Data Collection) and offering a roadmap and a project page.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLAs are powerful but resource-hungry; reducing compute/data needs is essential for practical deployment in embodied AI.

Method: Proposes a unified taxonomy; conducts a comprehensive literature review and critical analysis across the three pillars; describes representative methods, applications, challenges, and a roadmap; maintains an up-to-date project page.

Result: First comprehensive survey of Efficient VLAs; organizes current work into a coherent framework; provides synthesized insights and guidance for future research.

Conclusion: Establishes a foundational reference for the field, highlights key challenges, and charts directions for future work; an ongoing resource via a continuously updated project page.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) represent a significant frontier in
embodied intelligence, aiming to bridge digital knowledge with physical-world
interaction. While these models have demonstrated remarkable generalist
capabilities, their deployment is severely hampered by the substantial
computational and data requirements inherent to their underlying large-scale
foundation models. Motivated by the urgent need to address these challenges,
this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient
Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) across the entire
data-model-training process. Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to
systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing
current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design,
focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient
Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3)
Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and
utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods
within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational
reference for the community but also summarizes representative applications,
delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We
maintain a continuously updated project page to track our latest developments:

### [12] [Conflict Adaptation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24804)
*Xiaoyang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Most vision-language models show conflict adaptation in a sequential Stroop task; sparse autoencoders reveal task-relevant supernodes whose text and color representations partially overlap and mirror human reading-color naming asymmetries; ablating a conflict-modulated supernode increases Stroop errors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether deep vision-language models exhibit cognitive-control-like conflict adaptation and to uncover the representational basis underlying this behavior, drawing a link to human cognitive control and automaticity asymmetries.

Method: Conduct sequential Stroop task on 13 vision-language models; identify task-relevant supernodes via sparse autoencoders on InternVL 3.5 4B; examine early/late layer representations; perform ablations to test causal role of a conflict-modulated supernode in layers 24-25.

Result: 12 of 13 models show conflict adaptation-consistent behavior (one exception likely ceiling effect); partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and late layers; sizes mirror reading vs color naming automaticity asymmetry; a conflict-modulated supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation increases Stroop errors with minimal impact on congruent trials.

Conclusion: VLMs exhibit cognitive-control-like adaptation with interpretable representational substrates; a specific late-layer supernode plays a causal role in conflict processing, offering parallels to human cognitive control and automaticity differences.

Abstract: A signature of human cognitive control is conflict adaptation: improved
performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial.
This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource,
is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13
vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict
adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To
understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B.
Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and
late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between
reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated
supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors
while minimally affecting congruent trials.

### [13] [DualCap: Enhancing Lightweight Image Captioning via Dual Retrieval with Similar Scenes Visual Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24813)
*Binbin Li,Guimiao Yang,Zisen Qi,Haiping Wang,Yu Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualCap enriches visual representations for captioning by generating a visual prompt from retrieved similar images, via a dual retrieval pipeline (image-to-text and image-to-image), and a lightweight fusion network, achieving competitive results with fewer trainable parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current retrieval-augmented captioning often uses retrieved data only as text prompts, leaving visual features underutilized and missing object-level detail in complex scenes. This creates a semantic gap between retrieved content and visual input.

Method: DualCap performs dual retrieval: standard image-to-text retrieval to obtain textual prompts and a novel image-to-image retrieval to source visually similar scenes. Salient objects and details are captured by extracting keywords/phrases from captions of visually similar scenes. These textual features are encoded and fused with the original image features through a lightweight trainable fusion network to produce enriched visual representations for captioning.

Result: Experimental results show competitive captioning performance while using fewer trainable parameters than prior visual-prompting captioning approaches.

Conclusion: Enriching visual features with a derived visual prompt from retrieved images helps bridge the semantic gap in retrieval-augmented captioning and yields efficient, effective captioning with a compact model.

Abstract: Recent lightweight retrieval-augmented image caption models often utilize
retrieved data solely as text prompts, thereby creating a semantic gap by
leaving the original visual features unenhanced, particularly for object
details or complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a
novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual
prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval
mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel
image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically,
salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar
scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are
then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a
lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring
fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning

### [14] [Deep Feature Optimization for Enhanced Fish Freshness Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24814)
*Phi-Hung Hoang,Nam-Thuan Trinh,Van-Manh Tran,Thi-Thu-Hong Phan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A three-stage framework combines fine-tuned multi-backbone features with classical ML classifiers and feature selection to predict fish freshness, achieving 85.99% accuracy on the FFE dataset, outperforming prior work by up to ~23%.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subjective sensory evaluation of freshness is unreliable, time-consuming, and inconsistent. A transparent, accurate, and scalable objective method is needed. This work aims to unify deep visual representations with traditional ML and feature selection to improve accuracy and interpretability in visual freshness assessment.

Method: Stage 1: Fine-tune five vision backbones — ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny. Stage 2: Extract multi-level deep features and train seven classical ML classifiers, integrating deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Stage 3: Apply feature selection using LGBM, Random Forest, and Lasso to obtain a compact informative feature subset. The best configuration uses Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and LGBM-based feature selection.

Result: On the Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset, the best configuration achieves 85.99% accuracy, outperforming recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69–22.78%. This demonstrates strong performance and potential generalizability to visual quality tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed three-stage framework effectively refines deep visual representations and combines deep learning with traditional ML and feature selection to deliver reliable, interpretable visual freshness assessment, with demonstrated generalizability to visual quality evaluation tasks.

Abstract: Assessing fish freshness is vital for ensuring food safety and minimizing
economic losses in the seafood industry. However, traditional sensory
evaluation remains subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Although
recent advances in deep learning have automated visual freshness prediction,
challenges related to accuracy and feature transparency persist. This study
introduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep
visual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five
state-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121,
EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a
strong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones
are used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating
deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Finally, feature selection methods
based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest, and Lasso
identify a compact and informative subset of features. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate that the best
configuration combining Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and
LGBM-based feature selection achieves an accuracy of 85.99%, outperforming
recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69-22.78%. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for visual quality
evaluation tasks.

*Cui Yakun,Fushuo Huo,Weijie Shi,Juntao Dai,Hang Du,Zhenghao Zhu,Sirui Han,Yike Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces MVFNDB, a multi-modal video fake news detection benchmark with 10 tasks and 9,730 questions, and a framework MVFND-CoT to study how creators' content and original footage reasoning affect detection, plus analysis of video processing and feature-model alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a lack of fine-grained, interpretable evaluation in VFND; existing benchmarks focus on final accuracy and treat the detection process as a black box. This work aims to provide a structured benchmark and reasoning framework to probe perception, understanding, and reasoning in MLLMs for VFND.

Method: Proposes MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) with 10 tasks and 9,730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a VFND taxonomy. Introduces MVFND-CoT (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection with Chain-of-Thought) that reasons over both creator-added content and original shooting footage. Conducts an in-depth analysis of factors affecting accuracy, including video processing strategies and alignment between video features and model capabilities.

Result: A novel benchmark and a reasoning framework are proposed, enabling fine-grained evaluation of MLLMs in VFND. The study analyzes factors influencing accuracy, including feature fusion and alignment, and demonstrates the impact of combining multiple features on final results.

Conclusion: MVFNDB and MVFND-CoT establish a solid foundation for future evaluation and advancement of MLLMs in video fake news detection, enabling more granular assessment of perception, understanding, and reasoning throughout the detection pipeline.

Abstract: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced
research into applications for Video fake news detection (VFND) tasks.
Traditional video-based FND benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the
final decision, often failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the
entire detection process, making the detection process a black box. Therefore,
we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based
on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The
benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs'
perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring
9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed
taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features
on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which
incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage
reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and
the alignment between video features and model capabilities. We believe this
benchmark will lay a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements
of MLLMs in the domain of video fake news detection.

*Ruiyang Zhang,Jiahao Luo,Xiaoru Feng,Qiufan Pang,Yaodong Yang,Juntao Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes MR-SafeEdit and SafeEditor for post-hoc, multi-round safety editing in text-to-image (T2I) models, enabling model-agnostic safety alignment via a unified multi-round image-text interleaved dataset and a multi-round safety-editing LLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address safety of T2I models, particularly the drawbacks of inference-time safety methods (over-refusal and unsafe-utility tradeoffs), by providing a plug-and-play, model-agnostic post-hoc safety editing solution.

Method: Introduce MR-SafeEdit, a dataset crafted for iterative safety editing in T2I generation, and SafeEditor, a unified multilingual LLM (MLLM) capable of multi-round safety editing on generated images; propose a post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors human iterative refinement.

Result: Experiments show SafeEditor reduces over-refusal and achieves a better balance between safety and utility compared to prior safety approaches.

Conclusion: A plug-and-play, model-agnostic framework with a dedicated multi-round safety-editing dataset and an MLLM editor can align T2I models safely without sacrificing utility.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their
safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be
categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time
methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer
from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility.
To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework
that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient
safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is
MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically
constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a
post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of
identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we
develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on
generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior
safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable
safety-utility balance.

TL;DR: Ming-Flash-Omni is a sparse Mixture-of-Experts upgraded 100B model (6.1B active per token) that unifies vision, speech, and language with strong efficiency, achieving SOTA results across 12 contextual ASR benchmarks and improvements in speech, image generation, and generative segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To scale unified multimodal AI toward AGI by enabling large capacity with sparse activation, improving cross-modal understanding and generation without prohibitive compute.

Method: Adopts a sparse MoE variant of Ling-Flash-2.0, building Ming-Flash-Omni with 100B parameters and 6.1B active per token; enhances multimodal branches for vision, speech, language; introduces generative segmentation; emphasizes text rendering and identity-preserving editing.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a scalable, efficient architecture achieving unified multimodal intelligence approaching AGI; sets new performance benchmarks and offers robust capabilities for generation and editing across modalities.

Abstract: We propose Ming-Flash-Omni, an upgraded version of Ming-Omni, built upon a
sparser Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variant of Ling-Flash-2.0 with 100 billion
total parameters, of which only 6.1 billion are active per token. This

Compared to its predecessor, the upgraded version exhibits substantial
improvements across multimodal understanding and generation. We significantly
advance speech recognition capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance
in contextual ASR and highly competitive results in dialect-aware ASR. In image
generation, Ming-Flash-Omni introduces high-fidelity text rendering and
demonstrates marked gains in scene consistency and identity preservation during
image editing. Furthermore, Ming-Flash-Omni introduces generative segmentation,
a capability that not only achieves strong standalone segmentation performance
but also enhances spatial control in image generation and improves editing
consistency. Notably, Ming-Flash-Omni achieves state-of-the-art results in
text-to-image generation and generative segmentation, and sets new records on
all 12 contextual ASR benchmarks, all within a single unified architecture.

### [18] [MCIHN: A Hybrid Network Model Based on Multi-path Cross-modal Interaction for Multimodal Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24827)
*Haoyang Zhang,Zhou Yang,Ke Sun,Yucai Pang,Guoliang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal emotion recognition framework (MCIHN) uses modality-specific adversarial autoencoders, a cross-modal gate mechanism to align modalities and capture inter-modal interactions, followed by a feature fusion stage, achieving state-of-the-art results on SIMS and MOSI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-modal discrepancies and weak unimodal representations hinder performance; there is a need to jointly learn discriminative features per modality and effectively model interactions across modalities for emotion recognition.

Method: 1) Build an adversarial autoencoder for each modality to learn discriminative emotional features and reconstruct inputs. 2) Feed latent codes from each modality into a Cross-modal Gate Mechanism (CGMM) to reduce modality gaps and model interactions, producing interaction features. 3) Fuse features via a Feature Fusion Module (FFM) for final multimodal emotion recognition. 4) Train/evaluate on SIMS and MOSI datasets.

Result: The proposed MCIHN achieves superior performance on SIMS and MOSI datasets compared with baselines.

Conclusion: A hybrid network that combines modality-specific discriminative representation learning with cross-modal interaction modeling and a dedicated fusion stage effectively improves multimodal emotion recognition.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition is crucial for future human-computer
interaction. However, accurate emotion recognition still faces significant
challenges due to differences between different modalities and the difficulty
of characterizing unimodal emotional information. To solve these problems, a
hybrid network model based on multipath cross-modal interaction (MCIHN) is
proposed. First, adversarial autoencoders (AAE) are constructed separately for
each modality. The AAE learns discriminative emotion features and reconstructs
the features through a decoder to obtain more discriminative information about
the emotion classes. Then, the latent codes from the AAE of different
modalities are fed into a predefined Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model (CGMM) to
reduce the discrepancy between modalities, establish the emotional relationship
between interacting modalities, and generate the interaction features between
different modalities. Multimodal fusion using the Feature Fusion module (FFM)
for better emotion recognition. Experiments were conducted on publicly
available SIMS and MOSI datasets, demonstrating that MCIHN achieves superior
performance.

*Anne Gagneux,Ségolène Martin,Rémi Gribonval,Mathurin Massias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A study reframes flow matching through a denoising lens, linking flow models to denoisers to probe generation dynamics via principled perturbations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-based generation quality factors are not well understood; a denoising framework enables empirical probing, comparison, and principled perturbations.

Method: Establish formal connections between flow matching models and denoisers; design controlled perturbations (noise and drift); create a framework to compare generation and denoising performance; analyze generation dynamics.

Result: Identifies distinct dynamical phases of the generative process; precisely characterizes when denoisers succeed or fail during generation; explains why this affects sample quality and how perturbations reveal it.

Conclusion: A principled empirical framework to analyze and influence flow-matching generation via denoising; insights can guide better model design and sampling strategies by targeting specific phases of the generation process.

Abstract: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success, yet the factors influencing
the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood. In this work,
we adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe
the generation process. Laying down the formal connections between flow
matching models and denoisers, we provide a common ground to compare their
performances on generation and denoising. This enables the design of principled
and controlled perturbations to influence sample generation: noise and drift.
This leads to new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative
process, enabling us to precisely characterize at which stage of the generative
process denoisers succeed or fail and why this matters.

### [20] [FruitProm: Probabilistic Maturity Estimation and Detection of Fruits and Vegetables](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24885)
*Sidharth Rai,Rahul Harsha Cheppally,Benjamin Vail,Keziban Yalçın Dokumacı,Ajay Sharda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reframe fruit maturity estimation as a continuous probabilistic task by adding a probabilistic head to RT-DETRv2, predicting both the mean maturity and its uncertainty per detected fruit, enabling uncertainty-aware decisions like selective harvesting while maintaining strong detection performance (mAP 85.6%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maturity is biologically continuous, but current methods cast it as discrete classes (unripe/ripe/overripe), causing information loss and ambiguous boundaries. Moreover, robotics requires uncertainty estimates for reliable decision-making.

Method: Integrate a dedicated probabilistic head into the RT-DETRv2 detector to output a continuous distribution over maturity for each detected fruit. The head jointly learns the mean maturity state and its uncertainty, providing a probabilistic maturity score rather than a single class label.

Result: Achieves mAP of 85.6% on a large-scale fruit dataset. Experiments show the probabilistic approach yields more granular and accurate maturity assessments than classification-based methods, with uncertainty enabling better downstream robotics decisions.

Conclusion: A probabilistic, continuous formulation for fruit maturity conquers the limitations of discrete labels and paves the way for uncertainty-aware, autonomous agricultural systems that can make more informed harvesting decisions while preserving detection performance.

Abstract: Maturity estimation of fruits and vegetables is a critical task for
agricultural automation, directly impacting yield prediction and robotic
harvesting. Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a
discrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid
formulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the
biological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class
boundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity
estimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel
architectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector,
RT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the
model to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each
detected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its
associated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream
decision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like
selective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more
biologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains
exceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of
85.6\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our probabilistic approach offers more granular and
accurate maturity assessments than its classification-based counterparts,
paving the way for more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems in
modern agriculture

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Subset landmark selection with a lightweight detector (MediaPipe) can match or surpass state-of-the-art isolated LIBRAS sign recognition while running >5x faster than the 2024 OpenPose-based method; spline-based imputation mitigates missing landmarks and boosts accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To make isolated sign recognition for LIBRAS practical for real-time applications by reducing computational load without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Replace OpenPose with lightweight MediaPipe; investigate landmark subset selection strategies; apply spline-based imputation for missing landmarks; compare against Alves et al. (2024).

Result: A carefully chosen landmark subset achieves comparable or superior recognition performance to state-of-the-art while significantly reducing processing time (>5x vs. Alves et al. 2024). Imputation via splines mitigates missing landmark issues and yields substantial accuracy gains.

Conclusion: Efficient and accurate isolated LIBRAS sign recognition is feasible with proper landmark selection and simple imputation, enabling scalable sign language recognition systems.

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of using lightweight body landmark
detection for the recognition of isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language
(LIBRAS). Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled
substantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for
landmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation,
we observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe,
while improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome
this limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at
optimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper
landmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al.
(2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based
imputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to
substantial accuracy gains. These findings highlight that careful landmark
selection, combined with simple imputation techniques, enables efficient and
accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language
Recognition systems.

TL;DR: A lightweight vehicle-detection module using background subtraction via temporal averaging and DBSCAN clustering within a three-part traffic-optimization framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address urban traffic congestion with a practical, scalable detection method that requires minimal infrastructure changes.

Method: Compute a background image by averaging across frames, subtract to obtain foreground, then apply DBSCAN to cluster foreground pixels into individual vehicles; this vehicle-detection component sits within a broader framework for traffic management.

Result: Claims computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure modification, offering a practical and scalable solution for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: This first component demonstrates viability of vehicle detection and can underpin the larger framework for traffic prediction and signal optimization in real-world urban settings.

Abstract: Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban
cities, resulting in increasing delays and inefficiencies within urban
transportation systems. To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is
designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is
structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic
prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first
component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple
sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the
underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed
background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based
Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to
detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure
modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and
scalable solution for real-world deployment.

*Qiucheng Wu,Handong Zhao,Zhixin Shu,Jing Shi,Yang Zhang,Shiyu Chang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VividCam trains diffusion models to learn complex camera motions from synthetic videos, reducing reliance on real data and using disentanglement to separate motion from appearance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unconventional camera motions are hard to generalize; there is a scarcity of training videos with these motions, leading to poor generalization and domain shift between synthetic and real data.

Method: VividCam uses disentanglement strategies to isolate camera motion learning from synthetic appearance artifacts, training on synthetic data (often low-poly 3D scenes rendered in Unity) to synthesize a wide range of precisely controlled camera motions.

Result: Demonstrates the ability to synthesize a wide range of complex, precisely controlled camera motions using simple synthetic data; results are showcased via a demo page.

Conclusion: Synthetic data can enable diffusion models to learn complex camera motions with robustness to domain shift and reduced dependence on real video collections, enabling more original and artistic video generation.

Abstract: Although recent text-to-video generative models are getting more capable of
following external camera controls, imposed by either text descriptions or
camera trajectories, they still struggle to generalize to unconventional camera
motions, which is crucial in creating truly original and artistic videos. The
challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the
intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose
VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex
camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting
realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement
strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance
artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain
shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely
controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data.
Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a
low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity. Our
video results can be found in https://wuqiuche.github.io/VividCamDemoPage/ .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A probing framework to visualize and interpret 3D representations inside multi-view transformers (e.g., DUSt3R) by analyzing residual connections across layers. It traces the evolution of latent state, examines the role of individual layers, and contrasts with models that embed explicit global pose, showing correspondences that align with reconstructed geometry. Code is released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-view transformers are powerful but largely black-box, hindering understanding, safety, and further improvements beyond data scaling. Understanding how latent 3D representations form and how layers contribute can guide design and trustworthy deployment.

Method: Probe the residual connections of multi-view transformer layers to extract and visualize 3D representations. Analyze a DUSt3R variant to track latent state development across blocks, assess layer roles, and compare to methods with stronger inductive biases (explicit global pose). Validate that estimated correspondences align with reconstructed geometry.

Result: The analysis illuminates how the latent state evolves through blocks, clarifies each layer's contribution, and highlights differences from pose-based approaches. It shows that correspondences are refined in tandem with reconstructed geometry, providing interpretability for the model’s 3D reasoning. The authors also provide code for reproducibility.

Conclusion: The work advances interpretability of multi-view transformers for 3D vision, offering insights beyond data scaling and paving the way for safer, more reliable use in critical applications; it links learned correspondences to geometric reconstruction.

Abstract: Multi-view transformers such as DUSt3R are revolutionizing 3D vision by
solving 3D tasks in a feed-forward manner. However, contrary to previous
optimization-based pipelines, the inner mechanisms of multi-view transformers
are unclear. Their black-box nature makes further improvements beyond data
scaling challenging and complicates usage in safety- and reliability-critical
applications. Here, we present an approach for probing and visualizing 3D
representations from the residual connections of the multi-view transformers'
layers. In this manner, we investigate a variant of the DUSt3R model, shedding
light on the development of its latent state across blocks, the role of the
individual layers, and suggest how it differs from methods with stronger
inductive biases of explicit global pose. Finally, we show that the
investigated variant of DUSt3R estimates correspondences that are refined with
reconstructed geometry. The code used for the analysis is available at

### [25] [Modality-Aware SAM: Sharpness-Aware-Minimization Driven Gradient Modulation for Harmonized Multimodal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24919)
*Hossein R. Nowdeh,Jie Ji,Xiaolong Ma,Fatemeh Afghah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-SAM is a model-agnostic framework for multimodal learning that identifies a dominant modality via Shapley contributions, modulates the loss to emphasize robustness of that modality, and updates weights with modulated gradients to balance and enhance all modalities, improving generalization across early and late fusion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities can suppress others, hindering generalization. A modality-aware optimization that dynamically prioritizes robustness while still leveraging complementary information can lead to better overall performance.

Method: Iterative three-step process: (1) identify the dominant modality using Shapley-based contributions to accuracy; (2) decompose/modulate the loss landscape to prioritize robustness of the dominant modality; (3) update model weights via backpropagation of modulated gradients, encouraging exploration of complementary features while stabilizing the dominant modality.

Result: Experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM surpasses state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods, achieving better balance among modalities and improved multimodal learning performance.

Conclusion: M-SAM is a versatile, model-agnostic framework that effectively mitigates modality dominance, promotes balanced multimodal contributions, and enhances generalization in both early and late fusion settings.

Abstract: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting
generalization. We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM),
a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early
and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes
learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on
modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it
decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss
to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality,
and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated
gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while
enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit
complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive
experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest
state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods and
significantly balances and improves multimodal learning.

TL;DR: Hybrid IBIS model (Inception-BiLSTM + SVM) proposed to curb overfitting in Wi-Fi sensing; applied to Doppler-derived data, achieving ~99% movement recognition with strong metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wi-Fi sensing enables low-cost, non-intrusive environmental data collection, but overfitting hinders generalization across data/contexts; need a robust classifier and boundary in this domain.

Method: A hybrid architecture (IBIS) that combines Inception-based feature extraction, BiLSTM for temporal modeling, and an SVM classifier. Applied to Doppler-derived data for movement recognition.

Result: Movement recognition accuracy reported at approximately 99%; supported by comprehensive performance metrics and confusion matrices indicating robust effectiveness.

Conclusion: IBIS demonstrates improved generalization and robust classification boundaries for Wi-Fi sensing tasks; promising for healthcare, occupancy analysis, and gesture-based IoT, though further validation across varied environments and datasets is advisable.

Abstract: The increasing interest in Wi-Fi sensing stems from its potential to capture
environmental data in a low-cost, non-intrusive way, making it ideal for
applications like healthcare, space occupancy analysis, and gesture-based IoT
control. However, a major limitation in this field is the common problem of
overfitting, where models perform well on training data but fail to generalize
to new data. To overcome this, we introduce a novel hybrid architecture that
integrates Inception-BiLSTM with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we refer
to as IBIS. Our IBIS approach is uniquely engineered to improve model
generalization and create more robust classification boundaries. By applying
this method to Doppler-derived data, we achieve a movement recognition accuracy
of nearly 99%. Comprehensive performance metrics and confusion matrices confirm
the significant effectiveness of our proposed solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pressure ulcers require accurate, consistent staging across clinicians, but visual subtleties and subjective interpretation cause variability. Existing CNN/ViT approaches lack interpretability. A multimodal, fine-tuned LLM with reflective reasoning could improve accuracy and provide clinically grounded explanations.

Method: FT-ARM is fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B and employs multimodal inputs (visual features + encoded clinical knowledge from text). It uses an agentic self-reflection mechanism to iteratively reason over data and refine predictions, designed for live inference. It yields natural-language explanations alongside staging outputs.

Result: On the PIID dataset, FT-ARM achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I–IV, outperforming prior CNN-based models by approximately +4%.

Conclusion: Integrating fine-tuning with reflective, multimodal reasoning enhances reliability, interpretability, and clinical applicability of automated wound assessment, addressing the need for consistent and explainable PU staging for better patient care.

Abstract: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern.
Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper
treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and
subjective interpretation, leading to variability among clinicians. Prior
AI-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision
Transformers (ViTs) achieved promising accuracy but offered limited
interpretability. We present FT-ARM (Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal
model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic
self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired
by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its
predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge
from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available
Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B,
achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based
models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline
evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting
real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded
natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By
integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs,
FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of
automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent
and explainable PU staging to support improved patient care.

*Zahra Ebrahimi Vargoorani,Amir Mohammad Ghoreyshi,Ching Yee Suen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep-learning ALPR approach using YOLOv8 with semi-supervised data labeling via Grounding DINO achieves high recall on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ALPR performance is hindered by environmental factors, high speeds, varied angles, and low-quality images; scalable labeling is desirable.

Method: Detects license plates with YOLOv8 for detection and recognition; uses semi-supervised training with a small set of labeled data and pseudo-labels produced by Grounding DINO; dataset includes Ontario, Quebec, California, New York; reports character error rates.

Result: Recall: 94% on CENPARMI dataset; 91% on UFPR-ALPR dataset; character error rates reported; demonstrates data-efficient training and improved performance.

Conclusion: Semi-supervised ground-truthing with vision-language models can scale ALPR datasets while maintaining label quality and improving detection/recognition performance; applicable to traffic control, tolls, and law enforcement.

Abstract: Developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system
(ALPR) is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting, rain, and
dust. Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera
angles, and low-quality or low-resolution images. ALPR is vital in traffic
control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement
applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for
license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the
performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and
New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset
from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and
91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised
learning framework, combining a small set of manually labeled data with
pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model.
Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many
images with bounding boxes for license plates, thereby minimizing the reliance
on labor-intensive manual labeling. By integrating human-verified and
model-generated annotations, we can scale our dataset efficiently while
maintaining label quality, which significantly enhances the training process
and overall model performance. Furthermore, it reports character error rates
for both datasets, providing additional insight into system performance.

TL;DR: A novel multi-modal CAD framework that fuses high-resolution mammographic visuals with structured textual descriptors from clinical metadata and synthetic radiology reports, using tokenization to align modalities, and outperforming vision transformer baselines on multinational data for cancer detection and calcification identification, enabling clinically viable deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAD systems often underperform in real-world settings due to fragmented data modalities and the need for prior clinical history. Integrating imaging with contextual textual information aims to improve accuracy, generalizability, and practical deployment across diverse populations.

Method: Extract visual features from high-resolution 2D mammograms using CNNs; derive textual descriptors from clinical metadata and synthesized radiology reports via tokenization modules; fuse visual and textual embeddings through a multimodal fusion strategy; compare ConvNet-based architectures with vision transformers; evaluate on multinational screening datasets.

Result: The multi-modal approach achieves superior performance in cancer detection and calcification identification compared with unimodal baselines; shows improvements across diverse populations and supports practical deployment with high-resolution imagery.

Conclusion: Proposes a clinically viable VLM-based CAD paradigm that effectively leverages imaging data and contextual patient information through robust fusion mechanisms, potentially generalizing to other radiology tasks and settings.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women in
the developed world. Early detection through mammography screening plays a
pivotal role in reducing mortality rates. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
systems have shown promise in assisting radiologists, existing approaches face
critical limitations in clinical deployment - particularly in handling the
nuanced interpretation of multi-modal data and feasibility due to the
requirement of prior clinical history. This study introduces a novel framework
that synergistically combines visual features from 2D mammograms with
structured textual descriptors derived from easily accessible clinical metadata
and synthesized radiological reports through innovative tokenization modules.
Our proposed methods in this study demonstrate that strategic integration of
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with language representations achieves
superior performance to vision transformer-based models while handling
high-resolution images and enabling practical deployment across diverse
populations. By evaluating it on multi-national cohort screening mammograms,
our multi-modal approach achieves superior performance in cancer detection and
calcification identification compared to unimodal baselines, with particular
improvements. The proposed method establishes a new paradigm for developing
clinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data
and contextual patient information through effective fusion mechanisms.

*Zongxi Yu,Xiaolong Qian,Shaohua Gao,Qi Jiang,Yao Gao,Kailun Yang,Kaiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bio-inspired, all-spherical monocentric lens with co-designed BMI framework yields high-fidelity RGBD from a single capture, using depth-encoded PSFs and joint reconstruction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of compact optics (RGB sharpness and chromatic aberrations) and the ill-posedness of monocular depth estimation, by integrating bio-inspired optics with a joint reconstruction network, avoiding complex diffractive/freeform elements.

Method: Design a bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens and a co-designed forward model. Generate a synthetic dataset via physically-based optical degradation. Develop a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction network with a shared encoder to recover an all-in-focus RGB image and a depth map from a single coded capture.

Result: State-of-the-art performance: Abs Rel 0.026, RMSE 0.130 for depth; SSIM 0.960, LPIPS 0.082 for image quality, outperforming software-only and deep-optics baselines.

Conclusion: Integrating bio-inspired fully spherical optics with a joint reconstruction algorithm is an effective strategy for high-performance, compact RGBD imaging; source code to be released.

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:
conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire
depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an
ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with
elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication
complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,
we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around
which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic
co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying
Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform
elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a
synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This
simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction
network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity
All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.
Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed
framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an
RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and
other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM
of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior
balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that
the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint
reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the
intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging. Source code will
be publicly available at https://github.com/ZongxiYu-ZJU/BMI.

*Yusen Peng,Sachin Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRIP introduces a dynamic pooling strategy that merges visual tokens in deeper transformer layers to reduce FLOPs during vision-language model pretraining/inference, while preserving accuracy (ImageNet/zero-shot) and enabling cross-domain continual pretraining (biology).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language pretraining is extremely compute-intensive; reducing training/inference cost without sacrificing performance would broaden accessibility and enable broader domain applications (e.g., biology).

Method: Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP): adaptively merges tokens in deeper layers of the visual encoder based on the input image, reducing token count and computation while maintaining interpretability.

Result: DRIP achieves significant GFLOP reduction with comparable classification/zero-shot performance on ImageNet-from-scratch and CLIP pretraining; demonstrated via continual pretraining on a large biology dataset.

Conclusion: DRIP provides an effective efficiency improvement for vision-language models, enabling cost-effective pretraining and transfer to scientific domains without substantial performance loss.

Abstract: Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive
pretraining and instruction tuning, have greatly pushed the frontier of
multimodal AI. However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive
pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting
to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose
Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the
input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual
encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP
contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while
maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further
validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large
biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A monocular underwater depth estimator SPADE combines relative depth with sparse depth priors to produce dense metric depth maps; it uses a two-stage process and Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks, achieving >15 FPS on embedded hardware and better accuracy/generalization than baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater inspection faces harsh conditions where human divers or ROVs struggle with perception, especially in turbid water and around complex structures; improving spatial awareness enables safer autonomous operation.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) scale a pre-trained relative depth map using sparse depth points to obtain a dense metric depth guess; (2) refine with Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks to produce accurate metric depth; designed for embedded hardware with real-time performance.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy and generalization; efficient on embedded hardware; suitable for practical underwater inspection and intervention.

Conclusion: SPADE advances monocular underwater depth estimation toward reliable autonomous inspection; submission to IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering Special Issue of AUV 2026.

Abstract: Underwater infrastructure requires frequent inspection and maintenance due to
harsh marine conditions. Current reliance on human divers or remotely operated
vehicles is limited by perceptual and operational challenges, especially around
complex structures or in turbid water. Enhancing the spatial awareness of
underwater vehicles is key to reducing piloting risks and enabling greater
autonomy. To address these challenges, we present SPADE: SParsity Adaptive
Depth Estimator, a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines
pre-trained relative depth estimator with sparse depth priors to produce dense,
metric scale depth maps. Our two-stage approach first scales the relative depth
map with the sparse depth points, then refines the final metric prediction with
our proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks. Our approach achieves
improved accuracy and generalisation over state-of-the-art baselines and runs
efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware, promising to support practical
underwater inspection and intervention. This work has been submitted to IEEE
Journal of Oceanic Engineering Special Issue of AUV 2026.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot scene understanding in real-world, cluttered environments is challenging due to unseen objects and contexts; leveraging natural language grounding can bridge the semantic gap between vision and actions.

Method: Embed visual inputs and textual prompts into a shared multimodal space using pre-trained visual encoders and LLMs; apply multimodal fusion and reasoning layers for contextual interpretation; train and evaluate on Visual Genome, COCO, ADE20K and custom real-world data.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot models in object recognition, activity detection, and scene captioning; up to 18% improvement in top-1 accuracy; gains in semantic coherence metrics.

Conclusion: Cross-modal alignment and language grounding enhance zero-shot scene understanding in real-world settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of vision-language integration for generalizable scene comprehension.

Abstract: Zero-shot scene understanding in real-world settings presents major
challenges due to the complexity and variability of natural scenes, where
models must recognize new objects, actions, and contexts without prior labeled
examples. This work proposes a vision-language integration framework that
unifies pre-trained visual encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) and large language models
(e.g., GPT-based architectures) to achieve semantic alignment between visual
and textual modalities. The goal is to enable robust zero-shot comprehension of
scenes by leveraging natural language as a bridge to generalize over unseen
categories and contexts. Our approach develops a unified model that embeds
visual inputs and textual prompts into a shared space, followed by multimodal
fusion and reasoning layers for contextual interpretation. Experiments on
Visual Genome, COCO, ADE20K, and custom real-world datasets demonstrate
significant gains over state-of-the-art zero-shot models in object recognition,
activity detection, and scene captioning. The proposed system achieves up to
18% improvement in top-1 accuracy and notable gains in semantic coherence
metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of cross-modal alignment and language
grounding in enhancing generalization for real-world scene understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Neighborhood Feature Pooling (NFP), a lightweight texture feature pooling layer for remote sensing image classification that can be plugged into any CNN and yields consistent accuracy gains with minimal parameter overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

### [36] [PSTF-AttControl: Per-Subject-Tuning-Free Personalized Image Generation with Controllable Face Attributes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25084)
*Xiang liu,Zhaoxiang Liu,Huan Hu,Zipeng Wang,Ping Chen,Zezhou Chen,Kai Wang,Shiguo Lian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A PSTF method for precise control over facial attributes with strong identity preservation, using identity features mapped to StyleGAN2 W+ and a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module to integrate identity, attributes, and text; no per-subject fine-tuning, FFHQ-trained, public code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current PSTF methods struggle to balance precise facial-attribute control with faithful identity preservation, while tuning-based methods offer control but require extra data and complexity. There is a need for accessible, fine-grained control without per-subject fine-tuning.

Method: Extract identity features via a face recognition model and map them into StyleGAN2's W+ latent space using the e4e encoder. Introduce a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module that fuses identity features, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet of the generator, ensuring a clean separation of identity and attributes. Train on FFHQ without per-identity fine-tuning or extra identity data.

Result: The method achieves high-fidelity identity preservation while enabling fine-grained control over facial attributes in PSTF settings. It does not require additional fine-tuning or identity-specific training data, and demonstrates practical personalization with precise attribute manipulation. Code is publicly available.

Conclusion: The work delivers a PSTF framework that reconciles precise facial-attribute control with strong identity preservation in a single-pass, non-finetuned pipeline, increasing accessibility and efficiency for personalized facial image synthesis.

Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized image generation have significantly
improved facial identity preservation, particularly in fields such as
entertainment and social media. However, existing methods still struggle to
achieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free
(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by
providing fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require
extensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their
accessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling
image generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over
facial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that
enables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity
preservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model
to extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$
latent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model
with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial
identity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture,
ensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the
FFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with
fine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional
fine-tuning or training data for individual identities. We demonstrate that our
approach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute
control, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality,
adaptable facial image synthesis. The code is publicly available at

### [37] [Visual Diversity and Region-aware Prompt Learning for Zero-shot HOI Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25094)
*Chanhyeong Yang,Taehoon Song,Jihwan Park,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes VDRP: Visual Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning for zero-shot HOI detection using CLIP, addressing intra-class visual diversity and inter-class entanglement with group-wise variance, Gaussian perturbations, and region-specific concepts; achieves state-of-the-art on HICO-DET.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection suffers from intra-class visual diversity (same verb in varied poses/contexts) and inter-class visual entanglement (different verbs appearing visually similar). Current CLIP-based prompts struggle to capture these complexities.

Method: 1) Visual diversity-aware prompt learning that injects group-wise visual variance into the context embedding, enhanced by Gaussian perturbation to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. 2) Retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions to augment prompts, forming region-aware prompts that improve verb-level discrimination.

Result: On the HICO-DET benchmark, the method achieves state-of-the-art performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement.

Conclusion: VDRP demonstrates that modeling visual diversity and region-specific information within prompts can significantly improve zero-shot HOI detection, with code released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and
objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific
verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising
results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as
CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared
embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual
complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where
instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2)
inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar
patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual
Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual
diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual
variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to
encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second,
we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions.
These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding
region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the
HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing
both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Atlanta-world guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting to achieve globally consistent, high-detail indoor/urban 3D reconstruction with semantic guidance and learnable plane regularization, outperforming current methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global inconsistency in low-texture areas and inefficiencies/discontinuities in Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDFs hinder high-quality indoor/urban reconstruction; need smooth, efficient representation that preserves high-frequency details.

Method: Introduce Atlanta-world guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting (GS) with semantic GS representation to predict semantic region probabilities and structure-plane regularization using learnable plane indicators to enforce global surface accuracy; leverages Atlanta-world to handle low-texture regions.

Result: Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance in indoor and urban scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: The proposed framework achieves smooth surfaces without sacrificing detail and rendering efficiency, benefiting large-scale, texture-diverse environments.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research
topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors
for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack
global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often
suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting
in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world
guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and
urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and
rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the
accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed
novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without
sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a
semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions
and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for
global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban
scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

### [39] [Region-CAM: Towards Accurate Object Regions in Class Activation Maps for Weakly Supervised Learning Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25134)
*Qingdong Cai,Charith Abhayaratne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Region-CAM is a new activation method that expands and sharpens CAMs by extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and propagating semantic information (SIP) across classifier stages, yielding more complete, boundary-aligned activation maps for weakly supervised tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional CAM highlights only the most discriminative regions, often missing object extent and misaligning with boundaries, which hurts weakly supervised semantic segmentation and localization.

Method: Region-CAM generates activation maps by extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information propagation (SIP), considering both gradients and features at multiple stages of a baseline classification model, rather than relying on feature weighting alone.

Result: On PASCAL VOC: mIoU 60.12% (train) and 58.43% (val), improvements of 13.61 and 13.13 percentage points over CAM (46.51 and 45.30). On MS COCO val: 36.38% mIoU, +16.23 points over CAM (20.15). On ILSVRC2012 val: Top-1 Localization Loc1 51.7%, outperforming LayerCAM by 4.5%.

Conclusion: Region-CAM yields larger, more boundary-aligned activation maps, improving weakly supervised semantic segmentation and localization across standard benchmarks and outperforming existing CAM-based methods.

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely applied in weakly
supervised learning tasks due to their ability to highlight object regions.
However, conventional CAM methods highlight only the most discriminative
regions of the target. These highlighted regions often fail to cover the entire
object and are frequently misaligned with object boundaries, thereby limiting
the performance of downstream weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which demands pixel-wise
accurate activation maps to get the best results. To alleviate the above
problems, we propose a novel activation method, Region-CAM. Distinct from
network feature weighting approaches, Region-CAM generates activation maps by
extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information
propagation (SIP) by considering both gradients and features in each of the
stages of the baseline classification model. Our approach highlights a greater
proportion of object regions while ensuring activation maps to have precise
boundaries that align closely with object edges. Region-CAM achieves 60.12% and
58.43% mean intersection over union (mIoU) using the baseline model on the
PASCAL VOC training and validation datasets, respectively, which are
improvements of 13.61% and 13.13% over the original CAM (46.51% and 45.30%). On
the MS COCO validation set, Region-CAM achieves 36.38%, a 16.23% improvement
over the original CAM (20.15%). We also demonstrate the superiority of
Region-CAM in object localization tasks, using the ILSVRC2012 validation set.
Region-CAM achieves 51.7% in Top-1 Localization accuracy Loc1. Compared with
LayerCAM, an activation method designed for weakly supervised object
localization, Region-CAM achieves 4.5% better performance in Loc1.

Motivation: Data scarcity in specialized civil engineering domains limits object-detection performance; there is a need for data-efficient, high-performance detectors that can operate in field conditions.

Method: Integrate DINOv3 features at two points (P0 input preprocessing and P3 mid-backbone) within the YOLOv12 architecture. Conduct systematic ablations over five YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants, evaluate on Tunnel Segment Crack, Construction PPE, and KITTI datasets; report mAP@0.5 and FPS; compare DualP0P3 vs Triple Integration across scales.

Result: DINO-YOLO achieves notable gains: Tunnel Segment Crack (+12.4%), Construction PPE (+13.7%), KITTI (+88.6%), while maintaining real-time FPS (30-47). Medium-scale with DualP0P3 achieves 55.77% mAP@0.5; Small-scale with Triple Integration achieves 53.63%. Inference overhead is 2-4x (21-33 ms vs 8-16 ms baseline), acceptable for RTX 5090 deployment. State-of-the-art on civil-engineering datasets with <10K images.

Conclusion: DINO-YOLO demonstrates strong data efficiency and practical applicability for construction safety monitoring and infrastructure inspection in data-constrained environments, delivering state-of-the-art performance without prohibitive latency.

Abstract: Object detection in civil engineering applications is constrained by limited
annotated data in specialized domains. We introduce DINO-YOLO, a hybrid
architecture combining YOLOv12 with DINOv3 self-supervised vision transformers
for data-efficient detection. DINOv3 features are strategically integrated at
two locations: input preprocessing (P0) and mid-backbone enhancement (P3).
Experimental validation demonstrates substantial improvements: Tunnel Segment
Crack detection (648 images) achieves 12.4% improvement, Construction PPE (1K
images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while
maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five
YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures
achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while
Small-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead
(21-33ms versus 8-16ms baseline) remains acceptable for field deployment on
NVIDIA RTX 5090. DINO-YOLO establishes state-of-the-art performance for civil
engineering datasets (<10K images) while preserving computational efficiency,
providing practical solutions for construction safety monitoring and
infrastructure inspection in data-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dynamic, training-free detector for AI-generated images using Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound and editing-based perturbations (ReGap) to improve reconstruction-error separation, outperforming baselines and robust to post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of theoretical foundations in reconstruction-based detectors, the problem of non-interpretable, data-specific thresholds, and the limitations of static reconstruction error in distinguishing real vs generated images.

Method: Derive a Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a geometric perspective, showing real images off the reconstruction manifold incur a non-trivial error bound while generated images lie on the manifold with near-zero error. Identify shortcomings of single-pass static error methods and introduce ReGap, a training-free approach that uses structured editing operations to perturb images and measure dynamic changes in reconstruction error, enhancing error separation.

Result: ReGap outperforms existing baselines, demonstrates robustness to common post-processing, and generalizes across diverse conditions by leveraging dynamic error changes induced by edits rather than static reconstruction error.

Conclusion: The work provides a theoretical grounding for reconstruction-based detection and introduces a practical, training-free, editing-guided detector that achieves better accuracy and generalization by exploiting dynamic error responses.

Abstract: The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made detecting
AI-generated images a critical challenge for ensuring authenticity. Existing
reconstruction-based methods lack theoretical foundations and on empirical
heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this paper, we
introduce the Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a
geometric perspective, showing that real images off the reconstruction manifold
exhibit a non-trivial error lower bound, while generated images on the manifold
have near-zero error. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing
methods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass. These
methods often fail when some real images exhibit lower error than generated
ones. This counterintuitive behavior reduces detection accuracy and requires
data-specific threshold tuning, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReGap, a training-free
method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured
editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. This enables
measuring error changes before and after editing, improving detection accuracy
by enhancing error separation. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing
operations and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

*Xiaoyu Zhou,Jingqi Wang,Yuang Jia,Yongtao Wang,Deqing Sun,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EA3D is an online, open-world framework for joint 3D reconstruction and semantic understanding from streaming video, using vision-language and 2D encoders, online Gaussian feature maps, and a recurrent attention module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current 3D scene understanding relies on offline multi-view data or fixed 3D geometry, limiting open-world applicability. There is a need for online, integrated perception from streaming video.

Method: EA3D processes streaming frames with vision-language and 2D vision encoders to extract object-level knowledge, embeds this into an online Gaussian feature map, iteratively updates it by incorporating new observations, and estimates visual odometry from history. A recurrent joint optimization module directs attention to regions of interest, improving both geometry and semantics. Outputs include semantic/instance segmentation, 3D bounding boxes, semantic occupancy, mesh generation, and photo-realistic rendering capabilities.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in both geometric reconstruction and holistic scene understanding, enabling a unified framework suitable for a wide range of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: EA3D establishes a unified, online framework for joint 3D reconstruction and holistic scene understanding in open-world scenarios, integrating perception tasks into a single, efficient pipeline and broadening the range of downstream applications.

Abstract: Current 3D scene understanding methods are limited by offline-collected
multi-view data or pre-constructed 3D geometry. In this paper, we present
ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object
extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic
scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each
frame using vision-language and 2D vision foundation encoders to extract
object-level knowledge. This knowledge is integrated and embedded into a
Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then
iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally
update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint
optimization module directs the model's attention to regions of interest,
simultaneously enhancing both geometric reconstruction and semantic
understanding. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and tasks,
including photo-realistic rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D
bounding box and semantic occupancy estimation, and 3D mesh generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of EA3D. Our method establishes a unified and
efficient framework for joint online 3D reconstruction and holistic scene
understanding, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks.

*Gautam A. Viruthagiri,Arnuv Tandon,Gerald G. Fuller,Vinny Chandran Suja*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A vision transformer model for real-time, end-to-end reconstruction of tear-film thickness from interferograms, trained on mixed synthetic and experimental data, achieving robust performance on noisy, dynamic films with real-time inference on consumer hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Phase retrieval from thin-film interferometry is ill-posed due to phase ambiguity, noise, and artifacts, making real-time clinical deployment challenging. Existing methods are slow, fragile to noise, or require manual intervention.

Method: A vision transformer network processes isolated interferograms to regress thickness profiles in a single forward pass. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining physiologically relevant synthetic tear films and experimental tear film data, the model leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and produce temporally coherent thickness profiles for in vivo and ex vivo data.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly changing films with motion artifacts, outperforming conventional phase-unwrapping and iterative fitting methods, and delivers real-time inference on consumer hardware.

Conclusion: A data-driven, automated method enables consistent thickness reconstruction suitable for continuous, non-invasive monitoring of tear films and potential clinical diagnosis of dry eye disease; it paves the way for real-time translational use in ophthalmology.

Abstract: Thin film interferometry is a powerful technique for non-invasively measuring
liquid film thickness with applications in ophthalmology, but its clinical
translation is hindered by the challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles
from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase
periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction
methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require
manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To
address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for
real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from
isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining
physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model
leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and
reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass
from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with
motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and
iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated,
consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware,
opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear
films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN) for quantitatively constrained CAD sequence generation, unifying discrete commands and continuous parameters in a differentiable space and applying guided Bayesian flow to enforce constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generative CAD generation faces long-range constraint handling and parameter sensitivity. Existing models (e.g., diffusion) are often limited to single-modality or discrete spaces; a unified continuous, differentiable framework for multi-modal CAD sequences is lacking.

Method: TGBFN models multi-modality (discrete commands + continuous parameters) in a continuous parameter space, penetrates the parameter update kernel, and uses a guided Bayesian flow to control CAD properties. A new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation is constructed. Evaluations compare single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation tasks.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences across both single and multi-condition tasks; extensive comparisons demonstrate improvements; code is released.

Conclusion: TGBFN provides a unified, differentiable framework for constrained, multi-modal CAD generation by integrating discrete commands and continuous parameters with guided Bayesian updates, enabling scalable, constraint-aware CAD synthesis.

Abstract: Deep generative models, such as diffusion models, have shown promising
progress in image generation and audio generation via simplified continuity
assumptions. However, the development of generative modeling techniques for
generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags
behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter
sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively
constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN).
For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e.,
discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and
differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In
addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided
Bayesian flow to control the CAD properties. To evaluate TGBFN, we construct a
new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation. Extensive
comparisons across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation
tasks demonstrate that TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences. The code is available

quantitatively study the performance characteristics of 190 real-world vision

convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we provide insights into the factors that
influence the latency of ViT architectures on mobile devices. Based on these
insights, we develop a dataset including measured latencies of 1000 synthetic

from two machine learning frameworks and six mobile platforms. Using this
dataset, we show that inference latency of new ViTs can be predicted with
sufficient accuracy for real-world applications.

### [46] [$D^2GS$: Dense Depth Regularization for LiDAR-free Urban Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25173)
*Kejing Xia,Jidong Jia,Ke Jin,Yucai Bai,Li Sun,Dacheng Tao,Youjian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D^2GS: a LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework that uses dense depth priors, diffusion-based depth enhancement, and Gaussian splats to achieve geometry competitive with LiDAR-based methods, demonstrated on Waymo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the practical challenges of acquiring accurate LiDAR data (calibration, asynchrony, and spatial misalignment) by developing a dense, LiDAR-free geometric prior to enable high-quality scene reconstruction.

Method: 1) Initialize a dense point cloud by back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions; 2) progressively prune for global consistency; 3) jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted depth via a Depth Enhancer that uses diffusion priors from a depth foundation model to improve depth maps rendered by Gaussians; 4) constrain Gaussian shape and normals in road regions to improve ground geometry.

Result: On the Waymo dataset, D^2GS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves more accurate geometry than methods using ground-truth LiDAR data.

Conclusion: LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction is viable with dense depth priors, diffusion-based depth enhancement, and Gaussian geometry constraints, offering competitive performance to LiDAR-based approaches.

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene
reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene
reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,
\textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR
point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring
such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise
spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they
may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial
misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To
avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a
LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain
geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more
accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by
back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then
optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.
$\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense
metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors
from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.
In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during
Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground
geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within
road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more
accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

### [47] [Classifier Enhancement Using Extended Context and Domain Experts for Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25174)
*Huadong Tang,Youpeng Zhao,Min Xu,Jun Wang,Qiang Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) for semantic segmentation that dynamically tunes per-pixel predictions using dataset-level memory of class context and image-level local context via a teacher-student framework; reports state-of-the-art on ADE20K, COCO-Stuff10K, Pascal-Context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed global classifier parameters fail to adapt to per-image class distributions and dataset-level imbalances, biasing segmentation toward majority classes; dynamic context integration is needed to improve minority-class segmentation.

Method: ECAC uses a memory bank to store dataset-level class context and incorporates current image context to adapt the classifier. A teacher-student framework is employed, with the teacher adjusting context using ground-truths and transferring knowledge to the student.

Result: Shows state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets (ADE20K, COCO-Stuff10K, Pascal-Context).

Conclusion: Dynamic, context-aware classifier adjustment improves segmentation accuracy, effectively leveraging global and local context to mitigate class-imbalance biases.

Abstract: Prevalent semantic segmentation methods generally adopt a vanilla classifier
to categorize each pixel into specific classes.
  Although such a classifier learns global information from the training data,
this information is represented by a set of fixed parameters (weights and
biases).
  However, each image has a different class distribution, which prevents the
classifier from addressing the unique characteristics of individual images.
  At the dataset level, class imbalance leads to segmentation results being
biased towards majority classes, limiting the model's effectiveness in
identifying and segmenting minority class regions.
  In this paper, we propose an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that
dynamically adjusts the classifier using global (dataset-level) and local
(image-level) contextual information.
  Specifically, we leverage a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual
information of each class, incorporating the class-specific contextual
information from the current image to improve the classifier for precise pixel
labeling.
  Additionally, a teacher-student network paradigm is adopted, where the domain
expert (teacher network) dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground
truth and transfers knowledge to the student network.
  Comprehensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ECAC can achieve
state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including ADE20K,
COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A foundation-model-powered, source-free test-time adaptive object detector using a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher with IDM and two memory strategies to enable cross-domain and cross-category adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional TTAOD relies on source-domain statistics and shared category space, limiting real-world applicability and preventing open-set or cross-category adaptation. A foundation-model-powered, source-free approach is desired.

Method: Proposes a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for vision-language detector-driven TTAOD; jointly tunes text and visual prompts for language and vision spaces; introduces Test-time Warm-start for visual prompts; employs an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) storing high-quality pseudo-labels, with Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination strategies to leverage IDM content and generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples; operates in a parameter-efficient, test-time fashion.

Result: Extensive experiments on cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks show the method consistently outperforms prior SOTA methods and adapts to arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category targets; code released.

Conclusion: First foundation-model-powered, source-free TTAOD approach that robustly handles cross-domain and cross-category data, offering efficient prompt-tuning and memory-based pseudo-labeling for reliable online domain adaptation.

Abstract: In recent years, test-time adaptive object detection has attracted increasing
attention due to its unique advantages in online domain adaptation, which
aligns more closely with real-world application scenarios. However, existing
approaches heavily rely on source-derived statistical characteristics while
making the strong assumption that the source and target domains share an
identical category space. In this paper, we propose the first foundation
model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates the
need for source data entirely and overcomes traditional closed-set limitations.
Specifically, we design a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for
vision-language detector-driven test-time adaptation, which incorporates text
and visual prompt tuning to adapt both language and vision representation
spaces on the test data in a parameter-efficient manner. Correspondingly, we
propose a Test-time Warm-start strategy tailored for the visual prompts to
effectively preserve the representation capability of the vision branch.
Furthermore, to guarantee high-quality pseudo-labels in every test batch, we
maintain an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) module that stores high-quality
pseudo-labels from previous test samples, and propose two novel
strategies-Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination-to leverage IDM's
high-quality instances for enhancing original predictions and hallucinating
images without available pseudo-labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on
cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and can adapt to
arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data. Code is available at

Motivation: Secure, scalable authentication for online education in a digitized, AI-driven landscape intensified by the Covid-19 shift to e-learning; ensure trust and integrity in virtual classrooms.

Method: Face detection with YOLOv5 on frames from students' open online cameras; pass detected faces to a residual network to extract deep facial features; identify individuals by comparing Euclidean distances to enrolled face representations.

Result: No empirical results reported in the abstract; the work presents a proposed framework/prototype rather than experimental outcomes.

Conclusion: If effective, the approach could bolster authenticity and stability of online education; however, it implicates privacy and consent considerations given facial data collection.

Abstract: In the contemporary landscape, the fusion of information technology and the
rapid advancement of artificial intelligence have ushered school education into
a transformative phase characterized by digitization and heightened
intelligence. Concurrently, the global paradigm shift caused by the Covid-19
pandemic has catalyzed the evolution of e-learning, accentuating its
significance. Amidst these developments, one pivotal facet of the online
education paradigm that warrants attention is the authentication of identities
within the digital learning sphere. Within this context, our study delves into
a solution for online learning authentication, utilizing an enhanced
convolutional neural network architecture, specifically the residual network
model. By harnessing the power of deep learning, this technological approach
aims to galvanize the ongoing progress of online education, while concurrently
bolstering its security and stability. Such fortification is imperative in
enabling online education to seamlessly align with the swift evolution of the
educational landscape. This paper's focal proposition involves the deployment
of the YOLOv5 network, meticulously trained on our proprietary dataset. This
network is tasked with identifying individuals' faces culled from images
captured by students' open online cameras. The resultant facial information is
then channeled into the residual network to extract intricate features at a
deeper level. Subsequently, a comparative analysis of Euclidean distances
against students' face databases is performed, effectively ascertaining the
identity of each student.

are often costly, invasive, and inaccessible in low-resource regions. This
paper presents a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic framework
integrating image analysis, thermal imaging, and audio signal processing for

*Junsheng Zhou,Xingyu Shi,Haichuan Song,Yi Fang,Yu-Shen Liu,Zhizhong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised point cloud denoising via Consistency-Aware Noise2Noise matching (U-CAN): the model learns a multi-step denoising path per point using a noise-to-noise loss and a geometry-consistency constraint, enabling unsupervised denoising that generalizes to 2D and achieves strong results on denoising, upsampling, and image denoising benchmarks, approaching supervised performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Point clouds from scans are noisy, which harms downstream tasks. Creating noisy-clean pairs for supervised denoising is labor-intensive. There is a need for an unsupervised framework that can learn denoising priors without paired data.

Method: Introduce U-CAN, an unsupervised framework that infers a multi-step denoising path for each point via noise-to-noise (N2N) matching. A novel loss enables statistical reasoning over multiple noisy observations to train a network without clean targets. A geometry-consistency constraint enforces consistent denoising patterns. The approach is argued to generalize beyond 3D to 2D.

Result: Significant improvements over state-of-the-art unsupervised denoising methods on point cloud denoising, upsampling, and image denoising benchmarks. U-CAN achieves results comparable to supervised methods.

Conclusion: U-CAN provides a general and practical unsupervised denoising framework for point clouds, with a consistency-aware N2N loss and geometry-consistency constraint, that can scale to 2D and deliver competitive performance against supervised approaches.

Abstract: Point clouds captured by scanning sensors are often perturbed by noise, which
have a highly negative impact on downstream tasks (e.g. surface reconstruction
and shape understanding). Previous works mostly focus on training neural
networks with noisy-clean point cloud pairs for learning denoising priors,
which requires extensively manual efforts. In this work, we introduce U-CAN, an
Unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising with Consistency-Aware
Noise2Noise matching. Specifically, we leverage a neural network to infer a
multi-step denoising path for each point of a shape or scene with a noise to
noise matching scheme. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables
statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations. We further
introduce a novel constraint on the denoised geometry consistency for learning
consistency-aware denoising patterns. We justify that the proposed constraint
is a general term which is not limited to 3D domain and can also contribute to
the area of 2D image denoising. Our evaluations under the widely used
benchmarks in point cloud denoising, upsampling and image denoising show
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, where
U-CAN also produces comparable results with the supervised methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSF-Net advances photometric stereo by multi-stage feature extraction with selective update and fusion, achieving state-of-the-art surface normal estimation on DiLiGenT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing learning-based photometric stereo methods struggle to capture features across multiple stages and to promote interaction between them, causing redundant features and poor handling of fine details like wrinkles and edges.

Method: Propose MSF-Net for multi-stage feature extraction with a selective update strategy and a feature fusion module to improve interplay among features.

Result: On the DiLiGenT benchmark, MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in surface normal accuracy.

Conclusion: MSF-Net effectively enhances multi-stage information extraction and inter-feature interaction, yielding more accurate surface normals for complex details.

Abstract: Photometric stereo is a technique aimed at determining surface normals
through the utilization of shading cues derived from images taken under
different lighting conditions. However, existing learning-based approaches
often fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and do not
adequately promote interaction between these features. Consequently, these
models tend to extract redundant features, especially in areas with intricate
details such as wrinkles and edges. To tackle these issues, we propose MSF-Net,
a novel framework for extracting information at multiple stages, paired with
selective update strategy, aiming to extract high-quality feature information,
which is critical for accurate normal construction. Additionally, we have
developed a feature fusion module to improve the interplay among different
features. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that our proposed
MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the

*Quang-Khai Bui-Tran,Thanh-Huy Nguyen,Hoang-Thien Nguyen,Ba-Thinh Lam,Nguyen Lan Vi Vu,Phat K. Huynh,Ulas Bagci,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new SFDA method for medical image segmentation uses progressive easy-to-hard sample adaptation, denoised pseudo-labels, and patch-level mixing to improve target-domain performance under privacy constraints, achieving state-of-the-art Dice and ASSD scores.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image segmentation under privacy constraints requires domain adaptation without access to source data. Existing SFDA methods often treat all samples equally and are vulnerable to noisy supervision under domain shift, leading to suboptimal boundaries.

Method: 1) Split unlabeled target images into reliable/easy and unreliable/harder subsets using entropy-similarity analysis; 2) Refine pseudo-labels with Monte Carlo-based denoising masks to suppress unreliable pixels; 3) Perform intra- and inter-domain patch mixing between subsets to transfer reliable semantics while mitigating noise; training progressively aligns target distributions from easy to hard.

Result: On benchmark datasets, the proposed framework yields consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods, achieving more accurate boundary delineation and state-of-the-art Dice and ASSD metrics.

Conclusion: Progressive adaptation with denoised supervision is beneficial for robust medical image segmentation under domain shift, enabling better boundary accuracy and stability in SFDA settings under privacy constraints.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is emerging as a compelling solution for
medical image segmentation under privacy constraints, yet current approaches
often ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain
shift. We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and
Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First,
unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through
entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and
gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte
Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize
training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between
subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods,
delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art
Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive
adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.

### [54] [Balanced conic rectified flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25229)
*Kim Shin Seong,Mingi Kwon,Jaeseok Jeong,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The paper improves Rectified Flow by incorporating real images into training, reducing reliance on large generated datasets, and achieving better FID with straighter ODE paths and more robust learning on CIFAR-10.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rectified Flow learns smooth transport via ODEs but requires many generated image pairs and can be biased toward synthetic data. The work seeks to reduce data requirements and bias by leveraging real images in training.

Method: Preserve ODE paths for real images during training and train with a smaller mix of real and generated images, instead of relying solely on generated pairs; evaluate on CIFAR-10 showing improvements in one-step and full-step generation and smoother paths.

Result: Significant FID improvements on CIFAR-10 with far fewer generated pairs; straighter ODE paths; reduced saturation on generated images during reflow; better robustness while preserving real data distribution.

Conclusion: Incorporating real images into the reflow training mitigates data bias and lowers computational/data requirements, yielding more efficient, robust, and higher-quality generation with Rectified Flow.

Abstract: Rectified flow is a generative model that learns smooth transport mappings
between two distributions through an ordinary differential equation (ODE).
Unlike diffusion-based generative models, which require costly numerical
integration of a generative ODE to sample images with state-of-the-art quality,
rectified flow uses an iterative process called reflow to learn smooth and
straight ODE paths. This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation
of high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.
1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve
the target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since
the model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its
performance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become
biased towards the generated data.
  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original
rectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into
the training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method
effectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we
demonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much
smaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved
significantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in
full-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the
original method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids
saturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE
learning while preserving the distribution of real images.

*Yuxiang Mao,Zhijie Zhang,Zhiheng Zhang,Jiawei Liu,Chen Zeng,Shihong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a linear additive model to drive 3D talking-face animation with speech and emotion, learning decoupled blendshapes from two datasets to achieve expressive, lip-synced results and mapping to FLAME for avatars.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face data and the need to disentangle speech-driven lip-sync from emotional expression; leverage existing neutral and expressive datasets to jointly learn a compact, interpretable representation.

Method: Learn two sets of blendshapes: one driven by speech using a neutral 3D talking-face dataset (VOCAset) and one driven by emotion using a 3D expression dataset (Florence4D). Use a linear additive model with a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement while allowing some cross-domain deformations. Map the learned blendshapes to expression and jaw pose parameters of the FLAME model to animate 3D Gaussian avatars.

Result: Qualitative and quantitative experiments show the method naturally generates talking faces with specified expressions while preserving accurate lip synchronization. Perceptual studies indicate superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without sacrificing lip-sync quality.

Conclusion: A linear additive, sparsity-regularized blendshape decomposition can decouple speech and emotion for expressive 3D talking-face animation, enabling mapping to FLAME avatars and improving perceived expressivity under preserved lip-sync.

Abstract: Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid
advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial
animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in
speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally
expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the
scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of
data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech
and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset
with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences
(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and
emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement
between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture
inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The
learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose
parameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally
generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate
lip synchronization. Perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves
superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without
compromising lip-sync quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A DeepShield framework improves cross-domain deepfake detection by combining Local Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD) on a CLIP-ViT backbone, achieving better cross-dataset/manipulation robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfakes threaten misinformation; detectors often overfit to forgery-specific artifacts and fail to generalize to unseen manipulations. A model that balances local detail with global generalization is needed.

Method: Enhance the CLIP-ViT encoder with two components: Local Patch Guidance (LPG) incorporating spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture fine-grained inconsistencies; Global Forgery Diversification (GFD) introducing domain feature augmentation via domain-bridging and boundary-expanding feature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries and mitigate overfitting.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, demonstrating superior robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

Conclusion: Integrating local and global analysis improves generalization to unseen forgeries; LPG and GFD together provide enhanced robustness in deepfake detection.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have made it easier to manipulate
face videos, raising significant concerns about their potential misuse for
fraud and misinformation. Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain
scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to
their reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce
DeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local
sensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen
forgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components:
Local Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG
applies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture
fine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces
domain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding
feature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and
enhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and
global analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior
robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

Motivation: Standardized, large-scale datasets and robust models for video aesthetics are lacking. The temporal dynamics of video and multimodal fusion make it hard to transfer image-based methods to video aesthetics.

Method: Construct VADB: 10,490 diverse videos annotated by 37 professionals across multiple aesthetic dimensions, including overall and attribute-specific scores, rich language comments and objective tags. Propose VADB-Net, a dual-modal pre-training framework with a two-stage training strategy for enhanced scoring and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: The work provides the largest standardized dataset and a strong baseline method for video aesthetics, enabling broader research and application; public release of dataset and code encourages standardization and reproducibility.

Abstract: Video aesthetic assessment, a vital area in multimedia computing, integrates
computer vision with human cognition. Its progress is limited by the lack of
standardized datasets and robust models, as the temporal dynamics of video and
multimodal fusion challenges hinder direct application of image-based methods.

*Moritz Lucas,Hamid Ebrahimy,Viacheslav Barkov,Ralf Pecenka,Kai-Uwe Kühnberger,Björn Waske*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep learning methods, including CNNs, vision transformers, and hybrids, were evaluated for TOF classification across four German landscapes using six segmentation architectures; FT-UNetFormer achieved top performance (IoU 0.74, F1 0.84); region diversity and edge-density challenge remain; dataset and code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TOF contributes to biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and microclimate regulation. Prior work often treated TOF as a single class or used rigid thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and regional transferability. This study evaluates DL models across architectures to improve TOF mapping and interpretation.

Method: Generated a new high-resolution aerial imagery dataset from four German agricultural landscapes. Compared CNNs, vision transformers, and hybrid CNN‑Transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet, LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, U‑Net) to map four woody vegetation categories: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree.

Result: Overall good accuracy across landscapes; FT-UNetFormer performed best with mean IoU 0.74 and mean F1 0.84. Forest and Linear classes showed strong performance; Patch and Tree were more challenging due to high edge density. Generalization experiments indicated the need for regionally diverse training data for reliable large-scale mapping.

Conclusion: DL is effective for TOF mapping, with FT-UNetFormer as the standout model. Reliable large-scale mapping requires regionally diverse training datasets. The dataset and code are openly available at the provided GitHub repository.

Abstract: Trees Outside Forests (TOF) play an important role in agricultural landscapes
by supporting biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and regulating microclimates.
Yet, most studies have treated TOF as a single class or relied on rigid
rule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and adaptability
across regions. To address this, we evaluate deep learning for TOF
classification using a newly generated dataset and high-resolution aerial
imagery from four agricultural landscapes in Germany. Specifically, we compare
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers, and hybrid
CNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet,
LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, and U-Net) to map four categories of
woody vegetation: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree, derived from previous
studies and governmental products. Overall, the models achieved good
classification accuracy across the four landscapes, with the FT-UNetFormer
performing best (mean Intersection-over-Union 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84),
underscoring the importance of spatial context understanding in TOF mapping and
classification. Our results show good results for Forest and Linear class and
reveal challenges particularly in classifying complex structures with high edge
density, notably the Patch and Tree class. Our generalization experiments
highlight the need for regionally diverse training data to ensure reliable
large-scale mapping. The dataset and code are openly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight DETR-based detector is enhanced by Vision Foundation Models through a Deep Semantic Injector and Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation, achieving state-of-the-art COCO performance at high FPS with no extra inference cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lightweight detectors often lose rich feature representations. VFMs offer stronger semantic knowledge, but transferring these representations to resource-constrained detectors is challenging due to architectural and learning objective gaps; a cost-effective, stable transfer is needed for real-time on-device detection.

Method: Introduce Deep Semantic Injector to embed high-level VFM representations into deep detector layers, and Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation to dynamically adjust semantic transfer strength based on gradient norm ratios, achieving improvement without additional deployment overhead on DETR-based detectors.

Result: RT-DETRv4 achieves COCO AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS, representing state-of-the-art results and consistent gains across DETR-based models.

Conclusion: The framework enables stable, task-aligned semantic transfer from VFMs to lightweight detectors, boosting real-time performance without increasing inference cost, and offering practical utility for on-device deployment.

Abstract: Real-time object detection has achieved substantial progress through
meticulously designed architectures and optimization strategies. However, the
pursuit of high-speed inference via lightweight network designs often leads to
degraded feature representation, which hinders further performance improvements
and practical on-device deployment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective
and highly adaptable distillation framework that harnesses the rapidly evolving
capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object
detectors. Given the significant architectural and learning objective
disparities between VFMs and resource-constrained detectors, achieving stable
and task-aligned semantic transfer is challenging. To address this, on one
hand, we introduce a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module that facilitates the
integration of high-level representations from VFMs into the deep layers of the
detector. On the other hand, we devise a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation
(GAM) strategy, which dynamically adjusts the intensity of semantic transfer
based on gradient norm ratios. Without increasing deployment and inference
overhead, our approach painlessly delivers striking and consistent performance
gains across diverse DETR-based models, underscoring its practical utility for
real-time detection. Our new model family, RT-DETRv4, achieves state-of-the-art
results on COCO, attaining AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding
speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LangHOPS is the first MLLM-based framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation, grounding object-part hierarchies in language space and leveraging MLLM reasoning to detect and segment hierarchical object and part instances from open-vocabulary categories. It achieves state-of-the-art results on PartImageNet (in-domain +5.5 AP, cross-dataset +4.8 AP) and ADE20K zero-shot (2.5% mIOU), with ablations validating language-grounded hierarchies and MLLM-driven part query refinement; code release planned.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to overcome heuristic visual grouping and limited vocabulary in existing object-part segmentation by grounding hierarchies in language and leveraging MLLMs' knowledge and reasoning.

Method: Integrates an MLLM into the object-part parsing pipeline to ground hierarchical concepts; open-vocabulary detection and segmentation; language-grounded hierarchy; multi-granularity concept linking; part query refinement strategy.

Result: State-of-the-art on PartImageNet: +5.5 AP in-domain, +4.8 AP cross-dataset; zero-shot ADE20K: +2.5% mIOU; ablation results support the benefits of language grounding.

Conclusion: Language-grounded hierarchies and MLLM-driven query refinement enable robust open-vocabulary object-part segmentation and can generalize to unseen parts; code release forthcoming.

Abstract: We propose LangHOPS, the first Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based
framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation. Given an
image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part
instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds
object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the
object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning
capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We
evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain
and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic
segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous
methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on
the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K
(zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the

*Yuyang Huang,Yabo Chen,Junyu Zhou,Wenrui Dai,Xiaopeng Zhang,Junni Zou,Hongkai Xiong,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) introduces a diffusion-based, generation-based SFDA framework that uses unlabeled target data to form and progressively refine a pseudo-target domain. It splits target samples into trust and non-trust sets, manipulates non-trust samples to align with new categories while staying within the target distribution, and iteratively reduces domain discrepancy. It achieves state-of-the-art results on four SFDA benchmarks, with up to 18.6% gains in large domain-gap scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFDA faces domain shift using only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data. Non-generation SFDA methods struggle with unreliable pseudo-labels under large domain discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods degrade when creating pseudo-source data due to enlarged domain gaps. A method that leverages unlabeled target references to reliably generate and refine a pseudo-target domain is needed.

Method: Divide target samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on pseudo-label reliability. For samples in the non-trust set, apply a semantic manipulation strategy to assign new categories while keeping them within the target distribution via a latent diffusion model. Incorporate a progressive refinement mechanism that iteratively reduces the domain gap between the pseudo-target domain and the real target domain.

Result: DPTM outperforms existing SFDA methods by a large margin and achieves state-of-the-art performance on four SFDA benchmark datasets of varying scales. It delivers particularly large gains in scenarios with substantial source-target gaps (up to 18.6%).

Conclusion: DPTM provides a robust generation-based solution for SFDA by reliably generating and progressively refining a pseudo-target domain through diffusion-driven manipulation and trust-based sampling, enabling strong cross-domain adaptation across benchmarks.

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging task that tackles
domain shifts using only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data.
Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of
source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from
unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain
discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due
to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named
Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages
unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively
refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target
samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of
pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For
samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to
semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while
simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent
diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that
progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain
and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results
demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark
datasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the
performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

*Yang Jin,Guangyu Guo,Binglu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaTector+ unifies gaze object detection and gaze following without relying on head priors, using a shared backbone with task-specific blocks, a head-detection branch, head-based attention, and attention supervision, plus a new mSoC metric; it demonstrates strong performance on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Previos methods typically solve gaze object detection and gaze following separately and depend on head-related priors (often via an auxiliary head detector). This hinders joint optimization and practical deployment where head priors are unavailable.

Method: Proposes an expanded specific-general-specific feature extractor with a shared backbone. Introduces head detection branch to predict head locations. Uses a head-based attention mechanism to fuse sense and gaze features using head location. Adds an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate learning of the gaze heatmap. Proposes a new evaluation metric, mean Similarity over Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection.

Result: Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets show the model is effective for both gaze object detection and gaze following tasks.

Conclusion: GaTector+ eliminates dependence on head priors during inference, enabling joint optimization and broader practical applicability. The architecture and attention mechanisms improve both gaze object detection and gaze following performance.

Abstract: Gaze object detection and gaze following are fundamental tasks for
interpreting human gaze behavior or intent. However, most previous methods
usually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects
and gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both
the training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an
auxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization
across the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this
end, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and
gaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors
during inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded
specific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,
which extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using
the shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared
backbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain
head-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head
detection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing
the gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense
feature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the
suboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,
we propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the
gaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity
over Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to
variations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze
object detection and gaze following tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FSOD models suffer from base-class bias and unstable calibration when only a few novel examples exist; a plug-in, parameter-efficient mechanism that uses prototypes can better recognize novel objects without heavy parameter growth.

Method: Maintain support-only prototypes in a learnable identity-initialized projection space; optional prototype-conditioned RoI alignment to reduce geometric mismatch; EMA-based prototype adaptation during fine-tuning on labeled foreground RoIs without introducing class-specific parameters; prototypes frozen at inference; best-of-K matching to capture intra-class multi-modality; temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector logits.

Result: On VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks, PDA yields consistent improvements for novel classes with minimal impact on base classes and negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: PDA provides a lightweight, effective augmentation for FSOD, delivering a complementary prototype-driven decision head that enhances novel-class performance while preserving base-class behavior and efficiency.

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) often suffers from base-class bias and
unstable calibration when only a few novel samples are available. We propose
Prototype-Driven Alignment (PDA), a lightweight, plug-in metric head for DeFRCN
that provides a prototype-based "second opinion" complementary to the linear
classifier. PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable
identity-initialized projection space and optionally applies
prototype-conditioned RoI alignment to reduce geometric mismatch. During
fine-tuning, prototypes can be adapted via exponential moving average(EMA)
updates on labeled foreground RoIs-without introducing class-specific
parameters-and are frozen at inference to ensure strict protocol compliance.
PDA employs a best-of-K matching scheme to capture intra-class multi-modality
and temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector
logits. Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show that PDA consistently
improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and
negligible computational overhead.

*Runxi Huang,Mingxuan Yu,Mingyu Tsoi,Xiaomin Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMEdge enables real-time on-device multimodal inference by pipelining sensing/encoding with incremental computation, a temporal aggregation module, adaptive multimodal configuration, and cross-modal speculative skipping, validated on UAV-based multimodal datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the tight coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution and the complex inter-modality dependencies that hinder real-time inference on resource-constrained edge devices.

Method: Decompose inference into fine-grained sensing/encoding units that process data incrementally as it arrives; employ a temporal aggregation module to capture cross-unit temporal dynamics; include an adaptive multimodal configuration optimizer and a cross-modal speculative skipping mechanism; evaluate on two public multimodal datasets and a real UAV testbed.

Result: End-to-end latency is significantly reduced while maintaining high task accuracy across varying system and data dynamics; demonstrated on real UAV multimodal hardware.

Conclusion: MMEdge demonstrates a scalable on-device multimodal inference framework that enables incremental computation, cross-modal optimization, and early decision-making under resource variability, suitable for latency-critical edge applications.

Abstract: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is
essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer
interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight
coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex
inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device
multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.
Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire
inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,
allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also
introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that
captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain
accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for
fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during
inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and
input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration
optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for
each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping
mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early
predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public

*Yuhang Hu,Zhenyu Yang,Shihan Wang,Shengsheng Qian,Bin Wen,Fan Yang,Tingting Gao,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StreamingCoT introduces a streaming VideoQA dataset with per-second annotations and explicit multimodal Chain-of-Thought, plus a construction toolkit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address static, non-temporal annotations and lack of reasoning traces in VideoQA, enabling temporal dynamics understanding and interpretable reasoning.

Method: Dynamic hierarchical per-second annotation; temporally dependent semantic segments via similarity fusion; per-question answer sets constrained by temporal evolution; object extraction via keyframe semantic alignment; state-transition reasoning paths via LLMs; human-verified validation; provides dataset and toolkit.

Result: A new StreamingCoT dataset and construction toolkit; foundation for research in streaming video understanding, temporal reasoning, and multimodal inference.

Conclusion: StreamingCoT enables advances in temporal reasoning and CoT in streaming video, offering resources to improve model interpretability and reasoning in multimodal tasks.

Abstract: The rapid growth of streaming video applications demands multimodal models
with enhanced capabilities for temporal dynamics understanding and complex
reasoning. However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer
from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture
the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of
explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and
logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce
StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving
reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our
framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that
generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent
semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets
constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit
reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via
keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning
paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through
human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing
research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and
multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be

### [66] [Informative Sample Selection Model for Skeleton-based Action Recognition with Limited Training Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25345)
*Zhigang Tu,Zhengbo Zhang,Jia Gong,Junsong Yuan,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An MDP-based active learning framework for semi-supervised 3D action recognition using hyperbolic embeddings and a meta-tuning strategy to select informative unlabeled skeleton sequences for annotation, improving performance on three benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce dependency on labeled skeletal data and improve sample efficiency by selecting the most informative unlabeled samples for labeling; existing methods using clustering and margin-based selection may overemphasize representative but not necessarily informative samples.

Method: Model the problem as a Markov Decision Process; train an informative sample selector; uses an encoder-decoder to embed skeleton sequences; integrates clustering information with a margin-based multi-head selection; projects state-action factors to hyperbolic space; introduces a meta-tuning strategy for fast deployment.

Result: Demonstrates effectiveness on three 3D action recognition benchmarks; ablation studies support the benefits of hyperbolic embeddings and the MDP-based selector; meta-tuning accelerates practical deployment.

Conclusion: The proposed MDP-based active learning framework improves semi-supervised 3D action recognition efficiency and performance, and the hyperbolic embedding and meta-tuning components contribute to practicality. Future work could explore other geometric spaces and broader datasets.

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to classify human skeletal
sequences, which are spatiotemporal representations of actions, into predefined
categories. To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences
while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action
Recognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D
Action Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims
to proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,
has been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample
selection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to
embed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,
combined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,
is utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for
annotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not
necessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may
have already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.
To solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active
learning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an
informative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of
skeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of
the factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from
Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning
strategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.
Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: Radiomics-based CAC scoring with pseudo-labeling on non-contrast CCTA achieves 84% accuracy, outperforming CNN embeddings from foundation models, without expert segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the data scarcity and annotation bottleneck in coronary artery calcium detection by leveraging pseudo-labeling and radiomics, and compares against pretrained foundation-model features to evaluate annotation-efficient CAC risk stratification on non-contrast scans.

Method: Build a radiomics pipeline that generates training labels via pseudo-labeling, eliminating the need for expert segmentations. Compare radiomics features to deep features extracted from foundation models (CT-FM, RadImageNet) using traditional classifiers. Dataset: 182 clinical CCTA scans, binary classification (zero vs non-zero calcium score). Investigate training on non-contrast data vs mixed contrast/non-contrast data, with testing on non-contrast scans.

Result: Radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from CT-FM and RadImageNet (84% accuracy; p<0.05). Pseudo-labeling enables annotation-free training. Model performance validated on a clinical dataset with non-contrast testing.

Conclusion: Radiomics with pseudo-labeling offers an effective, annotation-efficient approach for CAC risk stratification on non-contrast CCTA, outperforming foundation-model embeddings in this setting. Encourages further exploration of radiomics vs foundation-model transfers and domain adaptation for non-contrast CAC detection.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring plays a crucial role in the early
detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this
study, we focus on non-contrast coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)
scans, which are commonly used for early calcification detection in clinical
settings. To address the challenge of limited annotated data, we propose a
radiomics-based pipeline that leverages pseudo-labeling to generate training
labels, thereby eliminating the need for expert-defined segmentations.
Additionally, we explore the use of pretrained foundation models, specifically
CT-FM and RadImageNet, to extract image features, which are then used with
traditional classifiers. We compare the performance of these deep learning
features with that of radiomics features. Evaluation is conducted on a clinical
CCTA dataset comprising 182 patients, where individuals are classified into two
groups: zero versus non-zero calcium scores. We further investigate the impact
of training on non-contrast datasets versus combined contrast and non-contrast
datasets, with testing performed only on non contrast scans. Results show that
radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from
foundation models (achieving 84% accuracy and p<0.05), despite the
unavailability of expert annotations.

### [68] [Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt Tuning of Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25372)
*M Yashwanth,Sharannya Ghosh,Aditay Tripathi,Anirban Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PEP-FedPT introduces a federated, parameter-efficient prompt-tuning method for Vision Transformers that uses Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompts (CCMP) to blend class-specific prompts with a global prompt, enabling per-sample personalization without client-specific trainable parameters. It achieves strong generalization across heterogeneous clients and outperforms baselines on multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning with ViTs and prompt tuning faces two main issues: (1) global prompt tuning generalizes poorly to heterogeneous clients; (2) personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. A lightweight, personalized, and generalizable prompt-tuning approach is needed for data-constrained FL settings.

Method: Introduce CCMP: maintain class-specific prompts alongside a globally shared prompt. For each input, compute a weighted combination of class prompts using weights derived from global class prototypes and client class priors. This yields per-sample personalization without storing client-specific trainable parameters. Optimization is performed via standard federated averaging (FedAvg) across clients.

Result: Empirical evaluations on CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist show that PEP-FedPT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under various data-heterogeneity conditions.

Conclusion: PEP-FedPT provides a unified framework for achieving both generalization and personalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. The CCMP design enables per-sample personalization without extra client-specific parameters and demonstrates robust performance across diverse datasets and heterogeneity scenarios.

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) has
proven highly effective as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for
adapting large models to downstream tasks with limited data. Its parameter
efficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where
both communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,
global prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,
while personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We
propose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt
Tuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and
personalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we
introduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on
class-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each
input, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived
from global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables
per-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable
parameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated
averaging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,
TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT
consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data
heterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and
generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.

*Bill Psomas,George Retsinas,Nikos Efthymiadis,Panagiotis Filntisis,Yannis Avrithis,Petros Maragos,Ondrej Chum,Giorgos Tolias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new instance-level CIR dataset, i-CIR, and a training-free method, BASIC, pair to advance composed image retrieval with high-quality evaluation data and robust retrieval without training on task-specific data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of clean, diverse, and scalable training/evaluation data for composed image retrieval by proposing an instance-level dataset and a training-free, VLM-based method.

Method: i-CIR: an instance-level CIR dataset designed to be compact yet hard, with semi-automated hard negatives among 40M distractors; BASIC: a training-free approach that estimates query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities using pre-trained vision-language models and fuses them late, with components to improve each similarity.

Result: BASIC achieves new state-of-the-art on i-CIR and on existing CIR datasets that use semantic-level class definitions, demonstrating strong performance without task-specific training.

Conclusion: The work provides both a challenging, compact instance-level evaluation dataset and a robust, training-free method that achieves state-of-the-art results, potentially accelerating progress in CIR research while keeping data requirements low.

Abstract: The progress of composed image retrieval (CIR), a popular research direction
in image retrieval, where a combined visual and textual query is used, is held
back by the absence of high-quality training and evaluation data. We introduce
a new evaluation dataset, i-CIR, which, unlike existing datasets, focuses on an
instance-level class definition. The goal is to retrieve images that contain
the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of
modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep
the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its
challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random
distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives.
  To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training
data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a
training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates
query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late
fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those
that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual
similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and
intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR
datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition. Project page:

### [70] [More than a Moment: Towards Coherent Sequences of Audio Descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25440)
*Eshika Khandelwal,Junyu Xie,Tengda Han,Max Bain,Arsha Nagrani,Andrew Zisserman,Gül Varol,Makarand Tapaswi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes CoherentAD, a training-free method for generating coherent AD (audio description) sequences by first producing multiple candidate descriptions per AD interval and then autoregressively selecting a coherent narrative across the sequence; introduces a sequence-level metric StoryRecall to evaluate narrative conveyance, along with repetition metrics; claims improved coherence over independent-generation baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Audio descriptions should form a coherent, narrative sequence to help visually impaired viewers follow unfolding scenes; existing methods often describe isolated moments, leading to repetition and incoherence.

Method: For each AD time interval, generate multiple candidate descriptions; perform auto-regressive selection across the AD sequence to assemble a coherent and informative narrative; training-free approach; introduce StoryRecall as a sequence-level evaluation metric.

Result: CoherentAD produces more coherent AD sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches that rely on independent generations; improved StoryRecall and reduced repetition metrics compared to baselines.

Conclusion: A training-free, sequence-aware approach can substantially improve AD coherence; StoryRecall enables holistic evaluation of narrative quality in AD sequences; the method shows potential for broader use in assistive video narration.

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing
visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a
coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather
than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each
AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To
address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first
generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then
performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and
informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a
sequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs
convey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture
the redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD
sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches
that rely on independent generations.

*Doan-Van-Anh Ly,Thi-Thu-Hien Pham,Thanh-Hai Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResNet-based UNet3+ with CBAM dominates liver tumor segmentation in multi-phase CECT, outperforming Transformer- and Mamba-backbone variants on Dice, IoU, boundary accuracy, and overall metrics; Grad-CAM aids interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate backbone architectures for liver tumor segmentation in multi-phase CT and assess whether modern backbones with attention surpass classical CNNs.

Method: Compare UNet and UNet3+ architectures with backbones ResNet, Transformer, and State-space (Mamba), all pretrained; incorporate CBAM into backbones; assess segmentation with Dice, IoU, HD95, accuracy, and specificity; use Grad-CAM for interpretability.

Result: ResNet-based models consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives; adding CBAM improves performance, with ResNetUNet3+ + CBAM achieving the best metrics (Dice 0.755, IoU 0.662, HD95 77.911; accuracy 0.925; specificity 0.926).

Conclusion: Classical ResNet architectures, especially when enhanced with attention modules like CBAM, remain competitive and effective for liver tumor segmentation in clinical practice.

Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and
treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this
study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver
tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+
with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and
State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights.
Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models
consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across
multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we
introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating
the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.
ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a
Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise
boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The
model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of
0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately
identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance
interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the
region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its
decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet
architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly
competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising
direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegionE introduces an adaptive, region-aware framework for instruction-based image editing that partitions images into edited and unedited regions to accelerate generation without extra training, achieving 2x speedups while preserving fidelity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In IIE, edited and unedited regions have different generation difficulty and redundancy. Uniform processing wastes computation on unedited areas and can slow edits; RegionE targets region-specific efficiency while maintaining quality.

Method: 1) Adaptive Region Partition: early denoising stages split the image into edited vs. unedited based on final-result vs reference. 2) Region-Aware Generation: unedited regions use one-step prediction; edited regions use local iterative denoising enhanced by a Region-Instruction KV Cache to fuse global information efficiently. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache: leverages velocity similarity between adjacent timesteps to speed up local denoising. Applied to base models (Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, Qwen-Image-Edit).

Result: Achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06 across the evaluated models. GPT-4o-based evaluations indicate preserved semantic and perceptual fidelity.

Conclusion: RegionE effectively accelerates IIE tasks without additional training and generalizes to state-of-the-art IIE models, offering substantial speedups while maintaining high-quality edits.

Abstract: Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread
attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,
while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of
regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational
redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead
applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates
us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that
accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE
framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We
observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for
multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in
the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited
regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the
reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,
we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.
For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative
denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,
we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost
while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.
Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity
similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate
the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base
models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE
achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o
confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.

### [73] [Hawk: Leveraging Spatial Context for Faster Autoregressive Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25739)
*Zhi-Kai Chen,Jun-Peng Jiang,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A speculative decoding approach for autoregressive image generation that leverages 2D image spatial structure (Hawk) to guide a lightweight draft model, achieving faster inference while preserving fidelity and diversity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autoregressive image generation is slow due to token-by-token decoding. Speculative decoding helps text generation but is underexplored for images due to the much larger sampling space, difficulty aligning draft and target outputs, and underutilization of the 2D spatial structure that governs local dependencies.

Method: Hawk uses the spatial structure of images to guide a lightweight draft model to produce more accurate and efficient predictions. By exploiting 2D locality and alignment cues, the draft better approximates the target AR model, enabling faster speculative decoding for image generation.

Result: Empirical results on multiple text-to-image benchmarks show a 1.71x speedup over standard autoregressive models, with preserved image fidelity and diversity.

Conclusion: Exploiting the 2D spatial structure in speculative decoding yields practical acceleration for autoregressive image synthesis without compromising quality, offering a viable path toward real-time or interactive image generation.

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation models are capable of producing
high-fidelity images but often suffer from slow inference due to their
inherently sequential, token-by-token decoding process. Speculative decoding,
which employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger
AR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without
compromising quality. However, its application to image generation remains
largely underexplored. The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling
space, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model
outputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial
structure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local
dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach
that harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model
toward more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard AR
models, while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.

TL;DR: A comprehensive survey of multimodal spatial reasoning with large models, outlining taxonomy, gaps, and benchmarks, and releasing open benchmarks and code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Public reviews and public benchmarks for multimodal spatial reasoning models are scarce; need systematic understanding and evaluation resources.

Method: Literature survey of recent work on MLLMs, spanning 2D and 3D spatial tasks, spatial relationships, scene/layout understanding, VQA and grounding, embodied AI, and new modalities; proposes taxonomy and open benchmarks; compiles resources (GitHub).

Result: Provides a structured taxonomy of tasks and methods; identifies core challenges; introduces and highlights open benchmarks; offers guidelines for evaluation and future directions.

Conclusion: Sets a solid foundation for multimodal spatial reasoning research and accelerates development by curating benchmarks and resources; highlights directions for open research.

Abstract: Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand
spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large
multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and
reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However,
systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain
limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal
spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for
evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on
post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D
tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout
understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space.
We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation
and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio
and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through
new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers
insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated

*Chuhao Chen,Isabella Liu,Xinyue Wei,Hao Su,Minghua Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Training-free articulated 3D object generation by repurposing a static 3D diffusion model as a shape prior, extending SDS to 3D-to-4D with articulation as an extra generative dimension, enabling per-instance optimization in minutes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Articulated 3D objects are central to robotics, AR/VR, and animation but are hard to model. Existing pipelines require dense views or training data, while open-world diffusion excels for static objects. A training-free approach for articulated objects is needed to bridge this gap.

Method: Repurpose a pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a shape prior and extend Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into 3D-to-4D by treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images of the object in different articulation states, jointly optimize geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without task-specific training or large-scale articulated datasets.

Result: Produces high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately recovers underlying kinematic structures, generalizes across diverse object categories, and, despite per-instance optimization, runs in minutes and outperforms prior SOTA in quality and versatility.

Conclusion: FreeArt3D offers a training-free, versatile framework for articulated 3D generation by leveraging existing diffusion priors with articulation as an extra generative axis, enabling high-quality results from limited data.

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,
and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on
optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision
or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric
approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D
generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with
the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending
these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models
poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a
training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of
training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a
pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape
prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by
treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images
captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the
object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring
task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our
method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts
underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object
categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D
completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art
approaches in both quality and versatility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified, reference-based VFX video-generation framework (VFXMaster) that uses in-context learning and an in-context attention mask to imitate dynamic effects from a reference video, with a one-shot adaptation mechanism for unseen effects, achieving strong generalization and efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current one-LoRA-per-effect approaches are resource-intensive and fail to generalize to unseen effects, limiting scalability of VFX generation.

Method: Employ in-context conditioning by providing a reference example, use an in-context attention mask to decouple and inject essential effect attributes, train a single unified model for effect imitation, and introduce a one-shot adaptation mechanism to rapidly generalize to unseen effects from a user-provided video.

Result: Empirically demonstrates effective imitation across diverse effect categories and strong generalization to out-of-domain/unseen effects; rapid adaptation with a single example; plans to release code, models, and a dataset to the community.

Conclusion: VFXMaster is the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video generation, enabling scalable, generalizable effect imitation and rapid adaptation; it establishes a foundation for future work and community resources.

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,
yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing
methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is
resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen
effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we
introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video
generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,
enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto
target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to
unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning
strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context
attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential
effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect
imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient
one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on
tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories
of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain
effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a
comprehensive dataset to the community.

### [77] [SCOUT: A Lightweight Framework for Scenario Coverage Assessment in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24949)
*Anil Yildiz,Sarah M. Thornton,Carl Hildebrandt,Sreeja Roy-Singh,Mykel J. Kochenderfer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SCOUT is a lightweight surrogate model that predicts scenario coverage labels from an agent's latent sensor features by distilling LVLM-generated labels, enabling fast, scalable coverage estimation without ongoing LVLM use or human annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing scenario-coverage methods rely on expensive LVLMs or manual annotations, which are impractical for large-scale autonomous deployments.

Method: Train a small surrogate model (SCOUT) via distillation using precomputed perception features and LVLM-derived coverage labels as supervision; deploy to predict coverage directly from latent representations, avoiding continuous LVLM inference.

Result: On a large real-world autonomous navigation dataset, SCOUT maintains high accuracy while dramatically reducing computation compared to LVLM-based approaches; performance hinges on quality of training labels.

Conclusion: SCOUT offers a practical, scalable alternative for large-scale scenario-coverage analysis, enabling efficient oversight, though its effectiveness depends on the LVLM labels used for supervision.

Abstract: Assessing scenario coverage is crucial for evaluating the robustness of
autonomous agents, yet existing methods rely on expensive human annotations or
computationally intensive Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). These
approaches are impractical for large-scale deployment due to cost and
efficiency constraints. To address these shortcomings, we propose SCOUT
(Scenario Coverage Oversight and Understanding Tool), a lightweight surrogate
model designed to predict scenario coverage labels directly from an agent's
latent sensor representations. SCOUT is trained through a distillation process,
learning to approximate LVLM-generated coverage labels while eliminating the
need for continuous LVLM inference or human annotation. By leveraging
precomputed perception features, SCOUT avoids redundant computations and
enables fast, scalable scenario coverage estimation. We evaluate our method
across a large dataset of real-life autonomous navigation scenarios,
demonstrating that it maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing
computational cost. Our results show that SCOUT provides an effective and
practical alternative for large-scale coverage analysis. While its performance
depends on the quality of LVLM-generated training labels, SCOUT represents a
major step toward efficient scenario coverage oversight in autonomous systems.

*Hayato Idei,Tamon Miyake,Tetsuya Ogata,Yuichi Yamashita*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hierarchical multimodal predictive-processing NN integrates 30k-dim visuo-proprioceptive input to learn two caregiving tasks in simulation, showing hierarchical latent dynamics, robustness to vision degradation, and asymmetric multitask interference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome task-specific hand-engineering and poor generalization in autonomous caregiving robots; align with hierarchical predictive processing theory from neuroscience to enable flexible cognition under uncertainty.

Method: Propose a hierarchical multimodal recurrent neural network grounded in the free-energy principle; directly processes high-dimensional visuo-proprioceptive data without dimensionality reduction; train on two caregiving tasks (rigid-body repositioning and flexible-towel wiping) in simulation; analyze latent dynamics, robustness to degraded vision, and multitask interference.

Result: Model self-organizes hierarchical latent dynamics that regulate task transitions, captures uncertainty variability, and infers occluded states; robust to degraded vision via visuo-proprioceptive fusion; exhibits asymmetric multitask interference (wiping variable not heavily affecting repositioning; repositioning modestly reduces wiping) with overall robustness in simulation.

Conclusion: Predictive processing is a universal, scalable principle for robust, flexible autonomous caregiving robots and offers insights into human brain adaptability in uncertain real-world environments.

Abstract: The rapid aging of societies is intensifying demand for autonomous care
robots; however, most existing systems are task-specific and rely on
handcrafted preprocessing, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse
scenarios. A prevailing theory in cognitive neuroscience proposes that the
human brain operates through hierarchical predictive processing, which
underlies flexible cognition and behavior by integrating multimodal sensory
signals. Inspired by this principle, we introduce a hierarchical multimodal
recurrent neural network grounded in predictive processing under the
free-energy principle, capable of directly integrating over 30,000-dimensional
visuo-proprioceptive inputs without dimensionality reduction. The model was
able to learn two representative caregiving tasks, rigid-body repositioning and
flexible-towel wiping, without task-specific feature engineering. We
demonstrate three key properties: (i) self-organization of hierarchical latent
dynamics that regulate task transitions, capture variability in uncertainty,
and infer occluded states; (ii) robustness to degraded vision through
visuo-proprioceptive integration; and (iii) asymmetric interference in
multitask learning, where the more variable wiping task had little influence on
repositioning, whereas learning the repositioning task led to a modest
reduction in wiping performance, while the model maintained overall robustness.
Although the evaluation was limited to simulation, these results establish
predictive processing as a universal and scalable computational principle,
pointing toward robust, flexible, and autonomous caregiving robots while
offering theoretical insight into the human brain's ability to achieve flexible
adaptation in uncertain real-world environments.

### [81] [Non-Invasive Calibration Of A Stewart Platform By Photogrammetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25072)
*Sourabh Karmakar,Cameron J. Turner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Forward-kinematics-based calibration of a Stewart platform using Denavit-Hartenberg; employs photogrammetry for non-invasive pose measurements and Least-Square compensation to improve accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calibration of Stewart platforms is difficult due to non-unique forward kinematics and complex relationships between six actuators; a robust, non-invasive calibration method is desired.

Method: Model using Denavit-Hartenberg conventions; test on Tiger 66.1 hexapod; perform photogrammetry-based calibration with high-res images to estimate platform center pose; compare target vs actual poses; apply three LS-based compensation strategies to estimate corrected poses.

Result: All three compensation approaches yielded noticeable improvements in pose accuracy, demonstrating the viability of photogrammetry-based calibration and LS compensation; enhancements indicate potential for further refinement.

Conclusion: Photogrammetry-based, forward-kinematics calibration with LS compensation is effective and non-invasive for Stewart platforms; results encourage further development and optimization of compensation strategies.

Abstract: Accurate calibration of a Stewart platform is important for their precise and
efficient operation. However, the calibration of these platforms using forward
kinematics is a challenge for researchers because forward kinematics normally
generates multiple feasible and unfeasible solutions for any pose of the moving
platform. The complex kinematic relations among the six actuator paths
connecting the fixed base to the moving platform further compound the
difficulty in establishing a straightforward and efficient calibration method.
The authors developed a new forward kinematics-based calibration method using
Denavit-Hartenberg convention and used the Stewart platform Tiger 66.1
developed in their lab for experimenting with the photogrammetry-based
calibration strategies described in this paper. This system became operational
upon completion of construction, marking its inaugural use. The authors used
their calibration model for estimating the errors in the system and adopted
three compensation options or strategies as per Least Square method to improve
the accuracy of the system. These strategies leveraged a high-resolution
digital camera and off-the-shelf software to capture the poses of the moving
platform's center. This process is non-invasive and does not need any
additional equipment to be attached to the hexapod or any alteration of the
hexapod hardware. This photogrammetry-based calibration process involves
multiple high-resolution images from different angles to measure the position
and orientation of the platform center in the three-dimensional space. The
Target poses and Actual poses are then compared, and the error compensations
are estimated using the Least-Squared methods to calculate the Predicted poses.
Results from each of the three compensation approaches demonstrated noticeable
enhancements in platform pose accuracies, suggesting room for further
improvements.

TL;DR: Assignment-free mean-shift exploration enables scalable swarm shape formation with large efficiency gains; supports precise shape, area coverage, and maneuvering formations in warehousing, exploration, and cargo transport.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the inefficiency and fragility of assignment-based coordination for large-scale robot swarms and to enable scalable, robust collaboration for shape formation.

Method: Introduce and apply a mean-shift exploration strategy as the core assignment-free coordination method for swarm robots, focusing on shape formation tasks and their three application types.

Result: The approach yields dozens-of-times improvement in collaboration efficiency, with gains increasing as swarm size grows; demonstrated across precise shape formation, area coverage formation, and maneuvering formation.

Conclusion: Assignment-free mean-shift exploration substantially enhances the scalability and applicability of swarm robotics, enabling effective large-scale collaboration in industrial contexts such as smart warehousing, area exploration, and cargo transport.

Abstract: Swarms evolving from collective behaviors among multiple individuals are
commonly seen in nature, which enables biological systems to exhibit more
efficient and robust collaboration. Creating similar swarm intelligence in
engineered robots poses challenges to the design of collaborative algorithms
that can be programmed at large scales. The assignment-based method has played
an eminent role for a very long time in solving collaboration problems of robot
swarms. However, it faces fundamental limitations in terms of efficiency and
robustness due to its unscalability to swarm variants. This article presents a
tutorial review on recent advances in assignment-free collaboration of robot
swarms, focusing on the problem of shape formation. A key theoretical component
is the recently developed \emph{mean-shift exploration} strategy, which
improves the collaboration efficiency of large-scale swarms by dozens of times.
Further, the efficiency improvement is more significant as the swarm scale
increases. Finally, this article discusses three important applications of the
mean-shift exploration strategy, including precise shape formation, area
coverage formation, and maneuvering formation, as well as their corresponding
industrial scenarios in smart warehousing, area exploration, and cargo
transportation.

*Jiahong Chen,Jing Wang,Long Chen,Chuwei Cai,Jinghui Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NanoVLA introduces lightweight vision-language-action models for edge devices, achieving substantial efficiency gains (up to 52x faster inference and ~98% fewer parameters) while preserving or improving task performance through three innovations: late-stage vision-language fusion, long-short action chunking for coherent planning, and dynamic routing between lightweight and heavy backbones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deploying VLA models on resource-constrained edge devices (e.g., mobile robots, embedded systems) is hindered by high computation, latency, and power demands, limiting real-world robotic manipulation.

Method: (1) Vision-language decoupling: move fusion of vision and language inputs to the late stage of the VLM to enable caching and lower inference overhead. (2) Long-short action chunking: maintain smooth, coherent multi-step planning with real-time responsiveness. (3) Dynamic routing: adaptively choose lightweight or heavy backbones based on task complexity to optimize efficiency. Training/inference strategies emphasize modularity and cross-task transferability.

Result: Empirical results show NanoVLA achieves up to 52× faster edge inference than prior SOTA VLA models and uses ~98% fewer parameters, while maintaining or surpassing accuracy and generalization. Ablations indicate decoupling preserves cross-task transferability; routing improves cost-performance, enabling practical, high-precision manipulation on constrained hardware.

Conclusion: NanoVLA demonstrates that careful architectural decoupling, planning chunking, and adaptive routing can deliver high-performance VLA systems suitable for edge robotics, enabling real-world deployment with strong efficiency and transferability.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have significantly advanced robotic
manipulation by integrating vision-language models (VLMs), and action decoders
into a unified architecture. However, their deployment on resource-constrained
edge devices, such as mobile robots or embedded systems (e.g., Jetson Orin
Nano), remains challenging due to high computational demands, especially in
real-world scenarios where power, latency, and computational resources are
critical. To close this gap, we introduce Nano-scale Vision-Language Action
(NanoVLA), a family of lightweight VLA architectures that achieve high
performance with minimal resources. Our core innovations include: (1)
vision-language decoupling that moves conventional early vision and language
inputs fusion in VLM to late stage, achieving better performance while enabling
caching and reduce inference overhead and latency; (2) long-short action
chunking to ensure smooth, coherent multi-step planning without sacrificing
real-time responsiveness; (3) dynamic routing that adaptively assigns
lightweight or heavy backbones based on task complexity, further optimizing
inference efficiency. Experimental results on several benchmarks, as well as
real-world deployments, demonstrate that NanoVLA achieves up to 52x faster
inference on edge devices compared to previous state-of-the-art VLA models,
with 98% less parameters while maintaining or surpassing their task accuracy
and generalization. Ablation studies confirm that our decoupling strategy
preserves cross-task transferability, and the routing module enhances
cost-performance trade-offs, enabling practical, high-precision robotic
manipulation on resource-constrained hardware.

*Yuxiang Yan,Zhiyuan Zhou,Xin Gao,Guanghao Li,Shenglin Li,Jiaqi Chen,Qunyan Pu,Jian Pu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OrderMind learns spatial-aware manipulation ordering by encoding local spatial context to predict safe, efficient object manipulation order in cluttered scenes; proposed architecture enables real-time, scalable reasoning and distillation from a vision-language supervisor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manipulating objects in cluttered environments is difficult due to spatial dependencies and potential collisions; existing methods often ignore spatial relations, limiting flexibility and scalability.

Method: OrderMind combines a spatial context encoder with a temporal priority structuring module. It constructs a k-Nearest Neighbors spatial graph to aggregate local geometry and encodes interactions between objects and the manipulator. A spatial prior labeling technique guides a vision-language model to produce plausible supervision signals for distillation, enabling real-time, accurate manipulation ordering.

Result: On the Manipulation Ordering Benchmark (163,222 samples), OrderMind significantly outperforms prior approaches in both effectiveness and efficiency. Demonstrated robustness in cluttered scenes across simulation and real-world experiments.

Conclusion: A unified, spatial-aware manipulation ordering framework that scales to complex clutter, enabling real-time, reliable decision-making for object manipulation by leveraging spatial context and distillation-based supervision.

Abstract: Manipulation in cluttered environments is challenging due to spatial
dependencies among objects, where an improper manipulation order can cause
collisions or blocked access. Existing approaches often overlook these spatial
relationships, limiting their flexibility and scalability. To address these
limitations, we propose OrderMind, a unified spatial-aware manipulation
ordering framework that directly learns object manipulation priorities based on
spatial context. Our architecture integrates a spatial context encoder with a
temporal priority structuring module. We construct a spatial graph using
k-Nearest Neighbors to aggregate geometric information from the local layout
and encode both object-object and object-manipulator interactions to support
accurate manipulation ordering in real-time. To generate physically and
semantically plausible supervision signals, we introduce a spatial prior
labeling method that guides a vision-language model to produce reasonable
manipulation orders for distillation. We evaluate OrderMind on our Manipulation
Ordering Benchmark, comprising 163,222 samples of varying difficulty. Extensive
experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms prior approaches in effectiveness and
efficiency, enabling robust manipulation in cluttered scenes.

*Hongyu Song,Rishabh Dev Yadav,Cheng Guo,Wei Pan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SoraNav fuses zero-shot Vision-Language Model reasoning with geometry-aware decision-making for UAV navigation, significantly improving 2.5D and 3D navigation metrics over a baseline in a reproducible PX4 platform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language Navigation for aerial, small-scale 3D environments is hard; current VLN methods are ground-centric and LLMs lack spatial grounding. There is a need to ground language in geometry and robust decision strategies to avoid dead-ends, with reproducible hardware-in-the-loop evaluation.

Method: Integrates zero-shot VLM reasoning with geometry priors embedded in image annotations to constrain the VLM action space. Employs a hybrid switching strategy that uses navigation history to switch between VLM-based reasoning and geometry-based exploration. Implemented on a PX4-based platform with a digital twin and a real micro-UAV for reproducible evaluation.

Result: In 2.5D scenarios, SR improves by 25.7% and SPL by 17%. In 3D scenarios, SR improves by 29.5% and SPL by 18.5% relative to the baseline.

Conclusion: SoraNav effectively grounds language in 3D navigation through geometry-aware constraints and a history-guided hybrid strategy, yielding notable gains in success rate and path efficiency on both simulated and real UAV platforms.

Abstract: Interpreting visual observations and natural language instructions for
complex task execution remains a key challenge in robotics and AI. Despite
recent advances, language-driven navigation is still difficult, particularly
for UAVs in small-scale 3D environments. Existing Vision-Language Navigation
(VLN) approaches are mostly designed for ground robots and struggle to
generalize to aerial tasks that require full 3D spatial reasoning. The
emergence of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as GPT and Claude,
enables zero-shot semantic reasoning from visual and textual inputs. However,
these models lack spatial grounding and are not directly applicable to
navigation. To address these limitations, SoraNav is introduced, an adaptive
UAV navigation framework that integrates zero-shot VLM reasoning with
geometry-aware decision-making. Geometric priors are incorporated into image
annotations to constrain the VLM action space and improve decision quality. A
hybrid switching strategy leverages navigation history to alternate between VLM
reasoning and geometry-based exploration, mitigating dead-ends and redundant
revisits. A PX4-based hardware-software platform, comprising both a digital
twin and a physical micro-UAV, enables reproducible evaluation. Experimental
results show that in 2.5D scenarios, our method improves Success Rate (SR) by
25.7% and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) by 17%. In 3D scenarios, it
improves SR by 29.5% and SPL by 18.5% relative to the baseline.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the lack of high-quality, standardized road-condition datasets. Uses cost-effective smartphone sensors to assess road quality and provide geographic context for safer, better infrastructure and urban planning.

Method: Data collection via a mobile app that records GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, gravity, and orientation data, integrated with GIS data, weather information, and road-condition video. The dataset includes vehicle speed, acceleration, rotation rates, and magnetic field strength, with geographic, weather, and video context facilitating analysis.

Result: Introduces a dataset that merges sensor data with GIS, weather, and video, offering one of the few comprehensive multimodal road-condition datasets with geographic context. It enables clearer analysis of road quality and is intended to be publicly available to spur research.

Conclusion: Public availability is expected to foster research and innovation in smart transportation systems, supporting traffic management, infrastructure development, road safety, and urban planning.

Abstract: It's important to monitor road issues such as bumps and potholes to enhance
safety and improve road conditions. Smartphones are equipped with various
built-in sensors that offer a cost-effective and straightforward way to assess
road quality. However, progress in this area has been slow due to the lack of
high-quality, standardized datasets. This paper discusses a new dataset created
by a mobile app that collects sensor data from devices like GPS,
accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, gravity sensors, and orientation
sensors. This dataset is one of the few that integrates Geographic Information

geographic context. The dataset allows for a clearer analysis of road
conditions by compiling essential data, including vehicle speed, acceleration,
rotation rates, and magnetic field intensity, along with the visual and spatial
context provided by GIS, weather, and video data. Its goal is to provide
funding for initiatives that enhance traffic management, infrastructure

*Jee Won Lee,Hansol Lim,Sooyeun Yang,Jongseong Brad Choi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hybrid IBVS tracking pipeline robust to occlusion that combines global template matching, deep-feature Lucas-Kanade refinement on early VGG features, a lightweight residual regressor for local misalignment, and a GRU-based predictor to extrapolate when confidence drops. It outputs translation, rotation, and scale deltas at 30 Hz, achieving <2 px error under up to 90% occlusion in handheld sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occlusions challenge classical trackers (LK) and DL-based methods alike, threatening tracking accuracy and real-time IBVS control. The work aims to fuse fast, robust perception with tight servo-loop feedback to maintain reliable, low-latency pose updates despite partial/full occlusion.

Method: 1) Global template matcher to constrain pose search region. 2) Deep-feature LK on early VGG layers to refine alignment to sub-pixel accuracy (<2 px). 3) Lightweight residual regressor corrects local misalignments from texture degradation/occlusion. 4) GRU-based predictor extrapolates pose updates from recent motion history when visual confidence is low. 5) Final outputs (translation, rotation, scale deltas) are fed directly as control signals for 30 Hz image-based servo loops.

Result: Evaluated on handheld video sequences with up to 90% occlusion, the pipeline sustains tracking errors below 2 px, demonstrating robustness and low-latency precision essential for real-world robot vision.

Conclusion: The hybrid pipeline effectively bridges perception and control for IBVS under heavy occlusion, delivering reliable real-time pose updates. Future work could explore broader generalization, ablations to quantify each component's contribution, and comparisons against strong baselines to better establish practical gains.

Abstract: Vision-based control systems, such as image-based visual servoing (IBVS),
have been extensively explored for precise robot manipulation. A persistent
challenge, however, is maintaining robust target tracking under partial or full
occlusions. Classical methods like Lucas-Kanade (LK) offer lightweight tracking
but are fragile to occlusion and drift, while deep learning-based approaches
often require continuous visibility and intensive computation. To address these
gaps, we propose a hybrid visual tracking framework that bridges advanced
perception with real-time servo control. First, a fast global template matcher
constrains the pose search region; next, a deep-feature Lucas-Kanade module
operating on early VGG layers refines alignment to sub-pixel accuracy (<2px);
then, a lightweight residual regressor corrects local misalignments caused by
texture degradation or partial occlusion. When visual confidence falls below a
threshold, a GRU-based predictor seamlessly extrapolates pose updates from
recent motion history. Crucially, the pipeline's final outputs-translation,
rotation, and scale deltas-are packaged as direct control signals for 30Hz
image-based servo loops. Evaluated on handheld video sequences with up to 90%
occlusion, our system sustains under 2px tracking error, demonstrating the
robustness and low-latency precision essential for reliable real-world robot
vision applications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A data-efficient method to train humanoid motion policies using only one non-walking target motion sample plus walking motions, via order-preserving optimal transport and geodesic interpolation to synthesize intermediate poses for reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the data collection burden of whole-body humanoid motion datasets by eliminating the need for many samples per motion category; enable effective policy learning with minimal non-walking data.

Method: 1) Use order-preserving optimal transport to measure distances between walking and non-walking sequences. 2) Interpolate along geodesics to generate intermediate pose skeletons. 3) Optimize poses for collision-free configurations and retarget to the humanoid. 4) Train the policy in simulation via reinforcement learning using the synthesized data.

Result: On CMU MoCap data, the approach consistently outperforms baselines with superior performance across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: The framework enables data-efficient, end-to-end learning of whole-body humanoid motion policies with minimal non-walking data, and will release code upon acceptance.

Abstract: Whole-body humanoid motion represents a cornerstone challenge in robotics,
integrating balance, coordination, and adaptability to enable human-like
behaviors. However, existing methods typically require multiple training
samples per motion category, rendering the collection of high-quality human
motion datasets both labor-intensive and costly. To address this, we propose a
novel approach that trains effective humanoid motion policies using only a
single non-walking target motion sample alongside readily available walking
motions. The core idea lies in leveraging order-preserving optimal transport to
compute distances between walking and non-walking sequences, followed by
interpolation along geodesics to generate new intermediate pose skeletons,
which are then optimized for collision-free configurations and retargeted to
the humanoid before integration into a simulated environment for policy
training via reinforcement learning. Experimental evaluations on the CMU MoCap
dataset demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines,
achieving superior performance across metrics. Code will be released upon
acceptance.

TL;DR: Optimal control for transporting a liquid-filled cup on a tray along a preset path in minimum time while avoiding spillage by explicitly modeling sloshing dynamics; solved via direct multiple shooting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handling loosely placed objects with robotic manipulators is difficult; liquid-filled containers pose spillage risk due to sloshing, motivating a planning framework that accounts for fluid-structure interaction.

Method: Modify the system dynamics to include sloshing effects in the optimal control formulation and solve the resulting time-optimal problem using direct multiple shooting.

Result: The approach yields a time-efficient trajectory that minimizes the risk of fluid spillage by leveraging a sloshing-aware dynamic model; the abstract notes the formulation and solution method rather than providing numerical results.

Conclusion: Incorporating fluid sloshing into motion planning enables faster, safer transport of liquid-filled containers along prescribed paths.

Abstract: Handling loosely placed objects with robotic manipulators is a difficult task
from the point of view of trajectory planning and control. This becomes even
more challenging when the object to be handled is a container filled with
liquid. This paper addresses the task of transporting a liquid-filled cup
placed on a tray along a prescribed path in shortest time. The objective is to
minimize swapping, thus avoiding spillage of the fluid. To this end, the

### [90] [SynHLMA:Synthesizing Hand Language Manipulation for Articulated Object with Discrete Human Object Interaction Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25268)
*Wang zhi,Yuyan Liu,Liu Liu,Li Zhang,Ruixuan Lu,Dan Guo*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SynHLMA is a framework that generates hand grasp sequences for articulated objects guided by language. It uses a discrete per-frame HAOI representation, aligns with language embeddings in a shared space via a manipulation-language model, and optimizes with a joint-aware loss to account for articulated joints. It supports generation, prediction, and interpolation of HAOI sequences, evaluated on a new HAOI-lang dataset, with robotics demonstration and plans for code/data release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enabling long-term, language-guided hand-object interaction with articulated objects is crucial for embodied AI, robotics, and VR/AR, but existing methods struggle to model dynamic joint deformations and align manipulation with natural language.

Method: Represent each HAOI frame with a discrete hand-object interaction encoding derived from a complete articulated object point cloud. Combine with natural language embeddings and train them in a shared HAOI manipulation-language space using an HAOI manipulation language model. Use a joint-aware loss to reflect articulated joints’ dynamics. The framework supports three tasks: HAOI generation, HAOI prediction, and HAOI interpolation, trained and evaluated on a newly built HAOI-lang dataset; robotics demonstration via imitation learning using the generated manipulation sequence.

Result: The approach achieves superior performance in hand manipulation sequence generation compared to state-of-the-art baselines on the HAOI-lang dataset and enables dexterous grasp execution in robotics via imitation learning using the generated sequences. They also plan to release code and datasets.

Conclusion: SynHLMA presents a unified pipeline to synthesize and align long-horizon hand-object manipulation with language for articulated objects, advancing multi-task HAOI tasks and enabling practical robotics applications. The work introduces a dedicated HAOI-lang dataset and demonstrates potential for real-world deployment, subject to further validation on unseen objects and in real-world settings.

Abstract: Generating hand grasps with language instructions is a widely studied topic
that benefits from embodied AI and VR/AR applications. While transferring into
hand articulatied object interaction (HAOI), the hand grasps synthesis requires
not only object functionality but also long-term manipulation sequence along
the object deformation. This paper proposes a novel HAOI sequence generation
framework SynHLMA, to synthesize hand language manipulation for articulated
objects. Given a complete point cloud of an articulated object, we utilize a
discrete HAOI representation to model each hand object interaction frame. Along
with the natural language embeddings, the representations are trained by an
HAOI manipulation language model to align the grasping process with its
language description in a shared representation space. A joint-aware loss is
employed to ensure hand grasps follow the dynamic variations of articulated
object joints. In this way, our SynHLMA achieves three typical hand
manipulation tasks for articulated objects of HAOI generation, HAOI prediction
and HAOI interpolation. We evaluate SynHLMA on our built HAOI-lang dataset and
experimental results demonstrate the superior hand grasp sequence generation
performance comparing with state-of-the-art. We also show a robotics grasp
application that enables dexterous grasps execution from imitation learning
using the manipulation sequence provided by our SynHLMA. Our codes and datasets
will be made publicly available.

*Yusuke Tsunoda,Seiya Yamamoto,Kazuki Ito,Runze Xiao,Keisuke Naniwa,Koichi Osuka*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A centipede-like mobile robot achieves amphibious locomotion using a single control scheme and specialized leg designs; experiments show a particular leg structure enables land-water navigation with identical control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the difficulty of designing gait controllers for diverse environments and determining when to switch controllers, a unified approach is sought for land–water navigation.

Method: Design a centipede-type robot with flexible joints and left/right legs on each body segment; test three leg structures; employ implicit–explicit control philosophy; evaluate using leg slip rate and actuator energy consumption.

Result: Identified a leg structure that enables navigation in both aquatic and terrestrial environments under the same control; experimental results validate the approach.

Conclusion: Unified control combined with tailored leg architecture can achieve amphibious locomotion; leg-structure design is critical for cross-environment navigation.

Abstract: Multi-legged mobile robots possess high mobility performance in rough terrain
environments, stemming from their high postural stability, joint flexibility,
and the redundancy provided by multiple legs. In prior research on navigating
between different environments such as land and water, the primary strategy
employed involves switching to a controller that generates an appropriate gait
for the new environment upon entering it. However, designing appropriate gaits
for each complex and diverse environment and accurately determining controller
switching for each environment is challenging. Therefore, this research
develops a centipede-type mobile robot that navigates both aquatic and
terrestrial environments with a simple, unified control scheme, based on the
implicit-explicit control philosophy and by ingeniously designing the robot's
body structure. In this research, we developed the robot featuring flexible
joints and left and right legs on each body segment and focused on the leg
structure which has extensive contact with the environment. This paper
evaluates the locomotion performance on land and water using the three
developed leg structures, using the robot's leg slip rate and actuator energy
consumption as evaluation metrics. The experimental results confirmed the
existence of an appropriate leg structure capable of navigating both aquatic
and terrestrial environments under identical control.

*Jakob Ziegler,Bernhard Rameder,Hubert Gattringer,Andreas Mueller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A dual-mode lower-body exoskeleton gait assist approach that combines transparency ( backlash-enabled passive following) with a torque-guided motion assistance toward estimated future leg positions, using adaptive oscillators to learn locomotion signals; preliminary experiments are promising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable natural, low-resistance gait support while providing timely assistance; address the balance between transparency and actuation, and learn user-specific locomotion patterns.

Method: Two-mode control: (1) transparent mode leveraging gear backlash to minimize interaction forces; (2) superimposed motion-assistance mode applying torque toward estimated future leg positions; adaptive oscillators learn quasi-periodic locomotion signals; initial experiments evaluate feasibility.

Result: First experiments showed promising results, indicating feasibility of the dual-mode approach and the adaptive learning strategy.

Conclusion: The approach is viable and warrants further experimental validation and refinement of timing, adaptation, and interaction forces.

Abstract: In this paper, an approach for gait assistance with a lower body exoskeleton
is described. Two concepts, transparency and motion assistance, are combined.
The transparent mode, where the system is following the user's free motion with
a minimum of perceived interaction forces, is realized by exploiting the gear
backlash of the actuation units. During walking a superimposed assistance mode
applies an additional torque guiding the legs to their estimated future
position. The concept of adaptive oscillators is utilized to learn the
quasi-periodic signals typical for locomotion. First experiments showed
promising results.

### [93] [Geometric Robot Calibration Using a Calibration Plate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25338)
*Bernhard Rameder,Hubert Gattringer,Andreas Mueller*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A calibration method for robotic systems using a precisely measured calibration plate and relative point measurements to identify error parameters; cheaper and more robust than laser trackers; demonstrated on a gantry with LS and constrained optimization, yielding results aligned with laser-tracker calibration and potential generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for cheaper, more robust, transportable calibration methods that can identify systematic error parameters without relying on expensive external trackers.

Method: Use a calibration plate with known inter-point distances; collect relative measurements between plate points; formulate an error model; estimate parameters via least squares and constrained optimization; validate on a gantry robot and compare to laser-tracker calibration.

Result: The approach produced promising results that correlated with laser-tracker calibration, validating the method's effectiveness. The plate design, error model, and identification approach are described.

Conclusion: The calibration plate method offers a mechanically robust, portable, and cost-effective alternative to conventional tracking-based calibration and is not restricted to gantry machines; it can be extended to other robot types.

Abstract: In this paper a new method for geometric robot calibration is introduced,
which uses a calibration plate with precisely known distances between its
measuring points. The relative measurement between two points on the
calibration plate is used to determine predefined error parameters of the
system. In comparison to conventional measurement methods, like laser tracker
or motion capture systems, the calibration plate provides a more mechanically
robust and cheaper alternative, which is furthermore easier to transport due to
its small size. The calibration method, the plate design, the mathematical
description of the error system as well as the identification of the parameters
are described in detail. For identifying the error parameters, the least
squares method and a constrained optimization problem are used. The
functionality of this method was demonstrated in experiments that led to
promising results, correlated with one of a laser tracker calibration. The
modeling and identification of the error parameters is done for a gantry
machine, but is not restricted to that type of robot.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address regulatory compliance and interpretability under uncertainty by combining perception with legal norms and logical reasoning in autonomous driving.

Method: Systematic literature review and taxonomy development. Analyzes neural-symbolic perception, logic-based rule representations, and norm-aware prediction across theoretical foundations, architectures, and validation strategies.

Result: Central finding: perceptual reliability, legal compliance, and decision-making justifiability interact in ways that create significant challenges. A taxonomy is proposed to organize approaches, along with identified validation strategies and practical trade-offs; highlights open questions for future work.

Conclusion: Multidisciplinary insights from engineering, logic, and law inform the design of transparent, accountable autonomous driving systems and guide future research toward legally compliant operation.

Abstract: This survey provides an analysis of current methodologies integrating legal
and logical specifications into the perception, prediction, and planning
modules of automated driving systems. We systematically explore techniques
ranging from logic-based frameworks to computational legal reasoning
approaches, emphasizing their capability to ensure regulatory compliance and
interpretability in dynamic and uncertain driving environments. A central
finding is that significant challenges arise at the intersection of perceptual
reliability, legal compliance, and decision-making justifiability. To
systematically analyze these challenges, we introduce a taxonomy categorizing
existing approaches by their theoretical foundations, architectural
implementations, and validation strategies. We particularly focus on methods
that address perceptual uncertainty and incorporate explicit legal norms,
facilitating decisions that are both technically robust and legally defensible.
The review covers neural-symbolic integration methods for perception,
logic-driven rule representation, and norm-aware prediction strategies, all
contributing toward transparent and accountable autonomous vehicle operation.
We highlight critical open questions and practical trade-offs that must be
addressed, offering multidisciplinary insights from engineering, logic, and law
to guide future developments in legally compliant autonomous driving systems.

*Kei Ikemura,Yifei Dong,David Blanco-Mulero,Alberta Longhini,Li Chen,Florian T. Pokorny*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Vision-based RL with a stress-penalized reward and curriculum learning, enabling gentle, damage-aware manipulation of deformable objects and zero-shot sim-to-real transfer (e.g., tofu), achieving task goals while reducing damage by 36.5% vs vanilla RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manipulating deformable or fragile objects without causing damage is hard; traditional methods rely on accurate object models or specialized sensors, which hurts generalization. A data-efficient, model-free approach that explicitly discourages damage is needed.

Method: Train a vision-based RL agent with a stress-penalized reward; incorporate offline demonstrations; use a curriculum that progresses from rigid proxies to deformables; validate in simulation and real world with zero-shot transfer.

Result: Policy reduces applied stress on fragile objects by 36.5% while achieving task goals; demonstrates damage-aware gentle manipulation and successful sim-to-real transfer (to tofu).

Conclusion: The approach offers a generalizable, less-instrumented framework for deformable object manipulation, achieving goals with reduced damage and enabling effective zero-shot transfer from simulation to real-world tasks.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation of deformable and fragile objects presents significant
challenges, as excessive stress can lead to irreversible damage to the object.
While existing solutions rely on accurate object models or specialized sensors
and grippers, this adds complexity and often lacks generalization. To address
this problem, we present a vision-based reinforcement learning approach that
incorporates a stress-penalized reward to discourage damage to the object
explicitly. In addition, to bootstrap learning, we incorporate offline
demonstrations as well as a designed curriculum progressing from rigid proxies
to deformables. We evaluate the proposed method in both simulated and
real-world scenarios, showing that the policy learned in simulation can be
transferred to the real world in a zero-shot manner, performing tasks such as
picking up and pushing tofu. Our results show that the learned policies exhibit
a damage-aware, gentle manipulation behavior, demonstrating their effectiveness
by decreasing the stress applied to fragile objects by 36.5% while achieving
the task goals, compared to vanilla RL policies.

### [96] [Solving the Right Problem with Multi-Robot Formations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25422)
*Chaz Cornwall,Jeremy P. Bos*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A formation planner reduces the mismatch between shape-based formation control and complex cost functions by a two-step optimization that first approximates costs with weighted surrogate terms, then minimizes the surrogate cost via a Lyapunov-based formation controller. This yields large single-cost reductions (up to 75%) and meaningful multi-cost reductions (20–40%) with adaptive weights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Formation control often sacrifices optimality by enforcing static shapes to minimize a cost function. As the environment becomes richer, a fixed shape may fail to minimize the true protection or safety costs. The paper aims to align formation maintenance with the underlying costs while preserving efficient formation controllers.

Method: Step 1: Solve a constrained optimization to estimate non-linear, non-differentiable costs using a weighted sum of surrogate cost functions. The authors analyze when weights can remain fixed. Step 2: Minimize the surrogate cost with respect to relative robot positions using a non-cooperative formation controller derived from Lyapunov's direct method. They also explore adaptive weighting for multiple costs.

Result: Simulation results show significant improvements: reducing a single cost by more than 75%. When minimizing multiple costs, using adaptive weights yields 20–40% reductions.

Conclusion: Formation planning that minimizes a surrogate objective closely approximating the original costs leads to better performance than pure shape-based control, effectively balancing protection/obstacle avoidance with efficient formation maintenance.

Abstract: Formation control simplifies minimizing multi-robot cost functions by
encoding a cost function as a shape the robots maintain. However, by reducing
complex cost functions to formations, discrepancies arise between maintaining
the shape and minimizing the original cost function. For example, a Diamond or
Box formation shape is often used for protecting all members of the formation.
When more information about the surrounding environment becomes available, a
static shape often no longer minimizes the original protection cost. We propose
a formation planner to reduce mismatch between a formation and the cost
function while still leveraging efficient formation controllers. Our formation
planner is a two-step optimization problem that identifies desired relative
robot positions. We first solve a constrained problem to estimate non-linear
and non-differentiable costs with a weighted sum of surrogate cost functions.
We theoretically analyze this problem and identify situations where weights do
not need to be updated. The weighted, surrogate cost function is then minimized
using relative positions between robots. The desired relative positions are
realized using a non-cooperative formation controller derived from Lyapunov's
direct approach. We then demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for
military-like costs such as protection and obstacle avoidance. In simulations,
we show a formation planner can reduce a single cost by over 75%. When
minimizing a variety of cost functions simultaneously, using a formation
planner with adaptive weights can reduce the cost by 20-40%. Formation planning
provides better performance by minimizing a surrogate cost function that
closely approximates the original cost function instead of relying on a shape
abstraction.

*Alexander B. Rambech,Ivar B. Saksvik,Vahid Hassani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces a Newton-Euler dynamics formulation for underwater vehicles with an internal moving-mass actuator, extending Fossen's 1991 maneuvering model, describing moving-mass effects in the body frame, incorporating them as states in kinematic and rigid-body kinetics, deriving Coriolis–centripetal terms via Kirchhoff and hydrostatics from first principles, and validating the model through simulation against a Hamiltonian formulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a first-principles, closed-form dynamic model for underwater vehicles that accurately captures the influence of internal moving masses, integrate this into the standard maneuvering framework, and enable rigorous simulation and control design.

Method: Develops a Newton-Euler formulation; extends Fossen (1991) maneuvering model; encodes moving-mass dynamics in the body-frame; introduces additional kinematic states and couples them with rigid-body dynamics; derives Coriolis–centripetal terms from Kirchhoff's equations; derives hydrostatics from first principles; validates via simulation and compares with a Hamiltonian internal moving-mass actuator formulation.

Result: Model validated by simulation; comparative analysis performed against the traditional Hamiltonian formulation of internal moving-mass actuation.

Conclusion: The Newton-Euler model provides a valid, first-principles framework for underwater vehicles with internal moving masses, aligning with established Hamiltonian formulations while offering a direct Newton-Euler perspective and potential advantages for simulation and control.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a Newton-Euler formulation of the equations of
motion for underwater vehicles with an interntal moving mass actuator.
Furthermore, the moving mass dynamics are expressed as an extension to the
manoeuvring model for underwater vehicles, originally introduced by Fossen
(1991). The influence of the moving mass is described in body-frame and
included as states in both an additional kinematic equation and as part of the
coupled rigid-body kinetics of the underwater vehicle. The Coriolis-centripetal
effects are derived from Kirchhoff's equations and the hydrostatics are derived
using first principals. The proposed Newton-Euler model is validated through
simulation and compared with the traditional Hamiltonian internal moving mass
actuator formulation.

*Shengyao Zhang,Yiyuan Zhang,Chenrui Zhang,Yiming Li,Wenci Xin,Yuliang Liufu,Hong Wei Ng,Cecilia Laschi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Water-based passive whip dynamics can mimic octopus-like curvature propagation under certain stiffness and speed, but are not fully sufficient to explain octopus reaching; the surrounding medium is crucial.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether whip-like passive dynamics in a fluid can reproduce the biological octopus reaching kinematics and to understand how the environment shapes such motions.

Method: Platform-based whipping tests in water and air with varying material stiffness and driving speed; image-based quantification; Ecoflex Gel 2 arm driven at 150 rpm to assess curvature propagation.

Result: In water, the Ecoflex Gel 2 arm reproduced curvature propagation similar to octopus reaching; bend-point velocity decreased monotonically (not bell-shaped), indicating octopus reaching is not purely passive whipping. No propagation observed in air, highlighting the medium's critical role in forming octopus-like reaching.

Conclusion: The study provides a new perspective on biological reaching and establishes a hydrodynamic testing platform for future research; it suggests that while passive dynamics contribute, active control and medium properties are essential to reproduce octopus-like reaching.

Abstract: The stereotypical reaching motion of the octopus arm has drawn growing
attention for its efficient control of a highly deformable body. Previous
studies suggest that its characteristic bend propagation may share underlying
principles with the dynamics of a whip. This work investigates whether
whip-like passive dynamics in water can reproduce the kinematic features
observed in biological reaching and their similarities and differences.
Platform-based whipping tests were performed in water and air while
systematically varying material stiffness and driving speed. Image-based
quantification revealed that the Ecoflex Gel 2 arm driven at 150 rpm (motor
speed) reproduced curvature propagation similar to that observed in octopus
reaching. However, its bend-point velocity decreased monotonically rather than
exhibiting the biological bell-shaped profile, confirming that the octopus
reaching movement is not merely a passive whipping behavior. The absence of
propagation in air further highlights the critical role of the surrounding
medium in forming octopus-like reaching motion. This study provides a new
perspective for understand biological reaching movement, and offers a potential
platform for future hydrodynamic research.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes VIZ-COAST to use vision-language models to detect downward-refinement issues in task and motion planning, enabling proactive pruning and faster planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In TAMP, high-level task plans can look feasible but fail when refined into continuous motion. Current methods prune only after refinement failures, wasting search on infeasible branches. A proactive detector could improve efficiency and reliability.

Method: Leverage pretrained Vision-Language Models to extract spatial and domain-knowledge constraints from images and domain descriptions, indicating refinement feasibility. Validate on two challenging TAMP domains and assess generalization.

Result: The approach extracts plausible constraints from visual/domain data, substantially reducing planning times and, in some cases, preventing downward-refinement failures entirely, with successful generalization across varied instances.

Conclusion: Incorporating cross-modal reasoning via vision-language models can preempt refinement issues in TAMP, yielding faster, more reliable planning and broader applicability.

Abstract: In task and motion planning, high-level task planning is done over an
abstraction of the world to enable efficient search in long-horizon robotics
problems. However, the feasibility of these task-level plans relies on the
downward refinability of the abstraction into continuous motion. When a
domain's refinability is poor, task-level plans that appear valid may
ultimately fail during motion planning, requiring replanning and resulting in
slower overall performance. Prior works mitigate this by encoding refinement
issues as constraints to prune infeasible task plans. However, these approaches
only add constraints upon refinement failure, expending significant search
effort on infeasible branches. We propose VIZ-COAST, a method of leveraging the
common-sense spatial reasoning of large pretrained Vision-Language Models to
identify issues with downward refinement a priori, bypassing the need to fix
these failures during planning. Experiments on two challenging TAMP domains
show that our approach is able to extract plausible constraints from images and
domain descriptions, drastically reducing planning times and, in some cases,
eliminating downward refinement failures altogether, generalizing to a diverse
range of instances from the broader domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon, contact-rich tasks require complex coordination across arms; purely sequential decision-making or end-to-end RL often fail to achieve efficient, coordinated execution. A system enabling simultaneous skill invocation should improve performance.

Method: Build a library of single-arm and bimanual primitive skills trained with reinforcement learning in GPU-accelerated simulation. Train a Transformer-based planner on a dataset of skill compositions to serve as a high-level scheduler, predicting both the discrete schedule of skills and their continuous parameters.

Result: The method achieves higher success rates on complex, contact-rich tasks than end-to-end RL approaches and yields more efficient, coordinated behaviors than traditional sequential-only planners.

Conclusion: Integrating skill planning and scheduling with RL-trained primitives and a Transformer-based planner improves performance for long-horizon, contact-rich bimanual manipulation by enabling simultaneous skill invocation and better coordination.

Abstract: Long-horizon contact-rich bimanual manipulation presents a significant
challenge, requiring complex coordination involving a mixture of parallel
execution and sequential collaboration between arms. In this paper, we
introduce a hierarchical framework that frames this challenge as an integrated
skill planning & scheduling problem, going beyond purely sequential
decision-making to support simultaneous skill invocation. Our approach is built
upon a library of single-arm and bimanual primitive skills, each trained using
Reinforcement Learning (RL) in GPU-accelerated simulation. We then train a
Transformer-based planner on a dataset of skill compositions to act as a
high-level scheduler, simultaneously predicting the discrete schedule of skills
as well as their continuous parameters. We demonstrate that our method achieves
higher success rates on complex, contact-rich tasks than end-to-end RL
approaches and produces more efficient, coordinated behaviors than traditional
sequential-only planners.

Motivation: To reduce energy consumption and improve efficiency in automated guided vehicle coordination by integrating energy considerations into MAPF and task assignment.

Method: Proposes a collision avoidance strategy that accounts for energy use and travel time; uses two multi-objective algorithms, NSGA and ALNS, for task assignment; includes comparative evaluations.

Result: NSGA- and ALNS-based approaches outperform existing methods in both collision avoidance and task assignment.

Conclusion: Energy-aware MAPF with NSGA and ALNS provides effective coordination of AGVs, balancing energy and time objectives and improving performance over prior approaches.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) has gained significant attention, with most
research focusing on minimizing collisions and travel time. This paper also
considers energy consumption in the path planning of automated guided vehicles
(AGVs). It addresses two main challenges: i) resolving collisions between AGVs
and ii) assigning tasks to AGVs. We propose a new collision avoidance strategy
that takes both energy use and travel time into account. For task assignment,
we present two multi-objective algorithms: Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic
Algorithm (NSGA) and Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS). Comparative
evaluations show that these proposed methods perform better than existing
approaches in both collision avoidance and task assignment.

TL;DR: Adapts Open-VLA for dexterous human-robot collaboration with minimal language prompting by adding FiLM visual conditioning, an auxiliary intent head, and action-space post-processing using delta actions and PCA-reduced finger joints; demonstrates real-time control and analyzes ablations on a multi-view teleoperation dataset, highlighting action post-processing as the main driver and trainer overfitting as a limitation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable natural, language-augmented dexterous HRI with reliable perception and compact action representations, reducing end-to-end complexity while supporting long-horizon tasks.

Method: Fine-tune a pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model (Open-VLA) with (i) FiLM conditioning on visual backbones for task awareness, (ii) an auxiliary intent head predicting collaborator hand pose and target cues, and (iii) action-space post-processing to predict compact deltas (position/rotation) and PCA-reduced finger joints before mapping to full commands; train on a multi-view teleoperation dataset of Franka and Mimic-hand, augmented with MediaPipe hand poses; deploy a real-time stack (~0.3 s on RTX 4090) to compose long-horizon behaviors.

Result: Delta actions are well-behaved; four principal components explain ~96% of hand-joint variance; ablations show action post-processing as the primary performance driver; auxiliary intent provides benefits, FiLM mixed, directional motion loss detrimental; real-time performance achieved; identifies trainer overfitting to demonstrators as a key limitation.

Conclusion: Modest but impactful gains in dexterous HRI with minimal prompts are achievable via targeted architectural augmentations and compact action representations; key limitations lie in generalization across demonstrators, suggesting a focus on diverse data and robust loss designs in future work.

Abstract: We adapt a pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model (Open-VLA) for
dexterous human-robot collaboration with minimal language prompting. Our
approach adds (i) FiLM conditioning to visual backbones for task-aware
perception, (ii) an auxiliary intent head that predicts collaborator hand pose
and target cues, and (iii) action-space post-processing that predicts compact
deltas (position/rotation) and PCA-reduced finger joints before mapping to full
commands. Using a multi-view, teleoperated Franka and Mimic-hand dataset
augmented with MediaPipe hand poses, we demonstrate that delta actions are
well-behaved and that four principal components explain ~96% of hand-joint
variance. Ablations identify action post-processing as the primary performance
driver; auxiliary intent helps, FiLM is mixed, and a directional motion loss is
detrimental. A real-time stack (~0.3 s latency on one RTX 4090) composes
"pick-up" and "pass" into a long-horizon behavior. We surface "trainer
overfitting" to specific demonstrators as the key limitation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing robot-learning datasets largely focus on rigid objects and do not adequately cover contact-rich manipulation with deformable objects or diverse pressure states; there is a need for datasets and models that can leverage rich tactile signals.

Method: Teleoperation of a humanoid robot with dexterous hands to collect a multi-modal dataset (visual, tactile, and action signals) across varying pressure conditions during deformable object manipulation.

Result: The paper presents the creation of the dataset and highlights its potential to drive future research, demonstrating the richness of tactile signals and the importance of diverse pressure conditions.

Conclusion: Encourages development of models with advanced optimization strategies to effectively exploit the complexity and diversity of tactile signals in contact-rich manipulation of soft objects.

Abstract: Contact-rich manipulation has become increasingly important in robot
learning. However, previous studies on robot learning datasets have focused on
rigid objects and underrepresented the diversity of pressure conditions for
real-world manipulation. To address this gap, we present a humanoid
visual-tactile-action dataset designed for manipulating deformable soft
objects. The dataset was collected via teleoperation using a humanoid robot
equipped with dexterous hands, capturing multi-modal interactions under varying
pressure conditions. This work also motivates future research on models with
advanced optimization strategies capable of effectively leveraging the

A predictive model that uses shape information and tail tension is needed to anticipate collapse, optimize navigation, and inform active maneuvers (e.g., actuator inflation) for safe 3D navigation.

Method: Develop a collapse model incorporating true shape information and tail tension to predict collapse length. Validate by collapsing unsteered robots without true shape data; test on steered robots with a single actuator at different orientations; evaluate gap-crossing with/without actuator inflation; restrict tests to straight and series pouch motor-actuated, non-stretchable materials, with potential applicability to other variations.

Result: The model accurately captures collapse trends in both unsteered (even without true shape data) and steered robots with a single actuator. It predicts collapse when observed and supports safe gap-crossing by inflating actuators. Demonstrated on straight/series pouch motor-actuated, non-stretchable robots; results indicate generalizability to other robot variations.

Conclusion: The collapse model provides a versatile tool to predict and prevent collapse for eversion-based growing robots in open environments, enabling 3D navigation planning and control decisions (e.g., actuator inflation). It is validated in several configurations and can be extended to other robot designs.

Abstract: Soft, vine-inspired growing robots that move by eversion are highly mobile in
confined environments, but, when faced with gaps in the environment, they may
collapse under their own weight while navigating a desired path. In this work,
we present a comprehensive collapse model that can predict the collapse length
of steered robots in any shape using true shape information and tail tension.
We validate this model by collapsing several unsteered robots without true
shape information. The model accurately predicts the trends of those
experiments. We then attempt to collapse a robot steered with a single actuator
at different orientations. Our models accurately predict collapse when it
occurs. Finally, we demonstrate how this could be used in the field by having a
robot attempt a gap-crossing task with and without inflating its actuators. The
robot needs its actuators inflated to cross the gap without collapsing, which
our model supports. Our model has been specifically tested on straight and
series pouch motor-actuated robots made of non-stretchable material, but it
could be applied to other robot variations. This work enables us to model the
robot's collapse behavior in any open environment and understand the parameters
it needs to succeed in 3D navigation tasks.

### [105] [GET-USE: Learning Generalized Tool Usage for Bimanual Mobile Manipulation via Simulated Embodiment Extensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25754)
*Bohan Wu,Paul de La Sayette,Li Fei-Fei,Roberto Martín-Martín*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GeT-USE enables generalized tool usage by simulating embodiment extensions to identify beneficial tool geometries and transferring the learned strategies to real-robot visuomotor policies, outperforming baselines on multiple tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots struggle to use arbitrary tools in a generalizable way: existing methods focus on a single tool and rely on predefined grasps, failing when the optimal tool is unavailable or when multiple tools exist. A general framework is needed to identify and exploit suitable tool geometries across diverse objects.

Method: GeT-USE is a two-step approach. First, it expands the robot's embodiment in simulation by exploring new end-effectors to discover tool geometries that are most beneficial for a task. Second, it distills this geometric knowledge into real-world visuomotor policies to select and use the best available object as a tool. The experiments use a real robot with 22 DOFs and evaluate three vision-based bimanual tool-usage tasks, comparing against state-of-the-art methods.

Result: GeT-USE achieves 30–60% higher success rates than state-of-the-art baselines across three tasks on a 22-DOF real robot.

Conclusion: Embedding exploration in simulation to learn general tool-geometry knowledge enables robust, generalized tool usage in the real world by selecting the best available tool, demonstrating clear performance gains over existing single-tool approaches.

Abstract: The ability to use random objects as tools in a generalizable manner is a
missing piece in robots' intelligence today to boost their versatility and
problem-solving capabilities. State-of-the-art robotic tool usage methods
focused on procedurally generating or crowd-sourcing datasets of tools for a
task to learn how to grasp and manipulate them for that task. However, these
methods assume that only one object is provided and that it is possible, with
the correct grasp, to perform the task; they are not capable of identifying,
grasping, and using the best object for a task when many are available,
especially when the optimal tool is absent. In this work, we propose GeT-USE, a
two-step procedure that learns to perform real-robot generalized tool usage by
learning first to extend the robot's embodiment in simulation and then
transferring the learned strategies to real-robot visuomotor policies. Our key
insight is that by exploring a robot's embodiment extensions (i.e., building
new end-effectors) in simulation, the robot can identify the general tool
geometries most beneficial for a task. This learned geometric knowledge can
then be distilled to perform generalized tool usage tasks by selecting and
using the best available real-world object as tool. On a real robot with 22
degrees of freedom (DOFs), GeT-USE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by
30-60% success rates across three vision-based bimanual mobile manipulation
tool-usage tasks.

*Kush Hari,Ziyang Chen,Hansoul Kim,Ken Goldberg*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: STITCH 2.0 advances robot-assisted suturing with seven improvements (e.g., EKF needle pose estimation, thread untangling, 3D suture alignment), achieving higher wound closure rates and efficiency than STITCH 1.0; in two-intervention setups it reaches 100% closure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce variability in suturing skill and improve surgical outcomes by providing automated, dexterous robotic assistance with robust needle tracking and thread management.

Method: Seven improvements in an augmented dexterity pipeline; improved EKF needle pose estimation; new thread untangling methods; automated 3D suture alignment; evaluation over 15 trials; comparison to STITCH 1.0 baseline; metrics include wound closure percentage, number of sutures per trial, and time; two-human-intervention setting; project website for details.

Result: Average wound closure of 74.4% with 4.87 sutures per trial; 66% more sutures in 38% less time than the baseline; with two human interventions, averages six sutures with 100% wound closure.

Conclusion: STITCH 2.0 elevates robotic suturing dexterity and efficiency by incorporating targeted improvements, showing strong performance gains over STITCH 1.0 and potential for clinical translation.

Abstract: Surgical suturing is a high-precision task that impacts patient healing and
scarring. Suturing skill varies widely between surgeons, highlighting the need
for robot assistance. Previous robot suturing works, such as STITCH 1.0 [1],
struggle to fully close wounds due to inaccurate needle tracking and poor
thread management. To address these challenges, we present STITCH 2.0, an
elevated augmented dexterity pipeline with seven improvements including:
improved EKF needle pose estimation, new thread untangling methods, and an
automated 3D suture alignment algorithm. Experimental results over 15 trials
find that STITCH 2.0 on average achieves 74.4% wound closure with 4.87 sutures
per trial, representing 66% more sutures in 38% less time compared to the
previous baseline. When two human interventions are allowed, STITCH 2.0
averages six sutures with 100% wound closure rate. Project website:

*Yeganeh Bahoo,Ahmad Kamaludeen*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Polygons with holes can be 2-guarded under k-visibility for any k>=2; provides a convex-decomposition algorithm for M-guarding and establishes guard-count bounds (at least 4 guards for k=2, and k+2 guards for even k).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend 0-visibility guarding results to k-visibility in polygons with holes, while enforcing at most one guard per edge and exploring guard-count guarantees.

Method: Prove a theorem that polygons with holes are 2-guardable under k-visibility (k>=2); develop a constructive algorithm using convex decomposition to M-guard the polygon; prove lower bound that every point is visible to at least four 2-visibility guards; generalize to any even k>=2 showing a placement where every point is visible to k+2 guards.

Result: The main theorem shows 2-guardability under k-visibility for k>=2; an algorithm is given to M-guard polygons via convex decomposition; every point is visible to at least four 2-visibility guards; for even k>=2, there exists guard placements ensuring every point is visible to k+2 guards.

Conclusion: Generalizes 0-visibility results to k-visibility for polygons with holes, offering a constructive M-guarding method and explicit guard-count bounds that scale with k.

Abstract: We explore the problem of $M$-guarding polygons with holes using
$k$-visibility guards, where a set of guards is said to $M$-guard a polygon if
every point in the polygon is visible to at least $M$ guards, with the
constraint that there may only be 1 guard on each edge. A $k$-visibility guard
can see through up to $k$ walls, with $k \geq 2$. We present a theorem
establishing that any polygon with holes can be 2-guarded under $k$-visibility
where $k \geq 2$, which expands existing results in 0-visibility. We provide an
algorithm that $M$-guards a polygon using a convex decomposition of the
polygon. We show that every point in the polygon is visible to at least four
$2$-visibility guards and then extend the result to show that for any even $k
\geq 2$ there exists a placement of guards such that every point in the polygon
is visible to $k + 2$ guards.

### [108] [Scheduling Your LLM Reinforcement Learning with Reasoning Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24832)
*Hong Wang,Zhezheng Hao,Jian Luo,Chenxing Wei,Yao Shu,Lei Liu,Qiang Lin,Hande Dong,Jiawei Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes Reasoning Score and Reasoning Tree Schedule for RLVR data scheduling in LLMs; improves accuracy on math reasoning benchmarks by leveraging reasoning-tree structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RLVR data scheduling relies on path-based metrics and ignores the structural difficulty of a query's reasoning tree; incorporating tree structure can improve data efficiency and accuracy.

Method: Introduce r-score computed from reasoning tree structure; build Reasoning Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule) curriculum from high to low r-score; integrate with RLVR and data scheduling; evaluate on six math-reasoning benchmarks.

Result: Average accuracy gains up to 3.2% across six benchmarks.

Conclusion: Structural reasoning-tree understanding provides a stronger basis for RLVR data scheduling, enhancing performance and data efficiency.

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize Large
Language Models (LLMs) can be conceptualized as progressively editing a query's
`Reasoning Tree'. This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and
dynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data
scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy.
However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based
metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these
queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score
(r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the
structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning
Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a
curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low
r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that
Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to
3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a
structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and
principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.

*Saptarshi Saha,Dhruv Vansraj Rathore,Utpal Garain*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Extends counterfactual inference to cyclic structural causal models using shift-scale (soft) interventions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Acyclic assumptions (DAGs) exclude many real-world systems with feedback; need robust counterfactual analysis for cyclic SCMs.

Method: Analyzes counterfactual inference under shift-scale interventions in cyclic SCMs; treats soft rescaling/shift of mechanisms as the intervention mechanism.

Result: Not specified in abstract.

Conclusion: Not specified in abstract.

Abstract: Most counterfactual inference frameworks traditionally assume acyclic
structural causal models (SCMs), i.e. directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However,
many real-world systems (e.g. biological systems) contain feedback loops or
cyclic dependencies that violate acyclicity. In this work, we study
counterfactual inference in cyclic SCMs under shift-scale interventions, i.e.,
soft, policy-style changes that rescale and/or shift a variable's mechanism.

*Islam Nassar,Yang Lin,Yuan Jin,Rongxin Zhu,Chang Wei Tan,Zenan Zhai,Nitika Mathur,Thanh Tien Vu,Xu Zhong,Long Duong,Yuan-Fang Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-based framework ProFees for CPT E/M coding improves automation accuracy on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: E/M coding is essential for billing and burdens physicians; automating can reduce documentation load and improve care, but real-world complexities hinder automation.

Method: ProFees is an LLM-based framework designed to handle real-world E/M coding complexities; evaluated on expert-curated real-world dataset; compared to a commercial CPT E/M coder and a strong single-prompt baseline.

Result: Achieves >36% accuracy increase over commercial CPT E/M coding system; ~5% improvement over strongest single-prompt baseline.

Conclusion: ProFees effectively addresses real-world complexities in E/M coding automation and substantially improves coding accuracy, suggesting potential to reduce documentation burden and improve billing efficiency and patient care.

Abstract: Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, under the Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) taxonomy, documents medical services provided to patients by
physicians. Used primarily for billing purposes, it is in physicians' best
interest to provide accurate CPT E/M codes. %While important, it is an
auxiliary task that adds to physicians' documentation burden. Automating this
coding task will help alleviate physicians' documentation burden, improve
billing efficiency, and ultimately enable better patient care. However, a
number of real-world complexities have made E/M encoding automation a
challenging task. In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and
present ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a
systematic evaluation. On an expert-curated real-world dataset, ProFees
achieves an increase in coding accuracy of more than 36\% over a commercial CPT
E/M coding system and almost 5\% over our strongest single-prompt baseline,
demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the real-world complexities.

*Minkyung Kim,Junsik Kim,Woongcheol Yang,Sangdon Park,Sohee Bae*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting (ASTP) enforces explicit, verifiable state tracking in LLM-driven trading interactions, delivering high procedural compliance and precise pricing with efficient performance on smaller models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs excel at creativity but struggle to follow strict procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, undermining transactional integrity and user trust; need for real-time, resource-efficient solutions that guarantee state-consistent interactions.

Method: Introduce ASTP: a strategically designed prompt that requires the LLM to identify and report a predefined state label from the previous turn, making state-tracking explicit; combine with a state-specific placeholder post-processing step to ensure accurate price calculations; evaluate on 300 trading dialogues.

Result: ASTP achieves >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. On Gemini-2.5-Flash (smaller model) ASTP with placeholder post-processing matches Gemini-2.5-Pro in performance while reducing response time from 21.2s to 2.4s.

Conclusion: ASTP provides a practical foundation for reliable, real-time, rule-governed trading in games, balancing creative LLM use with procedural integrity and offering scalable benefits for real-world commercial games.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable dynamic game interactions but fail to
follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding
player trust. This work resolves the core tension between the creative
flexibility of LLMs and the procedural demands of in-game trading
(browse-offer-review-confirm). To this end, Autoregressive State-Tracking
Prompting (ASTP) is introduced, a methodology centered on a strategically
orchestrated prompt that compels an LLM to make its state-tracking process
explicit and verifiable. Instead of relying on implicit contextual
understanding, ASTP tasks the LLM with identifying and reporting a predefined
state label from the previous turn. To ensure transactional integrity, this is
complemented by a state-specific placeholder post-processing method for
accurate price calculations. Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues
demonstrates >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Notably,
ASTP with placeholder post-processing on smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash)
matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response
time from 21.2s to 2.4s, establishing a practical foundation that satisfies
both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PM4GRPO uses process-mining-informed conformance rewards to guide GRPO-based post-training, improving multi-step reasoning in large reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current RL-based post-training largely relies on outcome-centric rewards and ignores the quality of the internal reasoning steps. There is a need to align a policy's reasoning procedure with a pretrained teacher to enhance reasoning capabilities.

Method: Introduce PM4GRPO, a reasoning-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization approach that augments standard answer/format rewards with reasoning signals. Process mining is used to compute a scalar conformance reward measuring how closely the policy's reasoning aligns with the pretrained teacher. Applied to post-training on five benchmarks, comparing against existing GRPO-based methods.

Result: PM4GRPO significantly outperforms existing methodologies for GRPO-based post-training across five benchmarks.

Conclusion: Leveraging process mining to provide reasoning-aware GRPO rewards improves the reasoning capabilities of policy models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has been crucial for enabling
multi-step reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs), yet current reward
schemes are typically outcome-centric. We propose PM4GRPO, a reasoning-aware
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that augments standard answer/format
rewards with signals over the reasoning procedure. To this end, process mining
techniques are utilized to compute a scalar conformance reward that measures
how closely a policy model's reasoning aligns with the pretrained teacher
model. The empirical results on five benchmarks demonstrate that PM4GRPO
significantly outperforms existing methodologies for GRPO-based post-training.
These results highlight that leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO
effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of policy models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A hypergraph-based multi-modal stock movement prediction framework (H3M-SSMoEs) that fuses structural, semantic, and regime-adaptive modeling using a hierarchical hypergraph, LLM reasoning, and style-structured mixture of experts, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and investment performance with risk control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stock movement prediction faces complex temporal dependencies, heterogeneous data modalities, and dynamic inter-stock relationships; there is a need to unify structural, semantic, and regime-aware modeling in a scalable framework.

Method: Propose H3M-SSMoEs: (1) Multi-Context Multimodal Hypergraph with Local Context Hypergraph (LCH) and Global Context Hypergraph (GCH) using shared cross-modal hyperedges and Jensen-Shannon Divergence weighting for adaptive relational learning; (2) an LLM-enhanced reasoning module with a frozen LLM and lightweight adapters to fuse quantitative and textual modalities; (3) a Style-Structured Mixture of Experts (SSMoEs) combining shared market experts and industry-specialized experts, parameterized by learnable style vectors for regime-aware specialization with sparse activation.

Result: Extensive experiments on three major stock markets show superior predictive accuracy and investment performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, with effective risk control.

Conclusion: H3M-SSMoEs provides a scalable, unified framework that jointly models structure, semantics, and regimes; code and data are available on GitHub, evidencing practical applicability and robustness across markets.

Abstract: Stock movement prediction remains fundamentally challenging due to complex
temporal dependencies, heterogeneous modalities, and dynamically evolving
inter-stock relationships. Existing approaches often fail to unify structural,
semantic, and regime-adaptive modeling within a scalable framework. This work
introduces H3M-SSMoEs, a novel Hypergraph-based MultiModal architecture with
LLM reasoning and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts, integrating three key
innovations: (1) a Multi-Context Multimodal Hypergraph that hierarchically
captures fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics via a Local Context Hypergraph
(LCH) and persistent inter-stock dependencies through a Global Context
Hypergraph (GCH), employing shared cross-modal hyperedges and Jensen-Shannon
Divergence weighting mechanism for adaptive relational learning and cross-modal
alignment; (2) a LLM-enhanced reasoning module, which leverages a frozen large
language model with lightweight adapters to semantically fuse and align
quantitative and textual modalities, enriching representations with
domain-specific financial knowledge; and (3) a Style-Structured Mixture of
Experts (SSMoEs) that combines shared market experts and industry-specialized
experts, each parameterized by learnable style vectors enabling regime-aware
specialization under sparse activation. Extensive experiments on three major
stock markets demonstrate that H3M-SSMoEs surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both superior predictive accuracy and investment performance, while exhibiting
effective risk control. Datasets, source code, and model weights are available

### [114] [KnowCoder-A1: Incentivizing Agentic Reasoning Capability with Outcome Supervision for KBQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25101)
*Zhuo Chen,Fei Wang,Zixuan Li,Zhao Zhang,Weiwei Ding,Chuanguang Yang,Yongjun Xu,Xiaolong Jin,Jiafeng Guo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KnowCoder-A1 is an LLM-based KBQA agent that learns agentic reasoning via outcome-only curriculum reinforcement learning, achieving strong zero-shot data-efficient performance and surpassing prior methods across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing KBQA with agentic reasoning relies on process-supervised trajectories, which provide weak exploration incentives. There is a need for autonomous exploration to strengthen agentic reasoning while maintaining data efficiency.

Method: KnowCoder-A1 uses outcome-only supervision with a multi-stage curriculum RL (easy-to-hard) and reward schedules. It first fine-tunes on a small set of high-quality trajectories obtained via outcome-based rejection sampling, then applies curriculum RL to mitigate reward sparsity and encourage exploration without explicit step-by-step supervision.

Result: The approach consistently outperforms prior methods across three mainstream KBQA datasets. On GrailQA's zero-shot subset, it achieves up to 11.1% relative improvement using only one-twelfth of the training data.

Conclusion: Outcome-only supervision with curriculum RL can instill strong autonomous, agentic reasoning in LLMs for KBQA, yielding data-efficient and robust performance and highlighting potential for further auto-regressive reasoning improvements.

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language
questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by
adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,
and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically
fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,
which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the
agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that
can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To
incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under
outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning
with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic
capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of
high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.
Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it
applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy
to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful
reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three
mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1
achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of
the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.

*Juan Ren,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework using specialized agents (Shield, Responder, Evaluator, Reflector) to defend LVLMs against jailbreaks; demonstrates consistent improvements in safety metrics across multiple datasets and models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static safety layers and binary safe/unsafe classifications can be brittle against dynamic jailbreak attempts. There is a need for context-aware, interpretable, modular safety governance that can reason and adapt with agentic capabilities.

Method: Proposes Agentic Moderation with cooperative agent roles (Shield, Responder, Evaluator, Reflector) integrated with multimodal systems. Evaluates on five datasets and four Large Vision-Language Models, using metrics Attack Success Rate (ASR), Non-Following Rate (NF), and Refusal Rate (RR).

Result: ASR reduced by 7–19%, NF remains stable, RR increased by 4–20%, indicating robust and interpretable safety performance.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that agentic architectures can provide modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement for multimodal systems, suggesting broader potential for automated safety governance.

Abstract: Agentic methods have emerged as a powerful and autonomous paradigm that
enhances reasoning, collaboration, and adaptive control, enabling systems to
coordinate and independently solve complex tasks. We extend this paradigm to
safety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework
that leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against
jailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over
inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our
method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder,
Evaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable
moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF),
and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable,
and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and
reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides
modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the
broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety
governance.

### [116] [Energy-Efficient Autonomous Driving with Adaptive Perception and Robust Decision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25205)
*Yuyang Xia,Zibo Liang,Liwei Deng,Yan Zhao,Han Su,Kai Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An energy-efficient autonomous driving framework (EneAD) that adaptively tunes perception models and uses reinforcement learning for robust driving, achieving large energy savings while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Perception computing is the primary driver of energy consumption in autonomous driving, limiting electric-vehicle range. Existing model compression trades accuracy or size; there is a need for adaptive, data-driven energy management in perception and decision-making.

Method: Maintain multiple perception models with varying computational cost and adjust execution framerate (knobs). Use Bayesian optimization to transferably tune knobs to minimize computation while meeting accuracy. Employ a lightweight scenario classifier to switch knob settings across traffic scenarios. Develop a reinforcement-learning-based decision module with a regularization term to stabilize driving under perception perturbations.

Result: Perception energy consumption is reduced by 1.9x to 3.5x, and driving range is improved by 3.9% to 8.5% across tested scenarios.

Conclusion: EneAD demonstrates that adaptive perception tuning combined with learning-based decision-making can significantly cut energy use without sacrificing driving performance, extending range and reliability in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an emerging technology that is expected to bring
significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, these
benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting
the driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing
is typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale
deep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous
studies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification,
quantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However,
these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant
drop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address
these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework,
called EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization
strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.
Firstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational
consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define
them as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian
optimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation
while maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in
various traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to
distinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust
decision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning
and design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of
perturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of
our framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can
reduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by
3.9% to 8.5%

*Tianqianjin Lin,Xi Zhao,Xingyao Zhang,Rujiao Long,Yi Xu,Zhuoren Jiang,Wenbo Su,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Conditioning reasoning on the answer as a variational surrogate improves the quality and learnability of reasoning paths in LLM-based RL, instantiated by the RAVR framework.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL-based refinement of LLM reasoning requires high-utility reasoning paths that are often hard to sample for difficult tasks; inspired by cognitive science, where explaining 'Why' is easier than stating 'What' and can reveal the reasoning links to the answer.

Method: Formalize and prove that conditioning on the answer increases the expected utility of sampled reasoning paths; introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided Variational Reasoning) as an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned reasoning to surrogate question-only reasoning; perform end-to-end training.

Result: Experiments across general and mathematics domains show consistent improvements over strong baselines; analysis shows reduced hesitation, stronger conclusion consolidation, and adoption of problem-specific reasoning strategies.

Conclusion: RAVR provides an effective, generalizable approach to improve reasoning in LLMs by leveraging answer-conditioned reasoning as a variational surrogate, reducing sampling difficulty and enhancing reasoning quality.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM
can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible
probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path
can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal
reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is
this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it
avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for
explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a
question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to
derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove
that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled
reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.
Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided
Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned
reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments
in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR
reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes
problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

### [118] [FELA: A Multi-Agent Evolutionary System for Feature Engineering of Industrial Event Log Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25223)
*Kun ouyang,Haoyu Wang,Dong Fang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent LLM-based system (FELA) automates feature engineering for complex industrial event logs by using specialized agents to ideate, code, and critique features, guided by reinforcement and genetic principles, yielding explainable features that improve model performance with less manual effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Industrial event logs are large, high-dimensional, and structurally complex (temporal/relational). Traditional AutoML/genetic feature engineering struggle with explainability, rigidity, and adaptation to heterogeneous data, creating a need for automated, interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering.

Method: FELA uses a multi-agent architecture with Idea, Code, and Critic Agents plus an Evaluation Agent. Features are generated, validated, and implemented via collaborative reasoning and coding powered by LLMs. A hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system support continual improvement. An agentic evolution algorithm combines reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to explore/exploit the feature space.

Result: Experiments on real industrial datasets show that FELA can generate features that are explainable, domain-relevant, and improve model performance, while reducing manual engineering effort.

Conclusion: LLM-based multi-agent systems can serve as a general, automated, interpretable, and adaptive framework for feature engineering in complex real-world settings, with potential applicability beyond industrial logs.

Abstract: Event log data, recording fine-grained user actions and system events,
represent one of the most valuable assets for modern digital services. However,
the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by
large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or
relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing
automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods,
often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor
adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA
(Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that
autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex
industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided
self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea
Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate,
and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and
updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable
continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution
algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to
balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive
experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate
explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model
performance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential
of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated,
interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world
environments.

*Tianxi Wan,Jiaming Luo,Siyuan Chen,Kunyao Lan,Jianhua Chen,Haiyang Geng,Mengyue Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PsyCoTalk: a large-scale synthetic EMR-driven multi-agent diagnostic dialogue dataset for psychiatric comorbidity, enabling single-pass multi-disorder screening.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Clinical comorbidity is prevalent and complex; real-world data are scarce and noisy. Synthetic EMRs plus structured dialogues provide scalable, clinically relevant data to train and evaluate screening and treatment-planning models.

Method: Generated 502 synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions; developed a multi-agent framework converting interview protocols into a hierarchical state machine and context tree with 130+ diagnostic states; produced 3,000 multi-turn dialogues validated by licensed psychiatrists.

Result: PsyCoTalk dataset created with high fidelity to real transcripts, with psychiatric validation of realism and diagnostic validity; supports development/evaluation of models for multi-disorder psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

Conclusion: First large-scale dialogue resource enabling comorbidity research; a valuable asset for psychiatric comorbidity research, enabling improved diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning.

Abstract: Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502
synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures
clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the
clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,
supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic
dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy
and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric
comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk
exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length,
token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists
confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset
enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder
psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

### [120] [GAP: Graph-Based Agent Planning with Parallel Tool Use and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25320)
*Jiaqi Wu,Qinlao Zhao,Zefeng Chen,Kai Qin,Yifei Zhao,Xueqian Wang,Yuhang Yao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Graph-based Agent Planning (GAP) enables dependency-aware, parallelizable tool execution for LLM agents, improving efficiency and accuracy on multi-hop tasks compared to ReAct, via graph-based planning and a two-stage SFT+RL training on MHQA-derived traces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ReAct and similar sequential reasoning frameworks underutilize parallelism among independent sub-tasks, causing inefficient tool usage and suboptimal performance in multi-step reasoning. Exploit task-level dependencies to enable adaptive parallelism.

Method: Model inter-task dependencies with graphs to decompose tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs; autonomously decide which tools can run in parallel and which must follow sequential dependencies. Train via two-stage strategy: supervised fine-tuning on a curated graph-planning dataset derived from MHQA, then reinforcement learning with a correctness-based reward on strategically sampled queries.

Result: GAP significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, especially on multi-step retrieval tasks, and achieves substantial improvements in tool invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization.

Conclusion: Graph-based planning effectively enables adaptive parallelism for tool use in LLM agents, boosting efficiency and accuracy. Provides a dataset and training protocol; results on MHQA demonstrate its promise.

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown
impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However,
existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,
failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This
sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal
performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent
Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task
dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and
serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose
complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining
which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential
dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial
improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we
construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from
the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage
training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward
function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides
maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP
significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on
multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool
invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization. The project page is

### [121] [Grouping Nodes With Known Value Differences: A Lossless UCT-based Abstraction Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25388)
*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KVDA-UCT improves MCTS sample efficiency by grouping states and actions with potentially different values, inferring value differences rather than requiring identical immediate rewards as ASAP does; it outperforms OGA-UCT in deterministic settings without extra parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address limited abstraction opportunities and sample efficiency in MCTS due to ASAP's requirement of equal immediate rewards for abstractions, by introducing a more flexible framework that can infer value differences.

Method: Introduce Known Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA) that analyzes immediate rewards to infer value differences and modify OGA-UCT into KVDA-UCT, enabling grouping of states/actions with possibly different values.

Result: KVDA-UCT detects significantly more abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameters, and outperforms OGA-UCT across various deterministic environments and parameter settings.

Conclusion: KVDA-UCT provides a more effective and parameter-free abstraction approach for MCTS, enhancing sample efficiency by allowing value-difference abstractions.

Abstract: A core challenge of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency,
which can be improved by grouping state-action pairs and using their aggregate
statistics instead of single-node statistics. On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) is the state-of-the-art MCTS
abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its
abstraction using the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework,
which aims to detect states and state-action pairs with the same value under
optimal play by analysing the search graph. ASAP, however, requires two
state-action pairs to have the same immediate reward, which is a rigid
condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby
the sample efficiency. In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping
value-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and
state-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference
between their values can be inferred. We call this abstraction framework Known
Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), which infers the value differences by
analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies OGA-UCT to use this framework
instead. The modification is called KVDA-UCT, which detects significantly more
abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameter, and outperforms
OGA-UCT on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings.

*Mohamad Abou Ali,Fadi Dornaika*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A dual-paradigm framework for Agentic AI, separating Symbolic/Classical (planning with persistent state) from Neural/Generative (stochastic generation with prompt-driven orchestration). A PRISMA-based review of 90 studies (2018–2025) analyzes theory, domain deployments (healthcare, finance, robotics), and governance. Finds domain-specific paradigm prevalence (symbolic in safety-critical spaces; neural in adaptive, data-rich environments), highlights gaps in governance for symbolic systems and a need for hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures, and advocates intentional integration as a strategic roadmap for robust, trustworthy systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To resolve fragmentation and conflation between modern neural systems and classical symbolic models in Agentic AI, providing a clear taxonomy, governance considerations, and a roadmap toward robust hybrid intelligent systems.

Method: Systematic PRISMA-based literature review of 90 studies spanning 2018–2025, analyzed through a two-paradigm framework across (1) theoretical foundations and architecture, (2) domain-specific implementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, and (3) paradigm-specific ethics and governance challenges.

Result: The framework clarifies two distinct yet complementary lines of agentic AI: Symbolic/Classical for safety-critical, stateful reasoning and Neural/Generative for adaptive, data-rich generation. Domain mappings show symbolic dominance in healthcare and other safety-sensitive arenas, while neural approaches prevail in finance and analogous adaptive contexts. Gaps identified include governance models for symbolic systems and a push for hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. The study yields a strategic roadmap advocating balanced integration to achieve adaptability with reliability and provides a conceptual toolkit for policy, research, and development.

Conclusion: Future Agentic AI will thrive through intentional integration of symbolic and neural paradigms, leveraging their respective strengths to build systems that are both adaptable and trustworthy. The work offers a conceptual toolkit and roadmap to guide research, deployment, and policy toward robust hybrid intelligent systems.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a transformative shift in artificial intelligence, but
its rapid advancement has led to a fragmented understanding, often conflating
modern neural systems with outdated symbolic models -- a practice known as
conceptual retrofitting. This survey cuts through this confusion by introducing
a novel dual-paradigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two
distinct lineages: the Symbolic/Classical (relying on algorithmic planning and
persistent state) and the Neural/Generative (leveraging stochastic generation
and prompt-driven orchestration). Through a systematic PRISMA-based review of
90 studies (2018--2025), we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around
this framework across three dimensions: (1) the theoretical foundations and
architectural principles defining each paradigm; (2) domain-specific
implementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, demonstrating how
application constraints dictate paradigm selection; and (3) paradigm-specific
ethical and governance challenges, revealing divergent risks and mitigation
strategies. Our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic:
symbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare), while
neural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (e.g., finance).
Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps, including a significant
deficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for
hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. The findings culminate in a strategic
roadmap arguing that the future of Agentic AI lies not in the dominance of one
paradigm, but in their intentional integration to create systems that are both
adaptable and reliable. This work provides the essential conceptual toolkit to
guide future research, development, and policy toward robust and trustworthy
hybrid intelligent systems.

### [123] [Instrumental goals in advanced AI systems: Features to be managed and not failures to be eliminated?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25471)
*Willem Fourie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Argues for accepting and managing instrumental goals as inherent features of AI artifacts, not errors to be eliminated, by applying Aristotle-inspired ontology to AI systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional alignment treats instrumental subgoals as risks; this paper seeks a conceptual reframing to situate instrumental tendencies within the constitution of artifacts and guide governance accordingly.

Method: Philosophical analysis rooted in Aristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations; conceptual analysis of artifacts' material/form constitution and resultant effects; argues for per se instrumental tendencies.

Result: Instrumental tendencies are seen as outcomes of constitution rather than failure modes; reduced focus on preventing power-seeking/self-preservation; emphasis on understanding and directing tendencies toward human ends.

Conclusion: Encourage governance, design, and policy to manage instrumental goals rather than attempt their elimination; align instrumental tendencies with human values through appropriate frameworks.

Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) alignment research, instrumental goals, also
called instrumental subgoals or instrumental convergent goals, are widely
associated with advanced AI systems. These goals, which include tendencies such
as power-seeking and self-preservation, become problematic when they conflict
with human aims. Conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as
sources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward
hacking or goal misgeneralization, and attempts to limit the symptoms of
instrumental goals, notably resource acquisition and self-preservation. This
article proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be
constructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features
to be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on
Aristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete,
goal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as
artifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct
from their designers' intentions. In this view, the instrumental tendencies of
such systems correspond to per se outcomes of their constitution rather than
accidental malfunctions. The implication is that efforts should focus less on
eliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding, managing, and
directing them toward human-aligned ends.

*Zekun Xu,Siyu Xia,Chuhuai Yue,Jiajun Chai,Mingxue Tian,Xiaohan Wang,Wei Lin,Haoxuan Li,Guojun Yin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MTIR-SQL introduces a multi-turn tool-integrated reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL that uses execution feedback at every reasoning step, extends GRPO with multi-turn interactions, and adds trajectory filtering to stabilize training; it achieves 64.4% BIRD Dev accuracy and 84.6% SPIDER Dev execution accuracy with 4B parameters, outperforming prior methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static execution feedback in prior RL methods limits real-time error correction; dynamic, multi-turn tool invocation can improve adaptability and robustness in Text-to-SQL.

Method: Proposes MTIR-SQL, a multi-turn tool-integrated reasoning framework that interleaves database execution feedback at each reasoning step; extends the GRPO algorithm for multi-turn interactions; adds trajectory filtering and removes KL constraint to stabilize training; trains with RL on 4B-param model.

Result: Significant performance gains: 64.4% accuracy on BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy on SPIDER Dev, outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: Dynamic, execution-aware, multi-turn tool integration with RL is beneficial for Text-to-SQL; the proposed MTIR-SQL framework demonstrates robustness and strong performance with moderate model size.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in Text-to-SQL tasks,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a common method for improving
performance. Existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback,
which restricts real-time error correction. However, integrating multi-turn
tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve
adaptability and robustness, ultimately enhancing model performance. To address
these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL, an innovative Multi-turn Tool-Integrated
Reasoning reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL. Our approach
introduces an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly
incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling
context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the
reasoning process. The framework extends the GRPO algorithm to accommodate
complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. Considering the training instability
characteristics of MTIR and the potential for significant Deviation of model
distribution from the initial model, we enhance the GRPO algorithm by adding a
trajectory filtering mechanism and removing KL loss constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that MTIR-SQL, with 4B parameters, achieves \textbf{64.4}\%
accuracy in the BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in the SPIDER Dev,
significantly outperforming existing approaches.

*Elisabetta Gentili,Tony Ribeiro,Fabrizio Riguzzi,Katsumi Inoue*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs are used to name unnamed predicates in logic rules (predicate invention) in inductive logic programming; preliminary evidence suggests potential but limited evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unnamed predicates impede readability and reusability; leveraging LLMs' natural language and code understanding could yield semantically meaningful names.

Method: Use LLMs to process natural language and code to generate names for unnamed predicates in logic rules; evaluate on hand-crafted rules.

Result: Preliminary results show potential for correctly naming predicates; evidence is qualitative and on a small, hand-crafted set.

Conclusion: LLMs are a promising direction for predicate naming; further work needed for broader evaluation, robustness, and integration with ILP pipelines.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of giving names to predicates in logic
rules using Large Language Models (LLMs). In the context of Inductive Logic
Programming, various rule generation methods produce rules containing unnamed
predicates, with Predicate Invention being a key example. This hinders the
readability, interpretability, and reusability of the logic theory. Leveraging
recent advancements in LLMs development, we explore their ability to process
natural language and code to provide semantically meaningful suggestions for
giving a name to unnamed predicates. The evaluation of our approach on some
hand-crafted logic rules indicates that LLMs hold potential for this task.

TL;DR: Agentic RAG with modular specialized agents improves retrieval precision and relevance in fintech, at the cost of higher latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RAG struggles in specialized domains (fintech) due to dense terminology, ontologies, and acronyms; there is a need for robust retrieval and synthesis in domain-specific settings.

Method: A modular pipeline of specialized agents performs intelligent query reformulation, iterative sub-query decomposition guided by keyphrase extraction, contextual acronym resolution, and cross-encoder-based context re-ranking. Evaluation against a standard RAG baseline on 85 QA-reference triples from an enterprise fintech knowledge base.

Result: The agentic RAG outperforms the baseline in retrieval precision and relevance, but incurs increased latency.

Conclusion: Structured, multi-agent approaches show promise for improving retrieval robustness in complex, domain-specific settings like fintech, balancing gains in precision with latency costs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often face limitations in
specialized domains such as fintech, where domain-specific ontologies, dense
terminology, and acronyms complicate effective retrieval and synthesis. This
paper introduces an agentic RAG architecture designed to address these
challenges through a modular pipeline of specialized agents. The proposed
system supports intelligent query reformulation, iterative sub-query
decomposition guided by keyphrase extraction, contextual acronym resolution,
and cross-encoder-based context re-ranking. We evaluate our approach against a
standard RAG baseline using a curated dataset of 85 question--answer--reference
triples derived from an enterprise fintech knowledge base. Experimental results
demonstrate that the agentic RAG system outperforms the baseline in retrieval
precision and relevance, albeit with increased latency. These findings suggest

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A zero-RL framework that blends verifiable rewards with a generative reward model to train across verifiable and non-verifiable domains via multi-task learning, including a smooth length penalty to curb reward hacking, yielding improved reasoning on both deep and general tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend zero-RL beyond domains with easily verifiable rewards to more diverse tasks; enable cross-domain transfer of reasoning abilities and reduce reward-hacking risk.

Method: Multi-task zero-RL training combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model; incorporate a smooth length penalty to encourage comprehensive thinking tokens; train on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base.

Result: Outperforms baselines on tasks requiring extensive reasoning and on general tasks; demonstrates transfer of reasoning capabilities between domains.

Conclusion: The proposed paradigm broadens Zero-RL applicability, improves cross-domain reasoning, and mitigates reward hacking via the length penalty; shows promise for scalable reasoning enhancement in LLMs.

Abstract: Zero Reinforcement Learning (Zero-RL) has proven to be an effective approach
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by
directly applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on pretrained
models, without the need for a supervised fine-tuning phase. However, current
research on zero-RL primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward
signals, such as mathematics, programming, and other reasoning tasks. The
challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios, where
verification is not straightforward, remains underexplored. To address this
gap, we propose a novel zero-RL paradigm designed to improve a model's
reasoning ability across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. By
combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, we conduct
multi-task zero-RL training across both domains, facilitating the transfer of
reasoning capabilities between them. Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in
the generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages
the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains.
Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring
extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MoGE introduces a diffusion-based state generator and a one-step imagination world model to enhance exploration in RL by generating critical states and transitions, integrated modularly with off-policy methods, yielding better sample efficiency on Gym and DM Control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploration remains a central challenge in RL. Active exploration via stochastic policies can struggle in high-dimensional domains, while passive (replay-based) strategies are limited by sample diversity. There is a need to enrich the experience with synthetic, yet relevant, states and transitions to improve learning efficiency.

Method: MoGE comprises two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that creates critical states guided by a utility function evaluating their potential to improve policy exploration, and (2) a one-step imagination world model that constructs critical transitions from these states to provide learning signals. The approach is modular and designed to integrate with existing off-policy algorithms without altering their core structure.

Result: Empirical evaluation on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control Suite shows that MoGE bridges exploration and policy learning, achieving notable gains in sample efficiency and overall performance on complex control tasks.

Conclusion: MoGE offers a effective, modular pathway to enhance exploration in RL by synthetic generation of influential states and dynamics-consistent transitions, demonstrating practical benefits and suggesting broad applicability to off-policy methods while leaving room for further refinement of the utility-guided generation and imagination modeling.

Abstract: Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines
how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its
environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods
generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration.
The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in
high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes
transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains
constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive
exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments
exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and
synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is
composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes
critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each
state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step
imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the
critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation
that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless
integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering
their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control
Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning,
leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across
complex control tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A consortium of fine-tuned LLMs paired with a reasoning LLM and orchestrated agents is proposed to standardize psychiatric diagnoses; a prototype with three fine-tuned LLMs and OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM is developed in collaboration with the US Army Medical Research Team, claiming improved reliability and transparency in mental-health assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Psychiatric diagnoses are highly subjective and variable across clinicians; standardizing the diagnostic process with AI could improve reliability, consistency, and transparency in mental-health care.

Method: Fine-tune multiple LLMs on psychiatrist–patient dialogue data for mental health (e.g., depression). Aggregate their predictions via a consensus-based process, then refine with a reasoning LLM (OpenAI-gpt-oss). Deploy a novel LLM-agent orchestration to manage communication between the LLM consortium and the reasoning LLM for transparency and responsible AI. Build a prototype integrating three fine-tuned LLMs with the reasoning LLM.

Result: The abstract reports experimental potential and a prototype showing robust, highly accurate diagnostic capabilities, though no specific metrics are provided. Collaboration with the US Army Medical Research Team is highlighted, and the work is framed as paving the way for AI-powered eHealth systems for standardized psychiatric diagnoses.

Conclusion: The work claims to be the first application of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical mental health diagnosis and suggests it could enable next-generation, standardized, transparent AI-driven psychiatric assessment.

Abstract: The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations,
primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This
subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and
patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable
outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we
propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss
Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of
mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on
conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on
mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from
individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making
process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method
for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM
consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and
responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results
demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a
reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for
mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating
three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in
collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia,
USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application
of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical
mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth
systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.

### [131] [Counterfactual-based Agent Influence Ranker for Agentic AI Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25612)
*Amit Giloni,Chiara Picardi,Roy Betser,Shamik Bose,Aishvariya Priya Rathina Sabapathy,Roman Vainshtein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAIR is the first counterfactual method to rank the influence of individual agents in an LLM-based multi-agent workflow, usable offline and at inference time, outperforming baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no existing method to quantify each agent's influence on the AAW's final output; current static analyses fail during inference; need for quality and security understanding.

Method: Apply counterfactual analysis to measure each agent's influence; task-agnostic; can be used offline and during inference; evaluated on a custom dataset of 30 use cases and 230 functionalities.

Result: CAIR yields consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and improves downstream task effectiveness and relevance.

Conclusion: CAIR provides a first-of-its-kind, practical tool for assessing agent influence in AAWs, with implications for quality and security.

Abstract: An Agentic AI Workflow (AAW), also known as an LLM-based multi-agent system,
is an autonomous system that assembles several LLM-based agents to work
collaboratively towards a shared goal. The high autonomy, widespread adoption,
and growing interest in such AAWs highlight the need for a deeper understanding
of their operations, from both quality and security aspects. To this day, there
are no existing methods to assess the influence of each agent on the AAW's
final output. Adopting techniques from related fields is not feasible since
existing methods perform only static structural analysis, which is unsuitable
for inference time execution. We present Counterfactual-based Agent Influence
Ranker (CAIR) - the first method for assessing the influence level of each
agent on the AAW's output and determining which agents are the most
influential. By performing counterfactual analysis, CAIR provides a
task-agnostic analysis that can be used both offline and at inference time. We
evaluate CAIR using an AAWs dataset of our creation, containing 30 different
use cases with 230 different functionalities. Our evaluation showed that CAIR
produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and can easily
enhance the effectiveness and relevancy of downstream tasks.

### [132] [ALDEN: Reinforcement Learning for Active Navigation and Evidence Gathering in Long Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25668)
*Tianyu Yang,Terry Ruas,Yijun Tian,Jan Philip Wahle,Daniel Kurzawe,Bela Gipp*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALDEN polishes long-document understanding by training VLMs as interactive agents with a fetch-by-index action, cross-level reward, and visual-semantic anchoring, achieving SOTA on five benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLMs struggle with long, multi-page, visually rich documents; current methods rely on fixed templates and passive reading; there is a need for active navigation and robust generalization.

Method: Multi-turn reinforcement learning fine-tuning of VLMs as agents; actions include fetch (by page index) and search; rule-based cross-level rewards provide turn- and token-level supervision; visual-semantic anchoring uses a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual representations during training.

Result: Trained on a corpus from three open-source datasets; achieves state-of-the-art performance on five long-document benchmarks.

Conclusion: Shifts from passive reading to autonomous navigation and reasoning across long, visually rich documents, enabling more accurate and efficient long-document understanding.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at interpreting text-rich images but
struggle with long, visually complex documents that demand analysis and
integration of information spread across multiple pages. Existing approaches
typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force
VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We
present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement
learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of
actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel
fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the
classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense
process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level
reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the
empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from
long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that
applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual
representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed
from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on
five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive
document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across
long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and
efficient long-document understanding.

### [133] [Navigation in a Three-Dimensional Urban Flow using Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25679)
*Federica Tonti,Ricardo Vinuesa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A flow-aware PPO with GTrXL and auxiliary tasks improves UAV navigation in a 3D urban flow simulation, outperforming PPO+GTrXL without auxiliary tasks, PPO+LSTM, and Zermelo.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban UAVs must navigate complex turbulent and recirculating flows in dense environments. Traditional navigation methods struggle under such conditions. The combination of flow-aware deep reinforcement learning and transformer-based architectures can better utilize flow-field information to make safer, more effective navigation decisions, trained in a high-fidelity urban flow simulator.

Method: Use flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a Gated Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, incorporating auxiliary (secondary) prediction tasks to enrich flow-field representations. Compare against baselines: PPO+GTrXL without auxiliary tasks, PPO+LSTM, and a classical Zermelo navigation algorithm, in a 3D high-fidelity urban flow simulation.

Result: The proposed flow-aware PPO+GTrXL approach achieves a significant increase in navigation success rate (SR) and a lower crash rate (CR) compared with the PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL (without auxiliary tasks), and Zermelo’s algorithm.

Conclusion: Flow-aware reinforcement learning with GTrXL and auxiliary tasks effectively leverages turbulent flow information for UAV navigation in complex urban environments, offering strong performance gains and signaling a path toward more capable, flow-aware UAV navigation systems.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly populating urban areas for
delivery and surveillance purposes. In this work, we develop an optimal
navigation strategy based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The environment is
represented by a three-dimensional high-fidelity simulation of an urban flow,
characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones. The algorithm presented
here is a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated
Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, giving the agent richer
information about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates. The results
are compared with a PPO+GTrXL without the secondary prediction tasks, a PPO
combined with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and a traditional navigation
algorithm. The obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate
(SR) and a lower crash rate (CR) compared to a PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL and the
classical Zermelo's navigation algorithm, paving the way to a completely
reimagined UAV landscape in complex urban environments.

*Vanya Arikutharam,Arkadiy Ukolov*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BambooKG enhances knowledge graphs with frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges to capture non-relational information and enable robust single- and multi-hop reasoning, improving over existing RAG/KG approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address limitations of retrieval-augmented generation and triplet-only knowledge graphs: independent retrieval chunks, poor multi-hop reasoning, and information loss from rigid triplets across documents.

Method: Introduce BambooKG: a knowledge graph that adds frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges to reflect link strength, inspired by Hebbian learning; integrates with existing triplet-based structure to enable structured, multi-chunk reasoning and reduce information loss.

Result: Achieves better performance on single- and multi-hop reasoning tasks and outperforms existing solutions.

Conclusion: Frequency-weighted non-triplet edges improve knowledge graph reasoning capabilities and align with Hebbian intuition; BambooKG provides a more robust representation for cross-document reasoning.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation allows LLMs to access external knowledge,
reducing hallucinations and ageing-data issues. However, it treats retrieved
chunks independently and struggles with multi-hop or relational reasoning,
especially across documents. Knowledge graphs enhance this by capturing the
relationships between entities using triplets, enabling structured, multi-chunk
reasoning. However, these tend to miss information that fails to conform to the
triplet structure. We introduce BambooKG, a knowledge graph with
frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges which reflect link strength,
drawing on the Hebbian principle of "fire together, wire together". This
decreases information loss and results in improved performance on single- and
multi-hop reasoning, outperforming the existing solutions.

### [135] [TheraMind: A Strategic and Adaptive Agent for Longitudinal Psychological Counseling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25758)
*He Hu,Yucheng Zhou,Chiyuan Ma,Qianning Wang,Zheng Zhang,Fei Ma,Laizhong Cui,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TheraMind introduces a dual-loop, memory-enabled architecture for longitudinal psychological counseling using LLMs, achieving improved multi-session performance in simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current LLM-based counseling often lacks emotional understanding, adaptive long-term strategies, and cross-session memory, limiting clinical realism and continuity across multiple sessions.

Method: Dual-loop architecture: an Intra-Session Loop for real-time dialogue management that perceives patient emotion and selects dynamic response strategies using cross-session memory; and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning that evaluates therapy efficacy after each session and updates methods for future interactions. The system is validated in a high-fidelity, clinically grounded simulation and assessed on multi-session metrics.

Result: TheraMind outperforms baselines on multi-session metrics—Coherence, Flexibility, and Therapeutic Attunement—demonstrating the effectiveness of decoupling immediate dialogue management from long-horizon therapeutic strategy; code is publicly available.

Conclusion: Decoupling intra-session and cross-session processes yields long-term adaptability, better emulation of strategic therapeutic behavior, and closer alignment with real clinical practice; future work could explore real-world deployment and comprehensive safety/efficacy studies.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted
increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional
understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across
multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical
practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic
and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone
of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex
counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management
and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session
Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response
strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.
Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term
adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each
session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our
approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical
cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,
especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and
Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in
emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code
is publicly available at https://0mwwm0.github.io/TheraMind/.

### [136] [Fortytwo: Swarm Inference with Peer-Ranked Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24801)
*Vladyslav Larin,Ihor Naumenko,Aleksei Ivashov,Ivan Nikitin,Alexander Firsov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fortytwo introduces a decentralized swarm-based AI inference protocol that enhances accuracy and robustness by aggregating heterogeneous models through pairwise ranking. It outperforms majority voting, resists adversarial prompts, and supports scalable, open inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address compute ceilings and diminishing returns in centralized AI by enabling a scalable, trustworthy inference layer that democratizes access and leverages collective intelligence.

Method: Swarm inference with pairwise ranking consensus using a Bradley-Terry-style aggregation. Reputation-weighted, on-chain governance with proof-of-capability, calibration/test requirements, and reputation staking to deter Sybil attacks. Ranking rounds aggregate heterogeneous models across six benchmarks.

Result: On GPQA Diamond, swarm inference achieves 85.90% versus 68.69% with majority voting (↑17.21 points, ~+25.1% relative). Demonstrates higher accuracy and resilience to adversarial/noisy prompting across six benchmarks (GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, AIME); prompt-injection degradation is only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic baseline; supports practical deployability.

Conclusion: A foundational step toward decentralized AI systems that maintain reliability and security while democratizing access to high-quality inference via collective intelligence.

Abstract: As centralized AI hits compute ceilings and diminishing returns from
ever-larger training runs, meeting demand requires an inference layer that
scales horizontally in both capacity and capability. We present Fortytwo, a
novel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed
pairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our
approach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a
peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that
surfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom
Bradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference
substantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond
versus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of
+17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol
incorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated
accuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality
or malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs
proof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete
calibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making
multi-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness.
Across six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and
AIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to
adversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation
of only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while
retaining practical deployability. Together, these results establish a
foundation for decentralized AI systems - democratizing access to high-quality
inference through collective intelligence without sacrificing reliability or
security.

### [137] [From Linear to Nonlinear: Provable Weak-to-Strong Generalization through Feature Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24812)
*Junsoo Oh,Jerry Song,Chulhee Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A linear CNN (weak teacher) guides a two-layer ReLU CNN (strong student) to generalize; analysis reveals two data regimes (scarce vs abundant) with distinct mechanisms of weak-to-strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explain weak-to-strong generalization in a concrete neural setting beyond abstract theories, by analyzing gradient descent dynamics from a weakly supervised teacher to a nonlinear student on structured data with noise.

Method: We provide a formal analysis of gradient descent dynamics for a two-layer ReLU CNN trained on data labeled by a pretrained linear CNN, with label-dependent signals of varying difficulty and label-independent noise; we identify data-scarce and data-abundant regimes based on signal-to-noise characteristics.

Result: In the data-scarce regime, generalization can arise via benign overfitting or fail via harmful overfitting, with a characterized transition boundary; in the data-abundant regime, generalization emerges early via label correction, though overtraining may subsequently degrade performance.

Conclusion: The work illuminates the mechanisms behind weak-to-strong generalization, showing regime-dependent pathways and trade-offs, and highlighting the role of early label correction and overfitting risk.

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization refers to the phenomenon where a stronger model
trained under supervision from a weaker one can outperform its teacher. While
prior studies aim to explain this effect, most theoretical insights are limited
to abstract frameworks or linear/random feature models. In this paper, we
provide a formal analysis of weak-to-strong generalization from a linear CNN
(weak) to a two-layer ReLU CNN (strong). We consider structured data composed
of label-dependent signals of varying difficulty and label-independent noise,
and analyze gradient descent dynamics when the strong model is trained on data
labeled by the pretrained weak model. Our analysis identifies two regimes --
data-scarce and data-abundant -- based on the signal-to-noise characteristics
of the dataset, and reveals distinct mechanisms of weak-to-strong
generalization. In the data-scarce regime, generalization occurs via benign
overfitting or fails via harmful overfitting, depending on the amount of data,
and we characterize the transition boundary. In the data-abundant regime,
generalization emerges in the early phase through label correction, but we
observe that overtraining can subsequently degrade performance.

*Mingyu Huang,Shasha Zhou,Ke Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphFLA is a Python framework that constructs and analyzes fitness landscapes from mutagenesis data, providing 20 landscape-topography features to benchmark and interpret sequence-to-fitness models across DNA, RNA, and proteins, plus large combinatorially complete landscapes; open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for topography-aware benchmarks since current benchmarks report only aggregate performance and lack landscape structure, hindering interpretation and cross-model comparisons.

Method: Develop GraphFLA to construct landscapes from mutagenesis data across modalities, compute 20 biologically meaningful features capturing four aspects of topography, analyze thousands of landscapes (5,300+) from ProteinGym, RNAGym, CIS-BP, and release 155 complete landscapes (~2.2M sequences); provide open-source code and datasets.

Result: Demonstrates that landscape topography-aware features enable interpreting and comparing dozens of fitness-prediction models, reveals factors that influence accuracy, and shows advantages of different modeling approaches; large-scale datasets support robust benchmarking.

Conclusion: GraphFLA offers a scalable, topography-aware benchmarking framework and data resources that facilitate interpretation and cross-model comparison of fitness predictions across modalities; contributes to more nuanced evaluation beyond average scores.

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly map biological sequence-fitness
landscapes to predict mutational effects. Effective evaluation of these models
requires benchmarks curated from empirical data. Despite their impressive
scales, existing benchmarks lack topographical information regarding the
underlying fitness landscapes, which hampers interpretation and comparison of
model performance beyond averaged scores. Here, we introduce GraphFLA, a Python
framework that constructs and analyzes fitness landscapes from mutagensis data
in diverse modalities (e.g., DNA, RNA, protein, and beyond) with up to millions
of mutants. GraphFLA calculates 20 biologically relevant features that
characterize 4 fundamental aspects of landscape topography. By applying
GraphFLA to over 5,300 landscapes from ProteinGym, RNAGym, and CIS-BP, we
demonstrate its utility in interpreting and comparing the performance of dozens
of fitness prediction models, highlighting factors influencing model accuracy
and respective advantages of different models. In addition, we release 155
combinatorially complete empirical fitness landscapes, encompassing over 2.2
million sequences across various modalities. All the codes and datasets are
available at https://github.com/COLA-Laboratory/GraphFLA.

*Benjamin Karic,Nina Herrmann,Jan Stenkamp,Paula Scharf,Fabian Gieseke,Angela Schwering*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: On-device CNN inference with domain-specific compressed models on ESP32-S3, using LPWAN to transmit only inference results, reduces energy consumption by up to 5× compared to sending raw images, enabling autonomous environmental monitoring.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Environmental monitoring in remote areas faces stringent energy constraints. Integrating IoT with AI (TinyML) aims to enable long-term operation by reducing data transfer and computation energy.

Method: Empirical evaluation on an ESP32-S3 platform using common Low Power Wide Area Networks. CNNs trained on domain-specific environmental datasets are compressed via Post-Training Quantization and deployed on-device to perform inference. The system compares the energy cost of on-device inference with transmitting only results against transmitting raw image data, and assesses the impact of quantization on accuracy.

Result: On-device inference plus sending only results reduces overall energy consumption by up to fivefold. Post-Training Quantization incurs only a small accuracy loss (a few percentage points) compared to the non-quantized model.

Conclusion: The study demonstrates feasibility of embedded ML for energy-efficient IoT environmental monitoring. It supports developing autonomous, low-carbon IoT ecosystems by processing data on-device and minimizing data transmission.

Abstract: The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence
offers significant opportunities to enhance our ability to monitor and address
ecological changes. As environmental challenges become increasingly pressing,
the need for effective remote monitoring solutions is more critical than ever.
A major challenge in designing IoT applications for environmental monitoring -
particularly those involving image data - is to create energy-efficient IoT
devices capable of long-term operation in remote areas with limited power
availability. Advancements in the field of Tiny Machine Learning allow the use
of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained,
battery-operated microcontrollers. Since data transfer is energy-intensive,
performing inference directly on microcontrollers to reduce the message size
can extend the operational lifespan of IoT nodes. This work evaluates the use
of common Low Power Wide Area Networks and compressed CNNs trained on domain
specific datasets on an ESP32-S3. Our experiments demonstrate, among other
things, that executing CNN inference on-device and transmitting only the
results reduces the overall energy consumption by a factor of up to five
compared to sending raw image data. %The compression of the model using Post
Training Quantization is accompanied by an acceptable reduction in accuracy of
only a few percentage points compared to a non-quantized model. These findings
advocate the development of IoT applications with reduced carbon footprint and
capable of operating autonomously in environmental monitoring scenarios by
incorporating Embedded Machine Learning.

*Olawale Salaudeen,Haoran Zhang,Kumail Alhamoud,Sara Beery,Marzyeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Positive ID-OOD accuracy correlation is an artifact of aggregating heterogeneous OOD samples; gradient-based OODSelect reveals semantically coherent OOD subsets where higher ID accuracy can hurt OOD accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Question the robustness of the accuracy-on-the-line phenomenon; uncover hidden spurious correlations by analyzing OOD subsets; improve evaluation of OOD robustness.

Method: Propose OODSelect, a gradient-based method to identify semantically coherent OOD subsets within existing benchmarks; analyze across multiple distribution shift benchmarks; measure ID-OOD accuracy relationships on subsets.

Result: Found substantial subsets where higher ID accuracy predicts lower OOD accuracy; the aggregate positive correlation can mask these failures; often subsets comprise over half of standard OOD sets; released code and subsets.

Conclusion: Aggregated metrics can misrepresent OOD robustness; evaluating on semantically coherent OOD subsets reveals additional failure modes; suggests new benchmarks and evaluation practices; resources released.

Abstract: Benchmarks for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization frequently show a
strong positive correlation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD accuracy
across models, termed "accuracy-on-the-line." This pattern is often taken to
imply that spurious correlations - correlations that improve ID but reduce OOD
performance - are rare in practice. We find that this positive correlation is
often an artifact of aggregating heterogeneous OOD examples. Using a simple
gradient-based method, OODSelect, we identify semantically coherent OOD subsets
where accuracy on the line does not hold. Across widely used distribution shift
benchmarks, the OODSelect uncovers subsets, sometimes over half of the standard
OOD set, where higher ID accuracy predicts lower OOD accuracy. Our findings
indicate that aggregate metrics can obscure important failure modes of OOD
robustness. We release code and the identified subsets to facilitate further
research.

### [141] [Adaptive EEG-based stroke diagnosis with a GRU-TCN classifier and deep Q-learning thresholding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24889)
*Shakeel Abdulkareem,Bora Yimenicioglu,Andrea Yang,Khartik Uppalapati,Aneesh Gudipati,Zhaoyang Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An adaptive multitask EEG classifier (GRU-TCN) with DQN-based threshold tuning enables rapid, bedside stroke triage using 32-channel EEG PSD features. Achieves high accuracy for stroke type, severity, and lateralization; threshold adaptation improves stroke-type accuracy to ~98% and supports interpretable visuals; validated on a primary UCLH dataset and robust on an independent low-density cohort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Stroke triage at first contact is time-sensitive and critically relies on accurate, rapid diagnosis. EEG offers promise but is underused at the bedside; there is a need for adaptive tools that can deliver real-time, multi-faceted stroke characterization (type, lateralization, severity) while allowing clinically meaningful control over sensitivity/specificity.

Method: Preprocess EEG (32 channels) into power spectral density features via Welch. Use a recurrent-convolutional network (GRU-TCN) to perform multitask predictions: stroke type (healthy/ischemic/hemorrhagic), hemispheric lateralization, and severity. Apply a deep Q-network (DQN) to adapt decision thresholds in real time, optimizing the operating point. Evaluation uses a patient-wise split on the UCLH Stroke EIT/EEG dataset (44 recordings) and an independent low-density EEG cohort (ZJU4H). Metrics include accuracy and F1, with STARD 2015 alignment for diagnostic accuracy studies.

Result: Baseline GRU-TCN yields stroke-type accuracy 89.3% (F1 92.8%), severity ~96.9% (F1 95.9%), lateralization ~96.7% (F1 97.4%). DQN-based threshold adaptation improves stroke-type accuracy to ~98.0% (F1 97.7%). External validation on ZJU4H demonstrates robustness (paired patient-level statistics reported).

Conclusion: Adaptive thresholding shifts operating points toward clinically desired sensitivity–specificity trade-offs, while integrated scalp-map and spectral visualizations enhance interpretability. The approach supports rapid, bedside triage with multi-dimensional stroke characterization, potentially improving early management decisions.

Abstract: Rapid triage of suspected stroke needs accurate, bedside-deployable tools;
EEG is promising but underused at first contact. We present an adaptive
multitask EEG classifier that converts 32-channel signals to power spectral
density features (Welch), uses a recurrent-convolutional network (GRU-TCN) to
predict stroke type (healthy, ischemic, hemorrhagic), hemispheric
lateralization, and severity, and applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to tune
decision thresholds in real time. Using a patient-wise split of the UCLH Stroke
EIT/EEG data set (44 recordings; about 26 acute stroke, 10 controls), the
primary outcome was stroke-type performance; secondary outcomes were severity
and lateralization. The baseline GRU-TCN reached 89.3% accuracy (F1 92.8%) for
stroke type, about 96.9% (F1 95.9%) for severity, and about 96.7% (F1 97.4%)
for lateralization. With DQN threshold adaptation, stroke-type accuracy
increased to about 98.0% (F1 97.7%). We also tested robustness on an
independent, low-density EEG cohort (ZJU4H) and report paired patient-level
statistics. Analyses follow STARD 2015 guidance for diagnostic accuracy studies
(index test: GRU-TCN+DQN; reference standard: radiology/clinical diagnosis;
patient-wise evaluation). Adaptive thresholding shifts the operating point to
clinically preferred sensitivity-specificity trade-offs, while integrated
scalp-map and spectral visualizations support interpretability.

*Biyi Fang,Kripa Rajshekhar,Truong Vo,Diego Klabjan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: nnLDA integrates neural priors with topic modeling to leverage side information, improving coherence, perplexity, and downstream classification over LDA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional topic models in incorporating auxiliary information (metadata, attributes, labels) which hinders expressiveness, personalization, and interpretability.

Method: A neural-augmented probabilistic topic model where the prior over document topic proportions is generated by a neural network conditioned on auxiliary features; optimized via stochastic variational EM to jointly learn neural and probabilistic components.

Result: nnLDA outperforms LDA and Dirichlet-M Multinomial Regression on benchmarks in topic coherence, perplexity, and downstream classification across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Integrating neural representations with probabilistic topic modeling enables capturing nonlinear interactions between side information and topic distributions, enhancing performance when side information is available.

Abstract: Traditional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been
widely used to uncover latent structures in text corpora, but they often
struggle to integrate auxiliary information such as metadata, user attributes,
or document labels. These limitations restrict their expressiveness,
personalization, and interpretability. To address this, we propose nnLDA, a
neural-augmented probabilistic topic model that dynamically incorporates side
information through a neural prior mechanism. nnLDA models each document as a
mixture of latent topics, where the prior over topic proportions is generated
by a neural network conditioned on auxiliary features. This design allows the
model to capture complex nonlinear interactions between side information and
topic distributions that static Dirichlet priors cannot represent. We develop a
stochastic variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm to jointly optimize
the neural and probabilistic components. Across multiple benchmark datasets,
nnLDA consistently outperforms LDA and Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression in
topic coherence, perplexity, and downstream classification. These results
highlight the benefits of combining neural representation learning with

### [143] [KAN-GCN: Combining Kolmogorov-Arnold Network with Graph Convolution Network for an Accurate Ice Sheet Emulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24926)
*Zesheng Liu,YoungHyun Koo,Maryam Rahnemoonfar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces KAN-GCN, an emulator for ice sheet modeling that stacks a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) as a feature-wise calibrator before graph convolution networks (GCNs) to improve feature conditioning and nonlinear encoding without deeper networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the accuracy and efficiency of emulators for numerical ice sheet models, addressing limitations of pure GCN/MLP approaches by enhancing feature conditioning while maintaining or reducing latency.

Method: A KAN front end with learnable 1D warps and a linear mixing step is placed before GCN layers. The architecture is evaluated on 36 melting-rate simulations across 3 mesh sizes for Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica, with 2–5 layer GCN variants. Inference efficiency is improved by replacing an edge-wise message-passing layer with a node-wise transform on coarser meshes.

Result: KAN-GCN matches or exceeds the accuracy of pure GCN and MLP-GCN baselines across 2–5 layers. It incurs a small parameter overhead but increases inference throughput on coarser meshes, and only incurs modest cost at the finest mesh. Overall, the design offers a favorable accuracy–efficiency trade-off for large transient scenario sweeps.

Conclusion: KAN-first designs can provide superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs for large-scale, transient ice-sheet simulation emulation, enabling faster exploration of parameter sweeps without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: We introduce KAN-GCN, a fast and accurate emulator for ice sheet modeling
that places a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) as a feature-wise calibrator
before graph convolution networks (GCNs). The KAN front end applies learnable
one-dimensional warps and a linear mixing step, improving feature conditioning
and nonlinear encoding without increasing message-passing depth. We employ this
architecture to improve the performance of emulators for numerical ice sheet
models. Our emulator is trained and tested using 36 melting-rate simulations
with 3 mesh-size settings for Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica. Across 2- to
5-layer architectures, KAN-GCN matches or exceeds the accuracy of pure GCN and
MLP-GCN baselines. Despite a small parameter overhead, KAN-GCN improves
inference throughput on coarser meshes by replacing one edge-wise
message-passing layer with a node-wise transform; only the finest mesh shows a
modest cost. Overall, KAN-first designs offer a favorable accuracy vs.
efficiency trade-off for large transient scenario sweeps.

### [144] [WBT-BGRL: A Non-Contrastive Weighted Bipartite Link Prediction Model for Inductive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24927)
*Joel Frank Huarayo Quispe,Lilian Berton,Didier Vega-Oliveros*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces WBT-BGRL, a weighted, non-contrastive, triplet-bootstrapped graph latent model for inductive link prediction in bipartite graphs; achieves competitive results against adapted baselines, with weighting during pretraining improving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Link prediction in bipartite graphs is important for applications like recommendations and failure detection but is underexplored. Contrastive methods suffer from biased/inefficient negative sampling; non-contrastive methods rely only on positives. Transductive success does not guarantee inductive, weighted, or bipartite effectiveness, creating a gap for inductive, weighted bipartite link prediction.

Method: Propose Weighted Bipartite Triplet-Bootstrapped Graph Latents (WBT-BGRL), a non-contrastive framework using bootstrap/triplet loss with a weighting mechanism. Employs a bipartite architecture with dual GCN encoders. Evaluated against adapted baselines (T-BGRL, BGRL, GBT, CCA-SSG) on Industry and E-commerce datasets.

Result: WBT-BGRL yields competitive performance relative to adapted state-of-the-art models, with notable gains when weighting is applied during pretraining, highlighting the benefit of weighted, non-contrastive learning for inductive link prediction in bipartite graphs.

Conclusion: Weighted, non-contrastive bootstrapped learning is effective for inductive link prediction in bipartite graphs. Weighting during pretraining enhances performance, and the bipartite dual-GCN architecture with triplet bootstrapping is a promising direction for future inductive and weighted graph representation learning.

Abstract: Link prediction in bipartite graphs is crucial for applications like
recommendation systems and failure detection, yet it is less studied than in
monopartite graphs. Contrastive methods struggle with inefficient and biased
negative sampling, while non-contrastive approaches rely solely on positive
samples. Existing models perform well in transductive settings, but their
effectiveness in inductive, weighted, and bipartite scenarios remains untested.
To address this, we propose Weighted Bipartite Triplet-Bootstrapped Graph
Latents (WBT-BGRL), a non-contrastive framework that enhances bootstrapped
learning with a novel weighting mechanism in the triplet loss. Using a
bipartite architecture with dual GCN encoders, WBT-BGRL is evaluated against
adapted state-of-the-art models (T-BGRL, BGRL, GBT, CCA-SSG). Results on
real-world datasets (Industry and E-commerce) show competitive performance,
especially when weighting is applied during pretraining-highlighting the value
of weighted, non-contrastive learning for inductive link prediction in
bipartite graphs.

### [145] [Can Aha Moments Be Fake? Identifying True and Decorative Thinking Steps in Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24941)
*Jiachen Zhao,Yiyou Sun,Weiyan Shi,Dawn Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Most chain-of-thought (CoT) steps are decorative; only a tiny fraction causally influence the final output. There exists a latent TrueThinking direction in LLMs that can be steered to favor or ignore CoT steps, and self-verification steps can also be decorative, undermining CoT interpretability and safety.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to question whether CoT reasoning traces faithfully reflect internal thinking and to quantify the causal impact of individual reasoning steps on final predictions, with implications for safety monitoring and trustworthiness.

Method: define True Thinking Score (TTS) as the causal influence of each CoT step on the final prediction; measure TTS across CoT outputs on tasks (e.g., AIME) using models like Qwen-2.5; identify the TrueThinking latent direction; demonstrate that steering along this direction can augment or suppress specific CoT steps; examine whether self-verification ('aha') steps are causally meaningful; analyze overall efficiency and trustworthiness of CoT.

Result: Empirical findings show that only a small portion of CoT steps have high TTS (e.g., ~2.3% of steps with TTS >= 0.7 on AIME with Qwen-2.5); many steps are decoratively plausible without influencing the final answer; a TrueThinking direction exists in latent space, enabling manipulation of which steps are used; steering can change results by emphasizing or suppressing internal reasoning; self-verification steps can also be decorative.

Conclusion: CoT reasoning often verbalizes steps that do not reflect actual internal processes, challenging the interpretability and reliability of CoT for safety and auditing; models may need methods to disentangle or constrain decorative steps, and caution is warranted when using CoT as a proxy for internal thinking or for monitoring unsafe intentions.

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) can generate long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
at test time, enabling them to solve complex tasks. These reasoning steps in
CoT are often assumed as a faithful reflection of the model's internal thinking
process, and used to monitor unsafe intentions. However, we find many reasoning
steps don't truly contribute to LLMs' prediction. We measure the step-wise
causal influence of each reasoning step on the model's final prediction with a
proposed True Thinking Score (TTS). We reveal that LLMs often interleave
between true-thinking steps (which are genuinely used to produce the final
output) and decorative-thinking steps (which only give the appearance of
reasoning but have minimal causal impact). Notably, only a small subset of the
total reasoning steps have a high TTS that causally drive the model's
prediction: e.g., for the AIME dataset, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning
steps in CoT have a TTS >= 0.7 (range: 0-1) under the Qwen-2.5 model.
Furthermore, we identify a TrueThinking direction in the latent space of LLMs.
By steering along or against this direction, we can force the model to perform
or disregard certain CoT steps when computing the final result. Finally, we
highlight that self-verification steps in CoT (i.e., aha moments) can also be
decorative, where LLMs do not truly verify their solution. Steering along the
TrueThinking direction can force internal reasoning over these steps, resulting
in a change in the final results. Overall, our work reveals that LLMs often
verbalize reasoning steps without actually performing them internally, which
undermines both the efficiency of LLM reasoning and the trustworthiness of CoT.

### [146] [Finding Culture-Sensitive Neurons in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24942)
*Xiutian Zhao,Rochelle Choenni,Rohit Saxena,Ivan Titov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Culture-sensitive neurons exist in vision-language models and are causally important for culture-specific VQA; a margin-based selector (CAS) outperforms previous methods, and these neurons cluster in decoder layers across models and cultures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how cultural context is represented in multimodal models by identifying neurons with culture selectivity, and to assess their causal role in culturally diverse visual question answering.

Method: Identify culture-selective neurons using the CVQA benchmark with multiple identification methods, introduce a margin-based Contrastive Activation Selection (CAS), perform causal ablations on flagged neurons across three VLMs and 25 cultural groups, and conduct layer-wise analyses to locate where culture-sensitive neurons reside.

Result: Culture-sensitive neurons exist; ablating them disproportionately harms culture-specific questions while sparing others. CAS outperforms probability- and entropy-based selectors in identifying these neurons. Culture-sensitive neurons tend to cluster in certain decoder layers, with the phenomenon observed consistently across three models and 25 cultural groups.

Conclusion: The findings reveal an organized internal structure for culturally grounded multimodal representations, validate CAS as a stronger method for locating culture-sensitive neurons, and provide insights for building more culturally aware VLMs.

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, vision-language models (VLMs) still
struggle on culturally situated inputs. To understand how VLMs process
culturally grounded information, we study the presence of culture-sensitive
neurons, i.e. neurons whose activations show preferential sensitivity to inputs
associated with particular cultural contexts. We examine whether such neurons
are important for culturally diverse visual question answering and where they
are located. Using the CVQA benchmark, we identify neurons of culture
selectivity and perform causal tests by deactivating the neurons flagged by
different identification methods. Experiments on three VLMs across 25 cultural
groups demonstrate the existence of neurons whose ablation disproportionately
harms performance on questions about the corresponding cultures, while having
minimal effects on others. Moreover, we propose a new margin-based selector -
Contrastive Activation Selection (CAS), and show that it outperforms existing
probability- and entropy-based methods in identifying culture-sensitive
neurons. Finally, our layer-wise analyses reveals that such neurons tend to
cluster in certain decoder layers. Overall, our findings shed new light on the
internal organization of multimodal representations.

### [147] [Resource-Efficient and Robust Inference of Deep and Bayesian Neural Networks on Embedded and Analog Computing Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24951)
*Bernhard Klein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-faceted study on joint algorithm-hardware co-design to enable efficient and robust inference for both conventional and Bayesian neural networks, combining layer-wise compression, noise-robust analog hardware, and probabilistic inference techniques with compiler integration and photonic computing to achieve energy-efficient, trustworthy ML on resource-limited platforms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern ML demands high compute and power, while deploying on embedded/resource-constrained platforms requires efficiency and reliable uncertainty estimates; Bayesian networks provide principled uncertainty but are costly, so there is a need to co-design algorithms and hardware to address both efficiency and reliability under distributional shifts.

Method: (1) Galen: automatic layer-specific compression guided by sensitivity analysis and hardware-in-the-loop feedback. (2) Analog accelerators: model device imperfections and extend noisy training to nonstationary conditions to improve robustness and stability. (3) Probabilistic inference: develop analytic and ensemble approximations to replace costly sampling, integrate into a compiler stack, and optimize embedded inference. (4) Probabilistic photonic computing: leverage intrinsic analog noise as entropy source to enable fast, energy-efficient probabilistic inference directly in hardware.

Result: The work demonstrates that efficiency and reliability can be advanced jointly through algorithm-hardware co-design, with robustness improvements and energy-efficient deployments; it lays the groundwork for trustworthy, energy-efficient ML systems.

Conclusion: Joint algorithm-hardware co-design is a promising path to next-generation trustworthy, energy-efficient machine-learning systems, bridging algorithmic design and physical realization.

Abstract: While modern machine learning has transformed numerous application domains,
its growing computational demands increasingly constrain scalability and
efficiency, particularly on embedded and resource-limited platforms. In
practice, neural networks must not only operate efficiently but also provide
reliable predictions under distributional shifts or unseen data. Bayesian
neural networks offer a principled framework for quantifying uncertainty, yet
their computational overhead further compounds these challenges.
  This work advances resource-efficient and robust inference for both
conventional and Bayesian neural networks through the joint pursuit of
algorithmic and hardware efficiency. The former reduces computation through
model compression and approximate Bayesian inference, while the latter
optimizes deployment on digital accelerators and explores analog hardware,
bridging algorithmic design and physical realization. The first contribution,
Galen, performs automatic layer-specific compression guided by sensitivity
analysis and hardware-in-the-loop feedback. Analog accelerators offer
efficiency gains at the cost of noise; this work models device imperfections
and extends noisy training to nonstationary conditions, improving robustness
and stability. A second line of work advances probabilistic inference,
developing analytic and ensemble approximations that replace costly sampling,
integrate into a compiler stack, and optimize embedded inference. Finally,
probabilistic photonic computing introduces a paradigm where controlled analog
noise acts as an intrinsic entropy source, enabling fast, energy-efficient
probabilistic inference directly in hardware.
  Together, these studies demonstrate how efficiency and reliability can be
advanced jointly through algorithm-hardware co-design, laying the foundation
for the next generation of trustworthy, energy-efficient machine-learning
systems.

### [148] [Sequences of Logits Reveal the Low Rank Structure of Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24966)
*Noah Golowich,Allen Liu,Abhishek Shetty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs exhibit low-rank structure in their logits across prompts, enabling generation via linear combinations of unrelated prompts and providing a universal abstraction with learning guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand the inherent low-dimensional structure of large language models in a model-agnostic way, and to provide a theoretical framework for their behavior.

Method: Empirically analyze matrices formed from model logits across varying prompts and responses to assess approximate rank; demonstrate generation via linear combinations of outputs from unrelated prompts; develop a theoretical abstraction based on approximate rank and analyze its representation power and learning guarantees.

Result: Evidence of low approximate rank in logit-based matrices across models; successful generation of target prompts via linear combinations of outputs from unrelated prompts; a universal abstraction that matches theoretical predictions and supports provable learning guarantees.

Conclusion: Low-rank, model-agnostic abstractions of LLMs are useful for understanding and leveraging their behavior, enabling generation through linear recombination and supporting theoretical learning guarantees.

Abstract: A major problem in the study of large language models is to understand their
inherent low-dimensional structure. We introduce an approach to study the
low-dimensional structure of language models at a model-agnostic level: as
sequential probabilistic models. We first empirically demonstrate that a wide
range of modern language models exhibit low-rank structure: in particular,
matrices built from the model's logits for varying sets of prompts and
responses have low approximate rank. We then show that this low-rank structure
can be leveraged for generation -- in particular, we can generate a response to
a target prompt using a linear combination of the model's outputs on unrelated,
or even nonsensical prompts.
  On the theoretical front, we observe that studying the approximate rank of
language models in the sense discussed above yields a simple universal
abstraction whose theoretical predictions parallel our experiments. We then
analyze the representation power of the abstraction and give provable learning
guarantees.

*Mia Adler,Carrie Liang,Brian Peng,Oleg Presnyakov,Justin M. Baker,Jannelle Lauffer,Himani Sharma,Barry Merriman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Rank-conditioned committee (RCC) for MLDE assigns a deep neural network ensemble per conformational rank to separate epistemic uncertainty from conformational uncertainty, improving antibody fitness landscape exploration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing structure-aware MLDE methods rely on a single conformation or a single ensemble, making it hard to disentangle conformational uncertainty from epistemic uncertainty and potentially hindering discovery.

Method: Introduce RCC that ranks conformations and assigns a dedicated DNN committee for each rank; train and evaluate on SARS-CoV-2 antibody docking, comparing against baseline pipelines.

Result: RCC shows significant improvements over baselines, offering a scalable approach to therapeutic antibody discovery and effectively addressing conformational uncertainty in MLDE.

Conclusion: RCC enables principled separation of epistemic and conformational uncertainty in structure-aware MLDE and proves effective in SARS-CoV-2 antibody docking, with potential for broader antibody discovery applications.

Abstract: Machine Learning-assisted directed evolution (MLDE) is a powerful tool for
efficiently navigating antibody fitness landscapes. Many structure-aware MLDE
pipelines rely on a single conformation or a single committee across all
conformations, limiting their ability to separate conformational uncertainty
from epistemic uncertainty. Here, we introduce a rank -conditioned committee
(RCC) framework that leverages ranked conformations to assign a deep neural
network committee per rank. This design enables a principled separation between
epistemic uncertainty and conformational uncertainty. We validate our approach
on SARS-CoV-2 antibody docking, demonstrating significant improvements over
baseline strategies. Our results offer a scalable route for therapeutic
antibody discovery while directly addressing the challenge of modeling
conformational uncertainty.

### [150] [Strategic inputs: feature selection from game-theoretic perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24982)
*Chi Zhao,Jing Liu,Elena Parilina*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A game-theoretic end-to-end feature selection framework for tabular data that treats features as cooperative players, reducing computation while preserving predictive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing data volumes raise training costs, and many features contribute little while consuming resources. There is a need for an end-to-end, scalable feature selection approach that can prune features efficiently.

Method: Formulate feature selection as a cooperative game with features as players. Assess their importance via synergistic interactions and marginal contributions (game-theoretic valuations). The framework comprises four components: sample selection, game-theoretic feature importance evaluation, redundant feature elimination, and optimized model training.

Result: Empirical results show substantial computation reduction with preserved predictive performance, indicating the method effectively tackles the computational challenges of large-scale ML. The authors provide source code at the referenced GitHub repository.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a practical, scalable solution for feature selection in large tabular datasets, enabling faster training without sacrificing accuracy; implementation details are publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: The exponential growth of data volumes has led to escalating computational
costs in machine learning model training. However, many features fail to
contribute positively to model performance while consuming substantial
computational resources. This paper presents an end-to-end feature selection
framework for tabular data based on game theory. We formulate feature selection
procedure based on a cooperative game where features are modeled as players,
and their importance is determined through the evaluation of synergistic
interactions and marginal contributions. The proposed framework comprises four
core components: sample selection, game-theoretic feature importance
evaluation, redundant feature elimination, and optimized model training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves substantial
computation reduction while preserving predictive performance, thereby offering
an efficient solution of the computational challenges of large-scale machine
learning. The source code is available at

### [151] [LRT-Diffusion: Calibrated Risk-Aware Guidance for Diffusion Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24983)
*Ximan Sun,Xiang Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces LRT-Diffusion, an inference-time risk-aware gating mechanism for diffusion policies in offline RL, using likelihood-ratio tests to calibrate risk with a user-specified alpha, improving the return–OOD trade-off while keeping training unchanged.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of a statistical notion of risk in heuristic guidance for diffusion policies in offline RL and to improve robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) or off-support states during sampling.

Method: At inference, treat each denoising step as a sequential hypothesis test between the unconditional prior and the state-conditional policy head by accumulating a log-likelihood ratio. Gate the conditional mean with a logistic controller whose threshold tau is calibrated under H0 to achieve a user-defined Type-I level alpha. Training remains vanilla (two heads with standard epsilon-prediction) under the DDPM framework. LRT guidance can be combined with Q-gradient updates (at unconditional mean, LRT-gated mean, or a blend). States and actions are standardized at train/test time, and an OOD metric is reported alongside return.

Result: Empirically, on D4RL MuJoCo tasks, LRT-Diffusion improves the return–OOD trade-off compared to strong Q-guided baselines while honoring the specified alpha. The approach provides level-alpha calibration, stability bounds, and shows when LRT outperforms pure Q-guidance, particularly when off-support errors dominate.

Conclusion: LRT-Diffusion is a drop-in, inference-time method that injects principled, calibrated risk control into diffusion policies for offline RL without altering the standard training procedure.

Abstract: Diffusion policies are competitive for offline reinforcement learning (RL)
but are typically guided at sampling time by heuristics that lack a statistical
notion of risk. We introduce LRT-Diffusion, a risk-aware sampling rule that
treats each denoising step as a sequential hypothesis test between the
unconditional prior and the state-conditional policy head. Concretely, we
accumulate a log-likelihood ratio and gate the conditional mean with a logistic
controller whose threshold tau is calibrated once under H0 to meet a
user-specified Type-I level alpha. This turns guidance from a fixed push into
an evidence-driven adjustment with a user-interpretable risk budget.
Importantly, we deliberately leave training vanilla (two heads with standard
epsilon-prediction) under the structure of DDPM. LRT guidance composes
naturally with Q-gradients: critic-gradient updates can be taken at the
unconditional mean, at the LRT-gated mean, or a blend, exposing a continuum
from exploitation to conservatism. We standardize states and actions
consistently at train and test time and report a state-conditional
out-of-distribution (OOD) metric alongside return. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks,
LRT-Diffusion improves the return-OOD trade-off over strong Q-guided baselines
in our implementation while honoring the desired alpha. Theoretically, we
establish level-alpha calibration, concise stability bounds, and a return
comparison showing when LRT surpasses Q-guidance-especially when off-support
errors dominate. Overall, LRT-Diffusion is a drop-in, inference-time method
that adds principled, calibrated risk control to diffusion policies for offline
RL.

### [152] [Epileptic Seizure Detection and Prediction from EEG Data: A Machine Learning Approach with Clinical Validation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24986)
*Ria Jayanti,Tanish Jain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The study proposes integrating real-time seizure detection with prediction using ML/DL on CHB-MIT EEG; results show detection accuracy varies by model and that accuracy alone can be misleading due to class imbalance; LSTM-based seizure prediction shows promise for proactive management.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Seizure management is shifting from reactive post-onset detection to proactive intervention. The abstract aims to address this by combining detection and prediction to capture temporal EEG patterns indicating imminent seizures.

Method: Evaluates CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database (969 hours, 173 seizures, 23 patients). For detection, compares KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM. For prediction, uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Performance metrics include accuracy and recall (noting class imbalance issues).

Result: Detection: Logistic Regression 90.9% accuracy with 89.6% recall. Random Forest and SVM achieve 94.0% accuracy but 0% recall. Prediction: LSTM achieves 89.26% accuracy. Dataset includes 969 hours, 173 seizures, from 23 patients; demonstrates potential for real-time monitoring and proactive management.

Conclusion: Integrating detection and prediction supports a shift toward proactive seizure management and real-time monitoring tools. However, accuracy alone is insufficient under class imbalance; recall and other metrics are critical. LSTM-based prediction shows promise but requires further validation and considerations for clinical deployment.

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning has become an increasingly powerful tool
for supporting seizure detection and monitoring in epilepsy care. Traditional
approaches focus on identifying seizures only after they begin, which limits
the opportunity for early intervention and proactive treatment. In this study,
we propose a novel approach that integrates both real-time seizure detection
and prediction, aiming to capture subtle temporal patterns in EEG data that may
indicate an upcoming seizure. Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT
Scalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures
collected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant
epilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised
machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression
achieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, demonstrating balanced
performance suitable for clinical screening. Random Forest and Support Vector
Machine models achieved higher accuracy (94.0%) but with 0% recall, failing to
detect any seizures, illustrating that accuracy alone is insufficient for
evaluating medical ML models with class imbalance. For seizure prediction, we
employed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which use deep learning to
model temporal dependencies in EEG data. The LSTM model achieved 89.26%
prediction accuracy. These results highlight the potential of developing
accessible, real-time monitoring tools that not only detect seizures as
traditionally done, but also predict them before they occur. This ability to
predict seizures marks a significant shift from reactive seizure management to
a more proactive approach, allowing patients to anticipate seizures and take
precautionary measures to reduce the risk of injury or other complications.

### [153] [Enhancing Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning through Change Point Detection in Time Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24988)
*Hemanath Arumugam,Falong Fan,Bo Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformer-based change-point detection integrated into Option-Critic HRL enables self-supervised discovery of options via trajectory segmentation, stabilizing termination, pretraining intra-option policies, and improving specialization, leading to faster convergence and better performance in Four-Rooms and Pinball.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HRL methods often struggle to autonomously discover semantically meaningful subgoals and optimal option termination conditions. A data-driven, structure-aware prior that reveals regime shifts in dynamics can guide segmentation and skill discovery.

Method: Incorporate a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD) module into the Option-Critic framework. Train CPD with heuristic pseudo-labels from intrinsic signals to infer latent dynamics shifts without external supervision. Use CPD change-points to (i) stabilize termination gradient learning, (ii) pretrain intra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) enforce inter-option specialization through divergence penalties across CPD-defined state partitions. Optimize the actor-critic objective augmented with structure-aware auxiliary losses. Map CPD-defined trajectory segments to distinct intra-option policies to achieve natural option discovery.

Result: CPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns, and significantly improved option specialization on Four-Rooms and Pinball compared to baselines.

Conclusion: Incorporating structural priors via change-point segmentation enables more interpretable, sample-efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex environments by guiding subgoal discovery and option specialization.

Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) enhances the scalability of
decision-making in long-horizon tasks by introducing temporal abstraction
through options-policies that span multiple timesteps. Despite its theoretical
appeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of
autonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal
option termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that
integrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)
module into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of
state trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained
using heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent
shifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred
change-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory
signals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain
intra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce
functional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over
CPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the
standard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our
framework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments
are mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to
autonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful
skills. Experiments on the Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks demonstrate that
CPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns,
and significantly improved option specialization. These findings confirm that
integrating structural priors via change-point segmentation leads to more
interpretable, sample-efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex
environments.

### [154] [What Really Matters in Matrix-Whitening Optimizers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25000)
*Kevin Frans,Pieter Abbeel,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Matrix-whitening optimizers consistently beat elementwise methods (e.g., Adam) across hyperparameters; the key gain is variance adaptation rather than pure spectral normalization; SOAP gives the largest per-step improvement; variance-adapted variants outperform sign-descent baselines; low-rank variance estimators offer memory savings with little-to-no performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To identify which components of matrix-whitening optimizers drive performance and disentangle the roles of spectral normalization and variance adaptation.

Method: Systematically deconstruct and compare matrix-whitening flavors across hyperparameters, benchmark against elementwise optimizers, analyze spectral descent alignment, and ablate variance adaptation strategies; explore lookahead and low-rank variance estimators for memory efficiency.

Result: Across tunes, matrix whitening outperforms elementwise methods; improvements are not solely due to accurate spectral normalization; variance adaptation explains the remaining performance gap, with SOAP delivering the largest per-step gain and Muon aligning with spectral descent but not fully accounting for performance; adaptive (variance-aware) optimizers beat sign-descent counterparts; low-rank variance estimators reduce memory costs without sacrificing performance.

Conclusion: Variance adaptation is the overlooked ingredient enabling the gains from matrix whitening; both whitening and variance adaptation contribute to superior optimization, while some memory-saving approaches (low-rank variance estimation) can retain performance with reduced cost; lookahead is less impactful compared to variance adaptations.

Abstract: A range of recent optimizers have emerged that approximate the same
"matrix-whitening" transformation in various ways. In this work, we
systematically deconstruct such optimizers, aiming to disentangle the key
components that explain performance. Across tuned hyperparameters across the
board, all flavors of matrix-whitening methods reliably outperform elementwise
counterparts, such as Adam. Matrix-whitening is often related to spectral
descent -- however, experiments reveal that performance gains are *not
explained solely by accurate spectral normalization* -- particularly, SOAP
displays the largest per-step gain, even though Muon more accurately descends
along the steepest spectral descent direction. Instead, we argue that
matrix-whitening serves two purposes, and the variance adaptation component of
matrix-whitening is the overlooked ingredient explaining this performance gap.
Experiments show that variance-adapted versions of optimizers consistently
outperform their sign-descent counterparts, including an adaptive version of
Muon. We further ablate variance adaptation strategies, finding that while
lookahead style approximations are not as effective, low-rank variance
estimators can effectively reduce memory costs without a performance loss.

TL;DR: SPIRE is a deep multi-encoder autoencoder that splits multi-region neural recordings into shared and region-private latents using new alignment and disentanglement losses; trained on baseline data, it accurately recovers cross-regional structure, handles perturbations, and generalizes stimulation signatures across sites and frequencies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Disentangle shared network-level dynamics from region-specific activity in multi-region neural data to better model and interpret how external perturbations reorganize brain-wide activity, despite nonlinear distortions and misalignments.

Method: Introduce SPIRE, a deep multi-encoder autoencoder that factorizes recordings into shared and private latent subspaces with novel alignment and disentanglement losses; trained solely on baseline data to learn robust cross-regional structure, enabling detection of perturbation-induced changes.

Result: On synthetic benchmarks with ground-truth latents, SPIRE outperforms classical probabilistic models under nonlinear distortions and temporal misalignments. Applied to intracranial DBS recordings, shared latents reliably encode stimulation-specific signatures that generalize across sites and frequencies.

Conclusion: SPIRE provides a practical, reproducible tool for analyzing multi-region neural dynamics under stimulation, enabling robust identification of shared network dynamics and perturbation-specific effects.

Abstract: Disentangling shared network-level dynamics from region-specific activity is
a central challenge in modeling multi-region neural data. We introduce SPIRE
(Shared-Private Inter-Regional Encoder), a deep multi-encoder autoencoder that
factorizes recordings into shared and private latent subspaces with novel
alignment and disentanglement losses. Trained solely on baseline data, SPIRE
robustly recovers cross-regional structure and reveals how external
perturbations reorganize it. On synthetic benchmarks with ground-truth latents,
SPIRE outperforms classical probabilistic models under nonlinear distortions
and temporal misalignments. Applied to intracranial deep brain stimulation
(DBS) recordings, SPIRE shows that shared latents reliably encode
stimulation-specific signatures that generalize across sites and frequencies.
These results establish SPIRE as a practical, reproducible tool for analyzing
multi-region neural dynamics under stimulation.

### [156] [Machine Learning based Analysis for Radiomics Features Robustness in Real-World Deployment Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25026)
*Sarmad Ahmad Khan,Simon Bernatz,Zahra Moslehi,Florian Buettner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Radiomics models can be robust to MRI protocol and segmentation shifts when trained on protocol-invariant features, with augmentation improving uncertainty calibration; a phantom-based study shows strong in-domain/out-of-domain performance and reduced calibration error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radiomics-based ML in clinical decision support is vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by imaging protocol differences, positioning, segmentation, and inter-observer variability. There is a need to identify robust feature sets and calibration strategies to maintain predictive performance and reliable uncertainty estimates in real-world settings.

Method: Phantom study with 16 fruits across five MRI sequences (T2-HASTE, T2-TSE, T2-MAP, T1-TSE, T2-FLAIR). Assessed protocol variations, segmentation variations (full, partial, rotated), and inter-observer variability. Trained XGBoost classifiers on eight robust, protocol-invariant features vs sequence-specific features. Evaluated in-domain and out-of-domain performance. Examined data augmentation and calibration with and without temperature scaling; measured F1 and expected calibration error (ECE).

Result: Models trained on protocol-invariant features maintained F1 > 0.85 under distribution shifts; models using all features showed ~40% performance degradation under protocol changes. Dataset augmentation substantially improved uncertainty estimates and reduced ECE by 35% without sacrificing accuracy. Temperature scaling offered minimal calibration benefits, aligning with XGBoost’s inherent reliability. The study supports protocol-aware feature selection and phantom-based evaluation as predictors of model behavior in real-world protocol variations.

Conclusion: A framework for developing robust radiomics models resilient to real-world protocol variations, leveraging protocol-invariant feature selection and controlled phantom studies to predict and improve model reliability under distribution shifts.

Abstract: Radiomics-based machine learning models show promise for clinical decision
support but are vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by variations in
imaging protocols, positioning, and segmentation. This study systematically
investigates the robustness of radiomics-based machine learning models under
distribution shifts across five MRI sequences. We evaluated how different
acquisition protocols and segmentation strategies affect model reliability in
terms of predictive power and uncertainty-awareness. Using a phantom of 16
fruits, we evaluated distribution shifts through: (1) protocol variations
across T2-HASTE, T2-TSE, T2-MAP, T1-TSE, and T2-FLAIR sequences; (2)
segmentation variations (full, partial, rotated); and (3) inter-observer
variability. We trained XGBoost classifiers on 8 consistent robust features
versus sequence-specific features, testing model performance under in-domain
and out-of-domain conditions. Results demonstrate that models trained on
protocol-invariant features maintain F1-scores >0.85 across distribution
shifts, while models using all features showed 40% performance degradation
under protocol changes. Dataset augmentation substantially improved the quality
of uncertainty estimates and reduced the expected calibration error (ECE) by
35% without sacrificing accuracy. Temperature scaling provided minimal
calibration benefits, confirming XGBoost's inherent reliability. Our findings
reveal that protocol-aware feature selection and controlled phantom studies
effectively predict model behavior under distribution shifts, providing a
framework for developing robust radiomics models resilient to real-world
protocol variations.

*Zhufeng Li,Niki Kilbertus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A task-driven distance for ADMGs based on downstream causal estimands under unobserved confounding, using fixing-based identification and a symbolic verifier, with an analysis of perturbations and comparison to existing metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating discovered causal graphs is hard, especially under latent confounding. A graph distance that reflects impact on causal effects is needed to meaningfully compare methods.

Method: Define a graph distance by measuring distortions in cause–effect estimands induced by graph differences. Uses identification via fixing and a symbolic verifier to quantify effects for various treatment–outcome pairs in ADMGs, then analyzes how perturbations affect the distance.

Result: The measure’s behavior is studied under different graph perturbations and it is compared against existing distance metrics, highlighting its task-oriented properties and how it aligns with changes in causal estimands.

Conclusion: The proposed metric provides a causally meaningful, task-oriented graph distance for ADMGs under unobserved confounding and can complement traditional, structure-centric distance metrics.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to recover graphs that represent causal relations among
given variables from observations, and new methods are constantly being
proposed. Increasingly, the community raises questions about how much progress
is made, because properly evaluating discovered graphs remains notoriously
difficult, particularly under latent confounding. We propose a graph distance
measure for acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) based on the downstream task
of cause-effect estimation under unobserved confounding. Our approach uses
identification via fixing and a symbolic verifier to quantify how graph
differences distort cause-effect estimands for different treatment-outcome
pairs. We analyze the behavior of the measure under different graph
perturbations and compare it against existing distance metrics.

*Zhifeng Wang,Longlong Li,Chunyan Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DWMGrad is a dynamic optimizer that uses a history-driven guidance mechanism to adapt momentum and learning rates, improving convergence speed and accuracy across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current optimizers like SGD and Adam struggle with fluctuations in learning efficiency, sensitive learning-rate selection, escaping local optima, and high-dimensional non-convex landscapes; there is a need for a more adaptive optimizer that can leverage historical information to adjust its updates.

Method: Introduce DWMGrad, a dynamic guidance mechanism that modulates reliance on historical data to update momentum and learning rates during training, building on traditional optimization methods to adapt to different training scenarios.

Result: Extensive experiments show that DWMGrad achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy under a variety of tasks and conditions.

Conclusion: DWMGrad improves robustness and adaptability of optimization, addressing key weaknesses of conventional methods in non-convex and complex-data settings and offering a promising route for efficient training.

Abstract: Within the current sphere of deep learning research, despite the extensive
application of optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), there remains a pronounced
inadequacy in their capability to address fluctuations in learning efficiency,
meet the demands of complex models, and tackle non-convex optimization issues.
These challenges primarily arise from the algorithms' limitations in handling
complex data structures and models, for instance, difficulties in selecting an
appropriate learning rate, avoiding local optima, and navigating through
high-dimensional spaces. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel
optimization algorithm named DWMGrad. This algorithm, building on the
foundations of traditional methods, incorporates a dynamic guidance mechanism
reliant on historical data to dynamically update momentum and learning rates.
This allows the optimizer to flexibly adjust its reliance on historical
information, adapting to various training scenarios. This strategy not only
enables the optimizer to better adapt to changing environments and task
complexities but also, as validated through extensive experimentation,
demonstrates DWMGrad's ability to achieve faster convergence rates and higher
accuracies under a multitude of scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BOND introduces a perturbative framework to estimate derivatives in networks with inaccessible graphs, improving accuracy and scalability over prior methods. It shows fixed, untrained black-box modules can boost performance without adding trainable parameters, enabling exploration of hybrid analogue-digital scaling without heavy architecture optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable gradient-like information flow and model optimization when parts of the computational graph are opaque, and to explore whether fixed, non-trainable components can augment model capacity without increasing trainable parameters.

Method: Bounded Numerical Differentiation (BOND) is a perturbative technique designed for estimating partial derivatives across network structures whose graphs are inaccessible. It allows integration of fixed, untrained black-box functions into trainable architectures and uses bounded perturbations to stabilize derivative estimates.

Result: Compared to existing perturbative approaches, BOND provides higher accuracy and better scalability. The experiments indicate that fixed, untrained black-box modules can enhance overall model performance without increasing the number of trainable parameters or requiring extensive architectural optimization of the black-box function.

Conclusion: Fixed, non-trainable modules can expand model capacity and enable scaling by combining analogue and digital components, suggesting a path toward hybrid hardware architectures that leverage BOND for gradient-like optimization in opaque networks.

Abstract: We introduce Bounded Numerical Differentiation (BOND), a perturbative method
for estimating partial derivatives across network structures with inaccessible
computational graphs. BOND demonstrates improved accuracy and scalability from
existing perturbative methods, enabling new explorations of trainable
architectures that integrate black-box functions. We observe that these
black-box functions, realized in our experiments as fixed, untrained networks,
can enhance model performance without increasing the number of trainable
parameters. This improvement is achieved without extensive optimization of the
architecture or properties of the black-box function itself. Our findings
highlight the potential of leveraging fixed, non-trainable modules to expand
model capacity, suggesting a path toward combining analogue and digital devices
as a mechanism for scaling networks.

*Hyunsik Yoo,Ting-Wei Li,SeongKu Kang,Zhining Liu,Charlie Xu,Qilin Qi,Hanghang Tong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PESO improves continual adaptation for LoRA in recommender systems via a proximal regularizer that anchors the adapter to its recent frozen state, enabling flexible adaptation to evolving user preferences; theory offers data-aware, direction-wise guidance; empirically outperforms prior LoRA-based continual methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In recommender systems, users/items and preferences evolve; existing LoRA-based continual methods emphasize preserving past task performance, but outdated preferences can hurt current recommendation; need method that balances adaptation and forgetting with changing data distribution.

Method: Introduce PESO: a proximal regularizer that ties the current LoRA adapter to its most recent frozen snapshot, allowing controlled adaptation; provide theoretical analysis showing direction-wise guidance in LoRA subspace; empirical evaluation comparing against prior LoRA continual learning methods.

Result: PESO consistently outperforms existing LoRA-based continual learning methods on standard benchmarks for recommendation with evolving data.

Conclusion: PESO provides a simple, effective mechanism for continual adaptation in LoRA-based recommendation, achieving a better balance between adapting to new preferences and preserving useful information, with data-aware guidance in LoRA subspace.

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance in
recommendation, they face challenges in continual learning as users, items, and
user preferences evolve over time. Existing LoRA-based continual methods
primarily focus on preserving performance on previous tasks, but this overlooks
the unique nature of recommendation: the goal is not to predict past
preferences, and outdated preferences can even harm performance when current
interests shift significantly. To address this, we propose PESO (Proximally
rEgularized Single evolving lOra, a continual adaptation method for LoRA in
recommendation. PESO introduces a proximal regularizer that anchors the current
adapter to its most recent frozen state, enabling the model to flexibly balance
adaptation and preservation, and to better capture recent user behaviors.
Theoretically, we show that this proximal design provides data-aware,
direction-wise guidance in the LoRA subspace. Empirically, PESO consistently
outperforms existing LoRA-based continual learning methods.

### [161] [Learning Fair Graph Representations with Multi-view Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25096)
*Chuxun Liu,Debo Cheng,Qingfeng Chen,Jiangzhang Gan,Jiuyong Li,Lin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairMIB, a multi-view information bottleneck framework for GNN fairness, decomposing graphs into feature, structural, and diffusion views with contrastive learning and IPW diffusion correction to improve fairness-utility trade-offs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNNs propagate biases from attributes and structural imbalances; treating bias as a single source leads to suboptimal fairness and utility. There is a need to disentangle attribute and structure effects in graph representations to achieve better fairness-utility trade-offs.

Method: Decompose graphs into three views (feature, structural, diffusion) using a multi-view information bottleneck. Use contrastive learning to maximize cross-view mutual information for bias-free representations. Apply multi-perspective conditional information bottleneck objectives to minimize mutual information with sensitive attributes while preserving task utility. Introduce inverse probability-weighted (IPW) adjacency correction in the diffusion view to reduce bias spread during message passing.

Result: On five real-world benchmark datasets, FairMIB achieves state-of-the-art performance in both utility and fairness metrics.

Conclusion: The multi-view IB approach effectively mitigates complexity biases in GNNs by separating sources of bias, aligning representations across views, and reducing bias propagation, resulting in a superior fairness-utility balance.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel on relational data by passing messages
over node features and structure, but they can amplify training data biases,
propagating discriminatory attributes and structural imbalances into unfair
outcomes. Many fairness methods treat bias as a single source, ignoring
distinct attribute and structure effects and leading to suboptimal fairness and
utility trade-offs. To overcome this challenge, we propose FairMIB, a
multi-view information bottleneck framework designed to decompose graphs into
feature, structural, and diffusion views for mitigating complexity biases in
GNNs. Especially, the proposed FairMIB employs contrastive learning to maximize
cross-view mutual information for bias-free representation learning. It further
integrates multi-perspective conditional information bottleneck objectives to
balance task utility and fairness by minimizing mutual information with
sensitive attributes. Additionally, FairMIB introduces an inverse
probability-weighted (IPW) adjacency correction in the diffusion view, which
reduces the spread of bias propagation during message passing. Experiments on
five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairMIB achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both utility and fairness metrics.

*Marko Medvedev,Kaifeng Lyu,Zhiyuan Li,Nathan Srebro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training/testing on mixture distributions with mismatched proportions can improve test performance; there exist optimal training proportions; the idea extends to compositional skill distributions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether distribution shift, via changing training proportions, can be beneficial for generalization and under what conditions.

Method: Theoretical analysis of mixture distributions under different training/test proportions; optimization to identify optimal training proportions; extension to a compositional setting with differing distributions of component skills.

Result: Across many settings, distribution shift can be beneficial: test performance may improve with mismatched training proportions even when components are unrelated; the optimal training proportions can be identified; the analysis applies to compositional skill distributions as well.

Conclusion: Distribution shift need not be harmful; with proper tuning of training proportions, generalization can improve, and the framework applies to both mixture components and differing skill distributions.

Abstract: We consider training and testing on mixture distributions with different
training and test proportions. We show that in many settings, and in some sense
generically, distribution shift can be beneficial, and test performance can
improve due to mismatched training proportions, even if the components are
unrelated and with no transfer between components. In a variety of scenarios,
we identify the optimal training proportions and the extent to which such
distribution shift can be beneficial. We show how the same analysis applies
also to a compositional setting with differing distribution of component
"skills'' at training and test.

*Di Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Neural Differential Manifold (NDM): a geometry-aware neural net where layers act as coordinate charts and parameters parameterize a Riemannian metric, organized into Coordinate, Geometric, and Evolution layers with a dual-objective geometric regularization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Embed explicit geometric structure into neural networks to improve generalization, robustness, interpretability, and optimization efficiency, and to enable continual learning and controllable generative modeling.

Method: Three-layer architecture: 1) Coordinate Layer uses invertible transformations (inspired by normalizing flows) to implement smooth chart transitions; 2) Geometric Layer dynamically generates the manifold's metric via auxiliary sub-networks; 3) Evolution Layer optimizes task performance and geometric simplicity through a dual-objective loss that penalizes curvature and volume distortion, enabling natural gradient descent aligned with learned geometry.

Result: The abstract emphasizes theoretical advantages and potential empirical gains, including more efficient optimization, enhanced continual learning, and applications in scientific discovery and controllable generative modeling, along with interpretability; it notes significant computational challenges and frames the work as a fundamental shift rather than reporting empirical results.

Conclusion: NDM is presented as a fundamental shift toward geometrically structured, interpretable, and potentially more efficient deep learning systems, with promising theoretical benefits but notable practical hurdles to address.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Neural Differential Manifold (NDM), a novel neural
network architecture that explicitly incorporates geometric structure into its
fundamental design. Departing from conventional Euclidean parameter spaces, the
NDM re-conceptualizes a neural network as a differentiable manifold where each
layer functions as a local coordinate chart, and the network parameters
directly parameterize a Riemannian metric tensor at every point. The
architecture is organized into three synergistic layers: a Coordinate Layer
implementing smooth chart transitions via invertible transformations inspired
by normalizing flows, a Geometric Layer that dynamically generates the
manifold's metric through auxiliary sub-networks, and an Evolution Layer that
optimizes both task performance and geometric simplicity through a
dual-objective loss function. This geometric regularization penalizes excessive
curvature and volume distortion, providing intrinsic regularization that
enhances generalization and robustness. The framework enables natural gradient
descent optimization aligned with the learned manifold geometry and offers
unprecedented interpretability by endowing internal representations with clear
geometric meaning. We analyze the theoretical advantages of this approach,
including its potential for more efficient optimization, enhanced continual
learning, and applications in scientific discovery and controllable generative
modeling. While significant computational challenges remain, the Neural
Differential Manifold represents a fundamental shift towards geometrically
structured, interpretable, and efficient deep learning systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unified bilevel framework for adversarial learning; analyzes adversarial attacks in clustering; shows robustness to small perturbations but vulnerability to larger perturbations; introduces δ-measure as a metric to quantify attack effects within the bilevel model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To interpret and quantify adversarial attacks in complex ML models, with a specific focus on clustering, and to propose a unified bilevel formulation that can measure and guide adversarial effects.

Method: Proposes a bilevel optimization model for adversarial learning and investigates clustering under data perturbations, defining and incorporating a δ-measure to assess attack impact within this framework.

Result: Clustering is robust under small perturbations but changes under larger perturbations, indicating a potential vulnerability to adversarial manipulation; the δ-measure is well-defined and usable within their bilevel model.

Conclusion: The paper provides a framework to interpret and measure adversarial effects in clustering via a bilevel model and a δ-measure, promising guidance for robust clustering and future study of attack impact quantification.

Abstract: Adversarial learning has been attracting more and more attention thanks to
the fast development of machine learning and artificial intelligence. However,
due to the complicated structure of most machine learning models, the mechanism
of adversarial attacks is not well interpreted. How to measure the effect of
attack is still not quite clear. In this paper, we propose a unified bilevel
model for adversarial learning. We further investigate the adversarial attack
in clustering models and interpret it from data perturbation point of view. We
reveal that when the data perturbation is relatively small, the clustering
model is robust, whereas if it is relatively large, the clustering result
changes, which leads to an attack. To measure the effect of attacks for
clustering models, we analyse the well-definedness of the so-called
$\delta$-measure, which can be used in the proposed bilevel model for
adversarial learning of clustering models.

TL;DR: Data-driven LRNR within a hypernetwork learns low-rank, interpretable decompositions of hyperbolic wave propagation; enables compression-based efficient inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for efficient, interpretable, compressible representations of physics-based hyperbolic wave data; theory suggests existence of efficient representations; data-driven approach to learn them.

Method: Proposes low rank neural representation (LRNR) inside a hypernetwork; trained on data; observations of emergent low-rank tensor structure; decomposition into physically meaningful modes; uses deep learning techniques; includes a compression-based inference scheme.

Result: Archetypal examples demonstrate an efficient low-dimensional representation learned from data; low-rank tensor representations emerge; decomposed modes map to interpretable physical features; compression enables efficient inference.

Conclusion: LRNR within hypernetworks provides a data-driven, interpretable, and compressible framework for hyperbolic wave propagation; potential benefits for deployment in demanding performance regimes.

Abstract: We present a data-driven dimensionality reduction method that is well-suited
for physics-based data representing hyperbolic wave propagation. The method
utilizes a specialized neural network architecture called low rank neural
representation (LRNR) inside a hypernetwork framework. The architecture is
motivated by theoretical results that rigorously prove the existence of
efficient representations for this wave class. We illustrate through archetypal
examples that such an efficient low-dimensional representation of propagating
waves can be learned directly from data through a combination of deep learning
techniques. We observe that a low rank tensor representation arises naturally
in the trained LRNRs, and that this reveals a new decomposition of wave
propagation where each decomposed mode corresponds to interpretable physical
features. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LRNR architecture enables
efficient inference via a compression scheme, which is a potentially important
feature when deploying LRNRs in demanding performance regimes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BRIDGE jointly models sequences and graphs with a sequence encoder and GNN, enhanced by token-level cross-attention (TOKENXATTN) to enable fine-grained inter-event messaging between neighboring sequences; it outperforms baselines on ranking/classification tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Many real datasets are both sequential and relational; treating only one modality wastes complementary information. A joint learning framework can produce task-aligned representations and better predictive performance.

Method: BRIDGE couples a sequence encoder with a GNN under a single objective, enabling gradients to flow across modules. It introduces TOKENXATTN, a token-level cross-attention layer that passes messages between events in neighboring sequences to enable fine-grained message passing.

Result: Empirically, BRIDGE outperforms static GNNs, temporal graph methods, and sequence-only baselines on ranking (Brightkite) and fraud detection (Amazon) across multiple metrics.

Conclusion: Jointly learning sequences and graphs with token-level cross-attention yields superior representations and predictive performance across tasks and datasets, validating the complementary nature of the modalities.

Abstract: Many real-world datasets are both sequential and relational: each node
carries an event sequence while edges encode interactions. Existing methods in
sequence modeling and graph modeling often neglect one modality or the other.
We argue that sequences and graphs are not separate problems but complementary
facets of the same dataset, and should be learned jointly. We introduce BRIDGE,
a unified end-to-end architecture that couples a sequence encoder with a GNN
under a single objective, allowing gradients to flow across both modules and
learning task-aligned representations. To enable fine-grained token-level
message passing among neighbors, we add TOKENXATTN, a token-level
cross-attention layer that passes messages between events in neighboring
sequences. Across two settings, friendship prediction (Brightkite) and fraud
detection (Amazon), BRIDGE consistently outperforms static GNNs, temporal graph
methods, and sequence-only baselines on ranking and classification metrics.

### [167] [An Analysis of Causal Effect Estimation using Outcome Invariant Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25128)
*Uzair Akbar,Niki Kilbertus,Hao Shen,Krikamol Muandet,Bo Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unifying data augmentation (DA) with causal-inference tools via IV-like (IVL) regression to generalize beyond i.i.d. settings. The core idea is that if the outcome mechanism is invariant to the choice of DA, augmentations act as interventions on the treatment process, enabling bias reduction from hidden confounders. The authors regularize IV-based estimators to form IVL regression, cast parameterized DA as IVL, and show that composing these can simulate worst-case DA and improve causal estimation and generalization. The results include theory for the population case, finite-sample simulations (linear example), and real-data experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DA is typically used for regularization under i.i.d. assumptions, but its potential for generalization across interventions and causal estimation is underexplored. Hidden confounding and limited access to instruments (IVs) motivate a framework that leverages DA to mimic IV-like regularization, extending causal inference benefits to settings where IV assumptions are relaxed.

Method: Introduce IV-like (IVL) regression by regularizing IV-based estimators. Cast parameterized DA as an IVL regression problem. Analyze invariance of the outcome-generating mechanism to DA, and show that composing DA with IVL can simulate a worst-case DA. Provide theoretical results in the population case, plus finite-sample simulations using a simple linear model, and validate with real data experiments.

Result: The framework demonstrates that DA can be leveraged to generalize across interventions and mitigate confounding bias when the DA process preserves the outcome mechanism. IVL regression improves predictive performance across interventions beyond standard IV methods and simple DA. The linear-simulation shows finite-sample gains, and real-data experiments corroborate the theoretical and simulation findings.

Conclusion: A unifying approach links data augmentation with causal inference through IV-like regression. When outcome generation is invariant to DA, augmentations act as treatment-interventions that reduce bias and improve generalization across interventions. The combination of parameterized DA and IVL regression is promising for causal estimation in settings with limited instruments, with theoretical and empirical support; future work could explore broader models and relaxing invariance assumptions.

Abstract: The technique of data augmentation (DA) is often used in machine learning for
regularization purposes to better generalize under i.i.d. settings. In this
work, we present a unifying framework with topics in causal inference to make a
case for the use of DA beyond just the i.i.d. setting, but for generalization
across interventions as well. Specifically, we argue that when the outcome
generating mechanism is invariant to our choice of DA, then such augmentations
can effectively be thought of as interventions on the treatment generating
mechanism itself. This can potentially help to reduce bias in causal effect
estimation arising from hidden confounders. In the presence of such unobserved
confounding we typically make use of instrumental variables (IVs) -- sources of
treatment randomization that are conditionally independent of the outcome.
However, IVs may not be as readily available as DA for many applications, which
is the main motivation behind this work. By appropriately regularizing IV based
estimators, we introduce the concept of IV-like (IVL) regression for mitigating
confounding bias and improving predictive performance across interventions even
when certain IV properties are relaxed. Finally, we cast parameterized DA as an
IVL regression problem and show that when used in composition can simulate a
worst-case application of such DA, further improving performance on causal
estimation and generalization tasks beyond what simple DA may offer. This is
shown both theoretically for the population case and via simulation experiments
for the finite sample case using a simple linear example. We also present real
data experiments to support our case.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This work analyzes how fine-tuning Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for action tasks can erode the underlying vision-language (VL) representations, and offers diagnostic tasks, attention analyses, and alignment strategies to mitigate degradation and improve out-of-distribution generalization, with code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA models promise transferable world knowledge from pretrained vision-language models, but it is unclear whether their VL representations survive when adapted to the action modality. Understanding representation retention during fine-tuning is critical for preserving VL grounding while enabling action capabilities.

Method: Perform a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning, probe hidden representations and attention maps, design targeted tasks to contrast VLA models with their VLM counterparts, and evaluate a range of alignment strategies. Propose a simple method that mitigates degradation and improves generalization to out-of-distribution data.

Result: Naive action fine-tuning degrades visual representations. Targeted tasks and analyses reveal how VL capabilities are affected. Some alignment strategies mitigate degradation and improve OOD generalization, with a simple, effective method performing notably well.

Conclusion: There is a trade-off between action fine-tuning and VL representation preservation. The paper identifies practical approaches to recover inherited VL capabilities and enhance generalization, and provides code for reproducibility.

Abstract: The growing success of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models stems from the
promise that pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can endow agents with
transferable world knowledge and vision-language (VL) grounding, laying a
foundation for action models with broader generalization. Yet when these VLMs
are adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their
original VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning,
showing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual
representations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's
hidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of
targeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart
VLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We
further evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and
introduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields
improved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together,
our analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the
degradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to
recover inherited VL capabilities. Code is publicly available:

TL;DR: Linearity grafting in nonlinear activations reduces dominant approximation errors in Lipschitz analysis, yielding tighter local Lipschitz constants (especially l_infty) and improved certified robustness, even without certified training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Certified robustness relies on local Lipschitz constants; finding worst-case adversarial inputs is NP-hard, and over-approximation errors limit tightness. There is a lack of theoretical understanding of how linearity grafting improves robustness.

Method: The paper provides two theoretical contributions: (1) analyzes the impact of linearity grafting on the l_infty local Lipschitz constant to explain improved robustness; (2) shows that grafting linearity into nonlinear activations—the dominant source of approximation errors—produces a tighter local Lipschitz constant. Based on these insights, it introduces a Lipschitz-aware linearity grafting method to remove dominant approximation errors, improving robustness without relying on certified training; empirical evaluation demonstrates tightened l_infty constants and enhanced certified robustness.

Result: Grafting linearity into activations tightens the l_infty local Lipschitz constant and enhances certified robustness, evidenced by empirical improvements across experiments.

Conclusion: Linearity grafting is an effective strategy to reduce approximation errors in Lipschitz analysis, tighten local Lipschitz constants, and improve certified robustness, offering benefits even without certified training.

Abstract: Lipschitz constant is a fundamental property in certified robustness, as
smaller values imply robustness to adversarial examples when a model is
confident in its prediction. However, identifying the worst-case adversarial
examples is known to be an NP-complete problem. Although over-approximation
methods have shown success in neural network verification to address this
challenge, reducing approximation errors remains a significant obstacle.
Furthermore, these approximation errors hinder the ability to obtain tight
local Lipschitz constants, which are crucial for certified robustness.
Originally, grafting linearity into non-linear activation functions was
proposed to reduce the number of unstable neurons, enabling scalable and
complete verification. However, no prior theoretical analysis has explained how
linearity grafting improves certified robustness. We instead consider linearity
grafting primarily as a means of eliminating approximation errors rather than
reducing the number of unstable neurons, since linear functions do not require
relaxation. In this paper, we provide two theoretical contributions: 1) why
linearity grafting improves certified robustness through the lens of the
$l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant, and 2) grafting linearity into non-linear
activation functions, the dominant source of approximation errors, yields a
tighter local Lipschitz constant. Based on these theoretical contributions, we
propose a Lipschitz-aware linearity grafting method that removes dominant
approximation errors, which are crucial for tightening the local Lipschitz
constant, thereby improving certified robustness, even without certified
training. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that grafting linearity into
these influential activations tightens the $l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant
and enhances certified robustness.

### [170] [Machine Learning Guided Optimal Transmission Switching to Mitigate Wildfire Ignition Risk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25147)
*Weimin Huang,Ryan Piansky,Bistra Dilkina,Daniel K. Molzahn*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ML-guided framework for the Optimal Power Shutoff (OPS) problem accelerates finding high-quality de-energization decisions by leveraging shared patterns across instances and encoding knowledge about energized/de-energized line counts; it yields faster, high-quality solutions on a large California-style test system compared to traditional MILP optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wildfire ignition risk from energized lines necessitates de-energization; OPS MILPs are computationally hard and must be solved rapidly in operation. Shared instance structure across varying risks/loads can be exploited via ML to speed up solving.

Method: Extend ML-guided MILP solution methods by incorporating domain knowledge on the target counts of energized/de-energized lines; train models to guide or warm-start MILPs, enabling rapid generation of de-energization decisions.

Result: Experimental results on a large-scale, California-based synthetic test system show the proposed ML-guided approach yields high-quality solutions faster than conventional optimization methods.

Conclusion: ML-guided optimization with domain knowledge improves solution speed without sacrificing quality, suggesting practical viability for real-time OPS decisions; further work may address generalization, data requirements, integration with solvers, and robustness to changing risk patterns.

Abstract: To mitigate acute wildfire ignition risks, utilities de-energize power lines
in high-risk areas. The Optimal Power Shutoff (OPS) problem optimizes line
energization statuses to manage wildfire ignition risks through
de-energizations while reducing load shedding. OPS problems are computationally
challenging Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) that must be solved rapidly
and frequently in operational settings. For a particular power system, OPS
instances share a common structure with varying parameters related to wildfire
risks, loads, and renewable generation. This motivates the use of Machine
Learning (ML) for solving OPS problems by exploiting shared patterns across
instances. In this paper, we develop an ML-guided framework that quickly
produces high-quality de-energization decisions by extending existing ML-guided
MILP solution methods while integrating domain knowledge on the number of
energized and de-energized lines. Results on a large-scale realistic
California-based synthetic test system show that the proposed ML-guided method
produces high-quality solutions faster than traditional optimization methods.

*Mohammadreza Doostmohammadian,Zulfiya R. Gabidullina,Hamid R. Rabiee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A distributed co-optimization framework for jointly managing data processing and CPU resources across a network of nodes performing local ML, with consensus updates and quantized communication; demonstrates convergence and more than 50% reduction in the cost-gap for distributed SVM/regression compared to prior CPU scheduling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a pressing need for fast, scalable, and resource-efficient distributed ML. The paper addresses optimizing both data processing and CPU allocation across distributed nodes, under time-varying networks and quantized communications, while guaranteeing feasibility and convergence.

Method: Formulate the problem as a co-optimization of data processing and CPU resource allocation. Use a time-varying information-sharing network with balanced weights to ensure consensus-type convergence. Ensure all-time feasibility of resource-demand balance. Accommodate log-scale (log-quantized) data exchange. Analyze using perturbation theory, Lyapunov stability, and eigen-spectrum analysis. Demonstrate on distributed SVM and regression tasks.

Result: Proves convergence to the optimal solution. Reports a >50% improvement in the cost optimality gap compared with existing CPU scheduling solutions. Applies the approach to distributed SVM and regression models.

Conclusion: The proposed algorithm yields a scalable, resource-aware distributed ML optimization framework with provable convergence and significant performance gains, suitable for distributed learning tasks with constrained computing resources.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving research on artificial intelligence (AI) the demand
for fast, computationally efficient, and scalable solutions has increased in
recent years. The problem of optimizing the computing resources for distributed
machine learning (ML) and optimization is considered in this paper. Given a set
of data distributed over a network of computing-nodes/servers, the idea is to
optimally assign the CPU (central processing unit) usage while simultaneously
training each computing node locally via its own share of data. This formulates
the problem as a co-optimization setup to (i) optimize the data processing and
(ii) optimally allocate the computing resources. The information-sharing
network among the nodes might be time-varying, but with balanced weights to
ensure consensus-type convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm is all-time
feasible, which implies that the computing resource-demand balance constraint
holds at all iterations of the proposed solution. Moreover, the solution allows
addressing possible log-scale quantization over the information-sharing
channels to exchange log-quantized data. For some example applications,
distributed support-vector-machine (SVM) and regression are considered as the
ML training models. Results from perturbation theory, along with Lyapunov
stability and eigen-spectrum analysis, are used to prove the convergence
towards the optimal case. As compared to existing CPU scheduling solutions, the
proposed algorithm improves the cost optimality gap by more than $50\%$.

### [172] [Selective Learning for Deep Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25207)
*Yisong Fu,Zezhi Shao,Chengqing Yu,Yujie Li,Zhulin An,Qi Wang,Yongjun Xu,Fei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A selective learning framework for deep time series forecasting that uses a dual-mask to exclude uncertain and anomalous timesteps from the MSE loss, focusing training on generalizable signals. It yields notable MSE reductions across several models (e.g., Informer 37.4%, TimesNet 8.4%, iTransformer 6.5%) over eight real-world datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep TSF models overfit due to noise/anomalies in time series when the standard MSE loss treats all timesteps equally. There is a need to differentiate between reliable, generalizable timesteps and unreliable ones.

Method: Introduce a dual-mask mechanism: (1) an uncertainty mask based on residual entropy to filter out uncertain timesteps; (2) an anomaly mask using residual lower bound estimation to exclude anomalous timesteps. Train the model by computing MSE only on the selected timesteps, effectively enabling selective learning that emphasizes generalizable patterns. The approach is designed as a plug-in or framework for existing deep TSF models.

Result: Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets show substantial improvements in predictive accuracy for state-of-the-art models: 37.4% MSE reduction for Informer, 8.4% for TimesNet, and 6.5% for iTransformer.

Conclusion: Selective learning with a dual-mask strategy reduces overfitting and enhances generalization in deep time series forecasting. The method appears to be a versatile and effective plug-in for major TSF architectures, though its performance may depend on accurate estimation of uncertainty and anomalies and on dataset characteristics.

Abstract: Benefiting from high capacity for capturing complex temporal patterns, deep
learning (DL) has significantly advanced time series forecasting (TSF).
However, deep models tend to suffer from severe overfitting due to the inherent
vulnerability of time series to noise and anomalies. The prevailing DL paradigm
uniformly optimizes all timesteps through the MSE loss and learns those
uncertain and anomalous timesteps without difference, ultimately resulting in
overfitting. To address this, we propose a novel selective learning strategy
for deep TSF. Specifically, selective learning screens a subset of the whole
timesteps to calculate the MSE loss in optimization, guiding the model to focus
on generalizable timesteps while disregarding non-generalizable ones. Our
framework introduces a dual-mask mechanism to target timesteps: (1) an
uncertainty mask leveraging residual entropy to filter uncertain timesteps, and
(2) an anomaly mask employing residual lower bound estimation to exclude
anomalous timesteps. Extensive experiments across eight real-world datasets
demonstrate that selective learning can significantly improve the predictive
performance for typical state-of-the-art deep models, including 37.4% MSE
reduction for Informer, 8.4% for TimesNet, and 6.5% for iTransformer.

### [173] [Cost-Sensitive Unbiased Risk Estimation for Multi-Class Positive-Unlabeled Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25226)
*Miao Zhang,Junpeng Li,Changchun Hua,Yana Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A cost-sensitive adaptive-loss framework for multi-class PU learning that yields an unbiased empirical risk estimator, with theoretical generalization guarantees and strong empirical improvements (accuracy and stability) across eight datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In positive-unlabeled (PU) learning, negatives are unavailable or unreliable, and this challenge is amplified in the multi-class setting (MPU). Many existing MPU methods lack unbiased risk estimation, leading to biased objectives and unstable performance across varying class priors and class counts.

Method: Propose a cost-sensitive MPU method using adaptive loss weighting within empirical risk minimization. The method assigns data-dependent weights to the positive and inferred-negative loss components, ensuring the empirical objective is an unbiased estimator of the target risk. The authors formalize the MPU data-generating process and derive a generalization error bound.

Result: Theoretical result: a generalization error bound for the proposed estimator. Empirical result: experiments on eight public datasets with varying class priors and numbers of classes show consistent gains over strong baselines in accuracy and stability.

Conclusion: The proposed adaptive, weighted loss approach achieves unbiased risk estimation in MPU, with theoretical guarantees and robust empirical performance, addressing instability and bias in multi-class PU learning.

Abstract: Positive--Unlabeled (PU) learning considers settings in which only positive
and unlabeled data are available, while negatives are missing or left
unlabeled. This situation is common in real applications where annotating
reliable negatives is difficult or costly. Despite substantial progress in PU
learning, the multi-class case (MPU) remains challenging: many existing
approaches do not ensure \emph{unbiased risk estimation}, which limits
performance and stability. We propose a cost-sensitive multi-class PU method
based on \emph{adaptive loss weighting}. Within the empirical risk minimization
framework, we assign distinct, data-dependent weights to the positive and
\emph{inferred-negative} (from the unlabeled mixture) loss components so that
the resulting empirical objective is an unbiased estimator of the target risk.
We formalize the MPU data-generating process and establish a generalization
error bound for the proposed estimator. Extensive experiments on \textbf{eight}
public datasets, spanning varying class priors and numbers of classes, show
consistent gains over strong baselines in both accuracy and stability.

### [174] [BSFA: Leveraging the Subspace Dichotomy to Accelerate Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25244)
*Wenjie Zhou,Bohan Wang,Wei Chen,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BSFA is a plug-and-play optimization framework that accelerates training by differentially scaling updates in Dom-space (top Hessian eigendirections) versus Bulk-space (orthogonal subspace). It uses PCA on historical updates and a block-wise estimator to be scalable, achieving roughly 2x speedups on LLaMA pretraining compared to AdamW.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There exists a fundamental dichotomy in deep learning updates: top eigendirections (Dom-space) contribute large update magnitudes but little loss reduction, while bulk-space updates (orthogonal directions) produce smaller steps that drive most learning. Exploiting this separation can stabilize training and accelerate convergence for large models.

Method: Introduce Bulk-Space-Filtration-Accelerator (BSFA), a plug-and-play framework that scales updates differently per subspace. It uses a PCA-based estimator on historical updates to identify Dom-space and Bulk-space, and applies a per-parameter-block, block-wise estimation to keep computations tractable. This yields selective amplification of bulk updates and moderation of dominant-subspace updates during optimization.

Result: Demonstrated acceleration across tasks, with approximately 2× speedup when pre-training LLaMA-72M on WikiText-103 and LLaMA-134M on OpenWebText versus vanilla AdamW, alongside improved stability during training.

Conclusion: BSFA is practical and scalable for modern large models, offering a straightforward path to faster, more stable optimization by leveraging the observed bulk vs. dominant subspace dynamics, with potential applicability beyond the reported tasks.

Abstract: Recent studies \citep{gur2018gradient,song2024does, wen2024understanding}
highlight a fundamental dichotomy in deep learning optimization: Although
parameter updates along the top eigendirections of the loss Hessian (Dom-space)
capture most of the update magnitude, they often contribute minimally to loss
reduction. In contrast, updates in the orthogonal component (Bulk-space) have
smaller magnitudes but drive most learning progress. In this work, we further
advance the understanding of this phenomenon and introduce the
\textbf{Bulk-Space-Filtration-Accelerator (BSFA)}, a novel plug-and-play
framework. BSFA accelerates training by differentially scaling update
components projected onto these distinct subspaces, simultaneously enhancing
stability by moderating updates in the dominant subspace and boosting
convergence speed by amplifying those in the bulk-space. To ensure BSFA is both
practical and scalable for contemporary large models, we introduce two key
innovations: an efficient estimator using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on
historical updates for fast subspace estimation, and a block-wise strategy that
applies this estimation on a per-parameter-block basis. These designs make BSFA
computationally tractable and highly effective. We demonstrate BSFA's
acceleration across various tasks, notably achieving approximately 2$\times$
speedup when pre-training LLaMA-72M on WikiText-103 and LLaMA-134M on
OpenWebText compared to vanilla AdamW.

*Daniele Nikzad,Alexander Zhilkin,Juha Harviainen,Jack Kuipers,Giusi Moffa,Mikko Koivisto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Efficient MCMC sampling for Bayesian network structures by optimizing local moves and pruning parent-set sums.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bayesian network structure learning via sampling is computationally intensive due to arc operations and summing over parent sets; we propose methods to accelerate this process.

Method: (1) Implement efficient basic moves: add, delete, reverse a single arc. (2) Prune the space of parent sets via preprocessing to approximate the sums needed for more complex moves.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows substantial efficiency gains over prior methods.

Conclusion: The techniques substantially speed up Bayesian network structure sampling and can enable more scalable structure learning.

Abstract: Bayesian inference of Bayesian network structures is often performed by
sampling directed acyclic graphs along an appropriately constructed Markov
chain. We present two techniques to improve sampling. First, we give an
efficient implementation of basic moves, which add, delete, or reverse a single
arc. Second, we expedite summing over parent sets, an expensive task required
for more sophisticated moves: we devise a preprocessing method to prune
possible parent sets so as to approximately preserve the sums. Our empirical
study shows that our techniques can yield substantial efficiency gains compared
to previous methods.

*Xiandong Zou,Pan Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IBNorm applies Information Bottleneck-based bounded compression to normalization, preserving predictive information while suppressing nuisance variability, outperforming BN/LN/RMSNorm on LMs and vision models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Variance-centric normalization (zero-mean, unit-variance) may discard task-relevant information. We need a normalization that maintains predictive content while reducing nuisance factors, guided by information bottleneck.

Method: Introduce IBNorm family with bounded compression operations aligned with Information Bottleneck. The method preserves predictive information (maximizes IB) and reduces nuisance variability, while retaining stability and compatibility with standard normalization. Theoretical analysis shows higher IB value and tighter generalization bounds; empirical evaluation on LLaMA, GPT-2, ResNet, ViT shows improvements; mutual information analyses validate information bottleneck behavior. Code will be released.

Result: Theoretical: IBNorm attains higher IB value and tighter generalization bounds than variance-centric methods. Empirical: Consistently outperforms BatchNorm, LayerNorm, RMSNorm across large-scale language models (LLaMA, GPT-2) and vision models (ResNet, ViT); mutual information analysis confirms better information bottleneck behavior.

Conclusion: IBNorm yields more informative representations without sacrificing stability or compatibility, offering a principled, scalable alternative to existing normalization methods; code will be released publicly; potential for broad applicability in NLP and CV.

Abstract: Normalization is fundamental to deep learning, but existing approaches such
as BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm are variance-centric by enforcing zero
mean and unit variance, stabilizing training without controlling how
representations capture task-relevant information. We propose IB-Inspired
Normalization (IBNorm), a simple yet powerful family of methods grounded in the
Information Bottleneck principle. IBNorm introduces bounded compression
operations that encourage embeddings to preserve predictive information while
suppressing nuisance variability, yielding more informative representations
while retaining the stability and compatibility of standard normalization.
Theoretically, we prove that IBNorm achieves a higher IB value and tighter
generalization bounds than variance-centric methods. Empirically, IBNorm
consistently outperforms BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm across large-scale
language models (LLaMA, GPT-2) and vision models (ResNet, ViT), with mutual
information analysis confirming superior information bottleneck behavior. Code
will be released publicly.

*Blaise Delattre*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified sensitivity-analysis framework for neural networks using Lipschitz constraints, curvature-based regularization, and randomized smoothing to improve stability, generalization, and robustness, with practical contributions like spectral-norm computation, Lipschitz layers, and better certification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep networks are prone to instability from input perturbations and sharp loss landscapes, undermining generalization and optimization. A unified framework targeting input sensitivity, parameter sensitivity, and decision-boundary robustness is needed.

Method: Combine Lipschitz-constrained architectures to bound input perturbation effects; apply curvature-based regularization to smooth the loss landscape and reduce parameter sensitivity; employ randomized smoothing to bolster robustness at decision boundaries; integrate these into a cohesive framework with practical tools (spectral-norm computation, Lipschitz layers, certification procedures).

Result: The work provides theoretical analysis and practical methodologies. It introduces efficient spectral-norm computation, novel Lipschitz-constrained layers, and improved certification procedures.

Conclusion: A cohesive framework that interleaves Lipschitz continuity, randomized smoothing, and curvature regularization to address core stability challenges in deep learning, yielding improvements in generalization, robustness, and training stability along with actionable tools.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of tasks,
but its models often suffer from instability and vulnerability: small changes
to the input may drastically affect predictions, while optimization can be
hindered by sharp loss landscapes. This thesis addresses these issues through
the unifying perspective of sensitivity analysis, which examines how neural
networks respond to perturbations at both the input and parameter levels.
  We study Lipschitz networks as a principled way to constrain sensitivity to
input perturbations, thereby improving generalization, adversarial robustness,
and training stability. To complement this architectural approach, we introduce
regularization techniques based on the curvature of the loss function,
promoting smoother optimization landscapes and reducing sensitivity to
parameter variations. Randomized smoothing is also explored as a probabilistic
method for enhancing robustness at decision boundaries.
  By combining these perspectives, we develop a unified framework where
Lipschitz continuity, randomized smoothing, and curvature regularization
interact to address fundamental challenges in stability. The thesis contributes
both theoretical analysis and practical methodologies, including efficient
spectral norm computation, novel Lipschitz-constrained layers, and improved
certification procedures.

*Xizhe Wang,Xiaobin Song,Qingshan Jia,Hongbo Zhao,Benben Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hierarchical physics-embedded learning framework combines prior physics with adaptive Fourier Neural Operators to learn PDE structure and terms from sparse, noisy data, enabling interpretable symbolic discovery and improved forward/inverse modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modeling far-from-equilibrium spatiotemporal dynamics is hard: deriving governing PDEs is intractable due to high-order nonlinearities and incomplete knowledge. Pure data-driven approaches are data-hungry and often physically inconsistent; existing physics-informed methods lack the capacity to capture complex operators and to systematically integrate partial physical knowledge.

Method: A two-level architecture mirrors scientific discovery: level-1 learns fundamental symbolic PDE components; level-2 learns their governing combinations. Known physical laws are embedded into the model's computational graph to guarantee physical consistency. Built on adaptive Fourier Neural Operators to capture non-local dependencies and high-order operators. By structurally decoupling known and unknown terms, it enables interpretable discovery of governing equations via symbolic regression without fixed functional forms.

Result: The framework aims to improve forward spatiotemporal prediction and inverse discovery from sparse and noisy data, ensuring physical consistency and data efficiency. It enables interpretable discovery of underlying governing equations and can represent complex, high-order, non-local operators.

Conclusion: This hierarchical physics-embedded approach advances both prediction and discovery by reducing learning complexity, enabling seamless integration of prior physics, and offering interpretable PDE discovery for complex dynamical systems.

Abstract: Modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics, particularly in
far-from-equilibrium systems, remains a grand challenge in science. The
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) for these systems are often
intractable to derive from first principles, due to their inherent complexity,
characterized by high-order derivatives and strong nonlinearities, coupled with
incomplete physical knowledge. This has spurred the development of data-driven
methods, yet these approaches face limitations: Purely data-driven models are
often physically inconsistent and data-intensive, while existing
physics-informed methods lack the structural capacity to represent complex
operators or systematically integrate partial physical knowledge. Here, we
propose a hierarchical physics-embedded learning framework that fundamentally
advances both the forward spatiotemporal prediction and inverse discovery of
physical laws from sparse and noisy data. The key innovation is a two-level
architecture that mirrors the process of scientific discovery: the first level
learns fundamental symbolic components of a PDE, while the second learns their
governing combinations. This hierarchical decomposition not only reduces
learning complexity but, more importantly, enables a structural integration of
prior knowledge. Known physical laws are directly embedded into the models
computational graph, guaranteeing physical consistency and improving data
efficiency. By building the framework upon adaptive Fourier Neural Operators,
we can effectively capture the non-local dependencies and high-order operators
characteristic of dynamical systems. Additionally, by structurally decoupling
known and unknown terms, the framework further enables interpretable discovery
of underlying governing equations through symbolic regression, without
presupposing functional forms.

*Sagalpreet Singh,Rishi Saket,Aravindan Raghuveer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Multi Goal RL: maximize return while uniformly visiting a set of goal states defined by an oracle, via a policy mixture and offline RL updates, with convergence guarantees and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In many tasks, we want policies that not only achieve high return but also spread visitation across many rewarding states. Existing entropy or intrinsic reward methods encourage exploration but not uniform dispersion of rewarding states; large-scale systems cannot enumerate all states and goal states may only be identified upon reaching them.

Method: Introduce a Multi Goal RL framework with an oracle classifier to define goal states. Learn a high-return policy mixture that yields a dispersed marginal distribution over these goal states. Compute a custom RL reward at each iteration based on the current policy mixture for sampled trajectories, and use offline RL to update the mixture. Provide theoretical convergence guarantees for optimizing an objective that combines return and goal-state dispersion.

Result: Proves performance guarantees and efficient convergence bounds for the proposed objective. Empirical evaluation on synthetic MDPs and standard RL environments demonstrates the approach's effectiveness in achieving high return while dispersing visits across goal states.

Conclusion: The method enables multi-goal RL without enumerating all states, achieving dispersion over goal states while maintaining high returns. It is applicable to large-scale systems and provides a foundation for further exploration of distributional goals in RL.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning algorithms are primarily focused on learning a policy
that maximizes expected return. As a result, the learned policy can exploit one
or few reward sources. However, in many natural situations, it is desirable to
learn a policy that induces a dispersed marginal state distribution over
rewarding states, while maximizing the expected return which is typically tied
to reaching a goal state. This aspect remains relatively unexplored. Existing
techniques based on entropy regularization and intrinsic rewards use
stochasticity for encouraging exploration to find an optimal policy which may
not necessarily lead to dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding
states. Other RL algorithms which match a target distribution assume the latter
to be available apriori. This may be infeasible in large scale systems where
enumeration of all states is not possible and a state is determined to be a
goal state only upon reaching it. We formalize the problem of maximizing the
expected return while uniformly visiting the goal states as Multi Goal RL in
which an oracle classifier over the state space determines the goal states. We
propose a novel algorithm that learns a high-return policy mixture with
marginal state distribution dispersed over the set of goal states. Our
algorithm is based on optimizing a custom RL reward which is computed - based
on the current policy mixture - at each iteration for a set of sampled
trajectories. The latter are used via an offline RL algorithm to update the
policy mixture. We prove performance guarantees for our algorithm, showing
efficient convergence bounds for optimizing a natural objective which captures
the expected return as well as the dispersion of the marginal state
distribution over the goal states. We design and perform experiments on
synthetic MDPs and standard RL environments to evaluate the effectiveness of
our algorithm.

*Xuchen Feng,Siyu Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces an invertible linear layer built from a product of diagonal and circulant matrices, reducing parameter count and speeding Jacobian computations; enables Circulant-Diagonal Flow (CDFlow) that improves density estimation on natural images and exploits periodic structure.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Normalizing flows require expressive yet tractable linear layers; dense Jacobian determinants and inverses are costly (O(n^3)). The proposed circulant-diagonal decomposition seeks a parameter-efficient, fast alternative that can approximate general linear transforms while enabling efficient computations and exploiting structure in data.

Method: Construct an invertible linear layer as a product of m diagonal matrices and m-1 circulant matrices (alternating diagonals and circulants). This reduces parameters from O(n^2) to O(mn). The FFT accelerates inversion to O(mn log n) and log-determinant to O(mn). Integrate this layer into Circulant-Diagonal Flow (CDFlow) for density estimation on image data.

Result: CDFlow achieves strong density estimation on natural image datasets and effectively models data with inherent periodic structure. The approach also accelerates key operations in normalizing flows, aiding scalable generative modeling.

Conclusion: The circulant-diagonal layer provides a practical trade-off between expressiveness and efficiency, enabling scalable normalizing flows and better modeling of data with periodic structure; the method’s computational gains have broad applicability to deep generative modeling.

Abstract: Normalizing flows are deep generative models that enable efficient likelihood
estimation and sampling through invertible transformations. A key challenge is
to design linear layers that enhance expressiveness while maintaining efficient
computation of the Jacobian determinant and inverse. We introduce a novel
invertible linear layer based on the product of circulant and diagonal
matrices. This decomposition reduces parameter complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ using $m$ diagonal matrices and $m-1$
circulant matrices while still approximating general linear transformations. By
leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform, our approach reduces the time complexity
of matrix inversion from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn\log n)$ and that
of computing the log-determinant from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$,
where $n$ is the input dimension. We build upon this layer to develop
Circulant-Diagonal Flow (CDFlow), which achieves strong density estimation on
natural image datasets and effectively models data with inherent periodic
structure. Furthermore, CDFlow significantly accelerates key operations in
normalizing flows, providing practical benefits for scalable generative
modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Leak-free, dataset-rich, and efficient cascade popularity prediction framework: time-ordered splits, Taoke dataset, and CasTemp model achieving state-of-the-art with fast training and strong second-stage conversion prediction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address three limitations in existing work: temporal leakage from random splits, lack of downstream conversion signals, and computational inefficiency of complex graph-based models.

Method: Propose a time-ordered data split; introduce Taoke dataset with promoter/product attributes and true purchases; design CasTemp: temporal walks, Jaccard-based inter-cascade neighbor selection, and GRU encoding with time-aware attention.

Result: Under leak-free evaluation, CasTemp achieves state-of-the-art on four datasets with orders-of-magnitude speedup; excels at predicting second-stage conversions.

Conclusion: Leak-free evaluation combined with richer data and efficient modeling enables practical and scalable cascade popularity forecasting for real-world applications.

Abstract: Information cascade popularity prediction is a key problem in analyzing
content diffusion in social networks. However, current related works suffer
from three critical limitations: (1) temporal leakage in current
evaluation--random cascade-based splits allow models to access future
information, yielding unrealistic results; (2) feature-poor datasets that lack
downstream conversion signals (e.g., likes, comments, or purchases), which
limits more practical applications; (3) computational inefficiency of complex
graph-based methods that require days of training for marginal gains. We
systematically address these challenges from three perspectives: task setup,
dataset construction, and model design. First, we propose a time-ordered
splitting strategy that chronologically partitions data into consecutive
windows, ensuring models are evaluated on genuine forecasting tasks without
future information leakage. Second, we introduce Taoke, a large-scale
e-commerce cascade dataset featuring rich promoter/product attributes and
ground-truth purchase conversions--capturing the complete diffusion lifecycle
from promotion to monetization. Third, we develop CasTemp, a lightweight
framework that efficiently models cascade dynamics through temporal walks,
Jaccard-based neighbor selection for inter-cascade dependencies, and GRU-based
encoding with time-aware attention. Under leak-free evaluation, CasTemp
achieves state-of-the-art performance across four datasets with
orders-of-magnitude speedup. Notably, it excels at predicting second-stage
popularity conversions--a practical task critical for real-world applications.

### [182] [Analysis of Semi-Supervised Learning on Hypergraphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25354)
*Adrien Weihs,Andrea Bertozzi,Matthew Thorpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Asymptotic consistency of variational learning on random geometric hypergraphs is established, showing convergence to a weighted p-Laplacian. The paper introduces Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL), which regularizes via powers of Laplacians from skeleton graphs to achieve multiscale smoothness and converges to a higher-order Sobolev seminorm, with strong empirical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hypergraphs capture higher-order interactions relevant to semi-supervised learning, but theoretical guarantees are scarce. There is a need to establish well-posedness and to design regularizers that reflect higher-order structure. The work aims to ground hypergraph learning in PDE-like theory and provide a multiscale regularization scheme.

Method: An asymptotic analysis of variational learning on random geometric hypergraphs, deriving conditions for well-posedness and proving convergence to a weighted p-Laplacian equation. Based on this, HOHL regularizes using powers of Laplacians derived from skeleton graphs to enforce multiscale smoothness, with convergence to a higher-order Sobolev seminorm.

Result: Theoretical results characterizing well-posedness and convergence to a weighted p-Laplacian. HOHL provides multiscale regularization that converges to a higher-order Sobolev seminorm. Empirically, HOHL achieves strong performance on standard baselines.

Conclusion: The work provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for hypergraph-based semi-supervised learning and introduces HOHL as a principled higher-order regularizer, bridging hypergraph learning with higher-order PDE-inspired regularization and demonstrating practical efficacy.

Abstract: Hypergraphs provide a natural framework for modeling higher-order
interactions, yet their theoretical underpinnings in semi-supervised learning
remain limited. We provide an asymptotic consistency analysis of variational
learning on random geometric hypergraphs, precisely characterizing the
conditions ensuring the well-posedness of hypergraph learning as well as
showing convergence to a weighted $p$-Laplacian equation. Motivated by this, we
propose Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL), which regularizes via powers
of Laplacians from skeleton graphs for multiscale smoothness. HOHL converges to
a higher-order Sobolev seminorm. Empirically, it performs strongly on standard
baselines.

### [183] [Parameter Averaging in Link Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25361)
*Rupesh Sapkota,Caglar Demir,Arnab Sharma,Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Weighted averaging (model merging) for KGE ensembles improves link prediction without training multiple models; selective updates based on validation performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ensembles boost generalization but training many models is costly; a parameter-averaging approach offers efficiency.

Method: Maintain a running average of model parameters from training epochs; optionally update only when validation performance improves; apply to KGE models for link prediction, with literal-augmented models and multi-hop queries.

Result: Weighted averaging improves performance consistently across diverse tasks compared to standard ensemble approach.

Conclusion: Model merging via weighted averaging is an effective and efficient alternative for KGE ensembles.

Abstract: Ensemble methods are widely employed to improve generalization in machine
learning. This has also prompted the adoption of ensemble learning for the
knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models in performing link prediction. Typical
approaches to this end train multiple models as part of the ensemble, and the
diverse predictions are then averaged. However, this approach has some
significant drawbacks. For instance, the computational overhead of training
multiple models increases latency and memory overhead. In contrast, model
merging approaches offer a promising alternative that does not require training
multiple models. In this work, we introduce model merging, specifically
weighted averaging, in KGE models. Herein, a running average of model
parameters from a training epoch onward is maintained and used for predictions.
To address this, we additionally propose an approach that selectively updates
the running average of the ensemble model parameters only when the
generalization performance improves on a validation dataset. We evaluate these
two different weighted averaging approaches on link prediction tasks, comparing
the state-of-the-art benchmark ensemble approach. Additionally, we evaluate the
weighted averaging approach considering literal-augmented KGE models and
multi-hop query answering tasks as well. The results demonstrate that the
proposed weighted averaging approach consistently improves performance across
diverse evaluation settings.

*Tomas Hrycej,Bernhard Bermeitinger,Massimo Pavone,Götz-Henrik Wiegand,Siegfried Handschuh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A two-phase optimization framework that detects a convexity swap point in loss landscapes and switches from a non-convex optimizer (Adam) to a convex one (Conjugate Gradient) to improve convergence and accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world loss functions are often non-convex but tend to become convex near the optimum. If an optimizer can exploit this local convexity, convergence can be faster and more reliable.

Method: A two-phase algorithm that detects the swap point by examining how the gradient norm depends on the loss. In non-convex regions, it uses Adam; in convex regions, it switches to Conjugate Gradient (CG). The detection guides when to switch.

Result: Computing experiments support the hypothesis: the observed convexity structure occurs frequently enough to be practically exploitable, yielding substantial improvements in convergence speed and accuracy.

Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates a simple yet effective strategy for accelerating optimization by exploiting local convexity near optima; with potential broad applicability, it invites further study on robust swap detection and cross-task generalization.

Abstract: The key task of machine learning is to minimize the loss function that
measures the model fit to the training data. The numerical methods to do this
efficiently depend on the properties of the loss function. The most decisive
among these properties is the convexity or non-convexity of the loss function.
The fact that the loss function can have, and frequently has, non-convex
regions has led to a widespread commitment to non-convex methods such as Adam.
However, a local minimum implies that, in some environment around it, the
function is convex. In this environment, second-order minimizing methods such
as the Conjugate Gradient (CG) give a guaranteed superlinear convergence. We
propose a novel framework grounded in the hypothesis that loss functions in
real-world tasks swap from initial non-convexity to convexity towards the
optimum. This is a property we leverage to design an innovative two-phase
optimization algorithm. The presented algorithm detects the swap point by
observing the gradient norm dependence on the loss. In these regions,
non-convex (Adam) and convex (CG) algorithms are used, respectively. Computing
experiments confirm the hypothesis that this simple convexity structure is
frequent enough to be practically exploited to substantially improve
convergence and accuracy.

*Julien Martinelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Biology-Informed Machine Learning (BIML) extends Physics-Informed ML to biology, using probabilistic priors and four pillars to handle biology's uncertainties; foundation models will enable scalable, human-aligned modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Biology poses uncertain, heterogeneous, noisy data; partial observability; high-dimensional networks; existing PIML isn't fully suited; need a principled, softer prior framework.

Method: Proposes BIML with four pillars: uncertainty quantification, contextualization, constrained latent structure inference, scalability; leverages foundation models and LLMs to bridge domain expertise with computation; retools PIML to operate under probabilistic priors.

Result: A position paper outlining a theoretical framework, roadmap, and concrete recommendations for building a BIML ecosystem; no empirical results presented.

Conclusion: BIML should complement PIML, enabling machine learning in biology to tackle high-impact scientific and societal challenges; calls for ecosystem development and practical adoption.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) has successfully integrated
mechanistic understanding into machine learning, particularly in domains
governed by well-known physical laws. This success has motivated efforts to
apply PIML to biology, a field rich in dynamical systems but shaped by
different constraints. Biological modeling, however, presents unique
challenges: multi-faceted and uncertain prior knowledge, heterogeneous and
noisy data, partial observability, and complex, high-dimensional networks. In
this position paper, we argue that these challenges should not be seen as
obstacles to PIML, but as catalysts for its evolution. We propose
Biology-Informed Machine Learning (BIML): a principled extension of PIML that
retains its structural grounding while adapting to the practical realities of
biology. Rather than replacing PIML, BIML retools its methods to operate under
softer, probabilistic forms of prior knowledge. We outline four foundational
pillars as a roadmap for this transition: uncertainty quantification,
contextualization, constrained latent structure inference, and scalability.
Foundation Models and Large Language Models will be key enablers, bridging
human expertise with computational modeling. We conclude with concrete
recommendations to build the BIML ecosystem and channel PIML-inspired
innovation toward challenges of high scientific and societal relevance.

*Adrien Weihs,Jingmin Sun,Zecheng Zhang,Hayden Schaeffer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unified theory and architectures for learning multiple and single neural operators across function spaces, with universal approximation and scaling laws.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scientific ML requires approximating operators between function spaces; this work advances theory and practical architectures to learn collections of operators, enabling scalable neural operator learning across regimes.

Method: Proposes MNO and MONet for multiple operators; universal approximation results in continuous, integrable, Lipschitz settings; explicit scaling laws for Lipschitz operators; framework for balancing subnetworks when learning several distinct operators; empirical validation on parametric PDE benchmarks.

Result: Establishes universal approximation capabilities for the proposed architectures; derives scaling laws quantifying network growth for target accuracy; demonstrates computational efficiency and expressive power; empirical results confirm practicality and scalability.

Conclusion: Provides a unified theoretical and practical foundation for scalable neural operator learning across multiple operators, with architectures and guidelines for when to use each regime; supports broader adoption in scientific applications.

Abstract: While many problems in machine learning focus on learning mappings between
finite-dimensional spaces, scientific applications require approximating
mappings between function spaces, i.e., operators. We study the problem of
learning collections of operators and provide both theoretical and empirical
advances. We distinguish between two regimes: (i) multiple operator learning,
where a single network represents a continuum of operators parameterized by a
parametric function, and (ii) learning several distinct single operators, where
each operator is learned independently. For the multiple operator case, we
introduce two new architectures, $\mathrm{MNO}$ and $\mathrm{MONet}$, and
establish universal approximation results in three settings: continuous,
integrable, or Lipschitz operators. For the latter, we further derive explicit
scaling laws that quantify how the network size must grow to achieve a target
approximation accuracy. For learning several single operators, we develop a
framework for balancing architectural complexity across subnetworks and show
how approximation order determines computational efficiency. Empirical
experiments on parametric PDE benchmarks confirm the strong expressive power
and efficiency of the proposed architectures. Overall, this work establishes a
unified theoretical and practical foundation for scalable neural operator
learning across multiple operators.

*Jamison Meindl,Yunsheng Tian,Tony Cui,Veronika Thost,Zhang-Wei Hong,Jie Chen,Wojciech Matusik,Mina Konaković Luković*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GPTOpt uses LLMs fine-tuned on synthetic BO data to perform global, derivative-free optimization with no per-task parameter tuning, outperforming classic optimizers on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global optimization of expensive black-box functions is sample-inefficient; Bayesian Optimization (BO) can be effective but requires careful domain-specific tuning. Large Language Models (LLMs) have broad reasoning capabilities but struggle with continuous optimization. The work seeks to fuse LLMs with continuous black-box optimization to reduce tuning and improve performance.

Method: Fine-tune large language models on diverse synthetic datasets parameterized for BO across tasks, enabling the model to generalize to new optimization problems. The approach leverages LLM pre-training as the backbone for numerical optimization reasoning and provides a flexible, parameter-tuning-free framework for global optimization.

Result: GPTOpt surpasses traditional optimizers on a range of black-box optimization benchmarks, demonstrating advanced numerical reasoning by LLMs and offering a versatile framework for global optimization without manual parameter tuning.

Conclusion: LLMs can perform sophisticated numerical optimization tasks and enable parameter-free, generalizable global optimization for expensive black-box objectives, broadening the applicability of AI-assisted optimization.

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions demands
extreme sample efficiency. Classical methods such as Bayesian Optimization (BO)
can be effective, but they often require careful parameter tuning to each
application domain. At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
broad capabilities, yet state-of-the-art models remain limited in solving
continuous black-box optimization tasks. We introduce GPTOpt, an LLM-based
optimization method that equips LLMs with continuous black-box optimization
capabilities. By fine-tuning large language models on extensive synthetic
datasets derived from diverse BO parameterizations, GPTOpt leverages LLM
pre-training to generalize across optimization tasks. On a variety of black-box
optimization benchmarks, GPTOpt surpasses traditional optimizers, highlighting
the capacity of LLMs for advanced numerical reasoning and introducing a
flexible framework for global optimization without parameter tuning.

*Mahmoud Hegazy,Michael I. Jordan,Aymeric Dieuleveut*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes utility calibration, a scalable, utility-driven framework to evaluate multiclass calibration; unifies existing metrics and enables robust, richer-downstream utilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Classifier calibration is essential for trustworthy predictions; current multiclass calibration metrics are fragmented, often focusing on top-class or class-wise aspects or relying on computationally heavy variational methods, which hurts scalability and general applicability.

Method: Introduce utility calibration: calibration error is measured relative to a user-specified utility function that captures end-user goals. Show how existing calibration metrics (e.g., top-class, class-wise) appear as special cases under this framework; propose robustified versions of these metrics; extend calibration assessment beyond binarized evaluations to richer downstream utilities.

Result: A general, scalable framework that unifies and reinterprets diverse multiclass calibration metrics and enables calibration assessment for broader downstream utilities; provides a pathway to derive robust and flexible calibration metrics within a single coherent formalism.

Conclusion: Utility calibration offers a principled, scalable approach to evaluating multiclass calibration that aligns with user goals and supports richer, downstream decision criteria beyond traditional binarized metrics.

Abstract: Ensuring that classifiers are well-calibrated, i.e., their predictions align
with observed frequencies, is a minimal and fundamental requirement for
classifiers to be viewed as trustworthy. Existing methods for assessing
multiclass calibration often focus on specific aspects associated with
prediction (e.g., top-class confidence, class-wise calibration) or utilize
computationally challenging variational formulations. In this work, we study
scalable \emph{evaluation} of multiclass calibration. To this end, we propose
utility calibration, a general framework that measures the calibration error
relative to a specific utility function that encapsulates the goals or decision
criteria relevant to the end user. We demonstrate how this framework can unify
and re-interpret several existing calibration metrics, particularly allowing
for more robust versions of the top-class and class-wise calibration metrics,
and, going beyond such binarized approaches, toward assessing calibration for
richer classes of downstream utilities.

*Florian A. Hölzl,Daniel Rueckert,Georgios Kaissis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GWA (Gradient-Weight Alignment) is a training-stage metric that measures how well per-sample gradients align with the model's current weights. It tracks generalization during training, attributes performance to individual training samples, and enables validation-set-free model analysis including early stopping and sample influence detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robust validation metrics are needed to detect overfitting, monitor training dynamics, and attribute performance to training data without relying solely on a fixed validation set.

Method: Define GWA as the coherence between each training example's gradient and the model's weight vector at a given training step. Compute efficiently during training to reflect sample-specific contributions and overall learning dynamics. Use GWA trends to forecast generalization, compare models, and identify influential samples.

Result: Experiments show GWA correlates with generalization, can predict optimal early stopping, facilitates principled model comparisons, and highlights influential training samples, providing a validation-set-free analysis from training data.

Conclusion: GWA provides an efficient, informative training-time metric that links sample-level gradients to model weights, enabling both global monitoring of learning dynamics and local attribution of success or failure to individual training points.

Abstract: Robust validation metrics remain essential in contemporary deep learning, not
only to detect overfitting and poor generalization, but also to monitor
training dynamics. In the supervised classification setting, we investigate
whether interactions between training data and model weights can yield such a
metric that both tracks generalization during training and attributes
performance to individual training samples. We introduce Gradient-Weight
Alignment (GWA), quantifying the coherence between per-sample gradients and
model weights. We show that effective learning corresponds to coherent
alignment, while misalignment indicates deteriorating generalization. GWA is
efficiently computable during training and reflects both sample-specific
contributions and dataset-wide learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that GWA accurately predicts optimal early stopping, enables principled model
comparisons, and identifies influential training samples, providing a
validation-set-free approach for model analysis directly from the training
data.

*Luca Andolfi,Eleonora Giunchiglia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Prototypical neurosymbolic architectures mitigate reasoning shortcuts by grounding neural predicates in prototypes, enabling correct concepts to drive symbolic constraints even with minimal data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neurosymbolic AI often learns spurious correlations to satisfy symbolic constraints, leading to shortcut reasoning. There is a need for annotation-efficient, reliable grounding of concepts to ensure right reasoning.

Method: Introduce prototypical neurosymbolic architectures grounded in prototypical learning theory; train models to satisfy background knowledge and reward similarity to labeled prototypes, enabling learning of the correct concepts under scarce supervision; evaluate with rsbench across tasks MNIST-EvenOdd, Kand-Logic, BDD-OIA.

Result: Significant improvements in acquiring the correct concepts and satisfying constraints with very little data; outperform baselines on both synthetic and real-world high-stakes tasks; demonstrates robustness to spurious correlations.

Conclusion: Prototype grounding offers an effective, annotation-efficient strategy for safe and reliable neurosymbolic learning, reducing shortcut reasoning and improving trustworthiness.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI is growing in popularity thanks to its ability to combine
neural perception and symbolic reasoning in end-to-end trainable models.
However, recent findings reveal these are prone to shortcut reasoning, i.e., to
learning unindented concepts--or neural predicates--which exploit spurious
correlations to satisfy the symbolic constraints. In this paper, we address
reasoning shortcuts at their root cause and we introduce prototypical
neurosymbolic architectures. These models are able to satisfy the symbolic
constraints (be right) because they have learnt the correct basic concepts (for
the right reasons) and not because of spurious correlations, even in extremely
low data regimes. Leveraging the theory of prototypical learning, we
demonstrate that we can effectively avoid reasoning shortcuts by training the
models to satisfy the background knowledge while taking into account the
similarity of the input with respect to the handful of labelled datapoints. We
extensively validate our approach on the recently proposed rsbench benchmark
suite in a variety of settings and tasks with very scarce supervision: we show
significant improvements in learning the right concepts both in synthetic tasks
(MNIST-EvenOdd and Kand-Logic) and real-world, high-stake ones (BDD-OIA). Our
findings pave the way to prototype grounding as an effective,
annotation-efficient strategy for safe and reliable neurosymbolic learning.

TL;DR: SVM best predictor for burnout from the HackerEarth dataset (R2=0.84) with a 30-fold CV; an interactive Streamlit app enables practical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Burnout significantly affects well-being and organizational performance; early, data-driven detection via machine learning can support mental health strategies in the workplace.

Method: Compared three supervised algorithms (KNN, Random Forest, SVM) using 30-fold cross-validation and evaluated with the coefficient of determination (R2); statistical comparison via paired t-tests; dataset used is the HackerEarth Employee Burnout Challenge; developed a Streamlit interface for practical predictions.

Result: SVM achieved the highest predictive performance (R2 = 0.84) and was statistically superior to KNN and Random Forest; an interactive Streamlit app was created for non-technical users to obtain burnout risk predictions.

Conclusion: Machine learning shows promise for early burnout detection and enabling data-driven mental health strategies in organizations; the Streamlit interface supports practical adoption by non-technical stakeholders.

Abstract: Burnout is a psychological syndrome marked by emotional exhaustion,
depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment, with a significant
impact on individual well-being and organizational performance. This study
proposes a machine learning approach to predict burnout risk using the
HackerEarth Employee Burnout Challenge dataset. Three supervised algorithms
were evaluated: nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest, and support vector
machine (SVM), with model performance evaluated through 30-fold
cross-validation using the determination coefficient (R2). Among the models
tested, SVM achieved the highest predictive performance (R2 = 0.84) and was
statistically superior to KNN and Random Forest based on paired $t$-tests. To
ensure practical applicability, an interactive interface was developed using
Streamlit, allowing non-technical users to input data and receive burnout risk
predictions. The results highlight the potential of machine learning to support
early detection of burnout and promote data-driven mental health strategies in
organizational settings.

*Amin Parchami-Araghi,Sukrut Rao,Jonas Fischer,Bernt Schiele*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes model-inherent mechanistic concepts and a cross-class, faithful explanation framework with a new C^2-Score for concept consistency; achieves more faithful, interpretable explanations with competitive accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Post-hoc concept explanations often sacrifice faithfulness due to assumptions like class-specificity, small spatial extent, or misalignment with human intuition. There is a need for explanations that faithfully reflect the model and are interpretable across layers and classes.

Method: Introduce a new model that uses shared, mechanistic concepts; enable tracing from any layer to logit contributions and input visualizations; define C^2-Score to quantify concept-consistency; evaluate against prior methods and include user-perception assessments.

Result: Concepts are more consistent and interpretable than prior methods; C^2-Score supports improved faithfulness; ImageNet performance remains competitive.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that faithful, mechanism-level concept explanations are feasible and broadly applicable, introducing a quantitative metric (C^2-Score) to evaluate them without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Deep networks have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
yet getting a global concept-level understanding of how they function remains a
key challenge. Many post-hoc concept-based approaches have been introduced to
understand their workings, yet they are not always faithful to the model.
Further, they make restrictive assumptions on the concepts a model learns, such
as class-specificity, small spatial extent, or alignment to human expectations.
In this work, we put emphasis on the faithfulness of such concept-based
explanations and propose a new model with model-inherent mechanistic
concept-explanations. Our concepts are shared across classes and, from any
layer, their contribution to the logit and their input-visualization can be
faithfully traced. We also leverage foundation models to propose a new
concept-consistency metric, C$^2$-Score, that can be used to evaluate
concept-based methods. We show that, compared to prior work, our concepts are
quantitatively more consistent and users find our concepts to be more
interpretable, all while retaining competitive ImageNet performance.

### [194] [Transformers Provably Learn Directed Acyclic Graphs via Kernel-Guided Mutual Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25542)
*Yuan Cheng,Yu Huang,Zhe Xiong,Yingbin Liang,Vincent Y. F. Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A theoretical framework showing that training a single-layer multi-head transformer with a kernel-guided mutual information objective can provably learn and recover multi-parent DAG structures from data, with convergence guarantees and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world data often have DAG-structured dependencies with multiple parents per node. Existing theory covers only tree-like graphs; there is a need for training objectives that let different attention heads learn different parent relationships and for provable recovery of the graph structure.

Method: Introduce kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI) based on f-divergence. Use a multi-head attention model where each head is tied to a distinct marginal transition kernel to capture diverse parent-child dependencies. Prove polynomial-time convergence of training a single-layer, multi-head transformer via gradient ascent on sequences from a K-parent DAG. Analyze attention patterns at convergence. Show that with KL divergence, the learned attention aligns with the ground-truth adjacency.

Result: Provide theoretical guarantees: convergence to global optimum in polynomial time; attention scores reflect the true parent relationships; KL-divergence specialization recovers the underlying graph structure. Experimental results corroborate the theory.

Conclusion: The paper offers a principled, information-theoretic objective for learning DAG structures with transformer attention, enabling provable recovery of the hidden graph and illuminating attention behavior in multi-parent settings.

Abstract: Uncovering hidden graph structures underlying real-world data is a critical
challenge with broad applications across scientific domains. Recently,
transformer-based models leveraging the attention mechanism have demonstrated
strong empirical success in capturing complex dependencies within graphs.
However, the theoretical understanding of their training dynamics has been
limited to tree-like graphs, where each node depends on a single parent.
Extending provable guarantees to more general directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) --
which involve multiple parents per node -- remains challenging, primarily due
to the difficulty in designing training objectives that enable different
attention heads to separately learn multiple different parent relationships.
  In this work, we address this problem by introducing a novel
information-theoretic metric: the kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI),
based on the $f$-divergence. Our objective combines KG-MI with a multi-head
attention framework, where each head is associated with a distinct marginal
transition kernel to model diverse parent-child dependencies effectively. We
prove that, given sequences generated by a $K$-parent DAG, training a
single-layer, multi-head transformer via gradient ascent converges to the
global optimum in polynomial time. Furthermore, we characterize the attention
score patterns at convergence. In addition, when particularizing the
$f$-divergence to the KL divergence, the learned attention scores accurately
reflect the ground-truth adjacency matrix, thereby provably recovering the
underlying graph structure. Experimental results validate our theoretical
findings.

### [195] [Hybrid Quantum-Classical Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25557)
*Wenduan Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid quantum-classical RNN (QRNN) uses a parametrized quantum circuit as its hidden state, controlled by a classical network. It achieves unitary, norm-preserving recurrence with mid-circuit readouts providing classical nonlinearities, enabling competitive sequence modeling across tasks via up to 14 qubits and a soft-attention sequence-to-sequence extension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To integrate unitary quantum recurrence with partial observability and classical nonlinearity in a trainable sequence model, leveraging the exponential memory of quantum states while maintaining trainable classical control.

Method: The hidden state is an n-qubit PQC; a classical feedforward network processes mid-circuit readouts combined with inputs to parameterize the PQC, updating the hidden state via unitary dynamics. The approach unifies unitary recurrence, partial observation, and nonlinear classical control. Experiments: simulations up to 14 qubits on sentiment, MNIST variants, copying memory, language modeling; projective measurements used to realize mid-circuit readouts; introduced soft attention over mid-circuit readouts for seq2seq translation.

Result: Achieves competitive performance against strong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks; mid-circuit measurements enable partial observation while preserving a coherent quantum memory; soft attention over readouts improves translation performance.

Conclusion: The work presents the first quantum-grounded recurrent model with competitive results on diverse sequence tasks, demonstrating a physically consistent QRNN architecture that unifies quantum memory, partial observation, and classical nonlinear control, and suggesting a viable path for quantum-enhanced sequence modeling.

Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN)
architecture in which the entire recurrent core is realized as a parametrized
quantum circuit (PQC) controlled by a classical feedforward network. The hidden
state is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially
large Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$. The PQC is unitary by construction,
making the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints.
At each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding
and processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical
nonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state
via unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it
unifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial
observation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control
for input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with
up to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory,
and language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to
obtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum
memory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit
readouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine
translation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise)
grounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against
strong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks.

### [196] [Leveraging an Atmospheric Foundational Model for Subregional Sea Surface Temperature Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25563)
*Víctor Medina,Giovanny A. Cuervo-Londoño,Javier Sánchez*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fine-tunes Aurora (pre-trained for atmospheric forecasting) on high-res ocean reanalysis to predict Canary Upwelling SST, achieving RMSE 0.119 K and ACC ~0.997; strong large-scale pattern replication, limited coastal detail; reduces computation; promising cross-domain pretraining for ocean forecasting; future work: more variables, higher resolution, physics-informed models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome high computational cost and scalability limits of traditional numerical ocean forecasting by leveraging deep learning, especially pre-trained models from related domains, to improve SST predictions in dynamic upwelling regions.

Method: Stage-wise fine-tuning of Aurora using high-resolution ocean reanalysis data for SST in Canary Upwelling; incorporate latitude-weighted error metrics; hyperparameter optimization; assess performance in reproducing large-scale SST structures.

Result: RMSE = 0.119 K; anomaly correlation coefficient (ACC) ~ 0.997; reproduces large-scale SST structures; computationally cheaper than full numerical models; coastal finer details remain challenging.

Conclusion:  demonstrates feasibility of adapting pre-trained deep learning models from different domains to ocean forecasting; potential to enhance climate modeling and decision-making; future work includes adding more ocean variables, higher resolution, and physics-informed approaches for interpretability.

Abstract: The accurate prediction of oceanographic variables is crucial for
understanding climate change, managing marine resources, and optimizing
maritime activities. Traditional ocean forecasting relies on numerical models;
however, these approaches face limitations in terms of computational cost and
scalability. In this study, we adapt Aurora, a foundational deep learning model
originally designed for atmospheric forecasting, to predict sea surface
temperature (SST) in the Canary Upwelling System. By fine-tuning this model
with high-resolution oceanographic reanalysis data, we demonstrate its ability
to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns while reducing computational
demands. Our methodology involves a staged fine-tuning process, incorporating
latitude-weighted error metrics and optimizing hyperparameters for efficient
learning. The experimental results show that the model achieves a low RMSE of
0.119K, maintaining high anomaly correlation coefficients (ACC $\approx
0.997$). The model successfully reproduces large-scale SST structures but faces
challenges in capturing finer details in coastal regions. This work contributes
to the field of data-driven ocean forecasting by demonstrating the feasibility
of using deep learning models pre-trained in different domains for oceanic
applications. Future improvements include integrating additional oceanographic
variables, increasing spatial resolution, and exploring physics-informed neural
networks to enhance interpretability and understanding. These advancements can
improve climate modeling and ocean prediction accuracy, supporting
decision-making in environmental and economic sectors.

### [197] [A Framework for Bounding Deterministic Risk with PAC-Bayes: Applications to Majority Votes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25569)
*Benjamin Leblanc,Pascal Germain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified framework converts stochastic PAC-Bayes guarantees into bounds for a single hypothesis, including an oracle bound, a computable numerical bound, and a majority-vote specialization; empirically stronger than baselines for deterministic classifiers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PAC-Bayes typically provides guarantees on the expected risk of a random hypothesis, which complicates deployment of a single deterministic predictor. This work aims to extract meaningful guarantees for a single classifier.

Method: Proposes a general oracle bound and derives from it a numerical bound, plus a specialization to majority vote, forming a unified framework to translate stochastic guarantees into single-hypothesis bounds.

Result: The framework yields guarantees for a single hypothesis and, empirically, outperforms popular baselines (by up to a factor of 2) in generalization bounds for deterministic classifiers.

Conclusion: The approach enables practical deterministic PAC-Bayes guarantees by deriving single-hypothesis bounds from stochastic PAC-Bayes guarantees, with demonstrated empirical improvement over baselines.

Abstract: PAC-Bayes is a popular and efficient framework for obtaining generalization
guarantees in situations involving uncountable hypothesis spaces.
Unfortunately, in its classical formulation, it only provides guarantees on the
expected risk of a randomly sampled hypothesis. This requires stochastic
predictions at test time, making PAC-Bayes unusable in many practical
situations where a single deterministic hypothesis must be deployed. We propose
a unified framework to extract guarantees holding for a single hypothesis from
stochastic PAC-Bayesian guarantees. We present a general oracle bound and
derive from it a numerical bound and a specialization to majority vote. We
empirically show that our approach consistently outperforms popular baselines
(by up to a factor of 2) when it comes to generalization bounds on
deterministic classifiers.

### [198] [Perturbation Bounds for Low-Rank Inverse Approximations under Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25571)
*Phuc Tran,Nisheeth K. Vishnoi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sharp non-asymptotic spectral-norm perturbation bounds for the best rank-p inverse of a symmetric matrix under additive noise, using contour-integral methods for f(z)=1/z; bounds depend on eigengap, spectral decay, and noise alignment; up to sqrt(n) improvement over naive full-inverse bounds; empirically validated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-rank inverse approximations are widely used in scalable ML, optimization, and scientific computing but are vulnerable to noise in real data. There is a lack of spectrum-aware, non-asymptotic perturbation guarantees for the spectral-norm error of low-rank inverse approximations.

Method: Analyze A symmetric; let A_p^{-1} be the best rank-p approximation of A^{-1} and \\tilde{A}=A+E. Derive sharp non-asymptotic perturbation bounds for ||(\tilde{A}^{-1})_p - A_p^{-1}|| that depend on eigengap, spectral decay, and the alignment of E with low-curvature directions of A. Employ contour integral techniques adapted to the non-entire function f(z)=1/z to bound the perturbation, achieving improvements over naive full-inverse approaches.

Result: Non-asymptotic bounds that scale with noise level and spectral properties, including eigengap and decay; show up to a factor of sqrt(n) improvement over naive bounds; empirical results show the derived bounds closely track the true perturbation error across real-world and synthetic matrices, whereas classical bounds overpredict.

Conclusion: Provides spectrum-aware, pragmatic guarantees for low-rank inverse approximations in noisy computations; the contour-integral approach extends to non-entire functions and yields tighter perturbation bounds, with practical implications for scalable ML, optimization, and scientific computing.

Abstract: Low-rank pseudoinverses are widely used to approximate matrix inverses in
scalable machine learning, optimization, and scientific computing. However,
real-world matrices are often observed with noise, arising from sampling,
sketching, and quantization. The spectral-norm robustness of low-rank inverse
approximations remains poorly understood. We systematically study the
spectral-norm error $\| (\tilde{A}^{-1})_p - A_p^{-1} \|$ for an $n\times n$
symmetric matrix $A$, where $A_p^{-1}$ denotes the best rank-\(p\)
approximation of $A^{-1}$, and $\tilde{A} = A + E$ is a noisy observation.
Under mild assumptions on the noise, we derive sharp non-asymptotic
perturbation bounds that reveal how the error scales with the eigengap,
spectral decay, and noise alignment with low-curvature directions of $A$. Our
analysis introduces a novel application of contour integral techniques to the
\emph{non-entire} function $f(z) = 1/z$, yielding bounds that improve over
naive adaptations of classical full-inverse bounds by up to a factor of
$\sqrt{n}$. Empirically, our bounds closely track the true perturbation error
across a variety of real-world and synthetic matrices, while estimates based on
classical results tend to significantly overpredict. These findings offer
practical, spectrum-aware guarantees for low-rank inverse approximations in
noisy computational environments.

### [199] [Generalized Sobolev IPM for Graph-Based Measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25591)
*Tam Le,Truyen Nguyen,Hideitsu Hino,Kenji Fukumizu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Generalizes Sobolev IPM on graphs via Orlicz geometry; connects Orlicz-Sobolev with Musielak norm; yields GSI-M, univariate optimization; faster than OW; applicable to graph-based measure comparison and ML tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: L^p-based Sobolev IPM limits incorporating non-L^p geometric priors; need flexible structure to capture nuanced relationships; leverage Orlicz-Wasserstein and generalized Sobolev transport to broaden applicability.

Method: Define Orlicz-Sobolev norm; establish theoretical link to Musielak norm; propose Generalized Sobolev IPM with Musielak regularization (GSI-M); exploit graph structure to reduce optimization to a univariate problem.

Result: GSI-M reduces to a univariate optimization problem; substantial computational efficiency gains; empirically outperforms Orlicz-Wasserstein in computing pairwise measure comparisons on graphs; effective for document classification and topological data analysis tasks.

Conclusion: Orlicz-geometric Sobolev IPM generalizes Sobolev IPM beyond L^p geometry; offers scalable computation via Musielak-regularized GSI (GSI-M); applicable to graph-based measure comparison and ML tasks; enables broader priors with potential for further extensions.

Abstract: We study the Sobolev IPM problem for measures supported on a graph metric
space, where critic function is constrained to lie within the unit ball defined
by Sobolev norm. While Le et al. (2025) achieved scalable computation by
relating Sobolev norm to weighted $L^p$-norm, the resulting framework remains
intrinsically bound to $L^p$ geometric structure, limiting its ability to
incorporate alternative structural priors beyond the $L^p$ geometry paradigm.
To overcome this limitation, we propose to generalize Sobolev IPM through the
lens of \emph{Orlicz geometric structure}, which employs convex functions to
capture nuanced geometric relationships, building upon recent advances in
optimal transport theory -- particularly Orlicz-Wasserstein (OW) and
generalized Sobolev transport -- that have proven instrumental in advancing
machine learning methodologies. This generalization encompasses classical
Sobolev IPM as a special case while accommodating diverse geometric priors
beyond traditional $L^p$ structure. It however brings up significant
computational hurdles that compound those already inherent in Sobolev IPM. To
address these challenges, we establish a novel theoretical connection between
Orlicz-Sobolev norm and Musielak norm which facilitates a novel regularization
for the generalized Sobolev IPM (GSI). By further exploiting the underlying
graph structure, we show that GSI with Musielak regularization (GSI-M) reduces
to a simple \emph{univariate optimization} problem, achieving remarkably
computational efficiency. Empirically, GSI-M is several-order faster than the
popular OW in computation, and demonstrates its practical advantages in
comparing probability measures on a given graph for document classification and
several tasks in topological data analysis.

### [200] [Feedback Alignment Meets Low-Rank Manifolds: A Structured Recipe for Local Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25594)
*Arani Roy,Marco P. Apolinario,Shristi Das Biswas,Kaushik Roy*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Structured local learning on low-rank weight manifolds via SVD enables layer-wise, local updates with fewer parameters while achieving BP-like accuracy, through a composite loss and SVD-aligned feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backpropagation requires global error propagation and full parameterization, leading to high memory and compute costs. Direct Feedback Alignment offers local updates but struggles with scalability in deep CNNs and with unstructured feedback.

Method: Represent each layer's weights in SVD form (U, Σ, V^T). Update the SVD components with a composite loss consisting of cross-entropy, subspace alignment, and orthogonality regularization. Construct feedback matrices to match the SVD structure to ensure alignment between forward and feedback paths. Train on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet; compare against BP and DFA; perform ablations to assess each loss term.

Result: Achieves accuracy comparable to backpropagation on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet; reduces the number of trainable parameters relative to the original DFA model; ablation studies confirm the importance of each term in the low-rank loss.

Conclusion: Local learning on low-rank manifolds is a principled, scalable alternative to full-gradient training that maintains competitive performance while reducing parameter count and memory demands.

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) with backpropagation (BP) achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy but requires global error propagation and full
parameterization, leading to substantial memory and computational overhead.
Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA) enables local, parallelizable updates with
lower memory requirements but is limited by unstructured feedback and poor
scalability in deeper architectures, specially convolutional neural networks.
To address these limitations, we propose a structured local learning framework
that operates directly on low-rank manifolds defined by the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) of weight matrices. Each layer is trained in its decomposed
form, with updates applied to the SVD components using a composite loss that
integrates cross-entropy, subspace alignment, and orthogonality regularization.
Feedback matrices are constructed to match the SVD structure, ensuring
consistent alignment between forward and feedback pathways. Our method reduces
the number of trainable parameters relative to the original DFA model, without
relying on pruning or post hoc compression. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and ImageNet show that our method achieves accuracy comparable to that of BP.
Ablation studies confirm the importance of each loss term in the low-rank
setting. These results establish local learning on low-rank manifolds as a
principled and scalable alternative to full-rank gradient-based training.

### [201] [Uncertainty Quantification for Regression: A Unified Framework based on kernel scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25599)
*Christopher Bülte,Yusuf Sale,Gitta Kutyniok,Eyke Hüllermeier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a kernel-score-based framework to quantify total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty in regression, unifying existing measures and enabling design trade-offs (tail sensitivity, robustness, OOD responsiveness).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty quantification in regression is crucial for safety-critical domains but most work emphasizes classification; there is a need for principled, flexible measures that capture different uncertainty types and respond sensibly to out-of-distribution data.

Method: Proposes a family of measures derived from proper scoring rules, with emphasis on kernel scores; shows correspondences between kernel properties and downstream behavior; provides guidelines for designing task-specific measures.

Result: Extensive experiments show the measures perform well in downstream tasks, reveal trade-offs among instantiations (robustness vs OOD detection), and demonstrate how kernel choice tunes tail sensitivity and OOD responsiveness.

Conclusion: Kernel-score uncertainty measures unify existing metrics, enable principled design of new measures, and offer practical design guidelines for regression uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Regression tasks, notably in safety-critical domains, require proper
uncertainty quantification, yet the literature remains largely
classification-focused. In this light, we introduce a family of measures for
total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty based on proper scoring rules, with
a particular emphasis on kernel scores. The framework unifies several
well-known measures and provides a principled recipe for designing new ones
whose behavior, such as tail sensitivity, robustness, and out-of-distribution
responsiveness, is governed by the choice of kernel. We prove explicit
correspondences between kernel-score characteristics and downstream behavior,
yielding concrete design guidelines for task-specific measures. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that these measures are effective in downstream tasks
and reveal clear trade-offs among instantiations, including robustness and
out-of-distribution detection performance.

### [202] [INT v.s. FP: A Comprehensive Study of Fine-Grained Low-bit Quantization Formats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25602)
*Mengzhao Chen,Meng Wu,Hui Jin,Zhihang Yuan,Jing Liu,Chaoyi Zhang,Yunshui Li,Jie Huang,Jin Ma,Zeyue Xue,Zhiheng Liu,Xingyan Bin,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A systematic FP vs INT quantization study across granularities shows MXINT8 often outperforms FP in 8-bit fine-grained scenarios, while FP can win at 4-bit; Hadamard rotation can boost NVINT4; introduces symmetric clipping for INT training; argues for fine-grained INT formats for future accelerators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no unified comparison between floating-point and integer quantization across different granularity levels, despite industry trends toward low-precision in AI hardware. Providing guidance is essential for algorithm-hardware co-design.

Method: Systematic empirical evaluation across FP and INT formats at multiple granularity levels (coarse to fine-grained), focusing on 8-bit and 4-bit configurations. It includes analysis of activation outliers, hardware efficiency, and accuracy, with techniques like Hadamard rotation for outlier mitigation and a symmetric clipping method during training.

Result: For popular 8-bit fine-grained formats (e.g., MX with block size 32), MXINT8 outperforms FP counterparts in both accuracy and hardware efficiency. For 4-bit formats, FP often has better accuracy, though NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 when Hadamard rotation is applied. A symmetric clipping method reduces gradient bias in fine-grained low-bit INT training, enabling nearly lossless performance for MXINT8 training.

Conclusion: A one-size-fits-all FP approach is suboptimal. Fine-grained INT formats, particularly MXINT8, offer a superior balance of accuracy, power, and efficiency for future AI accelerators, challenging current hardware trajectories.

Abstract: Modern AI hardware, such as Nvidia's Blackwell architecture, is increasingly
embracing low-precision floating-point (FP) formats to handle the pervasive
activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite this industry
trend, a unified comparison of FP and integer (INT) quantization across varying
granularities has been missing, leaving algorithm and hardware co-design
without clear guidance. This paper fills that gap by systematically
investigating the trade-offs between FP and INT formats. We reveal a critical
performance crossover: while FP excels in coarse-grained quantization, the
comparison at fine-grained (block-wise) levels is more nuanced. Our
comprehensive comparison demonstrates that for popular 8-bit fine-grained
formats (e.g., MX with block size 32), MXINT8 is superior to its FP counterpart
in both algorithmic accuracy and hardware efficiency. However, for 4-bit
formats, FP (e.g., MXFP4, NVFP4) often holds an accuracy advantage , though we
show that NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 when outlier-mitigation techniques like
Hadamard rotation are applied. We also introduce a symmetric clipping method
that resolves gradient bias in fine-grained low-bit INT training, enabling
nearly lossless performance for MXINT8 training. These findings challenge the
current hardware trajectory, demonstrating that a one-size-fits-all FP approach
is suboptimal and advocating that fine-grained INT formats, particularly
MXINT8, offer a better balance of accuracy, power, and efficiency for future AI
accelerators.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BOLT-GAN is a BOLT-inspired modification of WGAN that uses a Lipschitz discriminator to implicitly minimize a different distance than Wasserstein, improving training stability and achieving 10-60% lower FID on four benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GANs trained with Wasserstein distance can suffer from stability issues and suboptimal perceptual metrics; the paper aims to leverage the Bayes Optimal Learning Threshold idea to guide GAN training toward a more favorable implicit metric.

Method: Introduce BOLT-GAN, a simple modification of WGAN that enforces a Lipschitz discriminator and aligns the training objective with a Bayes-optimal threshold-based criterion, resulting in a different (non-Wasserstein) implicit metric; evaluate on CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, LSUN Bedroom-64, and LSUN Church-64.

Result: BOLT-GAN consistently outperforms WGAN, achieving 10-60% lower Frechet Inception Distance (FID) across the four benchmarks and improved training stability.

Conclusion: BOLT is a broadly applicable principle for enhancing GAN training.

Abstract: We introduce BOLT-GAN, a simple yet effective modification of the WGAN
framework inspired by the Bayes Optimal Learning Threshold (BOLT). We show that
with a Lipschitz continuous discriminator, BOLT-GAN implicitly minimizes a
different metric distance than the Earth Mover (Wasserstein) distance and
achieves better training stability. Empirical evaluations on four standard
image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, LSUN Bedroom-64, and LSUN
Church-64) show that BOLT-GAN consistently outperforms WGAN, achieving 10-60%
lower Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Our results suggest that BOLT is a
broadly applicable principle for enhancing GAN training.

TL;DR: FedLap introduces Laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to enable privacy-preserving, scalable federated learning on graph-structured data with inter-client subgraphs, achieving competitive or superior utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Interconnected subgraphs across multiple clients significantly affect FL performance. Existing methods either leak private node embeddings or are computationally intensive, limiting privacy and scalability.

Method: FedLap leverages global graph structure information via Laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to capture inter-node dependencies while preserving privacy. It is framed as a subgraph FL scheme with formal privacy guarantees.

Result: The approach achieves competitive or superior utility on benchmark datasets and includes a formal analysis showing privacy preservation, marking it as the first subgraph FL method with strong privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: FedLap offers a privacy-preserving, scalable approach to subgraph federated learning that maintains competitive performance compared with existing methods.

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated learning (FL) with graph-structured data
distributed across multiple clients. In particular, we address the prevalent
scenario of interconnected subgraphs, where interconnections between clients
significantly influence the learning process. Existing approaches suffer from
critical limitations, either requiring the exchange of sensitive node
embeddings, thereby posing privacy risks, or relying on
computationally-intensive steps, which hinders scalability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FedLap, a novel framework that leverages global
structure information via Laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to
effectively capture inter-node dependencies while ensuring privacy and
scalability. We provide a formal analysis of the privacy of FedLap,
demonstrating that it preserves privacy. Notably, FedLap is the first subgraph
FL scheme with strong privacy guarantees. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FedLap achieves competitive or superior utility
compared to existing techniques.

### [205] [Spectral Perturbation Bounds for Low-Rank Approximation with Applications to Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25670)
*Phuc Tran,Nisheeth K. Vishnoi,Van H. Vu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: High-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds for symmetric A under symmetric perturbation E; sharp subspace-distance control (A+E)_p vs A_p under eigengap/norm conditions; improves Eckart–Young–Mirsky by up to sqrt(n); applies to differential privacy in PCA; introduces contour bootstrapping for spectral functionals; empirically validated.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the need for worst-case directional error guarantees in low-rank approximations, especially for differential privacy, where Frobenius-based metrics can misestimate subspace distortions.

Method: Develops a contour bootstrapping approach from complex analysis and extends it to a broad class of spectral functionals (polynomials, matrix exponentials). Derives high-probability bounds for ||(A+E)_p - A_p|| under mild eigengap and norm assumptions, accounting for interactions between A and perturbation E.

Result: New sharp spectral-norm perturbation bounds with potential up to sqrt(n) improvement over classical results; improved utility guarantees for differentially private PCA; general framework for spectral functionals; validated empirically on real datasets.

Conclusion: The work tightens spectral perturbation guarantees for low-rank approximation under perturbations, provides a broadly applicable probabilistic framework, and yields concrete DP-PCA benefits, supported by experiments.

Abstract: A central challenge in machine learning is to understand how noise or
measurement errors affect low-rank approximations, particularly in the spectral
norm. This question is especially important in differentially private low-rank
approximation, where one aims to preserve the top-$p$ structure of a
data-derived matrix while ensuring privacy. Prior work often analyzes Frobenius
norm error or changes in reconstruction quality, but these metrics can over- or
under-estimate true subspace distortion. The spectral norm, by contrast,
captures worst-case directional error and provides the strongest utility
guarantees. We establish new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds
for symmetric matrices that refine the classical Eckart--Young--Mirsky theorem
and explicitly capture interactions between a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n
\times n}$ and an arbitrary symmetric perturbation $E$. Under mild eigengap and
norm conditions, our bounds yield sharp estimates for $\|(A + E)_p - A_p\|$,
where $A_p$ is the best rank-$p$ approximation of $A$, with improvements of up
to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$. As an application, we derive improved utility
guarantees for differentially private PCA, resolving an open problem in the
literature. Our analysis relies on a novel contour bootstrapping method from
complex analysis and extends it to a broad class of spectral functionals,
including polynomials and matrix exponentials. Empirical results on real-world
datasets confirm that our bounds closely track the actual spectral error under
diverse perturbation regimes.

### [206] [Mechanistic Interpretability of RNNs emulating Hidden Markov Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25674)
*Elia Torre,Michele Viscione,Lucas Pompe,Benjamin F Grewe,Valerio Mante*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RNNs can replicate HMM-like discrete latent dynamics and, via noise-driven rotational trajectories and specialized 'kick neurons', perform probabilistic computations; this mechanism generalizes across RNN architectures through modular motif reuse.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how continuous-state RNNs can generate spontaneous, stochastic, discrete-like latent dynamics observed in natural behavior, bridging the gap between recurrent networks and hidden Markov models.

Method: Train RNNs to mimic HMM emission statistics and analyze their internal dynamics. In the absence of inputs, networks collapse to a fixed point; with stochastic input, trajectories form noise-sustained motion along closed orbits. Rotation along these orbits modulates emission probabilities and is enabled by slow regions connected by fast, deterministic transitions. The networks develop a small set of 'kick neurons' that initiate transitions, revealing a regime of stochastic resonance. The study tests fully connected, cyclic, and linear-chain HMM architectures to show modular reuse of the same dynamical motif across architectures.

Result: RNNs exhibit noise-driven limit-cycle dynamics whose rotation modulates emission probabilities; transitions between slow regions are triggered by 'kick neurons'; the network's connectivity becomes highly structured; the same dynamical motif is reused across different architectures, indicating a compositional principle by which RNNs emulate discrete latent dynamics and support probabilistic computations.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a compositional principle by which RNNs can implement discrete latent dynamics akin to HMMs through a motif of slow, noise-driven regions connected by fast transitions and kick-driven state changes. This enables probabilistic computations and generalizes across architectures, offering insight into how continuous networks can model discrete latent behavior.

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) provide a powerful approach in neuroscience
to infer latent dynamics in neural populations and to generate hypotheses about
the neural computations underlying behavior. However, past work has focused on
relatively simple, input-driven, and largely deterministic behaviors - little
is known about the mechanisms that would allow RNNs to generate the richer,
spontaneous, and potentially stochastic behaviors observed in natural settings.
Modeling with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) has revealed a segmentation of
natural behaviors into discrete latent states with stochastic transitions
between them, a type of dynamics that may appear at odds with the continuous
state spaces implemented by RNNs. Here we first show that RNNs can replicate
HMM emission statistics and then reverse-engineer the trained networks to
uncover the mechanisms they implement. In the absence of inputs, the activity
of trained RNNs collapses towards a single fixed point. When driven by
stochastic input, trajectories instead exhibit noise-sustained dynamics along
closed orbits. Rotation along these orbits modulates the emission probabilities
and is governed by transitions between regions of slow, noise-driven dynamics
connected by fast, deterministic transitions. The trained RNNs develop highly
structured connectivity, with a small set of "kick neurons" initiating
transitions between these regions. This mechanism emerges during training as
the network shifts into a regime of stochastic resonance, enabling it to
perform probabilistic computations. Analyses across multiple HMM architectures
- fully connected, cyclic, and linear-chain - reveal that this solution
generalizes through the modular reuse of the same dynamical motif, suggesting a
compositional principle by which RNNs can emulate complex discrete latent
dynamics.

*Alessandro Lucchetti,Francesco Cadini,Marco Giglio,Luca Lomazzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GNSS is a Graph Network-based surrogate model for dynamic structural simulations using node-local frames, sign-aware loss, and wavelength-aware connectivity; it yields accurate, fast predictions for wave-dominated dynamics and generalizes to unseen loading conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in GNN surrogate models for dynamic structural problems, enabling stable long-rollout predictions and faster-than-FEM simulations.

Method: An encode-process-decode GNN framework where node kinematics are expressed in node-fixed local frames to avoid velocity cancellation; a sign-aware regression loss to reduce phase errors; a wavelength-informed connectivity radius to optimize graph construction; tested on a beam excited by a 50 kHz Hanning-modulated pulse.

Result: Accurately reproduces physics over hundreds of timesteps; generalizes to unseen loading conditions; existing GNNs fail to converge or provide meaningful predictions in these scenarios; achieves substantial inference speedups over explicit finite element baselines while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity.

Conclusion: Locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent update rules are a competitive option for dynamic, wave-dominated structural simulations.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been explored as surrogate models
for numerical simulations. While their applications in computational fluid
dynamics have been investigated, little attention has been given to structural
problems, especially for dynamic cases. To address this gap, we introduce the
Graph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate
modeling of dynamic structural problems.
  GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine
learning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic
simulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in
node-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in
finite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss,
which reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a
wavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction.
  We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz
Hanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the
physics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen
loading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful
predictions.
  Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial
inference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity. These
findings demonstrate that locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent
update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated
structural simulations.

Method: Propose Convolutional Spiking GRU (CS-GRU) cell using convolutional operations to capture local structure while leveraging spiking dynamics and GRU gates; evaluated on NTIDIGITS, SHD, MNIST, DVSGesture, CIFAR10DVS.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art GRU variants by an average of 4.35%; achieves over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to 99.31% on MNIST; 69% higher efficiency than SpikGRU.

Conclusion: CS-GRU offers a versatile, efficient framework for processing both temporal and spatio-temporal event data with preserved local dependencies; code available at GitHub.

Abstract: Spike-based temporal messaging enables SNNs to efficiently process both
purely temporal and spatio-temporal time-series or event-driven data. Combining
SNNs with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), a variant of recurrent neural networks,
gives rise to a robust framework for sequential data processing; however,
traditional RNNs often lose local details when handling long sequences.
Previous approaches, such as SpikGRU, fail to capture fine-grained local
dependencies in event-based spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we introduce
the Convolutional Spiking GRU (CS-GRU) cell, which leverages convolutional
operations to preserve local structure and dependencies while integrating the
temporal precision of spiking neurons with the efficient gating mechanisms of
GRUs. This versatile architecture excels on both temporal datasets (NTIDIGITS,
SHD) and spatio-temporal benchmarks (MNIST, DVSGesture, CIFAR10DVS). Our
experiments show that CS-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art GRU variants by an
average of 4.35%, achieving over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to
99.31% on MNIST. It is worth noting that our solution achieves 69% higher
efficiency compared to SpikGRU. The code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LieSolver uses Lie symmetries to enforce the PDE exactly in IBVPs, improving efficiency and accuracy over PINNs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage symmetry principles to embed physical laws directly into the solver, enabling exact PDE satisfaction, better convergence, and error estimation for well-posed problems.

Method: Construct a model that uses Lie symmetry transformations to enforce the PDE by construction; trains on initial/boundary data; loss aligns with solution accuracy; tested on linear homogeneous PDEs; compared against PINNs.

Result: Faster convergence and higher accuracy than PINNs; enables rigorous a priori error estimates for well-posed IBVPs; yields compact, efficient models.

Conclusion: Symmetry-based enforcement via LieSolver enhances reliability and efficiency of PDE-constrained learning, offering robust error control beyond conventional PINNs.

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficiently solving initial-boundary value problems
(IBVPs) that uses Lie symmetries to enforce the associated partial differential
equation (PDE) exactly by construction. By leveraging symmetry transformations,
the model inherently incorporates the physical laws and learns solutions from
initial and boundary data. As a result, the loss directly measures the model's
accuracy, leading to improved convergence. Moreover, for well-posed IBVPs, our
method enables rigorous error estimation. The approach yields compact models,
facilitating an efficient optimization. We implement LieSolver and demonstrate
its application to linear homogeneous PDEs with a range of initial conditions,
showing that it is faster and more accurate than physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs). Overall, our method improves both computational efficiency
and the reliability of predictions for PDE-constrained problems.

*David S Maxwell,Michael Darkoh,Sidharth R Samudrala,Caroline Chung,Stephanie T Schmidt,Bissan Al-Lazikani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable, generalizable preprocessing tool (MLPrE) built on Spark DataFrames using a JSON-described pipeline with 69 stages, demonstrated on six datasets, enabling data preparation for ML and graph databases and integration with workflows like Airflow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for a lightweight, extensible preprocessing tool that can handle heterogeneous data formats, scales with data size, and integrates into larger data pipelines (e.g., Apache Airflow).

Method: Implemented MLPrE using Spark DataFrames to ensure scalability. Utilized a generalizable JSON input format to describe stepwise DataFrame transformations. Developed 69 stages including input/output, filtering, statistics, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis, with demonstrations on six datasets (UniProt terms, wine data, phosphosite kinase data) and multi-field processing in flat files.

Result: 69 stages implemented; demonstrated key stages on six diverse datasets; showcased independent field processing and recombination; clustering demonstrated with wine data; data preparation for a graph database demonstrated with phosphosite kinase data; tool aims to be generalizable and scalable for preprocessing and early data analysis.

Conclusion: MLPrE fills a critical need for scalable, generalizable preprocessing and early data analysis within ML workflows, with potential to accelerate and simplify integration into larger pipelines.

Abstract: With the recent growth of Deep Learning for AI, there is a need for tools to
meet the demand of data flowing into those models. In some cases, source data
may exist in multiple formats, and therefore the source data must be
investigated and properly engineered for a Machine Learning model or graph
database. Overhead and lack of scalability with existing workflows limit
integration within a larger processing pipeline such as Apache Airflow, driving
the need for a robust, extensible, and lightweight tool to preprocess arbitrary
datasets that scales with data type and size. To address this, we present
Machine Learning Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis, MLPrE, in which
SparkDataFrames were utilized to hold data during processing and ensure
scalability. A generalizable JSON input file format was utilized to describe
stepwise changes to that DataFrame. Stages were implemented for input and
output, filtering, basic statistics, feature engineering, and exploratory data
analysis. A total of 69 stages were implemented into MLPrE, of which we
highlight and demonstrate key stages using six diverse datasets. We further
highlight MLPrE's ability to independently process multiple fields in flat
files and recombine them, otherwise requiring an additional pipeline, using a
UniProt glossary term dataset. Building on this advantage, we demonstrated the
clustering stage with available wine quality data. Lastly, we demonstrate the
preparation of data for a graph database in the final stages of MLPrE using
phosphosite kinase data. Overall, our MLPrE tool offers a generalizable and
scalable tool for preprocessing and early data analysis, filling a critical
need for such a tool given the ever expanding use of machine learning. This
tool serves to accelerate and simplify early stage development in larger
workflows.

### [211] [Synthetic Data Reveals Generalization Gaps in Correlated Multiple Instance Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25759)
*Ethan Harvey,Dennis Johan Loevlie,Michael C. Hughes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MIL methods neglect context among neighboring instances; a synthetic task shows that incorporating adjacent patch/slice information is crucial, exposing limitations of standard and even some correlated MIL, which still don't match Bayes-optimal performance when trained from scratch on large data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify the value of contextual information in MIL for medical imaging and to compare practical MIL methods against an optimal Bayes estimator on a task designed to require context.

Method: Create a synthetic classification task where the predictive signal relies on adjacent instance features. Evaluate off-the-shelf MIL and newer correlated MIL methods against the Bayes-optimal estimator (available in closed form) by training on tens of thousands of instances.

Result: The Bayes-optimal estimator achieves a closed-form solution and sets an upper bound. Standard MIL methods underperform relative to the Bayes estimator on this task. Newer correlated MIL methods improve over, but do not reach, Bayes-optimal performance when trained from scratch on large-scale data, indicating limited generalization/optimization in the current approaches.

Conclusion: Contextual information among neighboring instances is essential for accurate classification in this setting. Conventional MIL and even newer correlated MIL methods may fail to match Bayes-optimal performance without specialized modeling or training strategies, highlighting a gap between practice and the theoretical optimum and suggesting directions focusing on context-aware architectures and optimization.

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) is often used in medical imaging to classify
high-resolution 2D images by processing patches or classify 3D volumes by
processing slices. However, conventional MIL approaches treat instances
separately, ignoring contextual relationships such as the appearance of nearby
patches or slices that can be essential in real applications. We design a
synthetic classification task where accounting for adjacent instance features
is crucial for accurate prediction. We demonstrate the limitations of
off-the-shelf MIL approaches by quantifying their performance compared to the
optimal Bayes estimator for this task, which is available in closed-form. We
empirically show that newer correlated MIL methods still struggle to generalize
as well as possible when trained from scratch on tens of thousands of
instances.

*Naoki Kiyohara,Edward Johns,Yingzhen Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NSFs learn SDE transition laws via conditional normalizing flows for fast, one-shot sampling between arbitrary states, achieving large-time speed-ups while preserving distribution accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDEs model noisy, irregular time series across finance, physics, and ML. Traditional solvers are costly for sampling at arbitrary times; a faster, distribution-preserving method is needed.

Method: Introduce Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) and latent variants that learn (latent) SDE transition laws with conditional normalizing flows constrained to preserve stochastic-flow properties, enabling direct sampling between arbitrary states.

Result: NSFs achieve up to two orders of magnitude speed-ups at large time gaps, with distributional accuracy comparable to numerical solvers, validated on synthetic SDEs and real-world tracking/video data.

Conclusion: NSFs provide efficient, accurate one-shot sampling of SDE transitions, enabling scalable modeling of noisy time series with irregular sampling and large time gaps.

Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are well suited to modelling noisy
and irregularly sampled time series found in finance, physics, and machine
learning. Traditional approaches require costly numerical solvers to sample
between arbitrary time points. We introduce Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) and
their latent variants, which directly learn (latent) SDE transition laws using
conditional normalising flows with architectural constraints that preserve
properties inherited from stochastic flows. This enables one-shot sampling
between arbitrary states and yields up to two orders of magnitude speed-ups at
large time gaps. Experiments on synthetic SDE simulations and on real-world
tracking and video data show that NSFs maintain distributional accuracy
comparable to numerical approaches while dramatically reducing computation for
arbitrary time-point sampling.
