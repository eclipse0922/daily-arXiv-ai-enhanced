### [1] [Real-Time Intuitive AI Drawing System for Collaboration: Enhancing Human Creativity through Formal and Contextual Intent Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19254)
*Jookyung Song,Mookyoung Kang,Nojun Kwak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A real-time, touchscreen-based generative drawing system that jointly models formal (structure, composition, style) and contextual (semantic meaning) intents, using a dual-intent, two-stage pipeline with contour-preserving and content-aware synthesis, enabling low-latency, multi-user co-creation on shared canvases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional text-prompt-based generative systems emphasize high-level semantic descriptions but neglect precise geometric and structural cues. There is a need for systems that jointly model formal intent (geometry, layout, style) and contextual intent (meaning) to support real-time, collaborative, accessible visual creation and mutual enhancement between humans and AI.

Method: The system extracts dual intent signals: formal intent from intuitive geometric features (line trajectories, proportions, spatial arrangement) and contextual intent from semantic cues via vision-language models. These signals are jointly conditioned in a two-stage generation pipeline that combines contour-preserving structural control with style- and content-aware image synthesis. A touchscreen interface and distributed inference enable low-latency operation and multi-user collaboration on shared canvases.

Result: The approach delivers low-latency, two-stage transformation, enabling synchronous, co-authored visual creation on a shared canvas. It supports participants with varying artistic expertise and facilitates collaborative art-making.

Conclusion: This work reframes human-AI interaction as co-creation and mutual enhancement, presenting a platform that supports real-time, collaborative visual creation and expands possibilities for machine-assisted art and design.

Abstract: This paper presents a real-time generative drawing system that interprets and
integrates both formal intent - the structural, compositional, and stylistic
attributes of a sketch - and contextual intent - the semantic and thematic
meaning inferred from its visual content - into a unified transformation
process. Unlike conventional text-prompt-based generative systems, which
primarily capture high-level contextual descriptions, our approach
simultaneously analyzes ground-level intuitive geometric features such as line
trajectories, proportions, and spatial arrangement, and high-level semantic
cues extracted via vision-language models. These dual intent signals are
jointly conditioned in a multi-stage generation pipeline that combines
contour-preserving structural control with style- and content-aware image
synthesis. Implemented with a touchscreen-based interface and distributed
inference architecture, the system achieves low-latency, two-stage
transformation while supporting multi-user collaboration on shared canvases.
The resulting platform enables participants, regardless of artistic expertise,
to engage in synchronous, co-authored visual creation, redefining human-AI
interaction as a process of co-creation and mutual enhancement.

### [2] [TTF-VLA: Temporal Token Fusion via Pixel-Attention Integration for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19257)
*Chenghao Liu,Jiachen Zhang,Chengxuan Li,Zhimu Zhou,Shixin Wu,Songfang Huang,Huiling Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Temporal Token Fusion (TTF) is a training-free method that fuses historical and current visual tokens to improve Vision-Language-Action models in robotic manipulation, using dual-dimension detection (grayscale pixel diff + attention semantic relevance), hard fusion and keyframe anchoring, achieving cross-scenario gains and suggesting KQV reuse directions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action models process frames independently, discarding temporal coherence and being vulnerable to visual noise. A training-free, model-agnostic method that leverages temporal information could improve inference quality in robotic manipulation tasks.

Method: TTF uses dual-dimension detection: (1) efficient grayscale pixel difference analysis to detect temporal changes, and (2) attention-based semantic relevance assessment to judge which tokens are worth fusing. It performs selective temporal token fusion via hard fusion strategies and keyframe anchoring to prevent error accumulation. It is training-free and model-agnostic, compatible with OpenVLA and VLA-Cache, and reveals potential gains from selective Query matrix reuse in attention (KQV) for acceleration.

Result: Empirical gains across datasets: LIBERO shows an average improvement of 4.0 percentage points (72.4% vs 68.4% baseline). Cross-environment validation on SimplerEnv yields 4.8% relative improvement, and real robot tasks show 8.7% relative improvement. Demonstrates model-agnostic applicability and suggests avenues for faster inference via KQV reuse in attention.

Conclusion: TTF effectively leverages temporal information without training and across architectures, improving VLA inference quality and robustness to visual noise. It highlights promising directions for direct KQV matrix reuse to accelerate attention-based models and reduce error accumulation in temporal fusion.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models process visual inputs independently at
each timestep, discarding valuable temporal information inherent in robotic
manipulation tasks. This frame-by-frame processing makes models vulnerable to
visual noise while ignoring the substantial coherence between consecutive
frames in manipulation sequences. We propose Temporal Token Fusion (TTF), a
training-free approach that intelligently integrates historical and current
visual representations to enhance VLA inference quality. Our method employs
dual-dimension detection combining efficient grayscale pixel difference
analysis with attention-based semantic relevance assessment, enabling selective
temporal token fusion through hard fusion strategies and keyframe anchoring to
prevent error accumulation. Comprehensive experiments across LIBERO,
SimplerEnv, and real robot tasks demonstrate consistent improvements: 4.0
percentage points average on LIBERO (72.4\% vs 68.4\% baseline),
cross-environment validation on SimplerEnv (4.8\% relative improvement), and
8.7\% relative improvement on real robot tasks. Our approach proves
model-agnostic, working across OpenVLA and VLA-Cache architectures. Notably,
TTF reveals that selective Query matrix reuse in attention mechanisms enhances
rather than compromises performance, suggesting promising directions for direct
KQV matrix reuse strategies that achieve computational acceleration while
improving task success rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide scalable, objective feedback on slide quality by combining low-level design cues with multimodal embeddings to approximate audience perceptions, addressing subjectivity and scalability.

Method: Unsupervised pipeline combining seven expert-inspired metrics (whitespace, colorfulness, edge density, brightness contrast, text density, color harmony, layout balance) with CLIP-ViT embeddings; anomaly scoring via Isolation Forest; trained on 12k professional slides; evaluated on 115 slides from six academic talks.

Result: Pearson r up to 0.83 with human visual-quality ratings; outperforms ChatGPT o4-mini-high, ChatGPT o3, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro by factors ranging 1.79x–3.23x; evidence of convergent validity with visual ratings, discriminant validity against speaker-delivery scores, and alignment with overall impressions.

Conclusion: Augmenting low-level design cues with multimodal embeddings yields slide-quality representations that closely approximate audience perceptions, enabling scalable, real-time, objective feedback.

Abstract: We present an unsupervised slide-quality assessment pipeline that combines
seven expert-inspired visual-design metrics (whitespace, colorfulness, edge
density, brightness contrast, text density, color harmony, layout balance) with
CLIP-ViT embeddings, using Isolation Forest-based anomaly scoring to evaluate
presentation slides. Trained on 12k professional lecture slides and evaluated
on six academic talks (115 slides), our method achieved Pearson correlations up
to 0.83 with human visual-quality ratings-1.79x to 3.23x stronger than scores
from leading vision-language models (ChatGPT o4-mini-high, ChatGPT o3, Claude
Sonnet 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro). We demonstrate convergent validity with visual
ratings, discriminant validity against speaker-delivery scores, and exploratory
alignment with overall impressions. Our results show that augmenting low-level
design cues with multimodal embeddings closely approximates audience
perceptions of slide quality, enabling scalable, objective feedback in real
time.

### [4] [Efficient Model-Based Purification Against Adversarial Attacks for LiDAR Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19290)
*Alexandros Gkillas,Ioulia Kapsali,Nikos Piperigkos,Aris S. Lalos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an efficient, model-based purification framework for adversarial defense in 2D range-view LiDAR segmentation, featuring an explainable optimization-driven purification network that suppresses adversarial perturbations with low overhead; achieves competitive results on benchmarks and validates on a real vehicle.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Adversarial attacks threaten LiDAR-based segmentation in autonomous driving. While 2D range-view pipelines are computationally efficient, lightweight defenses for this domain are underexplored compared to raw 3D point clouds. A fast, accurate defense is needed for real-time deployment.

Method: Introduce a direct adversarial attack formulation in the range-view domain. Develop an explainable purification network based on a mathematically justified optimization problem that purifies perturbed range-view inputs prior to segmentation, with an emphasis on efficiency and interpretability.

Result: The purification framework delivers competitive performance on open benchmarks, consistently outperforming generative and adversarial training baselines. It achieves strong adversarial resilience with minimal computational overhead and is validated in real-world deployment on a demo vehicle.

Conclusion: An efficient, model-based purification approach for 2D range-view LiDAR segmentation provides robust adversarial defense with real-time feasibility, bridging the gap between lightweight pipelines and reliable security for autonomous driving.

Abstract: LiDAR-based segmentation is essential for reliable perception in autonomous
vehicles, yet modern segmentation networks are highly susceptible to
adversarial attacks that can compromise safety. Most existing defenses are
designed for networks operating directly on raw 3D point clouds and rely on
large, computationally intensive generative models. However, many
state-of-the-art LiDAR segmentation pipelines operate on more efficient 2D
range view representations. Despite their widespread adoption, dedicated
lightweight adversarial defenses for this domain remain largely unexplored. We
introduce an efficient model-based purification framework tailored for
adversarial defense in 2D range-view LiDAR segmentation. We propose a direct
attack formulation in the range-view domain and develop an explainable
purification network based on a mathematical justified optimization problem,
achieving strong adversarial resilience with minimal computational overhead.
Our method achieves competitive performance on open benchmarks, consistently
outperforming generative and adversarial training baselines. More importantly,
real-world deployment on a demo vehicle demonstrates the framework's ability to
deliver accurate operation in practical autonomous driving scenarios.

Conclusion: LVLMs are poised to transform object detection and robotics tech, with accelerating advances likely to meet or exceed conventional methods, while ongoing challenges require targeted research and systematic roadmap to achieve robust, real-time, and generalizable detection.

Abstract: The fusion of language and vision in large vision-language models (LVLMs) has
revolutionized deep learning-based object detection by enhancing adaptability,
contextual reasoning, and generalization beyond traditional architectures. This
in-depth review presents a structured exploration of the state-of-the-art in
LVLMs, systematically organized through a three-step research review process.
First, we discuss the functioning of vision language models (VLMs) for object
detection, describing how these models harness natural language processing

is expected that LVLMs will soon meet or surpass the performance of
conventional methods in object detection. The review also identifies a few
major limitations of the current LVLM modes, proposes solutions to address
those challenges, and presents a clear roadmap for the future advancement in
this field. We conclude, based on this study, that the recent advancement in
LVLMs have made and will continue to make a transformative impact on object
detection and robotic applications in the future.

### [6] [Large VLM-based Stylized Sports Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19295)
*Sauptik Dhar,Nicholas Buoncristiani,Joe Anakata,Haoyu Zhang,Michelle Munson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two-level fine-tuned LVLM pipeline for production-grade sports captions; outperforms baselines in F1 and BERT metrics; supports live journalism with fast captioning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sports content requires domain-specific jargon and natural, stylized narration that generic LVLMs struggle to produce; need accurate, fast captions for live game coverage.

Method: A two-stage fine-tuning of LVLMs to inject football/basketball-specific jargon and stylized narration, optimized for low memory footprint and fast inference during live events.

Result: >8-10% improvement in F1; >2-10% improvement in BERT score over alternatives; small runtime memory footprint; capable of ~6 images every 3-5 seconds for 1000+ images during a live game.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a practical, production-ready approach for real-time sports captioning with domain-specific language, suitable for live journalism workflows.

Abstract: The advent of large (visual) language models (LLM / LVLM) have led to a
deluge of automated human-like systems in several domains including social
media content generation, search and recommendation, healthcare prognosis, AI
assistants for cognitive tasks etc. Although these systems have been
successfully integrated in production; very little focus has been placed on
sports, particularly accurate identification and natural language description
of the game play. Most existing LLM/LVLMs can explain generic sports
activities, but lack sufficient domain-centric sports' jargon to create natural
(human-like) descriptions. This work highlights the limitations of existing
SoTA LLM/LVLMs for generating production-grade sports captions from images in a
desired stylized format, and proposes a two-level fine-tuned LVLM pipeline to
address that. The proposed pipeline yields an improvement > 8-10% in the F1,
and > 2-10% in BERT score compared to alternative approaches. In addition, it
has a small runtime memory footprint and fast execution time. During Super Bowl
LIX the pipeline proved its practical application for live professional sports
journalism; generating highly accurate and stylized captions at the rate of 6
images per 3-5 seconds for over 1000 images during the game play.

### [7] [DemoBias: An Empirical Study to Trace Demographic Biases in Vision Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19298)
*Abu Sufian,Anirudha Ghosh,Debaditya Barman,Marco Leo,Cosimo Distante*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DemoBias empirically measures demographic bias in LVLM-based biometric face recognition with text generation, revealing notable disparities for PaliGemma and LLaVA across Hispanic/Latino, Caucasian, and South Asian groups, while BLIP-2 shows more consistent performance. A demographic-balanced dataset and metrics like group-specific BERTScores and Fairness Discrepancy Rate underpin the analysis, with repository provided for reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fairness in biometric face recognition using large vision-language models is critical, as existing LVLMs can exhibit performance gaps across ethnicity/race, gender, and age. This study aims to quantify and trace such biases in a controlled setting.

Method: Fine-tune and evaluate three LVLMs (LLaVA, BLIP-2, PaliGemma) on a demographic-balanced, self-generated dataset for biometric FR with textual token generation. Use evaluation metrics including group-specific BERTScores and the Fairness Discrepancy Rate to quantify disparities and analyze results across demographic groups.

Result: Demographic biases were observed: PaliGemma and LLaVA showed higher disparities for Hispanic/Latino, Caucasian, and South Asian groups, while BLIP-2 demonstrated comparatively consistent performance across groups.

Conclusion: LVLMs for biometric FR with text-generation exhibit demographic biases; BLIP-2 appears more fairness-preserving among the tested models. The work provides empirical evidence and a public repository to facilitate reproducibility and future fairness-oriented improvements.

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across various downstream tasks, including biometric face
recognition (FR) with description. However, demographic biases remain a
critical concern in FR, as these foundation models often fail to perform
equitably across diverse demographic groups, considering ethnicity/race,
gender, and age. Therefore, through our work DemoBias, we conduct an empirical
evaluation to investigate the extent of demographic biases in LVLMs for
biometric FR with textual token generation tasks. We fine-tuned and evaluated
three widely used pre-trained LVLMs: LLaVA, BLIP-2, and PaliGemma on our own
generated demographic-balanced dataset. We utilize several evaluation metrics,
like group-specific BERTScores and the Fairness Discrepancy Rate, to quantify
and trace the performance disparities. The experimental results deliver
compelling insights into the fairness and reliability of LVLMs across diverse
demographic groups. Our empirical study uncovered demographic biases in LVLMs,
with PaliGemma and LLaVA exhibiting higher disparities for Hispanic/Latino,
Caucasian, and South Asian groups, whereas BLIP-2 demonstrated comparably
consistent. Repository: https://github.com/Sufianlab/DemoBias.

### [8] [Geo2Vec: Shape- and Distance-Aware Neural Representation of Geospatial Entities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19305)
*Chen Chu,Cyrus Shahabi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geo2Vec introduces an SDF-based, space-native representation for varied geo-entities (points, polylines, polygons) that adaptively samples and encodes signed distances, yielding unified, geometry-aware embeddings with rotation-invariant positional encoding. It aims to outperform decomposition-based methods (e.g., Poly2Vec) in accuracy and efficiency without prior geometric decomposition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current geo-embedding methods are limited: they typically handle a single geo-entity type or require decomposing shapes into simpler components for Fourier transforms, incurring high computational cost and losing fine-grained geometry. A unified, adaptive, geometry-preserving representation is needed for diverse GeoAI tasks.

Method: Geo2Vec builds a neural model to approximate a signed distance field directly in the original space. It adaptively samples points around geo-entities and learns to output their signed distances (positive outside, negative inside). A rotation-invariant positional encoding is used to capture high-frequency spatial variations, enabling a compact and robust embedding space shared across entity types without decomposition.

Result: Empirical evaluations show Geo2Vec consistently outperforms existing methods in representing shape and location, capturing topological and distance relationships, and delivering greater efficiency in real-world GeoAI applications.

Conclusion: Geo2Vec provides a compact, geometry-aware, and unified representation for geo-entities by operating in the original space with adaptive sampling and SDF learning, along with a rotation-invariant encoding that enhances robustness and high-frequency variation modeling; code is available online.

Abstract: Spatial representation learning is essential for GeoAI applications such as
urban analytics, enabling the encoding of shapes, locations, and spatial
relationships (topological and distance-based) of geo-entities like points,
polylines, and polygons. Existing methods either target a single geo-entity
type or, like Poly2Vec, decompose entities into simpler components to enable
Fourier transformation, introducing high computational cost. Moreover, since
the transformed space lacks geometric alignment, these methods rely on uniform,
non-adaptive sampling, which blurs fine-grained features like edges and
boundaries. To address these limitations, we introduce Geo2Vec, a novel method
inspired by signed distance fields (SDF) that operates directly in the original
space. Geo2Vec adaptively samples points and encodes their signed distances
(positive outside, negative inside), capturing geometry without decomposition.
A neural network trained to approximate the SDF produces compact,
geometry-aware, and unified representations for all geo-entity types.
Additionally, we propose a rotation-invariant positional encoding to model
high-frequency spatial variations and construct a structured and robust
embedding space for downstream GeoAI models. Empirical results show that
Geo2Vec consistently outperforms existing methods in representing shape and
location, capturing topological and distance relationships, and achieving
greater efficiency in real-world GeoAI applications. Code and Data can be found

### [9] [Advancements in Crop Analysis through Deep Learning and Explainable AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19307)
*Hamza Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CNN-based rice variety classification with a 75,000-image dataset, plus an XAI-enabled framework for rice leaf disease diagnosis using CNNs and SHAP/LIME; demonstrates high accuracy and interpretability for automated crop quality inspection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rice quality and crop health have global economic and nutritional implications. Manual inspection is labor-intensive, error-prone, and slow, necessitating automated, scalable, and interpretable AI solutions to classify grain varieties and diagnose leaf diseases across major rice-producing regions.

Method: 1) Classify five rice grain varieties using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) trained/tested on a publicly available dataset of 75,000 images; evaluation metrics include accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, ROC curves, and confusion matrices. 2) Develop an accurate diagnostic method for leaf diseases (Brown Spot, Blast, Bacterial Blight, Tungro) by combining explainable AI with deep learning models (CNN, VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2) using SHAP and LIME to reveal feature influences.

Result: The rice grain classifier achieved high accuracy with minimal misclassifications across varieties (performance evaluated via accuracy, recall, precision, F1-score, ROC, and confusion matrices). The leaf-disease framework demonstrated strong transparency, with SHAP and LIME elucidating how grain and leaf features drive predictions, indicating robustness and interpretability of the DL models.

Conclusion: Deep learning, augmented with explainability techniques, holds strong potential for automated crop quality inspection and disease diagnosis, supporting farmers, consumers, and the agricultural economy by enabling scalable, interpretable AI-assisted agriculture.

Abstract: Rice is a staple food of global importance in terms of trade, nutrition, and
economic growth. Among Asian nations such as China, India, Pakistan, Thailand,
Vietnam and Indonesia are leading producers of both long and short grain
varieties, including basmati, jasmine, arborio, ipsala, and kainat saila. To
ensure consumer satisfaction and strengthen national reputations, monitoring
rice crops and grain quality is essential. Manual inspection, however, is
labour intensive, time consuming and error prone, highlighting the need for
automated solutions for quality control and yield improvement. This study
proposes an automated approach to classify five rice grain varieties using
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). A publicly available dataset of 75000
images was used for training and testing. Model evaluation employed accuracy,
recall, precision, F1-score, ROC curves, and confusion matrices. Results
demonstrated high classification accuracy with minimal misclassifications,
confirming the model effectiveness in distinguishing rice varieties. In
addition, an accurate diagnostic method for rice leaf diseases such as Brown
Spot, Blast, Bacterial Blight, and Tungro was developed. The framework combined
explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) with deep learning models including
CNN, VGG16, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2. Explainability techniques such as SHAP
(SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic
Explanations) revealed how specific grain and leaf features influenced
predictions, enhancing model transparency and reliability. The findings
demonstrate the strong potential of deep learning in agricultural applications,
paving the way for robust, interpretable systems that can support automated
crop quality inspection and disease diagnosis, ultimately benefiting farmers,
consumers, and the agricultural economy.

### [11] [Automated classification of natural habitats using ground-level imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19314)
*Mahdis Tourian,Sareh Rowlands,Remy Vandaele,Max Fancourt,Rebecca Mein,Hywel T. P. Williams*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep-learning approach classifies ground-level habitat photos into 18 classes per the Living England framework, achieving a mean F1-score of 0.61 across five-fold cross-validation, with higher accuracy for visually distinct classes (e.g., Bare Soil, Silt and Peat, Bare Sand) and lower accuracy for mixed/ambiguous classes; a web app is provided for practical use, showing potential for scalable habitat classification from ground-level imagery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable scalable, ground-level habitat classification to complement satellite-based methods, improve validation, and support biodiversity monitoring, land-use planning, and citizen-science data integration; leveraging the Living England framework.

Method: Preprocess images (resize, normalize, augment); balance classes via re-sampling; train/fine-tune a DeepLabV3-ResNet101 semantic segmentation model to assign one of 18 habitat classes per image; evaluate with five-fold cross-validation; develop a simple web application for image uploads and classification outputs.

Result: Five-fold cross-validation yielded a mean F1-score of 0.61 across all 18 classes. Some classes with visually distinctive features (e.g., Bare Soil, Silt and Peat, Bare Sand) achieved F1-scores >0.90, while mixed or ambiguous classes scored lower, indicating varying difficulty across classes but overall robust performance and potential for scalable monitoring.

Conclusion: Ground-level imagery combined with deep learning can enable scalable ecological monitoring and habitat classification at scale. The methodology is feasible and practical, especially with readily obtainable ground-level photos, and the authors provide a user-friendly web application to support practitioners.

Abstract: Accurate classification of terrestrial habitats is critical for biodiversity
conservation, ecological monitoring, and land-use planning. Several habitat
classification schemes are in use, typically based on analysis of satellite
imagery with validation by field ecologists. Here we present a methodology for
classification of habitats based solely on ground-level imagery (photographs),
offering improved validation and the ability to classify habitats at scale (for
example using citizen-science imagery). In collaboration with Natural England,
a public sector organisation responsible for nature conservation in England,
this study develops a classification system that applies deep learning to
ground-level habitat photographs, categorising each image into one of 18
classes defined by the 'Living England' framework. Images were pre-processed
using resizing, normalisation, and augmentation; re-sampling was used to
balance classes in the training data and enhance model robustness. We developed
and fine-tuned a DeepLabV3-ResNet101 classifier to assign a habitat class label
to each photograph. Using five-fold cross-validation, the model demonstrated
strong overall performance across 18 habitat classes, with accuracy and
F1-scores varying between classes. Across all folds, the model achieved a mean
F1-score of 0.61, with visually distinct habitats such as Bare Soil, Silt and
Peat (BSSP) and Bare Sand (BS) reaching values above 0.90, and mixed or
ambiguous classes scoring lower. These findings demonstrate the potential of
this approach for ecological monitoring. Ground-level imagery is readily
obtained, and accurate computational methods for habitat classification based
on such data have many potential applications. To support use by practitioners,
we also provide a simple web application that classifies uploaded images using
our model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An autoregressive framework for interactive multimodal video generation with low latency streaming, integrating audio/pose/text signals into diffusion-based generation via an LLM, aided by a 64x compressed autoencoder and a large dialogue dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome high latency, heavy computation, and limited controllability in interactive digital human video generation by enabling real-time, multimodal control and long-horizon inference.

Method: Extend a standard LLM with multimodal condition encodings (audio, pose, text) to guide a diffusion head's denoising via autoregression; build a ~20k-hour dialogue dataset to train the system; introduce a deep compression autoencoder (up to 64x) to reduce long-horizon inference burden; operate in a streaming, low-latency manner for interactive control.

Result: Demonstrated via experiments on duplex conversation, multilingual human synthesis, and interactive world modeling that the approach achieves low latency, high efficiency, and fine-grained multimodal controllability.

Conclusion: The proposed autoregressive multimodal video generation framework enables real-time interactive control and efficient streaming video generation, with the dataset and compression module playing key roles in scalability.

Abstract: Recently, interactive digital human video generation has attracted widespread
attention and achieved remarkable progress. However, building such a practical
system that can interact with diverse input signals in real time remains
challenging to existing methods, which often struggle with high latency, heavy
computational cost, and limited controllability. In this work, we introduce an
autoregressive video generation framework that enables interactive multimodal
control and low-latency extrapolation in a streaming manner. With minimal
modifications to a standard large language model (LLM), our framework accepts
multimodal condition encodings including audio, pose, and text, and outputs
spatially and semantically coherent representations to guide the denoising
process of a diffusion head. To support this, we construct a large-scale
dialogue dataset of approximately 20,000 hours from multiple sources, providing
rich conversational scenarios for training. We further introduce a deep
compression autoencoder with up to 64$\times$ reduction ratio, which
effectively alleviates the long-horizon inference burden of the autoregressive
model. Extensive experiments on duplex conversation, multilingual human
synthesis, and interactive world model highlight the advantages of our approach
in low latency, high efficiency, and fine-grained multimodal controllability.

### [13] [Deep Data Hiding for ICAO-Compliant Face Images: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19324)
*Jefferson David Rodriguez Chivata,Davide Ghiani,Simone Maurizio La Cava,Marco Micheletto,Giulia Orrù,Federico Lama,Gian Luca Marcialis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A survey proposing digital watermarking and steganography to embed tamper-evident signals in ICAO-compliant facial images, addressing post-capture protection against morphing and deepfakes, alongside a comprehensive analysis of methods, trade-offs, and deployment guidance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICAO-compliant facial images enable global interoperability but are vulnerable to post-capture manipulation (e.g., morphing, deepfakes). Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) covers real-time capture but lacks post-capture protection. There is a need for tamper-evident, persistent verification that preserves ICAO standards.

Method: A comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art digital watermarking and steganography techniques. The authors evaluate potential and drawbacks of these approaches under ICAO-related constraints, develop a taxonomy, and derive deployment guidelines and trade-offs for secure real-world use.

Result: A first-of-its-kind analysis detailing the feasibility, robustness, and interoperability trade-offs of watermarking/steganography for ICAO images. The study provides guidelines for selecting and deploying tamper-evident methods, identifies limitations, and outlines practical recommendations for secure deployment in identity systems.

Conclusion: Digital watermarking and steganography can complement PAD to enable persistent, tamper-evident verification of ICAO-compliant images without compromising standardization. However, significant trade-offs exist (robustness, capacity, perceptual impact, interoperability, and evolving attack vectors). The survey lays groundwork for secure deployment, standardization, and future research.

Abstract: ICAO-compliant facial images, initially designed for secure biometric
passports, are increasingly becoming central to identity verification in a wide
range of application contexts, including border control, digital travel
credentials, and financial services. While their standardization enables global
interoperability, it also facilitates practices such as morphing and deepfakes,
which can be exploited for harmful purposes like identity theft and illegal
sharing of identity documents. Traditional countermeasures like Presentation
Attack Detection (PAD) are limited to real-time capture and offer no
post-capture protection. This survey paper investigates digital watermarking
and steganography as complementary solutions that embed tamper-evident signals
directly into the image, enabling persistent verification without compromising
ICAO compliance. We provide the first comprehensive analysis of
state-of-the-art techniques to evaluate the potential and drawbacks of the
underlying approaches concerning the applications involving ICAO-compliant
images and their suitability under standard constraints. We highlight key
trade-offs, offering guidance for secure deployment in real-world identity
systems.

### [14] [PRISM: A Framework Harnessing Unsupervised Visual Representations and Textual Prompts for Explainable MACE Survival Prediction from Cardiac Cine MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19325)
*Haoyang Su,Jin-Yi Xiang,Shaohao Rui,Yifan Gao,Xingyu Chen,Tingxuan Yin,Xiaosong Wang,Lian-Ming Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM is a self-supervised, multimodal framework that fuses non-contrast cardiac cine MRI features with structured EHRs for MACE survival analysis; uses motion-aware multi-view distillation and medically informed textual prompts; outperforms classical and SOTA baselines across four cohorts; reveals imaging risk signatures and dominant clinical factors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate MACE prediction is crucial in cardiovascular prognosis. Existing models often fail to leverage rich multimodal data and generalize across populations. A self-supervised, prompt-guided approach can exploit unlabeled imaging data, integrate EHRs, and provide interpretable insights.

Method: PRISM learns temporally synchronized imaging features via motion-aware multi-view distillation and modulates them using medically informed textual prompts. It integrates these imaging representations with structured EHR data for survival modeling, and is evaluated across four independent clinical cohorts with internal and external validation.

Result: PRISM consistently outperforms classical survival models and state-of-the-art deep learning baselines across all cohorts. The combined imaging+EHR representations yield meaningful cardiac risk insights, uncovering three imaging signatures (lateral wall dyssynchrony, inferior wall hypersensitivity, anterior elevated focus during diastole) and identifying hypertension, diabetes, and smoking as dominant EHR risk contributors through prompt-guided attribution.

Conclusion: PRISM demonstrates improved predictive performance and interpretability in MACE risk modeling, with strong generalization across cohorts, and shows the value of prompt-guided, self-supervised multimodal learning for clinical survival analysis.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) remains a central
challenge in cardiovascular prognosis. We present PRISM (Prompt-guided
Representation Integration for Survival Modeling), a self-supervised framework
that integrates visual representations from non-contrast cardiac cine magnetic
resonance imaging with structured electronic health records (EHRs) for survival
analysis. PRISM extracts temporally synchronized imaging features through
motion-aware multi-view distillation and modulates them using medically
informed textual prompts to enable fine-grained risk prediction. Across four
independent clinical cohorts, PRISM consistently surpasses classical survival
prediction models and state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning baselines under
internal and external validation. Further clinical findings demonstrate that
the combined imaging and EHR representations derived from PRISM provide
valuable insights into cardiac risk across diverse cohorts. Three distinct
imaging signatures associated with elevated MACE risk are uncovered, including
lateral wall dyssynchrony, inferior wall hypersensitivity, and anterior
elevated focus during diastole. Prompt-guided attribution further identifies
hypertension, diabetes, and smoking as dominant contributors among clinical and
physiological EHR factors.

### [15] [EffNetViTLoRA: An Efficient Hybrid Deep Learning Approach for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19349)
*Mahdieh Behjat Khatooni,Mohsen Soryani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A generalized end-to-end CNN-ViT model (EffNetViTLoRA) trained on the full ADNI T1-weighted MRI data for AD diagnosis, integrating EfficientNet and Vision Transformer with Low-Rank Adaptation to adapt to the target domain, achieving 92.52% accuracy and 92.76% F1 on AD, MCI, CN.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is crucial; MCI is a transitional stage and hard to distinguish from CN and AD. Previous work often trained on limited data, risking biases and poor generalization. A robust, unbiased model trained on the full ADNI dataset could improve clinical reliability and detection across three classes.

Method: An end-to-end model (EffNetViTLoRA) that fuses EfficientNet-like CNN features with a Vision Transformer, trained on the full ADNI T1-weighted MRI dataset. To prevent overfitting and improve transfer from pretrained ViT to the ADNI domain, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is used to fine-tune the ViT component. The system operates on full ADNI data to classify AD, MCI, and CN.

Result: Classification accuracy of 92.52% and an F1-score of 92.76% across three diagnostic classes (AD, MCI, CN) on the full ADNI dataset.

Conclusion: The integrated EffNetViTLoRA approach yields a robust and clinically reliable model for AD staging, benefiting from end-to-end training on the full dataset and efficient domain adaptation via LoRA, with strong discriminative performance across the three target classes.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative
disorders worldwide. As it progresses, it leads to the deterioration of
cognitive functions. Since AD is irreversible, early diagnosis is crucial for
managing its progression. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) represents an
intermediate stage between Cognitively Normal (CN) individuals and those with
AD, and is considered a transitional phase from normal cognition to Alzheimer's
disease. Diagnosing MCI is particularly challenging due to the subtle
differences between adjacent diagnostic categories. In this study, we propose
EffNetViTLoRA, a generalized end-to-end model for AD diagnosis using the whole
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) dataset. Our model integrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture both local and global features from MRI
images. Unlike previous studies that rely on limited subsets of data, our
approach is trained on the full T1-weighted MRI dataset from ADNI, resulting in
a more robust and unbiased model. This comprehensive methodology enhances the
model's clinical reliability. Furthermore, fine-tuning large pretrained models
often yields suboptimal results when source and target dataset domains differ.
To address this, we incorporate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to effectively adapt
the pretrained ViT model to our target domain. This method enables efficient
knowledge transfer and reduces the risk of overfitting. Our model achieves a
classification accuracy of 92.52% and an F1-score of 92.76% across three
diagnostic categories: AD, MCI, and CN for full ADNI dataset.

*Zachary L. Crang,Rich D. Johnston,Katie L. Mills,Johsan Billingham,Sam Robertson,Michael H. Cole,Jonathon Weakley,Adam Hewitt and,Grant M. Duthie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Commercial CV/AI player tracking from broadcast footage can track players with fair precision, but accuracy varies across providers; using tactical feed improves detection; 720p/1080p resolutions are acceptable with proper models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess feasibility and accuracy of off-the-shelf computer-vision/AI tracking on broadcast soccer footage and how feed type and resolution affect performance.

Method: Compare three commercial CV/AI trackers against a high-definition multi-camera system (TRACAB Gen 5) using data from one World Cup match; analyze instantaneous position and speed; compute RMSE and mean bias for position, speed, and total distance; evaluate effect of feed (tactical/programme/camera) and resolution.

Result: Position RMSE 1.68–16.39 m; speed RMSE 0.34–2.38 m/s; total distance bias −1745 m (−21.8%) to 1945 m (24.3%); tactical feed enhances detection; 720p and 1080p resolutions are feasible with appropriate models.

Conclusion: Commercial CV/AI tracking can offer fair-precision player-tracking from broadcast feeds when using appropriate feeds and models; recommendations include using tactical feeds to maximize detection and that common resolutions (720p/1080p) suffice with proper model deployment.

Abstract: This study aimed to: (1) understand whether commercially available
computer-vision and artificial intelligence (AI) player tracking software can
accurately measure player position, speed and distance using broadcast footage
and (2) determine the impact of camera feed and resolution on accuracy. Data
were obtained from one match at the 2022 Qatar Federation Internationale de
Football Association (FIFA) World Cup. Tactical, programme and camera 1 feeds
were used. Three commercial tracking providers that use computer-vision and AI
participated. Providers analysed instantaneous position (x, y coordinates) and
speed (m\,s^{-1}) of each player. Their data were compared with a
high-definition multi-camera tracking system (TRACAB Gen 5). Root mean square
error (RMSE) and mean bias were calculated. Position RMSE ranged from 1.68 to
16.39 m, while speed RMSE ranged from 0.34 to 2.38 m\,s^{-1}. Total match
distance mean bias ranged from -1745 m (-21.8%) to 1945 m (24.3%) across
providers. Computer-vision and AI player tracking software offer the ability to
track players with fair precision when players are detected by the software.
Providers should use a tactical feed when tracking position and speed, which
will maximise player detection, improving accuracy. Both 720p and 1080p
resolutions are suitable, assuming appropriate computer-vision and AI models
are implemented.

### [17] [JVLGS: Joint Vision-Language Gas Leak Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19485)
*Xinlong Zhao,Qixiang Pang,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A joint vision-language framework for gas leak segmentation improves robustness and accuracy, handling frames with no leaks and reducing false positives, and performs well in both supervised and few-shot settings with code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Gas leaks pose severe health and environmental risks, and existing vision-only approaches struggle with blurry, non-rigid gas clouds and frames without leaks. A multimodal (vision-language) approach can leverage textual cues to guide segmentation and reduce false positives.

Method: Proposes Joint Vision-Language Gas leak Segmentation (JVLGS), a multimodal framework that fuses visual and textual information to produce segmentation masks for gas leaks. Includes a post-processing step to suppress noise and non-target objects, addressing the sporadic nature of leaks where many frames contain no leak.

Result: JVLGS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art gas leak segmentation methods across diverse scenarios. It maintains strong performance in both supervised and few-shot settings, whereas competing methods excel in only one setting or perform poorly in both.

Conclusion: JVLGS is effective and robust for gas-leak segmentation, combining vision and language cues to improve accuracy and reduce false positives, with demonstrated benefits in limited-data regimes; code is available at the provided GitHub URL.

Abstract: Gas leaks pose serious threats to human health and contribute significantly
to atmospheric pollution, drawing increasing public concern. However, the lack
of effective detection methods hampers timely and accurate identification of
gas leaks. While some vision-based techniques leverage infrared videos for leak
detection, the blurry and non-rigid nature of gas clouds often limits their
effectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called
Joint Vision-Language Gas leak Segmentation (JVLGS), which integrates the
complementary strengths of visual and textual modalities to enhance gas leak
representation and segmentation. Recognizing that gas leaks are sporadic and
many video frames may contain no leak at all, our method incorporates a
post-processing step to reduce false positives caused by noise and non-target
objects, an issue that affects many existing approaches. Extensive experiments
conducted across diverse scenarios show that JVLGS significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art gas leak segmentation methods. We evaluate our model under
both supervised and few-shot learning settings, and it consistently achieves
strong performance in both, whereas competing methods tend to perform well in
only one setting or poorly in both. Code available at:

### [18] [UNIFORM: Unifying Knowledge from Large-scale and Diverse Pre-trained Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19498)
*Yimu Wang,Weiming Zhuang,Chen Chen,Jiabo Huang,Jingtao Li,Lingjuan Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UNIFORM proposes a scalable, model-agnostic framework to transfer knowledge from a diverse set of pre-trained models to a single student by combining logit- and feature-level consensus; it improves unsupervised object recognition and scales beyond 100 teachers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous off-the-shelf models encode diverse interpretations of the real world. Existing knowledge transfer methods rely on strong assumptions about training data distributions and architectures, which limits applicability and can introduce biases. There is a need to harness collective knowledge without such constraints.

Method: A dedicated voting mechanism that captures consensus at the logit level (across teacher models capable of predicting target classes) and at the feature level (using visual representations learned on arbitrary label spaces). The framework enables knowledge transfer to a student without requiring aligned label spaces or identical architectures, and demonstrates strong scalability.

Result: Extensive experiments show that UNIFORM improves unsupervised object recognition performance over strong knowledge transfer baselines, and scales effectively with large teacher ensembles (over 100 teachers), whereas existing methods saturate at smaller scales.

Conclusion: UNIFORM offers a generalizable and scalable approach to distill collective knowledge from diverse pre-trained models into a single student, enabling improved performance in unsupervised tasks without constraining training data distributions or network architectures.

Abstract: In the era of deep learning, the increasing number of pre-trained models
available online presents a wealth of knowledge. These models, developed with
diverse architectures and trained on varied datasets for different tasks,
provide unique interpretations of the real world. Their collective consensus is
likely universal and generalizable to unseen data. However, effectively
harnessing this collective knowledge poses a fundamental challenge due to the
heterogeneity of pre-trained models. Existing knowledge integration solutions
typically rely on strong assumptions about training data distributions and
network architectures, limiting them to learning only from specific types of
models and resulting in data and/or inductive biases. In this work, we
introduce a novel framework, namely UNIFORM, for knowledge transfer from a
diverse set of off-the-shelf models into one student model without such
constraints. Specifically, we propose a dedicated voting mechanism to capture
the consensus of knowledge both at the logit level -- incorporating teacher
models that are capable of predicting target classes of interest -- and at the
feature level, utilizing visual representations learned on arbitrary label
spaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UNIFORM effectively enhances
unsupervised object recognition performance compared to strong knowledge
transfer baselines. Notably, it exhibits remarkable scalability by benefiting
from over one hundred teachers, while existing methods saturate at a much
smaller scale.

*Xiangxu Wang,Tianhong Zhao,Wei Tu,Bowen Zhang,Guanzhou Chen,Jinzhou Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sat2Flow generates structurally coherent OD flows from satellite imagery using a latent diffusion framework with permutation-aware training to ensure topological invariance under arbitrary regional reindexing, achieving high numerical accuracy without auxiliary data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing OD generation methods rely on costly auxiliary features and are sensitive to spatial topology; there is a need for data-scarce, topology-robust, feature-free OD synthesis.

Method: A multi-kernel encoder captures diverse regional interactions; a permutation-aware diffusion process aligns latent representations across different regional orderings; joint contrastive objective bridges satellite-derived features with OD patterns; equivariant diffusion training enforces structural consistency under region index permutations.

Result: Sat2Flow outperforms both physics-based and data-driven baselines in numerical accuracy while preserving empirical distributions and spatial structures under index permutations, offering a globally scalable solution for OD generation in data-scarce urban environments.

Conclusion: Sat2Flow provides a topologically robust, data-efficient OD flow generation framework that eliminates dependence on region-specific auxiliary data and remains coherent under arbitrary regional reindexing, enabling robust mobility modeling at scale.

Abstract: Origin-Destination (OD) flow matrices are essential for urban mobility
analysis, underpinning applications in traffic forecasting, infrastructure
planning, and policy design. However, existing methods suffer from two critical
limitations: (1) reliance on auxiliary features (e.g., Points of Interest,
socioeconomic statistics) that are costly to collect and have limited spatial
coverage; and (2) sensitivity to spatial topology, where minor index reordering
of urban regions (e.g., census tract relabeling) disrupts structural coherence
in generated flows. To address these challenges, we propose Sat2Flow, a latent
structure-aware diffusion-based framework that generates structurally coherent
OD flows using solely satellite imagery as input. Our approach introduces a
multi-kernel encoder to capture diverse regional interactions and employs a
permutation-aware diffusion process that aligns latent representations across
different regional orderings. Through a joint contrastive training objective
that bridges satellite-derived features with OD patterns, combined with
equivariant diffusion training that enforces structural consistency, Sat2Flow
ensures topological robustness under arbitrary regional reindexing.
Experimental results on real-world urban datasets demonstrate that Sat2Flow
outperforms both physics-based and data-driven baselines in numerical accuracy
while preserving empirical distributions and spatial structures under index
permutations. Sat2Flow offers a globally scalable solution for OD flow
generation in data-scarce urban environments, eliminating region-specific
auxiliary data dependencies while maintaining structural invariance for robust
mobility modeling.

*Alzayat Saleh,Shunsuke Hatano,Mostafa Rahimi Azghadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diagnostic-driven semi-supervised framework for robust weed detection in precision agriculture, addressing shadow artifacts and data scarcity. Begins with strong supervised baselines on a Guinea Grass dataset, identifies a shadow bias, and leverages pseudo-labeling to improve recall, validated in low-data regimes on public benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep learning in real-world agriculture is hindered by variable field conditions and high annotational costs. There is a need for diagnostic tools and semi-supervised strategies that produce robust, high-recall weed detection suitable for automated spraying.

Method: 1) Build supervised baselines (ResNet for classification; YOLO and RF-DETR for detection) on ~975 labeled and ~10,000 unlabeled Guinea Grass images in sugarcane. 2) Use interpretability tools to diagnose biases, notably shadow bias. 3) Develop a semi-supervised pipeline using unlabeled data via pseudo-labeling to augment training and reduce bias, improving robustness and recall. 4) Validate in a low-data regime on a public crop-weed benchmark.

Result: Classification F1 up to 0.90; detection mAP50 > 0.82. Identification of a pervasive shadow bias and demonstration that semi-supervised pseudo-labeling improves robustness and recall. Field-tested framework with applicability to automated spraying systems.

Conclusion: A practical, field-tested framework for diagnosing and improving robust CV systems in precision agriculture. Semi-supervised learning on unlabeled data mitigates error biases (like shadows) and boosts recall, supporting deployment under data constraints.

Abstract: The automated management of invasive weeds is critical for sustainable
agriculture, yet the performance of deep learning models in real-world fields
is often compromised by two factors: challenging environmental conditions and
the high cost of data annotation. This study tackles both issues through a
diagnostic-driven, semi-supervised framework. Using a unique dataset of
approximately 975 labeled and 10,000 unlabeled images of Guinea Grass in
sugarcane, we first establish strong supervised baselines for classification
(ResNet) and detection (YOLO, RF-DETR), achieving F1 scores up to 0.90 and
mAP50 scores exceeding 0.82. Crucially, this foundational analysis, aided by
interpretability tools, uncovered a pervasive "shadow bias," where models
learned to misidentify shadows as vegetation. This diagnostic insight motivated
our primary contribution: a semi-supervised pipeline that leverages unlabeled
data to enhance model robustness. By training models on a more diverse set of
visual information through pseudo-labeling, this framework not only helps
mitigate the shadow bias but also provides a tangible boost in recall, a
critical metric for minimizing weed escapes in automated spraying systems. To
validate our methodology, we demonstrate its effectiveness in a low-data regime
on a public crop-weed benchmark. Our work provides a clear and field-tested
framework for developing, diagnosing, and improving robust computer vision
systems for the complex realities of precision agriculture.

*Zhiting Gao,Dan Song,Diqiong Jiang,Chao Xue,An-An Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes TAPO, a framework aligning subtle motion variations with textual modifiers via iterative grounding; and MotionFLUX, a real-time motion generation method using deterministic rectified flow matching for fast, high-quality results, claimed to outperform SOTA in semantic consistency and motion quality with future code release.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address misalignment between linguistic descriptions and motion semantics and the inefficiency of slow, multi-step diffusion-based generation for animating virtual characters and embodied agents.

Method: TAPO: alignment of motion variations with textual modifiers and iterative adjustments to reinforce semantic grounding. MotionFLUX: deterministic rectified flow matching that constructs optimal transport paths between noise and motion spaces, using linearized probability paths to enable real-time, single-pass or few-step generation without the heavy denoising steps of diffusion models.

Result: Experimental results claim that TAPO+MotionFLUX outperform state-of-the-art in semantic consistency and motion quality while accelerating generation speed. Code and pretrained models will be released.

Conclusion: A unified system combining TAPO and MotionFLUX offers improved semantic alignment and motion quality with real-time generation, representing a significant advance for text-driven motion synthesis and its practical deployment.

Abstract: Motion generation is essential for animating virtual characters and embodied
agents. While recent text-driven methods have made significant strides, they
often struggle with achieving precise alignment between linguistic descriptions
and motion semantics, as well as with the inefficiencies of slow, multi-step
inference. To address these issues, we introduce TMR++ Aligned Preference
Optimization (TAPO), an innovative framework that aligns subtle motion
variations with textual modifiers and incorporates iterative adjustments to
reinforce semantic grounding. To further enable real-time synthesis, we propose
MotionFLUX, a high-speed generation framework based on deterministic rectified
flow matching. Unlike traditional diffusion models, which require hundreds of
denoising steps, MotionFLUX constructs optimal transport paths between noise
distributions and motion spaces, facilitating real-time synthesis. The
linearized probability paths reduce the need for multi-step sampling typical of
sequential methods, significantly accelerating inference time without
sacrificing motion quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, together,
TAPO and MotionFLUX form a unified system that outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches in both semantic consistency and motion quality, while also
accelerating generation speed. The code and pretrained models will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Discrete Diffusion VLA proposes a single-transformer, discretized-action diffusion decoder that is cross-entropy trained and compatible with discrete VLM tokens, enabling adaptive decoding and parallelism while reducing function evaluations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Vision-Language-Action decoders rely on autoregressive decoders or external diffusion heads, hindering a unified, scalable architecture that preserves pretrained VLM priors and supports parallel decoding.

Method: A single-transformer policy that models discretized action chunks via discrete diffusion, trained with the same cross-entropy objective as the VLM backbone; uses adaptive decoding order and secondary remasking for refinement and error correction; preserves discrete token interface for parallel decoding.

Result: Achieves 96.3% avg. SR on LIBERO, 71.2% visual matching on SimplerEnv Fractal, and 49.3% overall on SimplerEnv Bridge, outperforming autoregressive and continuous diffusion baselines.

Conclusion: Discrete-diffusion action decoding preserves pretrained priors, enables robust, scalable VLA with parallel decoding, and lays groundwork for scaling VLA to larger models and datasets.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models adapt large vision-language backbones to
map images and instructions to robot actions. However, prevailing VLA decoders
either generate actions autoregressively in a fixed left-to-right order or
attach continuous diffusion or flow matching heads outside the backbone,
demanding specialized training and iterative sampling that hinder a unified,
scalable architecture. We present Discrete Diffusion VLA, a single-transformer
policy that models discretized action chunks with discrete diffusion and is
trained with the same cross-entropy objective as the VLM backbone. The design
retains diffusion's progressive refinement paradigm while remaining natively
compatible with the discrete token interface of VLMs. Our method achieves an
adaptive decoding order that resolves easy action elements before harder ones
and uses secondary remasking to revisit uncertain predictions across refinement
rounds, which improves consistency and enables robust error correction. This
unified decoder preserves pretrained vision language priors, supports parallel
decoding, breaks the autoregressive bottleneck, and reduces the number of
function evaluations. Discrete Diffusion VLA achieves 96.3% avg. SR on LIBERO,
71.2% visual matching on SimplerEnv Fractal and 49.3% overall on SimplerEnv
Bridge, improving over both autoregressive and continuous diffusion baselines.
These findings indicate that discrete-diffusion action decoder supports precise
action modeling and consistent training, laying groundwork for scaling VLA to
larger models and datasets.

*Nannan Zhu,Yonghao Dong,Teng Wang,Xueqian Li,Shengjun Deng,Yijia Wang,Zheng Hong,Tiantian Geng,Guo Niu,Hanyan Huang,Xiongfei Yao,Shuaiwei Jiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CVBench is a comprehensive cross-video relational reasoning benchmark for multimodal LLMs, with 1,000 QA across three tiers, drawn from five domain-diverse video clusters, evaluating 10+ models under zero-shot or chain-of-thought prompting. It reveals major gaps in cross-video context retention and disambiguation, and provides a framework and code to drive architectural improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the overlooked challenge of cross-video reasoning in multimodal LLMs, which is crucial for real-world tasks like multi-camera surveillance and cross-video procedural learning, and to diagnose bottlenecks beyond single-video benchmarks.

Method: Create CVBench with 1,000 question-answer pairs across three hierarchical tiers (cross-video object association, cross-video event association, cross-video complex reasoning) built from five domain-diverse video clusters. Evaluate 10+ leading MLLMs under zero-shot or chain-of-thought prompting, analyzing accuracy and qualitative failure modes.

Result: Top models (e.g., GPT-4o) reach ~60% accuracy on causal cross-video reasoning, far below human performance (~91%). Key bottlenecks include poor inter-video context retention and difficulty disambiguating overlapping entities. CVBench offers a principled framework to diagnose and guide next-generation MLLMs; data and code are available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: CVBench establishes a rigorous benchmark and diagnostic framework for multi-video reasoning, highlighting architectural gaps and guiding subsequent improvements in cross-video context handling, memory, and reasoning with domain knowledge.

Abstract: While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong performance on
single-video tasks (e.g., video question answering), their ability across
multiple videos remains critically underexplored. However, this capability is
essential for real-world applications, including multi-camera surveillance and
cross-video procedural learning. To bridge this gap, we present CVBench, the
first comprehensive benchmark designed to assess cross-video relational
reasoning rigorously. CVBench comprises 1,000 question-answer pairs spanning
three hierarchical tiers: cross-video object association (identifying shared
entities), cross-video event association (linking temporal or causal event
chains), and cross-video complex reasoning (integrating commonsense and domain
knowledge). Built from five domain-diverse video clusters (e.g., sports, life
records), the benchmark challenges models to synthesise information across
dynamic visual contexts. Extensive evaluation of 10+ leading MLLMs (including
GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-flash, Qwen2.5-VL) under zero-shot or chain-of-thought
prompting paradigms. Key findings reveal stark performance gaps: even top
models, such as GPT-4o, achieve only 60% accuracy on causal reasoning tasks,
compared to the 91% accuracy of human performance. Crucially, our analysis
reveals fundamental bottlenecks inherent in current MLLM architectures, notably
deficient inter-video context retention and poor disambiguation of overlapping
entities. CVBench establishes a rigorous framework for diagnosing and advancing
multi-video reasoning, offering architectural insights for next-generation
MLLMs.The data and evaluation code are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WebEyeTrack brings lightweight gaze estimation models into the browser, using on-device head pose estimation and 9-shot calibration to achieve near-SOTA accuracy with real-time speed, and is open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap between high-performing gaze-estimation models and real-world deployment: large models, slow inference, and privacy concerns; webcam-based methods struggle with head motion. A browser-based solution aims to be fast, private, and user-adaptive.

Method: Integrates lightweight SOTA gaze models directly in the browser, uses model-based head pose estimation, and performs on-device few-shot learning with as few as nine calibration samples to adapt to new users.

Result: Achieves 2.32 cm error on GazeCapture and real-time inference at 2.4 ms on an iPhone 14; open-source code is available at GitHub.

Conclusion: WebEyeTrack demonstrates that browser-based gaze estimation can reach competitive accuracy with fast inference while preserving privacy; the approach is open-source and ready for broader adoption and evaluation.

Abstract: With advancements in AI, new gaze estimation methods are exceeding
state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, but their real-world application reveals a
gap with commercial eye-tracking solutions. Factors like model size, inference
time, and privacy often go unaddressed. Meanwhile, webcam-based eye-tracking
methods lack sufficient accuracy, in particular due to head movement. To tackle
these issues, we introduce We bEyeTrack, a framework that integrates
lightweight SOTA gaze estimation models directly in the browser. It
incorporates model-based head pose estimation and on-device few-shot learning
with as few as nine calibration samples (k < 9). WebEyeTrack adapts to new
users, achieving SOTA performance with an error margin of 2.32 cm on
GazeCapture and real-time inference speeds of 2.4 milliseconds on an iPhone 14.

*Yu-Wei Zhang,Tongju Han,Lipeng Gao,Mingqiang Wei,Hui Liu,Changbao Li,Caiming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoRelief V2 is an end-to-end model that recovers 2.5D relief from a single image, trained with both pseudo-real synthetic data and a small real-world dataset, achieving state-of-the-art depth and normal predictions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to robustly recover 2.5D relief under challenging material and illumination variations and address real-world data scarcity by leveraging pseudo-real images plus a small real dataset to improve robustness, accuracy, and efficiency.

Method: Generate ~15k pseudo real images with a text-to-image model; derive depth pseudo-labels by fusing depth and normal predictions; build a small real-world dataset (800 samples) via multi-view reconstruction and detail refinement; progressively train the model on pseudo-real and real-world data.

Result: Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both depth and normal predictions, with improved robustness, accuracy, and efficiency, and strong potential for downstream applications.

Conclusion: Incorporating real data and progressive training bridges the synthetic-to-real gap and yields superior performance over MonoRelief V1; code is released at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: This paper presents MonoRelief V2, an end-to-end model designed for directly
recovering 2.5D reliefs from single images under complex material and
illumination variations. In contrast to its predecessor, MonoRelief V1 [1],
which was solely trained on synthetic data, MonoRelief V2 incorporates real
data to achieve improved robustness, accuracy and efficiency. To overcome the
challenge of acquiring large-scale real-world dataset, we generate
approximately 15,000 pseudo real images using a text-to-image generative model,
and derive corresponding depth pseudo-labels through fusion of depth and normal
predictions. Furthermore, we construct a small-scale real-world dataset (800
samples) via multi-view reconstruction and detail refinement. MonoRelief V2 is
then progressively trained on the pseudo-real and real-world datasets.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance both in
depth and normal predictions, highlighting its strong potential for a range of
downstream applications. Code is at: https://github.com/glp1001/MonoreliefV2.

### [26] [FlowDet: Overcoming Perspective and Scale Challenges in Real-Time End-to-End Traffic Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19565)
*Yuhang Zhao,Zixing Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowDet is a fast, NMS-free DETR-based detector that uses a Geometric Deformable Unit and Scale-Aware Attention to handle traffic scenes with occlusion and scale variation, achieving state-of-the-art on Intersection-Flow-5k with substantially lower compute and faster runtime.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end detectors eliminate NMS but suffer high computational cost in dense, occluded traffic scenes; there is need for real-time, accurate detectors for intersection scenarios.

Method: Introduce Geometric Deformable Unit (GDU) for traffic-aware geometric modeling; Scale-Aware Attention (SAA) to maintain representation across extreme scale variation; decoupled encoder optimization within DETR; evaluate on Intersection-Flow-5k dataset.

Result: On Intersection-Flow-5k, FlowDet beats RT-DETR in APtest by 1.5% and AP50test by 1.6%, while reducing GFLOPs by 63.2% and increasing inference speed by 16.2%.

Conclusion: FlowDet demonstrates a viable path to efficient, accurate detectors for demanding real-world perception systems; releases Intersection-Flow-5k dataset for rigorous evaluation (link: https://github.com/AstronZh/Intersection-Flow-5K).

Abstract: End-to-end object detectors offer a promising NMS-free paradigm for real-time
applications, yet their high computational cost remains a significant barrier,
particularly for complex scenarios like intersection traffic monitoring. To
address this challenge, we propose FlowDet, a high-speed detector featuring a
decoupled encoder optimization strategy applied to the DETR architecture.
Specifically, FlowDet employs a novel Geometric Deformable Unit (GDU) for
traffic-aware geometric modeling and a Scale-Aware Attention (SAA) module to
maintain high representational power across extreme scale variations. To
rigorously evaluate the model's performance in environments with severe
occlusion and high object density, we collected the Intersection-Flow-5k
dataset, a new challenging scene for this task. Evaluated on
Intersection-Flow-5k, FlowDet establishes a new state-of-the-art. Compared to
the strong RT-DETR baseline, it improves AP(test) by 1.5% and AP50(test) by
1.6%, while simultaneously reducing GFLOPs by 63.2% and increasing inference
speed by 16.2%. Our work demonstrates a new path towards building highly
efficient and accurate detectors for demanding, real-world perception systems.

### [27] [DNP-Guided Contrastive Reconstruction with a Reverse Distillation Transformer for Medical Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19573)
*Luhu Li,Bowen Lin,Mukhtiar Khan,Shujun Fu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified trainable encoder framework with prototype-guided reconstruction and a Diversity-Aware Alignment Loss to prevent prototype collapse, enabling domain-adaptive anomaly detection and improved localization in medical images with enhanced interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image anomaly detection suffers from limited annotations and a domain gap with natural images. Reconstruction methods using frozen encoders struggle to adapt to domain-specific features and localize anomalies accurately. Prototype-based learning offers interpretability but faces prototype collapse, where few prototypes dominate training, hurting diversity and generalization.

Method: Introduce a trainable encoder (with a momentum branch) for stable, domain-adaptive feature learning. Use a lightweight Prototype Extractor to mine informative normal prototypes that guide the decoder via attention for precise reconstruction. Apply a Diversity-Aware Alignment Loss with diversity constraints and per-prototype normalization to prevent collapse and encourage balanced prototype usage.

Result: On multiple medical imaging benchmarks, the proposed method yields significant improvements in representation quality and anomaly localization, outperforming prior methods. Visualizations and prototype-assignment analyses corroborate the anti-collapse mechanism and enhanced interpretability.

Conclusion: The framework effectively addresses domain adaptation and prototype collapse while improving anomaly detection and localization in medical images, offering better interpretability and stable training.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in medical images is challenging due to limited annotations
and a domain gap compared to natural images. Existing reconstruction methods
often rely on frozen pre-trained encoders, which limits adaptation to
domain-specific features and reduces localization accuracy. Prototype-based
learning offers interpretability and clustering benefits but suffers from
prototype collapse, where few prototypes dominate training, harming diversity
and generalization. To address this, we propose a unified framework combining a
trainable encoder with prototype-guided reconstruction and a novel
Diversity-Aware Alignment Loss. The trainable encoder, enhanced by a momentum
branch, enables stable domain-adaptive feature learning. A lightweight
Prototype Extractor mines informative normal prototypes to guide the decoder
via attention for precise reconstruction. Our loss enforces balanced prototype
use through diversity constraints and per-prototype normalization, effectively
preventing collapse. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show
significant improvements in representation quality and anomaly localization,
outperforming prior methods. Visualizations and prototype assignment analyses
further validate the effectiveness of our anti-collapse mechanism and enhanced
interpretability.

### [28] [Multimodal Prototype Alignment for Semi-supervised Pathology Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19574)
*Mingxi Fu,Fanglei Fu,Xitong Ling,Huaitian Yuan,Tian Guan,Yonghong He,Lianghui Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MPAMatch introduces multimodal prototype-guided, pixel-level contrastive learning for pathological image segmentation, leveraging image and text prototypes to supervise unlabeled data and replacing ViT with a pathology-pretrained Uni backbone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pathological image segmentation suffers from ambiguous boundaries and costly pixel annotations; existing semi-supervised methods rely on perturbation-based consistency within a single modality and fail to capture high-level semantic priors in complex pathology images.

Method: A dual contrastive learning framework: (1) image prototype ↔ pixel labels and (2) text prototype ↔ pixel labels; coarse-to-fine supervision; replace ViT with Uni backbone in TransUNet architecture to better extract pathology-relevant features; train and evaluate on GLAS, EBHI-SEG-GLAND, EBHI-SEG-CANCER, KPI.

Result: MPAMatch outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets, demonstrating improvements in both structural and semantic modeling and improved semantic boundary delineation.

Conclusion: Incorporating text prototype supervision and multimodal prototypes within a refined segmentation architecture yields robust pathological segmentation with unlabeled data and better boundary accuracy.

Abstract: Pathological image segmentation faces numerous challenges, particularly due
to ambiguous semantic boundaries and the high cost of pixel-level annotations.
Although recent semi-supervised methods based on consistency regularization
(e.g., UniMatch) have made notable progress, they mainly rely on
perturbation-based consistency within the image modality, making it difficult
to capture high-level semantic priors, especially in structurally complex
pathology images. To address these limitations, we propose MPAMatch - a novel
segmentation framework that performs pixel-level contrastive learning under a
multimodal prototype-guided supervision paradigm. The core innovation of
MPAMatch lies in the dual contrastive learning scheme between image prototypes
and pixel labels, and between text prototypes and pixel labels, providing
supervision at both structural and semantic levels. This coarse-to-fine
supervisory strategy not only enhances the discriminative capability on
unlabeled samples but also introduces the text prototype supervision into
segmentation for the first time, significantly improving semantic boundary
modeling. In addition, we reconstruct the classic segmentation architecture
(TransUNet) by replacing its ViT backbone with a pathology-pretrained
foundation model (Uni), enabling more effective extraction of
pathology-relevant features. Extensive experiments on GLAS, EBHI-SEG-GLAND,
EBHI-SEG-CANCER, and KPI show MPAMatch's superiority over state-of-the-art
methods, validating its dual advantages in structural and semantic modeling.

### [29] [Interact-Custom: Customized Human Object Interaction Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19575)
*Zhu Xu,Zhaowen Wang,Yuxin Peng,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage model Interact-Custom for CHOI that decomposes identity and interaction features, using a foreground interaction mask to guide generation, enabling customizable human-object interactions with optional background/location controls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable compositional customized image generation with fine-grained interaction control, addressing the lack of identity-preserving and interaction-controlled human-object interaction (HOI) generation and dataset limitations for feature decomposition.

Method: Two-stage model Interact-Custom: stage 1 explicitly models spatial configuration by generating a foreground mask depicting the interaction; stage 2 generates the target human object interacting while preserving identity features, guided by the mask. Dataset is processed so each sample has the same human-object pair across different interactive poses. Optional background image and union location can be provided by users for controllability.

Result: Experiments on CHOI-tailored metrics show the method effectively achieves interaction control and identity preservation, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: Interact-Custom offers a controllable CHOI framework with a data-collection/processing strategy for feature decomposition and a two-stage generation pipeline that enables customizable human-object interactions with optional background/position controls.

Abstract: Compositional Customized Image Generation aims to customize multiple target
concepts within generation content, which has gained attention for its wild
application.Existing approaches mainly concentrate on the target entity's
appearance preservation, while neglecting the fine-grained interaction control
among target entities.To enable the model of such interaction control
capability, we focus on human object interaction scenario and propose the task
of Customized Human Object Interaction Image Generation(CHOI), which
simultaneously requires identity preservation for target human object and the
interaction semantic control between them.Two primary challenges exist for
CHOI:(1)simultaneous identity preservation and interaction control demands
require the model to decompose the human object into self-contained identity
features and pose-oriented interaction features, while the current HOI image
datasets fail to provide ideal samples for such feature-decomposed
learning.(2)inappropriate spatial configuration between human and object may
lead to the lack of desired interaction semantics.To tackle it, we first
process a large-scale dataset, where each sample encompasses the same pair of
human object involving different interactive poses.Then we design a two-stage
model Interact-Custom, which firstly explicitly models the spatial
configuration by generating a foreground mask depicting the interaction
behavior, then under the guidance of this mask, we generate the target human
object interacting while preserving their identities features.Furthermore, if
the background image and the union location of where the target human object
should appear are provided by users, Interact-Custom also provides the optional
functionality to specify them, offering high content controllability. Extensive
experiments on our tailored metrics for CHOI task demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach.

### [30] [High-Speed FHD Full-Color Video Computer-Generated Holography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19579)
*Haomiao Zhang,Miao Cao,Xuan Yu,Hui Luo,Yanling Piao,Mengjie Qin,Zhangyuan Li,Ping Wang,Xin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SGDDM and HoloMamba to enable high-speed, high-fidelity full-color holographic video: SGDDM optimizes phase via frequency modulation; HoloMamba is a lightweight Mamba-Unet capturing spatio-temporal correlations to accelerate reconstruction. They achieve FHD (1080p) at over 260 FPS, beating prior Divide-Conquer-and-Merge methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two main challenges hinder high-quality, high-speed CGH video: (i) learning-based phase models tend to be over-smoothed with narrow angular spectra, causing color crosstalk in high-frame-rate full-color CGH; (ii) frame-by-frame optimization ignores temporal/spatial correlations across frames, leading to inefficient computation.

Method: (1) Spectrum-Guided Depth Division Multiplexing (SGDDM): optimize phase distributions via frequency modulation to improve color fidelity and maintain high frame rates. (2) HoloMamba: a lightweight asymmetric Mamba-Unet that explicitly models spatial-temporal correlations across video sequences to enhance reconstruction quality and computational efficiency.

Result: Extensive simulated and real-world experiments show SGDDM achieves high-fidelity full-color display without sacrificing frame rate. HoloMamba delivers 1080p full-color holographic video at >260 FPS, more than 2.6× faster than the prior Divide-Conquer-and-Merge strategy.

Conclusion: The combination of SGDDM and HoloMamba provides a practical solution for high-speed, high-quality full-color CGH video, addressing both color fidelity and computational efficiency by joint phase design and temporal-spatial modeling.

Abstract: Computer-generated holography (CGH) is a promising technology for
next-generation displays. However, generating high-speed, high-quality
holographic video requires both high frame rate display and efficient
computation, but is constrained by two key limitations: ($i$) Learning-based
models often produce over-smoothed phases with narrow angular spectra, causing
severe color crosstalk in high frame rate full-color displays such as
depth-division multiplexing and thus resulting in a trade-off between frame
rate and color fidelity. ($ii$) Existing frame-by-frame optimization methods
typically optimize frames independently, neglecting spatial-temporal
correlations between consecutive frames and leading to computationally
inefficient solutions. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose
a novel high-speed full-color video CGH generation scheme. First, we introduce
Spectrum-Guided Depth Division Multiplexing (SGDDM), which optimizes phase
distributions via frequency modulation, enabling high-fidelity full-color
display at high frame rates. Second, we present HoloMamba, a lightweight
asymmetric Mamba-Unet architecture that explicitly models spatial-temporal
correlations across video sequences to enhance reconstruction quality and
computational efficiency. Extensive simulated and real-world experiments
demonstrate that SGDDM achieves high-fidelity full-color display without
compromise in frame rate, while HoloMamba generates FHD (1080p) full-color
holographic video at over 260 FPS, more than 2.6$\times$ faster than the prior
state-of-the-art Divide-Conquer-and-Merge Strategy.

### [31] [Guiding Noisy Label Conditional Diffusion Models with Score-based Discriminator Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19581)
*Dat Nguyen Cong,Hieu Tran Bao,Hoang Thanh-Tung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SBDC provides a light-touch, discriminative guidance signal to align noisy pre-trained conditional diffusion models, using an adversarially trained discriminator mainly in the early generation steps, achieving improved quality and controllability without retraining and with minimal inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large diffusion-model datasets often contain labeling mistakes that degrade the alignment between conditional prompts and generated outputs. The paper seeks a practical, training-free (or retraining-light) method to compensate for noisy labels and improve generative controllability.

Method: Train a discriminator with an adversarial loss to judge the authenticity of diffusion samples and use this signal to guide sampling from a pre-trained conditional diffusion model. The approach leverages prior noise detection techniques to evaluate sample authenticity and deliberately restricts the guidance to the early phases of generation for better performance, avoiding retraining of the diffusion model.

Result: Empirical results show SBDC outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods under various noise settings, with only marginal increases in inference time and without requiring retraining of diffusion models.

Conclusion: SBDC offers an efficient and scalable way to align noisy pre-trained diffusion models, improving generation quality and controllability under label noise while keeping computational costs low.

Abstract: Diffusion models have gained prominence as state-of-the-art techniques for
synthesizing images and videos, particularly due to their ability to scale
effectively with large datasets. Recent studies have uncovered that these
extensive datasets often contain mistakes from manual labeling processes.
However, the extent to which such errors compromise the generative capabilities
and controllability of diffusion models is not well studied. This paper
introduces Score-based Discriminator Correction (SBDC), a guidance technique
for aligning noisy pre-trained conditional diffusion models. The guidance is
built on discriminator training using adversarial loss, drawing on prior noise
detection techniques to assess the authenticity of each sample. We further show
that limiting the usage of our guidance to the early phase of the generation
process leads to better performance. Our method is computationally efficient,
only marginally increases inference time, and does not require retraining
diffusion models. Experiments on different noise settings demonstrate the
superiority of our method over previous state-of-the-art methods.

*Abhinav Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Thesis on generalizing monocular 3D object detection (Mono3D) across occlusions, datasets, object scales, and camera parameters, introducing GrooMeD-NMS, DEVIANT backbones, SeaBird BEV segmentation with dice loss, and extrapolation analysis to unseen camera heights to boost cross-domain robustness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mono3D models struggle to generalize to occlusions, dataset shifts, larger objects, and different camera setups; robust 3D understanding is critical for autonomous driving, AR, and robotics.

Method: Proposes four contributions: (1) GrooMeD-NMS, a differentiable NMS; (2) DEVIANT depth-equivariant backbones for cross-dataset generalization; (3) SeaBird segmentation-based BEV approach using dice loss to mitigate large-object noise sensitivity; (4) mathematical analysis and methods for extrapolating Mono3D to unseen camera heights to improve out-of-distribution generalization.

Result: Abstract does not provide quantitative results; claims of improved occlusion robustness, cross-dataset generalization, handling of large-object detection, and better extrapolation to unseen camera heights are asserted but not quantified in the abstract.

Conclusion: The work presents a cohesive framework combining algorithmic innovations and theoretical analysis to advance Mono3D generalization across occlusion, data shifts, object scales, and camera configurations.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection (Mono3D) is a fundamental computer vision task
that estimates an object's class, 3D position, dimensions, and orientation from
a single image. Its applications, including autonomous driving, augmented
reality, and robotics, critically rely on accurate 3D environmental
understanding. This thesis addresses the challenge of generalizing Mono3D
models to diverse scenarios, including occlusions, datasets, object sizes, and
camera parameters. To enhance occlusion robustness, we propose a mathematically
differentiable NMS (GrooMeD-NMS). To improve generalization to new datasets, we
explore depth equivariant (DEVIANT) backbones. We address the issue of large
object detection, demonstrating that it's not solely a data imbalance or
receptive field problem but also a noise sensitivity issue. To mitigate this,
we introduce a segmentation-based approach in bird's-eye view with dice loss
(SeaBird). Finally, we mathematically analyze the extrapolation of Mono3D
models to unseen camera heights and improve Mono3D generalization in such
out-of-distribution settings.

### [33] [Quantization Robustness to Input Degradations for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19600)
*Toghrul Karimov,Hassan Imani,Allan Kazakov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Post-training quantization (PTQ) robustness of YOLO across FP32, FP16, Dynamic UINT8, and Static INT8 is studied. A degradation-aware calibration for Static INT8 in TensorRT is evaluated but largely yields no broad robustness gains; larger models show some sensitivity to noise. Static INT8 provides substantial speedups with modest accuracy loss on clean data, informing deployment decisions in uncontrolled environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient object detectors like YOLO require quantization to run on resource-constrained devices. Quantization can degrade robustness to real-world input degradations (noise, blur, compression). This study empirically assesses how PTQ across formats affects robustness and whether a calibration strategy that uses degraded inputs can improve it.

Method: Evaluate YOLO models from nano to extra-large across FP32, FP16 (TensorRT), Dynamic UINT8 (ONNX), and Static INT8 (TensorRT). Introduce degradation-aware calibration by exposing TensorRT's INT8 calibration to a mix of clean and synthetically degraded images. Benchmark on COCO under seven degradation conditions (noise, blur, low contrast, JPEG compression, etc.) plus a mixed-degradation scenario. Report performance (mAP50-95) and speedups (inferencing) for each configuration.

Result: Static INT8 TensorRT yields 1.5–3.3× speedups with a moderate clean-data accuracy drop of ~3–7% mAP50-95. Degradation-aware calibration did not produce consistent, broad robustness improvements over standard clean-data calibration across most models and degradations. Some improvement was observed for larger models under specific noise conditions, suggesting model capacity modulates calibration efficacy.

Conclusion: PTQ robustness remains challenging for practical deployment in uncontrolled environments. The study provides insights for choosing quantization configurations and emphasizes the limited utility of degradation-aware calibration in most cases, while highlighting a potential role of model capacity. Code and evaluation tables are available at the project repository.

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) is crucial for deploying efficient object
detection models, like YOLO, on resource-constrained devices. However, the
impact of reduced precision on model robustness to real-world input
degradations such as noise, blur, and compression artifacts is a significant
concern. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study evaluating the
robustness of YOLO models (nano to extra-large scales) across multiple
precision formats: FP32, FP16 (TensorRT), Dynamic UINT8 (ONNX), and Static INT8
(TensorRT). We introduce and evaluate a degradation-aware calibration strategy
for Static INT8 PTQ, where the TensorRT calibration process is exposed to a mix
of clean and synthetically degraded images. Models were benchmarked on the COCO
dataset under seven distinct degradation conditions (including various types
and levels of noise, blur, low contrast, and JPEG compression) and a
mixed-degradation scenario. Results indicate that while Static INT8 TensorRT
engines offer substantial speedups (~1.5-3.3x) with a moderate accuracy drop
(~3-7% mAP50-95) on clean data, the proposed degradation-aware calibration did
not yield consistent, broad improvements in robustness over standard clean-data
calibration across most models and degradations. A notable exception was
observed for larger model scales under specific noise conditions, suggesting
model capacity may influence the efficacy of this calibration approach. These
findings highlight the challenges in enhancing PTQ robustness and provide
insights for deploying quantized detectors in uncontrolled environments. All

### [34] [IELDG: Suppressing Domain-Specific Noise with Inverse Evolution Layers for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19604)
*Qizhe Fan,Chaoyu Liu,Zhonghua Qiao,Xiaoqin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IEL-based diffusion augmentation and a DGSS model with inverse evolution layers improve cross-domain semantic segmentation by suppressing diffusion artifacts and enhancing multi-scale semantic consistency, achieving superior generalization on benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-generated synthetic data often contains structural or semantic defects due to imperfect training, which can degrade segmentation performance and cause error accumulation when used for domain generalization.

Method: Introduce inverse evolution layers (IELs) with Laplacian-based priors to highlight spatial discontinuities and semantic inconsistencies. Use IELs to filter the generative process (IELDM) for higher-quality images. Embed IELs into the decoder of a DGSS model to form IELFormer, which includes a multi-scale frequency fusion (MFF) module to achieve cross-scale semantic coherence via frequency-domain analysis.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior generalization performance of the proposed approach compared to existing methods on benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: IELs improve both data quality and model robustness: they filter out undesirable generative patterns during data augmentation and suppress artifact propagation within the segmentation model, leading to stronger cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) focuses on training a model
using labeled data from a source domain, with the goal of achieving robust
generalization to unseen target domains during inference. A common approach to
improve generalization is to augment the source domain with synthetic data
generated by diffusion models (DMs). However, the generated images often
contain structural or semantic defects due to training imperfections. Training
segmentation models with such flawed data can lead to performance degradation
and error accumulation. To address this issue, we propose to integrate inverse
evolution layers (IELs) into the generative process. IELs are designed to
highlight spatial discontinuities and semantic inconsistencies using
Laplacian-based priors, enabling more effective filtering of undesirable
generative patterns. Based on this mechanism, we introduce IELDM, an enhanced
diffusion-based data augmentation framework that can produce higher-quality
images. Furthermore, we observe that the defect-suppression capability of IELs
can also benefit the segmentation network by suppressing artifact propagation.
Based on this insight, we embed IELs into the decoder of the DGSS model and
propose IELFormer to strengthen generalization capability in cross-domain
scenarios. To further strengthen the model's semantic consistency across
scales, IELFormer incorporates a multi-scale frequency fusion (MFF) module,
which performs frequency-domain analysis to achieve structured integration of
multi-resolution features, thereby improving cross-scale coherence. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior generalization performance compared to existing methods.

*Jiajun Sun,Zhen Yu,Siyuan Yan,Jason J. Ong,Zongyuan Ge,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes LF-VAR for controllable skin image synthesis using lesion measurements and type labels; uses a multiscale lesion-focused VQVAE and a Visual AutoRegressive Transformer; achieves state-of-the-art FID ~0.74 and supports language-prompted control; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scarcity of real-world clinical skin images and lack of control in synthesis; need high-fidelity, lesion-specific generation to aid training of deep learning models.

Method: Train a multiscale lesion-focused VQVAE to encode images into discrete tokens; train a Visual AutoRegressive Transformer on token sequences; condition generation on lesion measurements and lesion type labels; supports language prompts for lesion control.

Result: Achieves average FID 0.74 across seven lesion types, 6.3% improvement over prior SOTA; high-fidelity, clinically relevant synthetic skin images; code at GitHub.

Conclusion: Demonstrates controllable, clinically meaningful skin synthesis; potential for data augmentation in dermatology; future work may extend to broader lesion types and clinical evaluations.

Abstract: Skin images from real-world clinical practice are often limited, resulting in
a shortage of training data for deep-learning models. While many studies have
explored skin image synthesis, existing methods often generate low-quality
images and lack control over the lesion's location and type. To address these
limitations, we present LF-VAR, a model leveraging quantified lesion
measurement scores and lesion type labels to guide the clinically relevant and
controllable synthesis of skin images. It enables controlled skin synthesis
with specific lesion characteristics based on language prompts. We train a
multiscale lesion-focused Vector Quantised Variational Auto-Encoder (VQVAE) to
encode images into discrete latent representations for structured tokenization.
Then, a Visual AutoRegressive (VAR) Transformer trained on tokenized
representations facilitates image synthesis. Lesion measurement from the lesion
region and types as conditional embeddings are integrated to enhance synthesis
fidelity. Our method achieves the best overall FID score (average 0.74) among
seven lesion types, improving upon the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) by
6.3%. The study highlights our controllable skin synthesis model's
effectiveness in generating high-fidelity, clinically relevant synthetic skin
images. Our framework code is available at

TL;DR: DQRoute is a modular long-tailed recognition framework that combines difficulty-aware optimization with a decentralized mixture-of-experts routing, achieving improved accuracy on rare and hard classes by jointly training difficulty estimation, adaptive loss weighting, multi-expert specialization, and input-adaptive routing via expert-specific OOD detectors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance gap in long-tailed recognition arises from both data imbalance and varying intrinsic difficulty of classes; reweighting by frequency fails to address hard-to-learn classes. A model should estimate per-class difficulty and route inputs to experts accordingly.

Method: Proposes DQRoute: (1) estimate class-wise difficulty from prediction uncertainty and history; (2) use that to weight losses adaptively; (3) employ a mixture-of-experts where each expert specializes in a region of the class distribution; (4) at inference, weight expert outputs by confidence from expert-specific OOD detectors; (5) train all components end-to-end.

Result: On standard long-tailed benchmarks, significant improvements, especially for rare/difficult classes; demonstrates benefit of difficulty modeling plus decentralized routing.

Conclusion: Integrating difficulty-aware optimization with decentralized expert routing yields robust long-tailed recognition and better performance on challenging categories.

Abstract: Long-tailed visual recognition is challenging not only due to class imbalance
but also because of varying classification difficulty across categories. Simply
reweighting classes by frequency often overlooks those that are intrinsically
hard to learn. To address this, we propose \textbf{DQRoute}, a modular
framework that combines difficulty-aware optimization with dynamic expert
collaboration. DQRoute first estimates class-wise difficulty based on
prediction uncertainty and historical performance, and uses this signal to
guide training with adaptive loss weighting. On the architectural side, DQRoute
employs a mixture-of-experts design, where each expert specializes in a
different region of the class distribution. At inference time, expert
predictions are weighted by confidence scores derived from expert-specific OOD
detectors, enabling input-adaptive routing without the need for a centralized
router. All components are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Experiments
on standard long-tailed benchmarks demonstrate that DQRoute significantly
improves performance, particularly on rare and difficult classes, highlighting
the benefit of integrating difficulty modeling with decentralized expert
routing.

### [37] [Beyond BEV: Optimizing Point-Level Tokens for Collaborative Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19638)
*Yang Li,Quan Yuan,Guiyang Luo,Xiaoyuan Fu,Rui Pan,Yujia Yang,Congzhang Shao,Yuewen Liu,Jinglin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPLOT introduces point-level tokens for collaborative perception, employing semantic-aware token reordering, a frequency-enhanced state-space model, and neighbor-to-ego alignment to preserve 3D cues with lower communication/computation than BEV-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BEV representations discard crucial fine-grained 3D cues; point-cloud data are unordered, massive, and position-sensitive, making compact, aligned token sequences challenging yet necessary for effective multi-agent perception.

Method: CoPLOT uses Point-Level Optimized Tokens with a point-native pipeline: semantic-aware token reordering that adapts by scene/token semantics; a frequency-enhanced state-space model to capture long-range dependencies across spatial and spectral domains; and a neighbor-to-ego alignment module that closes the loop via global agent-level correction and local token-level refinement.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art models on simulated and real-world datasets while reducing communication and computation overhead; code will be released at the provided repository.

Conclusion: Point-level, optimized tokens enable richer 3D-aware collaboration in perception with improved efficiency and accuracy, establishing a new direction beyond traditional BEV-based fusion for cooperative perception.

Abstract: Collaborative perception allows agents to enhance their perceptual
capabilities by exchanging intermediate features. Existing methods typically
organize these intermediate features as 2D bird's-eye-view (BEV)
representations, which discard critical fine-grained 3D structural cues
essential for accurate object recognition and localization. To this end, we
first introduce point-level tokens as intermediate representations for
collaborative perception. However, point-cloud data are inherently unordered,
massive, and position-sensitive, making it challenging to produce compact and
aligned point-level token sequences that preserve detailed structural
information. Therefore, we present CoPLOT, a novel Collaborative perception
framework that utilizes Point-Level Optimized Tokens. It incorporates a
point-native processing pipeline, including token reordering, sequence
modeling, and multi-agent spatial alignment. A semantic-aware token reordering
module generates adaptive 1D reorderings by leveraging scene-level and
token-level semantic information. A frequency-enhanced state space model
captures long-range sequence dependencies across both spatial and spectral
domains, improving the differentiation between foreground tokens and background
clutter. Lastly, a neighbor-to-ego alignment module applies a closed-loop
process, combining global agent-level correction with local token-level
refinement to mitigate localization noise. Extensive experiments on both
simulated and real-world datasets show that CoPLOT outperforms state-of-the-art
models, with even lower communication and computation overhead. Code will be
available at https://github.com/CheeryLeeyy/CoPLOT.

*Bikash Kumar Badatya,Vipul Baghel,Ravi Hegde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised, skeleton-based action localization using an Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph ConvNet (ASTGCN) trained on pose-denoising; uses Action Dynamics Metric (ADM) to detect boundaries. Delivers real-time, competitive performance on diving data and good zero-shot generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address fine-grained action localization in untrimmed sports videos without heavy labeling or high-capacity models, enabling lightweight, real-time analysis in real-world settings.

Method: Pre-train an Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ASTGCN) on a pose-sequence denoising task with blockwise partitions. At inference, compute the Action Dynamics Metric (ADM) from low-dimensional ASTGCN embeddings and detect motion boundaries via inflection points in its curvature profile.

Result: Achieves mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.66% and average localization latency of 29.09 ms on the DSV Diving dataset, matching supervised state-of-the-art performance while remaining efficient; generalizes robustly to unseen, in-the-wild diving footage without retraining.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that unsupervised, skeleton-based localization with ADM can be both highly accurate and hardware-friendly, supporting real-time action analysis in embedded or dynamic environments and offering strong zero-shot generalization.

Abstract: Fine-grained action localization in untrimmed sports videos presents a
significant challenge due to rapid and subtle motion transitions over short
durations. Existing supervised and weakly supervised solutions often rely on
extensive annotated datasets and high-capacity models, making them
computationally intensive and less adaptable to real-world scenarios. In this
work, we introduce a lightweight and unsupervised skeleton-based action
localization pipeline that leverages spatio-temporal graph neural
representations. Our approach pre-trains an Attention-based Spatio-Temporal
Graph Convolutional Network (ASTGCN) on a pose-sequence denoising task with
blockwise partitions, enabling it to learn intrinsic motion dynamics without
any manual labeling. At inference, we define a novel Action Dynamics Metric
(ADM), computed directly from low-dimensional ASTGCN embeddings, which detects
motion boundaries by identifying inflection points in its curvature profile.
Our method achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.66% and average
localization latency of 29.09 ms on the DSV Diving dataset, matching
state-of-the-art supervised performance while maintaining computational
efficiency. Furthermore, it generalizes robustly to unseen, in-the-wild diving
footage without retraining, demonstrating its practical applicability for
lightweight, real-time action analysis systems in embedded or dynamic
environments.

*Dongjin Kim,Jaekyun Ko,Muhammad Kashif Ali,Tae Hyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A tiny image denoiser uses dynamically generated, pixel-wise kernels predicted from multi-branch features and applied iteratively. It aims to generalize to unseen noise while maintaining efficiency (~0.04M params).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep denoising methods overfit to training noise distributions and demand large data and compute, limiting generalization and practicality. A lightweight, adaptive approach could improve robustness to diverse noise types while reducing computational cost.

Method: A four-branch architecture: Feature Extraction Module for robust noise-invariant features; Global Statistics Module; Local Correlation Module; Kernel Prediction Module that outputs per-pixel kernels used iteratively for denoising. The model predicts local, structure-adaptive kernels and applies them repeatedly for refinement. Trained on single-level Gaussian noise with a compact parameter count (~0.04M).

Result: Claims superior restoration quality and efficiency, with resilience to unseen noise types/levels, indicating effective generalization despite training on a single noise level.

Conclusion: Iterative dynamic filtering via pixel-wise predictive kernels is a promising, resource-efficient approach for practical denoising, offering robust performance across diverse noise while maintaining a tiny footprint.

Abstract: Image denoising is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with
applications in photography and medical imaging. While deep learning-based
methods have shown remarkable success, their reliance on specific noise
distributions limits generalization to unseen noise types and levels. Existing
approaches attempt to address this with extensive training data and high
computational resources but they still suffer from overfitting. To address
these issues, we conduct image denoising by utilizing dynamically generated
kernels via efficient operations. This approach helps prevent overfitting and
improves resilience to unseen noise. Specifically, our method leverages a
Feature Extraction Module for robust noise-invariant features, Global
Statistics and Local Correlation Modules to capture comprehensive noise
characteristics and structural correlations. The Kernel Prediction Module then
employs these cues to produce pixel-wise varying kernels adapted to local
structures, which are then applied iteratively for denoising. This ensures both
efficiency and superior restoration quality. Despite being trained on
single-level Gaussian noise, our compact model (~ 0.04 M) excels across diverse
noise types and levels, demonstrating the promise of iterative dynamic
filtering for practical image denoising.

*Hou Xia,Zheren Fu,Fangcan Ling,Jiajun Li,Yi Tu,Zhendong Mao,Yongdong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-LevelGauge introduces a dedicated benchmark to quantify positional bias in large video-language models. It uses standardized probes and controllable context setups across 438 curated videos (1,177 MCQs; 120 open-ended questions) to reveal how LVLMs rely on context position and neighboring content. Evaluated on 27 LVLMs, results show notable bias in many open-source models, with head/neighbor-content preferences, while commercial models like Gemini2.5-Pro maintain consistent, sequence-wide performance. The study also analyzes context length, variation, and model scale to guide bias mitigation and model improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVLM evaluation benchmarks largely measure overall performance on whole video sequences and neglect contextual positional bias, a critical and understudied behavior that can impact real-world reliability. There is a need for a systematic, controllable probe suite to diagnose and quantify positional bias across diverse contexts.

Method: The authors design Video-LevelGauge with standardized probes and customizable contextual setups to flexibly control context length, probe position, and contextual types. They curate 438 videos spanning multiple types, producing 1,177 high-quality MCQs and 120 open-ended questions validated for exposing positional bias. They introduce a combined analysis pipeline using statistical measures and morphological pattern recognition to characterize bias and apply it to 27 LVLMs (commercial and open-source).

Result: Significant positional biases are found in many leading open-source LVLMs, typically showing head or neighbor-content preferences. Commercial models (e.g., Gemini2.5-Pro) exhibit robust, consistent performance across entire video sequences. Additional analyses reveal how context length, context variation, and model scale affect bias and suggest directions for mitigation.

Conclusion: Video-LevelGauge provides a rigorous framework to assess and understand positional bias in LVLMs, offering actionable insights for debiasing and improving model design. The benchmark can guide evaluation standards and inform model development toward more consistent, contextually robust video understanding.

Abstract: Large video language models (LVLMs) have made notable progress in video
understanding, spurring the development of corresponding evaluation benchmarks.
However, existing benchmarks generally assess overall performance across entire
video sequences, overlooking nuanced behaviors such as contextual positional
bias, a critical yet under-explored aspect of LVLM performance. We present
Video-LevelGauge, a dedicated benchmark designed to systematically assess
positional bias in LVLMs. We employ standardized probes and customized
contextual setups, allowing flexible control over context length, probe
position, and contextual types to simulate diverse real-world scenarios. In
addition, we introduce a comprehensive analysis method that combines
statistical measures with morphological pattern recognition to characterize
bias. Our benchmark comprises 438 manually curated videos spanning multiple
types, yielding 1,177 high-quality multiple-choice questions and 120 open-ended
questions, validated for their effectiveness in exposing positional bias. Based
on these, we evaluate 27 state-of-the-art LVLMs, including both commercial and
open-source models. Our findings reveal significant positional biases in many
leading open-source models, typically exhibiting head or neighbor-content
preferences. In contrast, commercial models such as Gemini2.5-Pro show
impressive, consistent performance across entire video sequences. Further
analyses on context length, context variation, and model scale provide
actionable insights for mitigating bias and guiding model enhancement.

*Bálint Mészáros,Ahmet Firintepe,Sebastian Schmidt,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Object Detection and Localization (ODAL) framework for interior car scenes splits computation between on-board and cloud, enabling detection/localization with resource constraints. Introduces ODALbench for benchmarking. Fine-tuned ODAL-LLaVA (7B) achieves 89% ODAL_score (71% above baseline) and outperforms GPT-4o by ~20%, with ODAL_SNR three times higher, while maintaining detection accuracy and reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limited computational resources of in-car hardware that hinder running large vision foundation models, by distributing inference between onboard systems and cloud, and by introducing a specialized benchmark (ODALbench) for interior scene understanding.

Method: Propose ODAL framework with distributed on-board/cloud architecture; develop ODALbench metric; compare state-of-the-art GPT-4o vision and lightweight LLaVA 1.5 7B; fine-tune the lightweight model to improve ODAL performance; evaluate detection accuracy and hallucination reduction.

Result: ODAL-LLaVA attains an ODAL_score of 89%, a 71% improvement over its baseline, and outperforms GPT-4o by ~20%; high detection accuracy with substantially reduced hallucinations; ODAL_SNR is three times higher than GPT-4o.

Conclusion: The ODAL framework shows promise for interior scene understanding under strict compute constraints and may set new benchmarking standards in this domain; fine-tuning lightweight models can rival large foundation models in this task while improving reliability.

Abstract: AI tasks in the car interior like identifying and localizing externally
introduced objects is crucial for response quality of personal assistants.
However, computational resources of on-board systems remain highly constrained,
restricting the deployment of such solutions directly within the vehicle. To
address this limitation, we propose the novel Object Detection and Localization
(ODAL) framework for interior scene understanding. Our approach leverages
vision foundation models through a distributed architecture, splitting
computational tasks between on-board and cloud. This design overcomes the
resource constraints of running foundation models directly in the car. To
benchmark model performance, we introduce ODALbench, a new metric for
comprehensive assessment of detection and localization.Our analysis
demonstrates the framework's potential to establish new standards in this
domain. We compare the state-of-the-art GPT-4o vision foundation model with the
lightweight LLaVA 1.5 7B model and explore how fine-tuning enhances the
lightweight models performance. Remarkably, our fine-tuned ODAL-LLaVA model
achieves an ODAL$_{score}$ of 89%, representing a 71% improvement over its
baseline performance and outperforming GPT-4o by nearly 20%. Furthermore, the
fine-tuned model maintains high detection accuracy while significantly reducing
hallucinations, achieving an ODAL$_{SNR}$ three times higher than GPT-4o.

### [42] [Self-Rewarding Vision-Language Model via Reasoning Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19652)
*Zongxia Li,Wenhao Yu,Chengsong Huang,Rui Liu,Zhenwen Liang,Fuxiao Liu,Jingxi Che,Dian Yu,Jordan Boyd-Graber,Haitao Mi,Dong Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-SR1 introduces a self-reward RL framework for vision-language models that decomposes reasoning into visual perception and language reasoning. The model first creates self-contained visual perceptions, then re-prompts to reason using only those perceptions to generate a reward, which is combined with final-output supervision to improve visual reasoning and reduce hallucinations without external visual supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address visual hallucinations and language shortcuts in vision-language models caused by reliance on text priors and sparse intermediate supervision. Aims to avoid costly human annotations and the risk of reward hacking from external signals by enabling self-guided improvement.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) prompt the model to generate self-contained visual perceptions sufficient to answer the question without referencing the input image; (2) re-prompt the model to perform language reasoning using only the generated perception to compute a self-generated reward; (3) combine this self-reward with supervision on final outputs to train the model.

Result: Claimed improvements in visual reasoning, reductions in visual hallucinations, and decreased reliance on language shortcuts across diverse vision-language tasks.

Conclusion: Vision-SR1 provides a self-reinforcing training signal that aligns visual perception and language reasoning without external supervision, potentially improving robustness of VLMs. Further studies could explore prompt quality, reward design, and evaluation across more tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from visual hallucinations, saying
things that are not actually in the image, and language shortcuts, where they
skip the visual part and just rely on text priors. These issues arise because
most post-training methods for VLMs rely on simple verifiable answer matching
and supervise only final outputs, leaving intermediate visual reasoning without
explicit guidance. As a result, VLMs receive sparse visual signals and often
learn to prioritize language-based reasoning over visual perception. To
mitigate this, some existing methods add visual supervision using human
annotations or distilled labels from external large models. However, human
annotations are labor-intensive and costly, and because external signals cannot
adapt to the evolving policy, they cause distributional shifts that can lead to
reward hacking. In this paper, we introduce Vision-SR1, a self-rewarding method
that improves visual reasoning without relying on external visual supervisions
via reinforcement learning. Vision-SR1 decomposes VLM reasoning into two
stages: visual perception and language reasoning. The model is first prompted
to produce self-contained visual perceptions that are sufficient to answer the
question without referring back the input image. To validate this
self-containment, the same VLM model is then re-prompted to perform language
reasoning using only the generated perception as input to compute reward. This
self-reward is combined with supervision on final outputs, providing a balanced
training signal that strengthens both visual perception and language reasoning.
Our experiments demonstrate that Vision-SR1 improves visual reasoning,
mitigates visual hallucinations, and reduces reliance on language shortcuts
across diverse vision-language tasks.

### [43] [Hardware-aware vs. Hardware-agnostic Energy Estimation for SNN in Space Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19654)
*Matthias Höfflin,Jürgen Wassner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SNNs can match CNN performance on a 3-D satellite position regression task, but energy savings depend on hardware and data sparsity; hardware-agnostic estimates overstate savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate and compare energy efficiency of SNNs versus CNNs in a space-domain regression task, and resolve conflicting energy estimates by separating hardware-agnostic and hardware-aware analyses; examine how data characteristics (e.g., dark pixel ratio) affect energy.

Method: Train an SNN using the membrane potential of the LIF neuron in the final layer on a photorealistic satellite image dataset to estimate 3-D positions; compare against a CNN baseline on MSE; perform two energy analyses (hardware-agnostic and hardware-aware); analyze impact of input sparsity (dark pixels) on energy consumption.

Result: SNN achieves comparable MSE to CNN on the task (3-D position estimation); hardware-agnostic analysis predicts a 50-60% energy advantage for SNNs over CNNs; hardware-aware analysis reveals substantial energy savings only on neuromorphic hardware when input sparsity is high; the dark pixel ratio significantly influences energy consumption; data characteristics and hardware assumptions critically shape energy outcomes.

Conclusion: Transparent and explicit disclosure of evaluation assumptions is essential for fair energy-efficiency comparisons between SNNs and CNNs. Energy benefits of SNNs are not universal; they depend on hardware choices and data sparsity. Researchers should align hardware models and data characteristics when reporting energy efficiency.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by biological intelligence, have
long been considered inherently energy-efficient, making them attractive for
resource-constrained domains such as space applications. However, recent
comparative studies with conventional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have
begun to question this reputation, especially for digital implementations. This
work investigates SNNs for multi-output regression, specifically 3-D satellite
position estimation from monocular images, and compares hardware-aware and
hardware-agnostic energy estimation methods. The proposed SNN, trained using
the membrane potential of the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron in the
final layer, achieves comparable Mean Squared Error (MSE) to a reference
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on a photorealistic satellite dataset.
Energy analysis shows that while hardware-agnostic methods predict a consistent
50-60% energy advantage for SNNs over CNNs, hardware-aware analysis reveals
that significant energy savings are realized only on neuromorphic hardware and
with high input sparsity. The influence of dark pixel ratio on energy
consumption is quantified, emphasizing the impact of data characteristics and
hardware assumptions. These findings highlight the need for transparent
evaluation methods and explicit disclosure of underlying assumptions to ensure
fair comparisons of neural network energy efficiency.

*Weicheng Liao,Zan Chen,Jianyang Xie,Yalin Zheng,Yuhui Ma,Yitian Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised, frequency-aware framework for ultra-wide-field (UWF) retinal image enhancement that decouples deblurring in the frequency domain and uses Retinex-guided illumination correction with an asymmetric channel integration and a color-preservation unit to maintain pathological details while improving visualization and diagnostic utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UWF retinal images suffer from quality-degrading factors such as blur and uneven illumination, which obscure fine details and pathology. Existing general enhancement methods do not address UWF-specific requirements, particularly the need to preserve disease-relevant details.

Method: Propose a frequency-aware self-supervised learning framework with two main modules: (1) a frequency-decoupled image deblurring module featuring an asymmetric channel integration to fuse global and local views by leveraging high- and low-frequency information; (2) a Retinex-guided illumination compensation module with a color preservation unit to provide multi-scale spatial and frequency information for accurate illumination estimation and correction. The approach preserves fine details while correcting uneven illumination, optimizing for clinical relevance in UWF imaging.

Result: Experiments show improved visualization quality and enhanced disease-diagnosis performance, indicating better preservation of local pathology and corrected illumination. The work is positioned as the first robust UWF image enhancement approach with clinical relevance for retinal disease management.

Conclusion: The proposed frequency-aware, self-supervised framework offers a robust, clinically valuable tool for UWF image enhancement, enabling improved visualization and disease management by restoring fine details and correcting nonuniform illumination.

Abstract: Ultra-Wide-Field (UWF) retinal imaging has revolutionized retinal diagnostics
by providing a comprehensive view of the retina. However, it often suffers from
quality-degrading factors such as blurring and uneven illumination, which
obscure fine details and mask pathological information. While numerous retinal
image enhancement methods have been proposed for other fundus imageries, they
often fail to address the unique requirements in UWF, particularly the need to
preserve pathological details. In this paper, we propose a novel
frequency-aware self-supervised learning method for UWF image enhancement. It
incorporates frequency-decoupled image deblurring and Retinex-guided
illumination compensation modules. An asymmetric channel integration operation
is introduced in the former module, so as to combine global and local views by
leveraging high- and low-frequency information, ensuring the preservation of
fine and broader structural details. In addition, a color preservation unit is
proposed in the latter Retinex-based module, to provide multi-scale spatial and
frequency information, enabling accurate illumination estimation and
correction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed work not only
enhances visualization quality but also improves disease diagnosis performance
by restoring and correcting fine local details and uneven intensity. To the
best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt for UWF image
enhancement, offering a robust and clinically valuable tool for improving
retinal disease management.

### [45] [SAT: Supervisor Regularization and Animation Augmentation for Two-process Monocular Texture 3D Human Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19688)
*Gangjian Zhang,Jian Shu,Nanjie Yao,Hao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A SAT framework unifies multiple geometric priors for monocular 3D human reconstruction, with a Supervisor Feature Regularization module and Online Animation Augmentation to produce high-quality textured 3D avatars, outperforming state-of-the-art on two benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D human reconstruction faces geometric ambiguity from a single image and a scarcity of 3D training data. Existing methods struggle to effectively fuse priors (e.g., SMPL, normal maps), leading to view inconsistencies such as facial distortions.

Method: A two-process SAT framework learns multiple prior geometries in a unified manner. It includes a Supervisor Feature Regularization module that uses a multi-view network to provide intermediate features as training supervision, facilitating better fusion of priors. It also adds an Online Animation Augmentation module that builds a one-feed-forward animation network to online-augment a large number of samples from the original 3D data.

Result: Extensive experiments on two benchmarks show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SAT enables seamless fusion of diverse geometric priors to reconstruct high-quality textured 3D avatars; the supervisory regularization and online augmentation improve geometry learning and data efficiency.

Abstract: Monocular texture 3D human reconstruction aims to create a complete 3D
digital avatar from just a single front-view human RGB image. However, the
geometric ambiguity inherent in a single 2D image and the scarcity of 3D human
training data are the main obstacles limiting progress in this field. To
address these issues, current methods employ prior geometric estimation
networks to derive various human geometric forms, such as the SMPL model and
normal maps. However, they struggle to integrate these modalities effectively,
leading to view inconsistencies, such as facial distortions. To this end, we
propose a two-process 3D human reconstruction framework, SAT, which seamlessly
learns various prior geometries in a unified manner and reconstructs
high-quality textured 3D avatars as the final output. To further facilitate
geometry learning, we introduce a Supervisor Feature Regularization module. By
employing a multi-view network with the same structure to provide intermediate
features as training supervision, these varied geometric priors can be better
fused. To tackle data scarcity and further improve reconstruction quality, we
also propose an Online Animation Augmentation module. By building a
one-feed-forward animation network, we augment a massive number of samples from
the original 3D human data online for model training. Extensive experiments on
two benchmarks show the superiority of our approach compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

*V. S. Usatyuk,D. A. Sapozhnikov,S. I. Egorov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A physics-inspired, model-agnostic detector identifies synthetic images by mapping deep features to a sparse LDPC-like graph and analyzing the Bethe-Hessian spectrum under Nishimori temperature; it is unsupervised and robust to new generators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deep generative models are increasingly capable of producing photorealistic images, eroding forensics and biometric security. Supervised detectors fail on unseen generators; unsupervised cues are fragile. A physics-based, model-agnostic detector promises robustness and broad applicability.

Method: Extract CNN features reduced to 32 dimensions; treat each feature as a node in a Multi-Edge Type QC-LDPC graph; convert pairwise similarities to edge couplings calibrated at the Nishimori temperature to form a Random Bond Ising Model; analyze the Bethe-Hessian spectrum to detect real vs synthetic images via spectral gaps.

Result: On binary tasks (cat vs dog, male vs female) using Flickr-Faces-HQ and CelebA real images and GAN/diffusion-generated counterparts, the detector achieves >94% accuracy without labeled synthetic data or retraining; real image sets show multiple well-separated gaps in the Bethe-Hessian spectrum, while synthetic images show a collapsed spectrum.

Conclusion: Proposes a novel LDPC-based graph construction for deep features, links Nishimori RBIM to Bethe-Hessian spectrum for Bayes-optimal detection, and delivers a practical unsupervised detector robust to new generative architectures; future work includes video streams and multi-class anomaly detection.

Abstract: The rapid advance of deep generative models such as GANs and diffusion
networks now produces images that are virtually indistinguishable from genuine
photographs, undermining media forensics and biometric security. Supervised
detectors quickly lose effectiveness on unseen generators or after adversarial
post-processing, while existing unsupervised methods that rely on low-level
statistical cues remain fragile. We introduce a physics-inspired,
model-agnostic detector that treats synthetic-image identification as a
community-detection problem on a sparse weighted graph. Image features are
first extracted with pretrained CNNs and reduced to 32 dimensions, each feature
vector becomes a node of a Multi-Edge Type QC-LDPC graph. Pairwise similarities
are transformed into edge couplings calibrated at the Nishimori temperature,
producing a Random Bond Ising Model (RBIM) whose Bethe-Hessian spectrum
exhibits a characteristic gap when genuine community structure (real images) is
present. Synthetic images violate the Nishimori symmetry and therefore lack
such gaps. We validate the approach on binary tasks cat versus dog and male
versus female using real photos from Flickr-Faces-HQ and CelebA and synthetic
counterparts generated by GANs and diffusion models. Without any labeled
synthetic data or retraining of the feature extractor, the detector achieves
over 94% accuracy. Spectral analysis shows multiple well separated gaps for
real image sets and a collapsed spectrum for generated ones. Our contributions
are threefold: a novel LDPC graph construction that embeds deep image features,
an analytical link between Nishimori temperature RBIM and the Bethe-Hessian
spectrum providing a Bayes optimal detection criterion; and a practical,
unsupervised synthetic image detector robust to new generative architectures.
Future work will extend the framework to video streams and multi-class anomaly
detection.

*Yupeng Zhang,Dezhi Zheng,Ping Lu,Han Zhang,Lei Wang,Liping xiang,Cheng Luo,Kaijun Deng,Xiaowen Fu,Linlin Shen,Jinbao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LabelGS augments 3D Gaussian Splatting with label-aware segmentation, introducing cross-view semantic masks, occlusion-aware optimization, and Gaussian label projection to enable 3D scene segmentation with strong efficiency gains (22x faster training).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) delivers high-fidelity 3D reconstructions but lacks 3D segmentation for scene understanding. To enable object-level tasks, the representation must support semantic labeling and consistent cross-view semantics while avoiding occlusion bias during optimization.

Method: Key ideas include: (1) cross-view consistent semantic masks for 3D Gaussians; (2) Occlusion Analysis Model to prevent overfitting to occluded regions during optimization; (3) Main Gaussian Labeling model to lift 2D semantic priors into 3D Gaussians; (4) Gaussian Projection Filter to prevent conflicting labels; (5) random region sampling to improve efficiency and decouple Gaussian representations; (6) overall refinement of the 3DGS optimization with labeled Gaussians.

Result: LabelGS achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D scene segmentation, outperforming prior methods such as Feature-3DGS, and delivers a significant training speedup—approximately 22×—at a resolution of 1440×1080.

Conclusion: By integrating semantic labeling within 3D Gaussian Splatting and introducing occlusion-aware optimization plus projection filtering, LabelGS enables effective 3D segmentation with substantial efficiency gains, marking a strong advancement in semantically aware 3D scene representations. Code will be available at the authors’ repository.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a novel explicit representation
for 3D scenes, offering both high-fidelity reconstruction and efficient
rendering. However, 3DGS lacks 3D segmentation ability, which limits its
applicability in tasks that require scene understanding. The identification and
isolating of specific object components is crucial. To address this limitation,
we propose Label-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (LabelGS), a method that augments
the Gaussian representation with object label.LabelGS introduces cross-view
consistent semantic masks for 3D Gaussians and employs a novel Occlusion
Analysis Model to avoid overfitting occlusion during optimization, Main
Gaussian Labeling model to lift 2D semantic prior to 3D Gaussian and Gaussian
Projection Filter to avoid Gaussian label conflict. Our approach achieves
effective decoupling of Gaussian representations and refines the 3DGS
optimization process through a random region sampling strategy, significantly
improving efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LabelGS
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, including Feature-3DGS, in the
3D scene segmentation task. Notably, LabelGS achieves a remarkable 22X speedup
in training compared to Feature-3DGS, at a resolution of 1440X1080. Our code

### [48] [FreeVPS: Repurposing Training-Free SAM2 for Generalizable Video Polyp Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19705)
*Qiang Hu,Ying Zhou,Gepeng Ji,Nick Barnes,Qiang Li,Zhiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FreeVPS, a track-by-detect video polyp segmentation framework that fuses image-level polyp segmentation (IPS) with Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for temporal modeling, and introduces two training-free modules—an intra-association filtering module to reduce spatial detection errors and an inter-association refinement module to adaptively update a memory bank—to stabilize long-term tracking and improve generalization, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings and robust tracking on long untrimmed colonoscopy videos.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VPS approaches struggle to balance spatiotemporal modeling with domain generalization, limiting clinical applicability. Long-term tracking suffers from error accumulation, leading to instability and unreliable segmentation across diverse domains and untrimmed sequences.

Method: Recast VPS as a track-by-detect task that leverages the spatial cues of an IPS model while incorporating SAM2's temporal modeling. Repurpose SAM2 as a video polyp segmenter with two training-free modules: intra-association filtering to suppress false positives from the detector and inter-association refinement to dynamically update a memory bank, preventing error propagation and enhancing temporal coherence. The approach operates in a training-free fashion for the two modules, enabling practical deployment.

Result: Achieves cutting-edge performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios and demonstrates robust tracking in long-untrimmed colonoscopy videos, highlighting its potential for reliable clinical analysis.

Conclusion: FreeVPS offers a robust, generalizable VPS solution by stabilizing SAM2-driven tracking with lightweight, training-free modules and by fusing IPS spatial context with SAM2 temporal modeling, enabling stable, accurate polyp segmentation across diverse clinical videos.

Abstract: Existing video polyp segmentation (VPS) paradigms usually struggle to balance
between spatiotemporal modeling and domain generalization, limiting their
applicability in real clinical scenarios. To embrace this challenge, we recast
the VPS task as a track-by-detect paradigm that leverages the spatial contexts
captured by the image polyp segmentation (IPS) model while integrating the
temporal modeling capabilities of segment anything model 2 (SAM2). However,
during long-term polyp tracking in colonoscopy videos, SAM2 suffers from error
accumulation, resulting in a snowball effect that compromises segmentation
stability. We mitigate this issue by repurposing SAM2 as a video polyp
segmenter with two training-free modules. In particular, the intra-association
filtering module eliminates spatial inaccuracies originating from the detecting
stage, reducing false positives. The inter-association refinement module
adaptively updates the memory bank to prevent error propagation over time,
enhancing temporal coherence. Both modules work synergistically to stabilize
SAM2, achieving cutting-edge performance in both in-domain and out-of-domain
scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robust tracking capabilities of
FreeVPS in long-untrimmed colonoscopy videos, underscoring its potential
reliable clinical analysis.

*Stelios Mylonas,Symeon Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robust video deepfake detector with strong generalization built on FSFM, fine-tuned on diverse fake datasets, using triplet loss and attribution-based supervision; demonstrates strong cross-dataset and real-world performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake detectors often fail to generalize beyond their training distributions, limiting effectiveness on real-world media. This work seeks robust, generalizable detection by leveraging facial foundation models and targeted supervision strategies.

Method: Utilizes FSFM, a self-supervised real-face model, as a base; fine-tunes on an ensemble of deepfake datasets spanning face-swapping and face-reenactment; incorporates triplet loss variants to encourage separable real/fake embeddings; explores attribution-based supervision by labeling fakes by manipulation type or source dataset to study impact on generalization.

Result: Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate strong generalization and effectiveness, particularly in challenging real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: The framework achieves robust video deepfake detection with strong cross-dataset generalization and provides insights into the benefits of triplet loss and attribution-based supervision for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The increasing realism and accessibility of deepfakes have raised critical
concerns about media authenticity and information integrity. Despite recent
advances, deepfake detection models often struggle to generalize beyond their
training distributions, particularly when applied to media content found in the
wild. In this work, we present a robust video deepfake detection framework with
strong generalization that takes advantage of the rich facial representations
learned by face foundation models. Our method is built on top of FSFM, a
self-supervised model trained on real face data, and is further fine-tuned
using an ensemble of deepfake datasets spanning both face-swapping and
face-reenactment manipulations. To enhance discriminative power, we incorporate
triplet loss variants during training, guiding the model to produce more
separable embeddings between real and fake samples. Additionally, we explore
attribution-based supervision schemes, where deepfakes are categorized by
manipulation type or source dataset, to assess their impact on generalization.
Extensive experiments across diverse evaluation benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, especially in challenging real-world scenarios.

### [50] [POEv2: a flexible and robust framework for generic line segment detection and wireframe line segment detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19742)
*Chenguang Liu,Chisheng Wang,Yuhua Cai,Chuanhua Zhu,Qingquan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A robust dual-purpose framework for line segment detection (POEv2) that extends Pixel Orientation Estimation to detect generic and wireframe line segments from edge strength maps, achieving state-of-the-art on three datasets when paired with an edge detector.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generic and wireframe line segment detectors have divergent goals; methods tailored to one often underperform on the other, creating a need for a unified, robust approach.

Method: Proposes POEv2, an improved Pixel Orientation Estimation method. It detects line segments from edge strength maps and is compatible with any edge detector, enabling use for both generic and wireframe LSD.

Result: Empirical results show state-of-the-art performance on three publicly available datasets when POEv2 is combined with an efficient edge detector.

Conclusion: POEv2 provides a versatile, robust framework bridging generic and wireframe line segment detection, improving upon prior POE and delivering strong performance across datasets.

Abstract: Line segment detection in images has been studied for several decades.
Existing line segment detectors can be roughly divided into two categories:
generic line segment detectors and wireframe line segment detectors. Generic
line segment detectors aim to detect all meaningful line segments in images and
traditional approaches usually fall into this category. Recent deep learning
based approaches are mostly wireframe line segment detectors. They detect only
line segments that are geometrically meaningful and have large spatial support.
Due to the difference in the aim of design, the performance of generic line
segment detectors for the task of wireframe line segment detection won't be
satisfactory, and vice versa. In this work, we propose a robust framework that
can be used for both generic line segment detection and wireframe line segment
detection. The proposed method is an improved version of the Pixel Orientation
Estimation (POE) method. It is thus named as POEv2. POEv2 detects line segments
from edge strength maps, and can be combined with any edge detector. We show in
our experiments that by combining the proposed POEv2 with an efficient edge
detector, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on three publicly available
datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces SPLF-SAM, a self-prompting light-field SOD model that uses UMFEB for multi-scale feature embedding and MAFA for frequency-aware filtering, achieving state-of-the-art results on LF SOD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM-based LF SOD models often neglect prompt information and fail to analyze frequency-domain features, causing small objects to be overwhelmed by noise.

Method: Proposes SPLF-SAM with two modules: UMFEB (unified multi-scale feature embedding block) to detect objects across scales and MAFA (multi-scale adaptive filtering adapter) to learn frequency-domain features that suppress noise affecting small objects; leverages self-prompting to guide segmentation.

Result: Demonstrates superiority over ten state-of-the-art LF SOD methods on experiments; code available at GitHub.

Conclusion: SPLF-SAM effectively integrates prompt-informed guidance and frequency-aware, multi-scale processing to improve light-field salient object detection.

Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
solving light field salient object detection (LF SOD). However, most existing
models tend to neglect the extraction of prompt information under this task.
Meanwhile, traditional models ignore the analysis of frequency-domain
information, which leads to small objects being overwhelmed by noise. In this
paper, we put forward a novel model called self-prompting light field segment
anything model (SPLF-SAM), equipped with unified multi-scale feature embedding
block (UMFEB) and a multi-scale adaptive filtering adapter (MAFA). UMFEB is
capable of identifying multiple objects of varying sizes, while MAFA, by
learning frequency features, effectively prevents small objects from being
overwhelmed by noise. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the superiority
of our method over ten state-of-the-art (SOTA) LF SOD methods. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/XucherCH/splfsam.

*Yue Wu,Yufan Wu,Wen Li,Yuxi Lu,Kairui Feng,Xuanhong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastAvatar is a unified, fast 3D avatar reconstruction framework that converts diverse inputs (single image, multi-view, or monocular video) into a high-quality 3D Gaussian Splatting model in seconds, via a Large Gaussian Reconstruction Transformer and incremental Gaussian aggregation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address long time complexity, sensitivity to data quality, and underutilization of data in 3D avatar reconstruction by enabling a single model to flexibly use common daily recordings and progressively improve as more observations are added.

Method: Three core designs: (1) a Large Gaussian Reconstruction Transformer with a VGGT-style architecture that aggregates multi-frame cues and uses an initial 3D prompt to predict a canonical 3DGS representation; (2) multi-granular guidance encoding (camera pose, FLAME expression, head pose) to reduce animation misalignment for inputs of variable length; (3) incremental Gaussian aggregation via landmark tracking and sliced fusion losses.

Result: Extensive experiments show that FastAvatar achieves higher quality and is highly competitive in speed compared with existing methods.

Conclusion: FastAvatar enables a quality-speed-tunable, incremental reconstruction paradigm, delivering highly usable avatar modeling with a single unified model that improves as more observations are collected.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 3D avatar reconstruction, it still faces
challenges such as high time complexity, sensitivity to data quality, and low
data utilization. We propose FastAvatar, a feedforward 3D avatar framework
capable of flexibly leveraging diverse daily recordings (e.g., a single image,
multi-view observations, or monocular video) to reconstruct a high-quality 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model within seconds, using only a single unified
model. FastAvatar's core is a Large Gaussian Reconstruction Transformer
featuring three key designs: First, a variant VGGT-style transformer
architecture aggregating multi-frame cues while injecting initial 3D prompt to
predict an aggregatable canonical 3DGS representation; Second, multi-granular
guidance encoding (camera pose, FLAME expression, head pose) mitigating
animation-induced misalignment for variable-length inputs; Third, incremental
Gaussian aggregation via landmark tracking and sliced fusion losses.
Integrating these features, FastAvatar enables incremental reconstruction,
i.e., improving quality with more observations, unlike prior work wasting input
data. This yields a quality-speed-tunable paradigm for highly usable avatar
modeling. Extensive experiments show that FastAvatar has higher quality and
highly competitive speed compared to existing methods.

*Ahmed Emam,Mohamed Elbassiouny,Julius Miller,Patrick Donworth,Sabine Seidel,Ribana Roscher*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BuzzSet is a new large-scale, real-field pollinator image dataset with 3 classes (honeybees, bumblebees, unidentified insects) that enables strong baselines for small-object detection under label noise; mAP@0.50 = 0.559 and F1 ~0.94/0.92 for honeybee/bumblebee.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pollinator declines threaten global food security, and scalable automated monitoring is needed. Real-field, small-object detection benchmarks with label noise are essential for robust ecological CV methods.

Method: Collected 7856 high-resolution field images with ~8000 labeled instances across four classes? Actually three: honeybee, bumblebee, unidentified. Initial annotations via YOLOv12 trained on external data, refined by human verification. Preprocessed images into 256×256 tiles. Baselines using RF-DETR transformer-based detector. Evaluated using F1 scores and mAP@0.50; confusion matrix analyzed.

Result: Honeybee F1 = 0.94; Bumblebee F1 = 0.92; unidentified class challenging due to label ambiguity and lower sample frequency; minimal misclassification between honeybees and bumblebees; best mAP@0.50 = 0.559.

Conclusion: BuzzSet provides a valuable benchmark for small-object detection and robustness to label noise, supporting ecological CV research and scalable pollinator monitoring.

Abstract: Pollinator insects such as honeybees and bumblebees are vital to global food
production and ecosystem stability, yet their populations are declining due to
increasing anthropogenic and environmental stressors. To support scalable,
automated pollinator monitoring, we introduce BuzzSet, a new large-scale
dataset of high-resolution pollinator images collected in real agricultural
field conditions. BuzzSet contains 7856 manually verified and labeled images,
with over 8000 annotated instances across three classes: honeybees, bumblebees,
and unidentified insects. Initial annotations were generated using a YOLOv12
model trained on external data and refined via human verification using
open-source labeling tools. All images were preprocessed into 256~$\times$~256
tiles to improve the detection of small insects. We provide strong baselines
using the RF-DETR transformer-based object detector. The model achieves high
F1-scores of 0.94 and 0.92 for honeybee and bumblebee classes, respectively,
with confusion matrix results showing minimal misclassification between these
categories. The unidentified class remains more challenging due to label
ambiguity and lower sample frequency, yet still contributes useful insights for
robustness evaluation. Overall detection quality is strong, with a best
mAP@0.50 of 0.559. BuzzSet offers a valuable benchmark for small object
detection, class separation under label noise, and ecological computer vision.

### [54] [AIM: Adaptive Intra-Network Modulation for Balanced Multimodal Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19769)
*Shu Shen,C. L. Philip Chen,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIM introduces optimization-state-aware intra-network modulation to balance multimodal learning without suppressing dominant or weaker modalities, yielding superior results across benchmarks and architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Imbalanced multimodal learning is widespread; existing methods that modulate per modality often harm the dominant modality due to optimization bias, limiting overall performance.

Method: Introduce Adaptive Intra-Network Modulation (AIM) that decouples under-optimized parameters of the dominant modality into Auxiliary Blocks and adapts modulation strength across network depths to balance learning with weaker modalities.

Result: AIM outperforms state-of-the-art imbalanced modality methods across multiple benchmarks, is robust to backbones, fusion strategies, and optimizers.

Conclusion: AIM effectively prevents suppression of weaker modalities while enabling targeted optimization of under-optimized parameters, offering a generalizable approach for balanced multimodal learning.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has significantly enhanced machine learning performance
but still faces numerous challenges and limitations. Imbalanced multimodal
learning is one of the problems extensively studied in recent works and is
typically mitigated by modulating the learning of each modality. However, we
find that these methods typically hinder the dominant modality's learning to
promote weaker modalities, which affects overall multimodal performance. We
analyze the cause of this issue and highlight a commonly overlooked problem:
optimization bias within networks. To address this, we propose Adaptive
Intra-Network Modulation (AIM) to improve balanced modality learning. AIM
accounts for differences in optimization state across parameters and depths
within the network during modulation, achieving balanced multimodal learning
without hindering either dominant or weak modalities for the first time.
Specifically, AIM decouples the dominant modality's under-optimized parameters
into Auxiliary Blocks and encourages reliance on these performance-degraded
blocks for joint training with weaker modalities. This approach effectively
prevents suppression of weaker modalities while enabling targeted optimization
of under-optimized parameters to improve the dominant modality. Additionally,
AIM assesses modality imbalance level across network depths and adaptively
adjusts modulation strength at each depth. Experimental results demonstrate
that AIM outperforms state-of-the-art imbalanced modality learning methods
across multiple benchmarks and exhibits strong generalizability across
different backbones, fusion strategies, and optimizers.

TL;DR: Automatic annotation and modular structural recognition for handwritten math, providing explicit trace-to-symbol graphs for error analysis and interpretability, with competitive CROHME-2023 results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Encoder-decoder models generating LaTeX often lack explicit symbol-to-trace alignment, hindering error analysis, interpretability, and spatially-aware interactive applications.

Method: 1) An automatic annotation system that uses a neural network to map LaTeX equations to raw handwritten traces, generating annotations for symbol segmentation, classification, and spatial relations. 2) A modular structural recognition system that independently optimizes segmentation, classification, and relation prediction. Trained on a dataset enriched with structural annotations from the auto-labeling system. The recognition pipeline combines graph-based trace sorting, a hybrid convolutional-recurrent network, and transformer-based correction to produce structural outputs.

Result: Achieves competitive performance on the CROHME-2023 benchmark. Produces a complete graph structure that directly links handwritten traces to predicted symbols, enabling transparent error analysis and interpretable outputs.

Conclusion: Structural recognition with explicit trace-to-symbol graphs fosters interpretability and precise error analysis, supporting spatially aware interactive applications and educational tech.

Abstract: Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition is foundational for
educational technologies, enabling applications like digital note-taking and
automated grading. While modern encoder-decoder architectures with large
language models excel at LaTeX generation, they lack explicit symbol-to-trace
alignment, a critical limitation for error analysis, interpretability, and
spatially aware interactive applications requiring selective content updates.
This paper introduces a structural recognition approach with two innovations: 1
an automatic annotation system that uses a neural network to map LaTeX
equations to raw traces, automatically generating annotations for symbol
segmentation, classification, and spatial relations, and 2 a modular structural
recognition system that independently optimizes segmentation, classification,
and relation prediction. By leveraging a dataset enriched with structural
annotations from our auto-labeling system, the proposed recognition system
combines graph-based trace sorting, a hybrid convolutional-recurrent network,
and transformer-based correction to achieve competitive performance on the
CROHME-2023 benchmark. Crucially, our structural recognition system generates a
complete graph structure that directly links handwritten traces to predicted
symbols, enabling transparent error analysis and interpretable outputs.

### [56] [MAPo : Motion-Aware Partitioning of Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting for High-Fidelity Dynamic Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19786)
*Han Jiao,Jiakai Sun,Yexing Xu,Lei Zhao,Wei Xing,Huaizhong Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAPo (Motion-Aware Partitioning of Deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting) partitions Gaussians by dynamicity to better model dynamic scenes. High-dynamic Gaussians are temporally partitioned with duplicated deformation networks per segment; low-dynamic Gaussians are treated as static to save compute. A cross-frame consistency loss reduces temporal discontinuities. Results show state-of-the-art rendering quality with comparable compute, especially in fast/motion regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deformation-based dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting often yields blurred renderings and loses fine motion details because a single unified model struggles to capture diverse motion patterns. There is a need for adaptively modeling regions with different dynamics while keeping computation reasonable.

Method: Introduce a dynamic score-based partitioning that separates 3D Gaussians into high- and low-dynamic groups. High-dynamic Gaussians are recursively partitioned in time and each new temporal segment gets its own duplicated deformation network for specialized motion modeling. Low-dynamic Gaussians are treated as static to reduce cost. A cross-frame consistency loss is added to ensure continuity across partition boundaries and improve rendering quality.

Result: Extensive experiments show MAPo achieves superior rendering quality compared to baselines with comparable computational costs, especially in regions with complex or rapid motions.

Conclusion: MAPo effectively improves dynamic scene reconstruction fidelity by adaptively partitioning dynamic components and enforcing cross-frame consistency, enabling detailed motion capture without incurring prohibitive compute.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting, known for enabling high-quality static scene
reconstruction with fast rendering, is increasingly being applied to dynamic
scene reconstruction. A common strategy involves learning a deformation field
to model the temporal changes of a canonical set of 3D Gaussians. However,
these deformation-based methods often produce blurred renderings and lose fine
motion details in highly dynamic regions due to the inherent limitations of a
single, unified model in representing diverse motion patterns. To address these
challenges, we introduce Motion-Aware Partitioning of Deformable 3D Gaussian
Splatting (MAPo), a novel framework for high-fidelity dynamic scene
reconstruction. Its core is a dynamic score-based partitioning strategy that
distinguishes between high- and low-dynamic 3D Gaussians. For high-dynamic 3D
Gaussians, we recursively partition them temporally and duplicate their
deformation networks for each new temporal segment, enabling specialized
modeling to capture intricate motion details. Concurrently, low-dynamic 3DGs
are treated as static to reduce computational costs. However, this temporal
partitioning strategy for high-dynamic 3DGs can introduce visual
discontinuities across frames at the partition boundaries. To address this, we
introduce a cross-frame consistency loss, which not only ensures visual
continuity but also further enhances rendering quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MAPo achieves superior rendering quality compared to baselines
while maintaining comparable computational costs, particularly in regions with
complex or rapid motions.

*Xiuchao Wu,Pengfei Zhu,Jiangjing Lyu,Xinguo Liu,Jie Guo,Yanwen Guo,Weiwei Xu,Chengfei Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A one-step diffusion framework (StableIntrinsic) for fast, low-variance multi-view material estimation, using pixel-space losses and a Detail Injection Network, achieving state-of-the-art gains in albedo PSNR and metallic/roughness MSE.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based material estimation is slow due to multi-step sampling and stochasticity; deterministic material estimation suffers high variance; one-step diffusion can lead to over-smoothing. There is a need for a fast, stable method that preserves material detail across views.

Method: Proposes StableIntrinsic, a one-step diffusion model for multi-view material estimation. It employs losses in pixel space tailored to material properties to mitigate over-smoothing. It introduces a Detail Injection Network (DIN) to recover detail lost during VAE encoding and to sharpen material predictions.

Result: Outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques, with a 9.9% improvement in PSNR for albedo and significant MSE reductions for metallic (44.4%) and roughness (60.0%).

Conclusion: StableIntrinsic offers an efficient, low-variance one-step diffusion solution for high-quality material estimation across views. The DIN helps preserve and restore fine details, contributing to notable quantitative gains and practical applicability.

Abstract: Recovering material information from images has been extensively studied in
computer graphics and vision. Recent works in material estimation leverage
diffusion model showing promising results. However, these diffusion-based
methods adopt a multi-step denoising strategy, which is time-consuming for each
estimation. Such stochastic inference also conflicts with the deterministic
material estimation task, leading to a high variance estimated results. In this
paper, we introduce StableIntrinsic, a one-step diffusion model for multi-view
material estimation that can produce high-quality material parameters with low
variance. To address the overly-smoothing problem in one-step diffusion,
StableIntrinsic applies losses in pixel space, with each loss designed based on
the properties of the material. Additionally, StableIntrinsic introduces a
Detail Injection Network (DIN) to eliminate the detail loss caused by VAE
encoding, while further enhancing the sharpness of material prediction results.
The experimental results indicate that our method surpasses the current
state-of-the-art techniques by achieving a $9.9\%$ improvement in the Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of albedo, and by reducing the Mean Square Error
(MSE) for metallic and roughness by $44.4\%$ and $60.0\%$, respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: They study semantic misalignment in text-to-image generation for prompts with multiple colors, show existing inference-time edits fail to fix it, and propose a dedicated image-editing technique that improves multi-object color alignment across diffusion-based models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current T2I systems struggle to faithfully render prompts with multiple color attributes, and existing evaluation practices rely on coarse metrics (CLIP cosine similarity or human judgments). There is a need for rigorous, scalable evaluation and methods that address multi-object color semantics.

Method: Perform a case study focused on color attributes as a testbed. Analyze how pretrained diffusion-based T2I models handle prompts with multiple colors, compare with inference-time attention-modification and editing methods, and introduce a dedicated image-editing technique to enforce multi-color semantic alignment. Evaluate across diverse T2I diffusion models using a broad set of metrics.

Result: The editing technique significantly improves performance across a wide range of metrics and across various diffusion-based T2I methods for prompts containing multiple colors.

Conclusion: Current inference-time edits are insufficient for multi-object color alignment; a dedicated editing approach can robustly improve semantic fidelity for multi-color prompts and potentially generalize to other attributes, highlighting the need for more rigorous, scalable evaluation beyond coarse metrics.

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has recently seen remarkable success, granting users
with the ability to create high-quality images through the use of text.
However, contemporary methods face challenges in capturing the precise
semantics conveyed by complex multi-object prompts. Consequently, many works
have sought to mitigate such semantic misalignments, typically via
inference-time schemes that modify the attention layers of the denoising
networks. However, prior work has mostly utilized coarse metrics, such as the
cosine similarity between text and image CLIP embeddings, or human evaluations,
which are challenging to conduct on a larger-scale. In this work, we perform a
case study on colors -- a fundamental attribute commonly associated with
objects in text prompts, which offer a rich test bed for rigorous evaluation.
Our analysis reveals that pretrained models struggle to generate images that
faithfully reflect multiple color attributes-far more so than with single-color
prompts-and that neither inference-time techniques nor existing editing methods
reliably resolve these semantic misalignments. Accordingly, we introduce a
dedicated image editing technique, mitigating the issue of multi-object
semantic alignment for prompts containing multiple colors. We demonstrate that
our approach significantly boosts performance over a wide range of metrics,
considering images generated by various text-to-image diffusion-based
techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An enhanced Encoder-Decoder waste-sorting network with a Comprehensive Attention Block, Mamba-attention, and a Data Fusion Block using PCA to fuse multi-channel images, achieving superior performance across RGB, hyperspectral, multispectral, and RGB+hyperspectral data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Waste streams are highly variable and challenging to sort; improving accuracy and efficiency requires robust feature representations and effective fusion of multi-channel data.

Method: Introduce a Comprehensive Attention Block in the decoder (merging convolution and upsampling), apply parallel Mamba attention, and add a Data Fusion Block that fuses images with more than three channels. Use PCA to reduce dimensionality to three principal components for processing. Evaluate on RGB, hyperspectral, multispectral, and RGB+hyperspectral datasets.

Result: The proposed approach outperforms existing methods by a significant margin across the evaluated modalities (RGB, hyperspectral, multispectral, and RGB+hyperspectral).

Conclusion: The architecture with enhanced attention mechanisms and PCA-based multi-channel fusion offers robust improvements for automated waste sorting, validating the benefit of multi-spectral data and advanced attention in Encoder-Decoder frameworks.

Abstract: In the realm of waste management, automating the sorting process for
non-biodegradable materials presents considerable challenges due to the
complexity and variability of waste streams. To address these challenges, we
introduce an enhanced neural architecture that builds upon an existing
Encoder-Decoder structure to improve the accuracy and efficiency of waste
sorting systems. Our model integrates several key innovations: a Comprehensive
Attention Block within the decoder, which refines feature representations by
combining convolutional and upsampling operations. In parallel, we utilize
attention through the Mamba architecture, providing an additional performance
boost. We also introduce a Data Fusion Block that fuses images with more than
three channels. To achieve this, we apply PCA transformation to reduce the
dimensionality while retaining the maximum variance and essential information
across three dimensions, which are then used for further processing. We

Abstract: Mitotic figure (MF) detection in histopathology images is challenging due to
large variations in slide scanners, staining protocols, tissue types, and the
presence of artifacts. This paper presents a collection of training techniques
- a bag of tricks - that enable robust, real-time MF detection across diverse
domains. We build on the efficient RTMDet single stage object detector to
achieve high inference speed suitable for clinical deployment. Our method
addresses scanner variability and tumor heterogeneity via extensive

Additionally, we employ targeted, hard negative mining on necrotic and debris
tissue to reduce false positives. In a grouped 5-fold cross-validation across
multiple MF datasets, our model achieves an F1 score between 0.78 and 0.84. On

### [61] [ERSR: An Ellipse-constrained pseudo-label refinement and symmetric regularization framework for semi-supervised fetal head segmentation in ultrasound images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19815)
*Linkuan Zhou,Zhexin Chen,Yufei Shen,Junlin Xu,Ping Xuan,Yixin Zhu,Yuqi Fang,Cong Cong,Leyi Wei,Ran Su,Jia Zhou,Qiangguo Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERSR is a semi-supervised framework that improves fetal head ultrasound segmentation by combining dual-scoring adaptive filtering, ellipse-constrained pseudo-label refinement, and symmetry-based multi-level consistency regularization, achieving state-of-the-art Dice on HC18 and PSFH with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fetal head ultrasound segmentation is difficult due to poor image quality and limited annotated data. Semi-supervised learning can help, but generating reliable pseudo-labels and enforcing effective regularization is challenging for the unique characteristics of fetal head ultrasound images.

Method: 1) Dual-scoring adaptive filtering: uses boundary consistency and contour regularity to evaluate and filter teacher outputs. 2) Ellipse-constrained pseudo-label refinement: fits least-squares ellipses to refine pseudo-labels, emphasizing center pixels and suppressing noise. 3) Symmetry-based multiple consistency regularization: enforces consistency across perturbed images, symmetric regions, and between predictions and pseudo-labels to capture robust shape representations.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on HC18 and PSFH datasets. On HC18, Dice scores of 92.05% (10% labeled) and 95.36% (20% labeled). On PSFH, Dice scores of 91.68% (10% labeled) and 93.70% (20% labeled).

Conclusion: The ERSR framework provides robust, label-efficient fetal head segmentation in ultrasound by integrating adaptive filtering, ellipse-based pseudo-label refinement, and symmetry-driven consistency, delivering strong performance with limited labels.

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the fetal head in ultrasound images is critical for
prenatal monitoring. However, achieving robust segmentation remains challenging
due to the poor quality of ultrasound images and the lack of annotated data.
Semi-supervised methods alleviate the lack of annotated data but struggle with
the unique characteristics of fetal head ultrasound images, making it
challenging to generate reliable pseudo-labels and enforce effective
consistency regularization constraints. To address this issue, we propose a
novel semi-supervised framework, ERSR, for fetal head ultrasound segmentation.
Our framework consists of the dual-scoring adaptive filtering strategy, the
ellipse-constrained pseudo-label refinement, and the symmetry-based multiple
consistency regularization. The dual-scoring adaptive filtering strategy uses
boundary consistency and contour regularity criteria to evaluate and filter
teacher outputs. The ellipse-constrained pseudo-label refinement refines these
filtered outputs by fitting least-squares ellipses, which strengthens pixels
near the center of the fitted ellipse and suppresses noise simultaneously. The
symmetry-based multiple consistency regularization enforces multi-level
consistency across perturbed images, symmetric regions, and between original
predictions and pseudo-labels, enabling the model to capture robust and stable
shape representations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two
benchmarks. On the HC18 dataset, it reaches Dice scores of 92.05% and 95.36%
with 10% and 20% labeled data, respectively. On the PSFH dataset, the scores
are 91.68% and 93.70% under the same settings.

*Shenqi Wang,Guangzhi Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CSSL introduces context-aware thresholding to regulate neuron activations for event-based vision, achieving high sparsity without explicit sparsity losses while maintaining competitive performance on object detection and optical flow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing deep learning methods underutilize the sparse nature of event data; dense models are costly for edge devices; spiking neural networks underperform on complex event-based tasks; achieving high activation sparsity is hard and often relies on manual sparsity-inducing terms.

Method: Context-aware Sparse Spatiotemporal Learning (CSSL) with context-aware thresholds that adapt to the input distribution to dynamically prune neuron activations, reducing density without explicit sparsity constraints; applied to event-based object detection and optical flow estimation.

Result: Achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining extremely high neuronal sparsity.

Conclusion: Context-aware thresholding enables efficient event-based vision for neuromorphic processing by leveraging input-driven activation control without explicit sparsity penalties.

Abstract: Event-based camera has emerged as a promising paradigm for robot perception,
offering advantages with high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and
robustness to motion blur. However, existing deep learning-based event
processing methods often fail to fully leverage the sparse nature of event
data, complicating their integration into resource-constrained edge
applications. While neuromorphic computing provides an energy-efficient
alternative, spiking neural networks struggle to match of performance of
state-of-the-art models in complex event-based vision tasks, like object
detection and optical flow. Moreover, achieving high activation sparsity in
neural networks is still difficult and often demands careful manual tuning of
sparsity-inducing loss terms. Here, we propose Context-aware Sparse
Spatiotemporal Learning (CSSL), a novel framework that introduces context-aware
thresholding to dynamically regulate neuron activations based on the input
distribution, naturally reducing activation density without explicit sparsity
constraints. Applied to event-based object detection and optical flow
estimation, CSSL achieves comparable or superior performance to
state-of-the-art methods while maintaining extremely high neuronal sparsity.
Our experimental results highlight CSSL's crucial role in enabling efficient
event-based vision for neuromorphic processing.

### [63] [Gradient Rectification for Robust Calibration under Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19830)
*Yilin Zhang,Cai Xu,You Wu,Ziyu Guan,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A calibration method that operates without target-domain data by using low-frequency feature filtering to reduce distribution-shift sensitivity and a gradient-based hard constraint to preserve in-distribution calibration, achieving better calibration under shift on CIFAR-10/100-C and WILDS while keeping ID accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve the reliability of deep networks under distribution shift without requiring access to target-domain data, addressing miscalibration that worsens outside the training distribution.

Method: A frequency-domain approach that applies low-frequency filtering to promote domain-invariant features, combined with a gradient-based rectification mechanism that enforces in-distribution calibration as a hard constraint during optimization.

Result: Significant improvement in calibration under distribution shift on synthetic and real-world shifted datasets (CIFAR-10/100-C and WILDS) while maintaining strong in-distribution performance.

Conclusion: The proposed framework provides a practical calibration solution that does not rely on target-domain information, achieving better reliability under distribution shifts with minimal sacrifice to in-distribution accuracy.

Abstract: Deep neural networks often produce overconfident predictions, undermining
their reliability in safety-critical applications. This miscalibration is
further exacerbated under distribution shift, where test data deviates from the
training distribution due to environmental or acquisition changes. While
existing approaches improve calibration through training-time regularization or
post-hoc adjustment, their reliance on access to or simulation of target
domains limits their practicality in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we
propose a novel calibration framework that operates without access to target
domain information. From a frequency-domain perspective, we identify that
distribution shifts often distort high-frequency visual cues exploited by deep
models, and introduce a low-frequency filtering strategy to encourage reliance
on domain-invariant features. However, such information loss may degrade
In-Distribution (ID) calibration performance. Therefore, we further propose a
gradient-based rectification mechanism that enforces ID calibration as a hard
constraint during optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world shifted
datasets, including CIFAR-10/100-C and WILDS, demonstrate that our method
significantly improves calibration under distribution shift while maintaining
strong in-distribution performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoQ-VIS introduces quality-guided self-training for unsupervised video instance segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art results on YouTubeVIS-2019 without annotations by bridging the synthetic-to-real domain gap via a closed-loop pseudo-labeling and quality assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VIS demands pixel-accurate masks and temporal consistency; unsupervised methods struggle with the synthetic-to-real domain gap. While methods like VideoCutLER reduce flow dependencies via synthetic data, real-world performance still suffers from domain shift.

Method: A closed-loop system that alternates between pseudo-label generation and automatic quality assessment to progressively adapt from synthetic to real videos.

Result: Achieves 52.6 AP50 on YouTubeVIS-2019 val, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art VideoCutLER by 4.4 percentage points, without any human annotations.

Conclusion: Quality-aware self-training is viable for unsupervised VIS; code is released, demonstrating effective domain adaptation without labeled data.

Abstract: Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) faces significant annotation challenges due
to its dual requirements of pixel-level masks and temporal consistency labels.
While recent unsupervised methods like VideoCutLER eliminate optical flow
dependencies through synthetic data, they remain constrained by the
synthetic-to-real domain gap. We present AutoQ-VIS, a novel unsupervised
framework that bridges this gap through quality-guided self-training. Our
approach establishes a closed-loop system between pseudo-label generation and
automatic quality assessment, enabling progressive adaptation from synthetic to
real videos. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with 52.6
$\text{AP}_{50}$ on YouTubeVIS-2019 val set, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art VideoCutLER by 4.4$\%$, while requiring no human annotations.
This demonstrates the viability of quality-aware self-training for unsupervised
VIS. The source code of our method is available at

*Narges Takhtkeshha,Gabriele Mazzacca,Fabio Remondino,Juha Hyyppä,Gottfried Mandlburger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-LiDAR with deep learning enhances urban tree extraction; Superpoint Transformer (SPT) achieves strong accuracy (mIoU 85.28%), and adding pseudo NDVI (pNDVI) to spatial data further improves detection by 10.61 percentage points over using spatial data alone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban tree dynamics are essential for greening policies and protecting electrical infrastructure. Urban environments are complex and tree morphology is variable, making accurate large-scale tree mapping challenging. Multispectral LiDAR offers both 3D geometry and spectral cues to improve delineation of trees.

Method: Evaluate three state-of-the-art deep learning models for tree point extraction using MS-LiDAR: Superpoint Transformer (SPT), Point Transformer V3 (PTv3), and Point Transformer V1 (PTv1). Compare performance; investigate the impact of adding pseudo NDVI (pNDVI) with spatial data on detection accuracy.

Result: SPT yields the best time efficiency and accuracy with a mean IoU of 85.28%. Incorporating pNDVI with spatial data reduces the error rate by 10.61 percentage points compared with using spatial information alone, with PTv3/PTv1 included for comparison.

Conclusion: MS-LiDAR combined with DL is promising for accurate tree extraction and improved inventories in urban areas. The study highlights the value of spectral cues (pNDVI) in boosting performance, while also noting ongoing challenges due to urban complexity and tree variability that warrant further research.

Abstract: Monitoring urban tree dynamics is vital for supporting greening policies and
reducing risks to electrical infrastructure. Airborne laser scanning has
advanced large-scale tree management, but challenges remain due to complex
urban environments and tree variability. Multispectral (MS) light detection and
ranging (LiDAR) improves this by capturing both 3D spatial and spectral data,
enabling detailed mapping. This study explores tree point extraction using
MS-LiDAR and deep learning (DL) models. Three state-of-the-art models are
evaluated: Superpoint Transformer (SPT), Point Transformer V3 (PTv3), and Point
Transformer V1 (PTv1). Results show the notable time efficiency and accuracy of
SPT, with a mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 85.28%. The highest
detection accuracy is achieved by incorporating pseudo normalized difference
vegetation index (pNDVI) with spatial data, reducing error rate by 10.61
percentage points (pp) compared to using spatial information alone. These
findings highlight the potential of MS-LiDAR and DL to improve tree extraction
and further tree inventories.

### [66] [WaveHiT-SR: Hierarchical Wavelet Network for Efficient Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19927)
*Fayaz Ali,Muhammad Zawish,Steven Davy,Radu Timofte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveHiT-SR embeds wavelet transforms into a hierarchical transformer with adaptive windows to capture multi-scale features, achieving efficient, state-of-the-art super-resolution with lower FLOPs and fewer parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard window self-attention in vision transformers incurs quadratic complexity and fixed small windows, limiting receptive fields. There is a need to model long-range dependencies while preserving details and reducing compute; wavelet decomposition provides multi-frequency subbands to balance global/local information.

Method: In WaveHiT-SR, adaptive hierarchical windows replace fixed small windows in a hierarchical transformer. Wavelet transforms decompose images into multi-frequency subbands, enabling the network to process global and local features. Through progressive, hierarchical reconstruction, the model reduces computation while maintaining quality. The approach yields refined versions of SwinIR-Light, SwinIR-NG, and SRFormer-Light with improved efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments validate effectiveness and efficiency; the refined models achieve cutting-edge SR results with fewer parameters, lower FLOPs, and faster speeds.

Conclusion: Adaptive hierarchical windows plus wavelet-based multi-scale decomposition provide a favorable balance of SR performance and efficiency, enabling better long-range modeling and detail preservation with reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated promising performance in computer vision
tasks, including image super-resolution (SR). The quadratic computational
complexity of window self-attention mechanisms in many transformer-based SR
methods forces the use of small, fixed windows, limiting the receptive field.
In this paper, we propose a new approach by embedding the wavelet transform
within a hierarchical transformer framework, called (WaveHiT-SR). First, using
adaptive hierarchical windows instead of static small windows allows to capture
features across different levels and greatly improve the ability to model
long-range dependencies. Secondly, the proposed model utilizes wavelet
transforms to decompose images into multiple frequency subbands, allowing the
network to focus on both global and local features while preserving structural
details. By progressively reconstructing high-resolution images through
hierarchical processing, the network reduces computational complexity without
sacrificing performance. The multi-level decomposition strategy enables the
network to capture fine-grained information in lowfrequency components while
enhancing high-frequency textures. Through extensive experimentation, we
confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our WaveHiT-SR. Our refined
versions of SwinIR-Light, SwinIR-NG, and SRFormer-Light deliver cutting-edge SR
results, achieving higher efficiency with fewer parameters, lower FLOPs, and
faster speeds.

*Xiaoqi Wang,Yun Zhang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a machine-centric image quality assessment (MIQA) framework for machine vision systems (MVS), introducing a large MIQ database and a region-aware MIQA (RA-MIQA) model to predict how degradations affect MVS performance, outperforming human-centric IQA metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MVS performance degrades under adverse visual conditions and current HVS-based IQA metrics fail to predict MVS quality; need machine-centric assessment aligned with end-task performance.

Method: Develop an end-to-end MIQA workflow, construct MIQD-2.5M with 2.5M samples across 75 models, 250 degradation types, 3 tasks; propose RA-MIQA for spatially fine-grained degradation analysis; benchmark against 7 HVS-IQA metrics and 5 retrained backbones.

Result: RA-MIQA yields SRCC gains of 13.56% on consistency and 13.37% on accuracy for image classification; RA-MIQA outperforms HVS-based metrics and reveals task-specific degradation sensitivities; existing MIQA models struggle with background degradations and subtle distortions.

Conclusion: The study advances MVS reliability by enabling machine-centric image processing and optimization, with a public codebase (GitHub).

Abstract: Machine vision systems (MVS) are intrinsically vulnerable to performance
degradation under adverse visual conditions. To address this, we propose a
machine-centric image quality assessment (MIQA) framework that quantifies the
impact of image degradations on MVS performance. We establish an MIQA paradigm
encompassing the end-to-end assessment workflow. To support this, we construct
a machine-centric image quality database (MIQD-2.5M), comprising 2.5 million
samples that capture distinctive degradation responses in both consistency and
accuracy metrics, spanning 75 vision models, 250 degradation types, and three
representative vision tasks. We further propose a region-aware MIQA (RA-MIQA)
model to evaluate MVS visual quality through fine-grained spatial degradation
analysis. Extensive experiments benchmark the proposed RA-MIQA against seven
human visual system (HVS)-based IQA metrics and five retrained classical
backbones. Results demonstrate RA-MIQA's superior performance in multiple
dimensions, e.g., achieving SRCC gains of 13.56% on consistency and 13.37% on
accuracy for image classification, while also revealing task-specific
degradation sensitivities. Critically, HVS-based metrics prove inadequate for
MVS quality prediction, while even specialized MIQA models struggle with
background degradations, accuracy-oriented estimation, and subtle distortions.
This study can advance MVS reliability and establish foundations for
machine-centric image processing and optimization. The model and code are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object hallucination in vision-language models poses safety risks; existing detectors rely on either global or local cues, which can be unreliable across scenarios. A robust, versatile detector is needed.

Method: GLSim leverages complementary global and local embedding similarity signals between image and text modalities and fuses them for training-free object hallucination detection.

Result: On comprehensive benchmarks, GLSim surpasses competitive baselines by a significant margin, demonstrating superior detection performance across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: GLSim provides a reliable, training-free solution for object hallucination detection in vision-language models, improving reliability and robustness of deployment.

Abstract: Object hallucination in large vision-language models presents a significant
challenge to their safe deployment in real-world applications. Recent works
have proposed object-level hallucination scores to estimate the likelihood of
object hallucination; however, these methods typically adopt either a global or
local perspective in isolation, which may limit detection reliability. In this
paper, we introduce GLSim, a novel training-free object hallucination detection
framework that leverages complementary global and local embedding similarity
signals between image and text modalities, enabling more accurate and reliable
hallucination detection in diverse scenarios. We comprehensively benchmark
existing object hallucination detection methods and demonstrate that GLSim
achieves superior detection performance, outperforming competitive baselines by

*Binjie Zhang,Mike Zheng Shou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A two-stage unified model for egocentric action and visual future prediction conditioned on hand trajectories, combining multimodal state modeling with a causal cross-attention Latent Diffusion Model to generate frame-by-frame futures; achieves state-of-the-art on multiple benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work either predicts actions (Vision-Language-Action) or predicts future frames (video prediction) but does not jointly model how actions shape future visuals. A unified approach is needed to enable better human-object interaction understanding and robotic planning in egocentric settings.

Method: Stage 1: Consecutive state modeling that ingests visual observations, language, and action history to explicitly forecast future hand trajectories. Stage 2: Causal cross-attention fusion of multimodal cues, using the inferred action signals to condition an image-based Latent Diffusion Model for frame-by-frame video generation.

Result: The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both action prediction and future video synthesis on Ego4D, BridgeData, and RLBench benchmarks.

Conclusion: This work presents the first unified model that handles both egocentric activity understanding and robotic manipulation tasks, providing explicit predictions of upcoming actions and their visual consequences.

Abstract: In egocentric scenarios, anticipating both the next action and its visual
outcome is essential for understanding human-object interactions and for
enabling robotic planning. However, existing paradigms fall short of jointly
modeling these aspects. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models focus on action
prediction but lack explicit modeling of how actions influence the visual
scene, while video prediction models generate future frames without
conditioning on specific actions, often resulting in implausible or
contextually inconsistent outcomes. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified
two-stage predictive framework that jointly models action and visual future in
egocentric scenarios, conditioned on hand trajectories. In the first stage, we
perform consecutive state modeling to process heterogeneous inputs (visual
observations, language, and action history) and explicitly predict future hand
trajectories. In the second stage, we introduce causal cross-attention to fuse
multi-modal cues, leveraging inferred action signals to guide an image-based
Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for frame-by-frame future video generation. Our
approach is the first unified model designed to handle both egocentric human
activity understanding and robotic manipulation tasks, providing explicit
predictions of both upcoming actions and their visual consequences. Extensive
experiments on Ego4D, BridgeData, and RLBench demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both action prediction and future
video synthesis.

TL;DR: Introduces MCMeshGAN, a multimodal conditional mesh-to-mesh GAN for 3D aneurysm growth prediction, using a dual-branch architecture (local KCN and global GCN) with a conditioning branch, trained on TAAMesh dataset; outperforms baselines in geometry and diameter estimation; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate prediction of aneurysm progression requires modeling both subtle local deformations and global anatomical changes in complex 3D geometries. Existing methods struggle with over-smoothing in deep GCNs, lack multimodal/temporal conditioning, and limited datasets.

Method: A dual-branch architecture: a local KNN-based convolutional network (KCN) to preserve fine geometric details and a global graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture long-range context; a dedicated condition branch encodes clinical attributes (age, sex) and target time interval to enable temporally controlled predictions; dataset TAAMesh of 590 longitudinal multimodal records from 208 patients; experiments comparing against state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: MCMeshGAN consistently outperforms baselines in geometric accuracy and clinically important diameter estimation on TAAMesh; demonstrates both retrospective and prospective modeling capabilities; code for MCMeshGAN and baselines released at GitHub.

Conclusion: The framework offers a robust step toward clinically deployable, personalized 3D disease trajectory modeling for aneurysm progression, highlighting the feasibility of combining local geometric detail with global context in a multimodal, temporally controlled generative framework.

Abstract: Personalized, accurate prediction of aortic aneurysm progression is essential
for timely intervention but remains challenging due to the need to model both
subtle local deformations and global anatomical changes within complex 3D
geometries. We propose MCMeshGAN, the first multimodal conditional mesh-to-mesh
generative adversarial network for 3D aneurysm growth prediction. MCMeshGAN
introduces a dual-branch architecture combining a novel local KNN-based
convolutional network (KCN) to preserve fine-grained geometric details and a
global graph convolutional network (GCN) to capture long-range structural
context, overcoming the over-smoothing limitations of deep GCNs. A dedicated
condition branch encodes clinical attributes (age, sex) and the target time
interval to generate anatomically plausible, temporally controlled predictions,
enabling retrospective and prospective modeling. We curated TAAMesh, a new
longitudinal thoracic aortic aneurysm mesh dataset consisting of 590 multimodal
records (CT scans, 3D meshes, and clinical data) from 208 patients. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MCMeshGAN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both geometric accuracy and clinically important
diameter estimation. This framework offers a robust step toward clinically
deployable, personalized 3D disease trajectory modeling. The source code for
MCMeshGAN and the baseline methods is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Presents ProtoScale SSL that progressively builds structured, multi-scale visual representations by combining semantic grouping, instance separation, and hierarchy, preserving full scene context; improves dense-object detection and outperforms SOTA with limited labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSL excels at global representations but struggles to capture scene structure; dense vision tasks require multi-scale, object-centric representations; need to preserve context across augmentations instead of aggressive cropping.

Method: Introduce ProtoScale module; integrates semantic grouping, instance-level separation, and hierarchical structuring; captures elements across multiple spatial scales; preserves full scene context across augmented views; contrasts with DINO-like cropping.

Result: Validated on object detection using combined COCO/UA-DETRAC subset; learns object-centric representations; improves supervised detector performance; outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially with limited annotations and fewer fine-tuning epochs.

Conclusion: ProtoScale SSL advances structured scene representation, enabling better dense prediction and data-efficient object detection; future work could explore broader tasks or generalization.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful technique for
learning visual representations. While recent SSL approaches achieve strong
results in global image understanding, they are limited in capturing the
structured representation in scenes. In this work, we propose a self-supervised
approach that progressively builds structured visual representations by
combining semantic grouping, instance level separation, and hierarchical
structuring. Our approach, based on a novel ProtoScale module, captures visual
elements across multiple spatial scales. Unlike common strategies like DINO
that rely on random cropping and global embeddings, we preserve full scene
context across augmented views to improve performance in dense prediction
tasks. We validate our method on downstream object detection tasks using a
combined subset of multiple datasets (COCO and UA-DETRAC). Experimental results
show that our method learns object centric representations that enhance
supervised object detection and outperform the state-of-the-art methods, even
when trained with limited annotated data and fewer fine-tuning epochs.

*François G. Landry,Moulay A. Akhloufi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrajFusionNet is a transformer-based model that fuses future pedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed priors to predict pedestrian crossing intention, using two branches (SAM and VAM) for sequential and visual features; it achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on three datasets with the lowest inference time among SOTA methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve pedestrian crossing intention prediction for autonomous driving by leveraging predictive priors (pedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed) and efficient multimodal representations to achieve accurate and fast inference on public-road scenarios.

Method: A dual-branch transformer architecture: Sequence Attention Module (SAM) processes observed+predicted pedestrian trajectories and vehicle speed as a temporal sequence; Visual Attention Module (VAM) overlays predicted pedestrian bounding boxes on scene images to extract visual cues; lightweight modalities are used to reduce inference time; outputs are fused for crossing prediction.

Result: TrajFusionNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on three common pedestrian crossing datasets and has the lowest total inference time (model runtime plus preprocessing) among contemporary approaches.

Conclusion: Integrating trajectory and speed priors with visual cues in a two-branch transformer framework enables accurate and efficient crossing intention prediction, highlighting the value of combining predictive priors with visual representations in safety-critical autonomous-driving tasks.

Abstract: With the introduction of vehicles with autonomous capabilities on public
roads, predicting pedestrian crossing intention has emerged as an active area
of research. The task of predicting pedestrian crossing intention involves
determining whether pedestrians in the scene are likely to cross the road or
not. In this work, we propose TrajFusionNet, a novel transformer-based model
that combines future pedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed predictions as
priors for predicting crossing intention. TrajFusionNet comprises two branches:
a Sequence Attention Module (SAM) and a Visual Attention Module (VAM). The SAM
branch learns from a sequential representation of the observed and predicted
pedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed. Complementarily, the VAM branch
enables learning from a visual representation of the predicted pedestrian
trajectory by overlaying predicted pedestrian bounding boxes onto scene images.
By utilizing a small number of lightweight modalities, TrajFusionNet achieves
the lowest total inference time (including model runtime and data
preprocessing) among current state-of-the-art approaches. In terms of

*Hui Zhang,Jianghui Cai,Haifeng Yang,Ali Luo,Yuqing Yang,Xiao Kong,Zhichao Ding,Lichan Zhou,Qin Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes SMI, a mutual-information based sky background estimation framework for fiber spectra using two networks and incremental training to separate common and individual sky components, showing improved sky subtraction, especially in the blue, on LAMOST data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current sky subtraction based on averaging sky fiber spectra (Super Sky) does not capture spatial/environmental variations around science objects, leading to imperfect sky background modeling.

Method: A two-network architecture: (1) a wavelength-calibration module to extract stable sky features and align them to emission positions, addressing feature-shift issues; (2) an incremental-training network that maximizes mutual information (MI) between representations across different spectra to capture shared sky components, then minimizes MI between neighboring spectra representations to isolate individual sky components, resulting in an estimated sky background at each object location using spectra from all fibers.

Result: Experimental validation on LAMOST spectra shows SMI produces a more accurate sky background estimate during observations, with notable improvement in the blue end of the spectrum.

Conclusion: SMI demonstrates that mutual-information-based, incrementally trained networks can model and subtract sky background more accurately by leveraging information across all fibers, reducing residuals and capturing spatial variation, especially at blue wavelengths.

Abstract: Sky background subtraction is a critical step in Multi-objective Fiber
spectra process. However, current subtraction relies mainly on sky fiber
spectra to build Super Sky. These average spectra are lacking in the modeling
of the environment surrounding the objects. To address this issue, a sky
background estimation model: Sky background building based on Mutual
Information (SMI) is proposed. SMI based on mutual information and incremental
training approach. It utilizes spectra from all fibers in the plate to estimate
the sky background. SMI contains two main networks, the first network applies a
wavelength calibration module to extract sky features from spectra, and can
effectively solve the feature shift problem according to the corresponding
emission position. The second network employs an incremental training approach
to maximize mutual information between representations of different spectra to
capturing the common component. Then, it minimizes the mutual information
between adjoining spectra representations to obtain individual components. This
network yields an individual sky background at each location of the object. To
verify the effectiveness of the method in this paper, we conducted experiments
on the spectra of LAMOST. Results show that SMI can obtain a better object sky
background during the observation, especially in the blue end.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: The MARIO challenge explored progression monitoring of exudative AMD using OCT. Task 1 used a fusion CNN with ensembling to classify evolution between two 2D slices from consecutive OCTs; Task 2 used a Patch Progression Masked Autoencoder to generate the next-exam OCT and then classify evolution against the current OCT. The approach achieved Top 10 placements in both tasks, with some team members affiliated with the organizers, affecting prize eligibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve personalized AMD management by enabling timely diagnosis and continuous monitoring of neovascular activity in OCT scans to inform treatment decisions.

Method: Task 1: fusion CNN network with model ensembling to classify evolution between two consecutive OCT slices. Task 2: Patch Progression Masked Autoencoder that generates the OCT for the next exam and then compares the current OCT to the generated one using the Task 1 solution to classify evolution.

Result: Top 10 placements in both tasks.

Conclusion: The methods demonstrated competitive performance and feasibility of using learned representations and generative progression modeling for OCT-based AMD progression assessment. However, organizational ties to the challenge organizers may affect prize eligibility and potential bias; further independent validation is recommended.

Abstract: Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a prevalent eye condition affecting
visual acuity. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatments
have been effective in slowing the progression of neovascular AMD, with better
outcomes achieved through timely diagnosis and consistent monitoring. Tracking
the progression of neovascular activity in OCT scans of patients with exudative
AMD allows for the development of more personalized and effective treatment
plans. This was the focus of the Monitoring Age-related Macular Degeneration
Progression in Optical Coherence Tomography (MARIO) challenge, in which we
participated. In Task 1, which involved classifying the evolution between two
pairs of 2D slices from consecutive OCT acquisitions, we employed a fusion CNN
network with model ensembling to further enhance the model's performance. For
Task 2, which focused on predicting progression over the next three months
based on current exam data, we proposed the Patch Progression Masked
Autoencoder that generates an OCT for the next exam and then classifies the
evolution between the current OCT and the one generated using our solution from
Task 1. The results we achieved allowed us to place in the Top 10 for both
tasks. Some team members are part of the same organization as the challenge
organizers; therefore, we are not eligible to compete for the prize.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces PersonaAnimator for video-to-video motion personalization, learning personalized motion patterns from unconstrained videos, supported by PersonaVid dataset and a physics-aware regularization, achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing pose-guided motion transfer methods produce inexpressive results by simply replicating motion. Motion style transfer relies on mocap data, which is hard to obtain, and generated motions can violate physical laws. A method is needed to learn personalized, physically plausible motion directly from unconstrained videos.

Method: Proposes PersonaAnimator, a framework that learns personalized motion patterns from unconstrained videos for video-to-video motion personalization. Introduces PersonaVid, the first video-based personalized motion dataset with 20 motion content categories and 120 motion style categories. Applies Physics-aware Motion Style Regularization to enforce physical plausibility in generated motions.

Result: Extensive experiments show PersonaAnimator outperforms state-of-the-art motion transfer methods and sets a new benchmark for Video-to-Video Motion Personalization.

Conclusion: The work defines a new task and dataset for personalized motion, demonstrates that physical plausibility can be integrated into motion personalization, and establishes superior performance over existing approaches while enabling personalized motion transfer from unconstrained videos.

Abstract: Recent advances in motion generation show remarkable progress. However,
several limitations remain: (1) Existing pose-guided character motion transfer
methods merely replicate motion without learning its style characteristics,
resulting in inexpressive characters. (2) Motion style transfer methods rely
heavily on motion capture data, which is difficult to obtain. (3) Generated
motions sometimes violate physical laws. To address these challenges, this
paper pioneers a new task: Video-to-Video Motion Personalization. We propose a
novel framework, PersonaAnimator, which learns personalized motion patterns
directly from unconstrained videos. This enables personalized motion transfer.
To support this task, we introduce PersonaVid, the first video-based
personalized motion dataset. It contains 20 motion content categories and 120
motion style categories. We further propose a Physics-aware Motion Style
Regularization mechanism to enforce physical plausibility in the generated
motions. Extensive experiments show that PersonaAnimator outperforms
state-of-the-art motion transfer methods and sets a new benchmark for the
Video-to-Video Motion Personalization task.

### [76] [CODA: Coordinating the Cerebrum and Cerebellum for a Dual-Brain Computer Use Agent with Decoupled Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20096)
*Zeyi Sun,Yuhang Cao,Jianze Liang,Qiushi Sun,Ziyu Liu,Zhixiong Zhang,Yuhang Zang,Xiaoyi Dong,Kai Chen,Dahua Lin,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A trainable compositional framework CODA combines a generalist planner (Cerebrum) with a specialist executor (Cerebellum) in a two-stage Specialization-Generalization pipeline to tackle long-horizon GUI tasks in scientific domains, achieving state-of-the-art results among open-source models on ScienceBoard tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous GUI agents falter in specialized domains due to a planning-execution trade-off and data scarcity; existing static compositional approaches are non-trainable, limiting adaptation. CODA aims to provide a trainable bridge between planning and execution that learns from limited data while generalizing across domains.

Method: CODA integrates Cerebrum planner with Cerebellum executor. Two-stage training: Specialization uses a decoupled GRPO to train expert planners per application from a small set of task trajectories; Generalization aggregates successful trajectories from specialists into a consolidated dataset for supervised fine-tuning of the final planner, yielding a robust, cross-domain capable system.

Result: On four tasks from the ScienceBoard benchmark, CODA outperforms baselines and achieves a new state-of-the-art among open-source models.

Conclusion: CODA demonstrates a trainable, cross-domain capable compositional framework that unites generalist planning with specialist execution, enabling robust long-horizon GUI tasks in data-scarce scientific domains.

Abstract: Autonomous agents for Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) face significant
challenges in specialized domains such as scientific computing, where both
long-horizon planning and precise execution are required. Existing approaches
suffer from a trade-off: generalist agents excel at planning but perform poorly
in execution, while specialized agents demonstrate the opposite weakness.
Recent compositional frameworks attempt to bridge this gap by combining a
planner and an actor, but they are typically static and non-trainable, which
prevents adaptation from experience. This is a critical limitation given the
scarcity of high-quality data in scientific domains. To address these
limitations, we introduce CODA, a novel and trainable compositional framework
that integrates a generalist planner (Cerebrum) with a specialist executor
(Cerebellum), trained via a dedicated two-stage pipeline. In the first stage,
Specialization, we apply a decoupled GRPO approach to train an expert planner
for each scientific application individually, bootstrapping from a small set of
task trajectories. In the second stage, Generalization, we aggregate all
successful trajectories from the specialized experts to build a consolidated
dataset, which is then used for supervised fine-tuning of the final planner.
This equips CODA with both robust execution and cross-domain generalization.
Evaluated on four challenging applications from the ScienceBoard benchmark,
CODA significantly outperforms baselines and establishes a new state of the art
among open-source models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HSI shows potential for automotive perception but commercialization lags: few cameras meet automotive requirements and none meet AEC-Q100; datasets are currently limited, hindering robust perception algorithm development and validation; significant research directions needed for practical ADAS/AD integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess the readiness of hyperspectral imaging for automotive applications by surveying existing hardware and datasets, identifying gaps between research potential and commercial viability, and guiding future research toward practical deployment.

Method: Qualitative literature review of HSI for automotive use and a benchmarking analysis of 216 commercially available HSI and multispectral cameras, evaluated against automotive criteria: frame rate, spatial resolution, spectral dimensionality, and AEC-Q100 temperature standard compliance.

Result: Only four cameras meet defined automotive performance thresholds; none comply with AEC-Q100; current HSI datasets are limited in scale, spectral consistency, channel count, and environmental diversity; overall state of HSI in automotive contexts as of 2025 is still immature for broad ADAS/AD deployment.

Conclusion: There is a clear gap between HSI research and practical automotive deployment. Addressing hardware readiness (autocare-grade performance and reliability) and developing richer, more diverse datasets are essential to progress toward reliable spectral perception in ADAS/AD systems.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) offers a transformative sensing modality for
Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving (AD)
applications, enabling material-level scene understanding through fine spectral
resolution beyond the capabilities of traditional RGB imaging. This paper
presents the first comprehensive review of HSI for automotive applications,
examining the strengths, limitations, and suitability of current HSI
technologies in the context of ADAS/AD. In addition to this qualitative review,
we analyze 216 commercially available HSI and multispectral imaging cameras,
benchmarking them against key automotive criteria: frame rate, spatial
resolution, spectral dimensionality, and compliance with AEC-Q100 temperature
standards. Our analysis reveals a significant gap between HSI's demonstrated
research potential and its commercial readiness. Only four cameras meet the
defined performance thresholds, and none comply with AEC-Q100 requirements. In
addition, the paper reviews recent HSI datasets and applications, including
semantic segmentation for road surface classification, pedestrian separability,
and adverse weather perception. Our review shows that current HSI datasets are
limited in terms of scale, spectral consistency, the number of spectral
channels, and environmental diversity, posing challenges for the development of
perception algorithms and the adequate validation of HSI's true potential in
ADAS/AD applications. This review paper establishes the current state of HSI in
automotive contexts as of 2025 and outlines key research directions toward
practical integration of spectral imaging in ADAS and autonomous systems.

*Moussa Kassem Sbeyti,Nadja Klein,Michelle Karg,Christian Wirth,Sahin Albayrak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OSS is a detector-agnostic similarity-based metric to evaluate and guide active learning for object detection without retraining detectors, enabling early pruning of ineffective methods and robust validation-set selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active learning for real-world object detection is computationally expensive and method rankings vary across validation sets, reducing reliability in safety-critical deployments.

Method: OSS measures similarity between training sets and target domains using object-level features from labeled crops, allowing pruning of ineffective AL methods before training and selection of representative validation sets. It is evaluated on KITTI, BDD100K, CODA with uncertainty-based AL methods and two detectors (EfficientDet, YOLOv3).

Result: OSS can quantify AL method effectiveness without detector training, enabling elimination of weak methods and more robust evaluation; code is available.

Conclusion: OSS unifies AL training and evaluation strategies in object detection around object similarity; detector-agnostic, requires only labeled object crops, and integrates with existing AL pipelines for practical deployment.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) for real-world object detection faces computational and
reliability challenges that limit practical deployment. Developing new AL
methods requires training multiple detectors across iterations to compare
against existing approaches. This creates high costs for autonomous driving
datasets where the training of one detector requires up to 282 GPU hours.
Additionally, AL method rankings vary substantially across validation sets,
compromising reliability in safety-critical transportation systems. We
introduce object-based set similarity ($\mathrm{OSS}$), a metric that addresses
these challenges. $\mathrm{OSS}$ (1) quantifies AL method effectiveness without
requiring detector training by measuring similarity between training sets and
target domains using object-level features. This enables the elimination of
ineffective AL methods before training. Furthermore, $\mathrm{OSS}$ (2) enables
the selection of representative validation sets for robust evaluation. We
validate our similarity-based approach on three autonomous driving datasets
(KITTI, BDD100K, CODA) using uncertainty-based AL methods as a case study with
two detector architectures (EfficientDet, YOLOv3). This work is the first to
unify AL training and evaluation strategies in object detection based on object
similarity. $\mathrm{OSS}$ is detector-agnostic, requires only labeled object
crops, and integrates with existing AL pipelines. This provides a practical
framework for deploying AL in real-world applications where computational
efficiency and evaluation reliability are critical. Code is available at

*Lechun You,Zhonghua Wu,Weide Liu,Xulei Yang,Jun Cheng,Wei Zhou,Bharadwaj Veeravalli,Guosheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A weakly supervised 3D segmentation approach that leverages 2D foundation-model masks and cross-modal geometry to expand sparse 3D annotations and improve performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D point clouds are hard to annotate, and existing 3D-only methods underutilize complementary 2D data. Noise and limited utility of pseudo labels hinder weakly supervised training. 2D foundation models offer strong segmentation capabilities that can be transferred to 3D if cross-modal correspondences are established.

Method: Generate segmentation masks with 2D foundation models for 2D views; establish geometric correspondences between the 3D scene and 2D views; propagate the 2D masks into 3D to augment sparse 3D labels; apply confidence- and uncertainty-based consistency regularization on augmented 3D data and select reliable pseudo labels; spread the reliable labels over 3D masks to create more training labels.

Result: The method is claimed to significantly improve 3D weakly supervised segmentation by expanding the label pool through cross-modal masking and robust pseudo-label selection.

Conclusion: Bridges the gap between limited 3D annotations and powerful 2D foundation models, demonstrating effective cross-modal augmentation to enhance 3D segmentation performance.

Abstract: Current methods for 3D semantic segmentation propose training models with
limited annotations to address the difficulty of annotating large, irregular,
and unordered 3D point cloud data. They usually focus on the 3D domain only,
without leveraging the complementary nature of 2D and 3D data. Besides, some
methods extend original labels or generate pseudo labels to guide the training,
but they often fail to fully use these labels or address the noise within them.
Meanwhile, the emergence of comprehensive and adaptable foundation models has
offered effective solutions for segmenting 2D data. Leveraging this
advancement, we present a novel approach that maximizes the utility of sparsely
available 3D annotations by incorporating segmentation masks generated by 2D
foundation models. We further propagate the 2D segmentation masks into the 3D
space by establishing geometric correspondences between 3D scenes and 2D views.
We extend the highly sparse annotations to encompass the areas delineated by 3D
masks, thereby substantially augmenting the pool of available labels.
Furthermore, we apply confidence- and uncertainty-based consistency
regularization on augmentations of the 3D point cloud and select the reliable
pseudo labels, which are further spread on the 3D masks to generate more
labels. This innovative strategy bridges the gap between limited 3D annotations
and the powerful capabilities of 2D foundation models, ultimately improving the
performance of 3D weakly supervised segmentation.

TL;DR: KRETA is a Korean text-rich VQA benchmark for reading and reasoning across diverse visuals, with a semi-automated data-generation pipeline and a seven-metric quality protocol.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a critical gap in robust evaluation benchmarks for text-rich VQA in Korean (a low-resource language), hindering reliable assessment and cross-lingual progress; KRETA aims to enable thorough evaluation across diverse contexts and support multilingual VLM research.

Method: Introduce KRETA with 15 domains and 26 image types; develop a semi-automated VQA generation pipeline optimized for text-rich contexts using refined stepwise image decomposition; employ a seven-metric evaluation protocol to ensure data quality.

Result: Provides a practical benchmark and generation pipeline; open-source code and dataset released (GitHub) to enable evaluation and extension to other languages.

Conclusion: KRETA's adaptable and extensible pipeline can facilitate the creation of similar benchmarks in other languages, accelerating multilingual VLM research.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over text within visual contexts poses a
significant challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs), given the complexity
and diversity of real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, text-rich
Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets and benchmarks have emerged for
high-resource languages like English. However, a critical gap persists for
low-resource languages such as Korean, where the lack of comprehensive
benchmarks hinders robust model evaluation and comparison. To bridge this gap,
we introduce KRETA, a benchmark for Korean Reading and rEasoning in Text-rich
VQA Attuned to diverse visual contexts. KRETA facilitates an in-depth
evaluation of both visual text understanding and reasoning capabilities, while
also supporting a multifaceted assessment across 15 domains and 26 image types.
Additionally, we introduce a semi-automated VQA generation pipeline
specifically optimized for text-rich settings, leveraging refined stepwise
image decomposition and a rigorous seven-metric evaluation protocol to ensure
data quality. While KRETA is tailored for Korean, we hope our adaptable and
extensible pipeline will facilitate the development of similar benchmarks in
other languages, thereby accelerating multilingual VLM research. The code and
dataset for KRETA are available at https://github.com/tabtoyou/KRETA.

Motivation: Bridge classical variational segmentation (Chan-Vese) with modern deep-learning tooling, and assess a functional, energy-based loss within CNN/DL training.

Method: Derive a discretized scheme from the Chan-Vese energy and level-set PDE, provide mathematical proofs, implement in MATLAB, and introduce a PyTorch loss module based on the Chan-Vese active-contour functional. Evaluate against common segmentation datasets and compare classical losses with the proposed method.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive study and analysis of the Chan-Vese
algorithm for image segmentation. We employ a discretized scheme derived from
the empirical study of the Chan-Vese model's functional energy and its partial
differential equation based on its level set function. We provide a proof of
the results and an implementation using MATLAB. Leveraging modern computer
vision methodologies, we propose a functional segmentation loss based on active

*Oliver Grainge,Sania Waheed,Jack Stilgoe,Michael Milford,Shoaib Ehsan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs can geolocate images with varying success; poor on generic street scenes but around 61% accuracy on social-media-like images, raising privacy concerns; call for systematic evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Growing use of Vision-Language Models for image understanding raises privacy risks via geo-localization capabilities; there is a need to quantify precision, limits, and potential for unintended inferences across diverse datasets.

Method: Empirical study evaluating 25 state-of-the-art VLMs on four benchmark image datasets from diverse environments, assessing geo-localization accuracy and analyzing internal reasoning, strengths, limitations, and societal risks.

Result: Poor performance on generic street-level images; notably high accuracy (61%) on images resembling social media content; results imply significant privacy risks if social-media-like data are geo-localizable.

Conclusion: Current VLM geolocation capabilities pose privacy concerns; systematic evaluation is crucial to understand risks, guide responsible deployment, and spur the development of privacy-aware mechanisms; paper highlights varying strengths and limitations across contexts.

Abstract: Geo-localization is the task of identifying the location of an image using
visual cues alone. It has beneficial applications, such as improving disaster
response, enhancing navigation, and geography education. Recently,
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly demonstrating capabilities as
accurate image geo-locators. This brings significant privacy risks, including
those related to stalking and surveillance, considering the widespread uses of
AI models and sharing of photos on social media. The precision of these models
is likely to improve in the future. Despite these risks, there is little work
on systematically evaluating the geolocation precision of Generative VLMs,
their limits and potential for unintended inferences. To bridge this gap, we
conduct a comprehensive assessment of the geolocation capabilities of 25
state-of-the-art VLMs on four benchmark image datasets captured in diverse
environments. Our results offer insight into the internal reasoning of VLMs and
highlight their strengths, limitations, and potential societal risks. Our
findings indicate that current VLMs perform poorly on generic street-level
images yet achieve notably high accuracy (61\%) on images resembling social
media content, raising significant and urgent privacy concerns.

### [83] [GS: Generative Segmentation via Label Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20020)
*Yuhao Chen,Shubin Chen,Liang Lin,Guangrun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Generative Segmentation (GS) reframes language-driven segmentation as a label-diffusion task that directly generates segmentation masks from noise, conditioned on image + text, achieving SOTA on PNG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current diffusion-based segmentation methods are image-centric and treat segmentation as an auxiliary or indirect problem; there is a need for end-to-end generative modeling of label maps to improve spatial and semantic fidelity.

Method: GS reverses the diffusion process to generate segmentation masks from noise, conditioned on the input image and language; end-to-end training with explicit control over spatial/semantic fidelity.

Result: GS significantly outperforms existing discriminative and diffusion-based methods on Panoptic Narrative Grounding, establishing new state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: Framing segmentation as a generative, label-diffusion task yields better alignment with language and image, enabling more precise and controllable segmentation; potential for broader multimodal tasks.

Abstract: Language-driven image segmentation is a fundamental task in vision-language
understanding, requiring models to segment regions of an image corresponding to
natural language expressions. Traditional methods approach this as a
discriminative problem, assigning each pixel to foreground or background based
on semantic alignment. Recently, diffusion models have been introduced to this
domain, but existing approaches remain image-centric: they either (i) use image
diffusion models as visual feature extractors, (ii) synthesize segmentation
data via image generation to train discriminative models, or (iii) perform
diffusion inversion to extract attention cues from pre-trained image diffusion
models-thereby treating segmentation as an auxiliary process. In this paper, we
propose GS (Generative Segmentation), a novel framework that formulates
segmentation itself as a generative task via label diffusion. Instead of
generating images conditioned on label maps and text, GS reverses the
generative process: it directly generates segmentation masks from noise,
conditioned on both the input image and the accompanying language description.
This paradigm makes label generation the primary modeling target, enabling
end-to-end training with explicit control over spatial and semantic fidelity.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate GS on Panoptic
Narrative Grounding (PNG), a representative and challenging benchmark for
multimodal segmentation that requires panoptic-level reasoning guided by
narrative captions. Experimental results show that GS significantly outperforms
existing discriminative and diffusion-based methods, setting a new
state-of-the-art for language-driven segmentation.

### [84] [Segmentation Assisted Incremental Test Time Adaptation in an Open World](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20029)
*Manogna Sreenivas,Soma Biswas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A new framework for Incremental Test Time Adaptation (ITTA) of Vision-Language Models that handles unseen classes and domains at test time by combining ITTA with active labeling. It introduces SegAssist, a training-free, segmentation-driven module that refines sample selection for labeling to identify unseen classes, and demonstrates improved adaptation on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic environments produce covariate and label shifts, including unseen classes, during testing. Traditional Test Time Adaptation assumes a fixed class set; there is a need for models that adapt continually as new domains and classes emerge.

Method: Propose SegAssist, a segmentation-assisted active labeling module that is training-free and leverages the segmentation capabilities of Vision-Language Models to guide active sample selection toward potential unseen-class samples. The framework integrates single-image test-time adaptation methods for VLMs with active labeling that queries an oracle for samples likely representing unseen classes, and establishes a new ITTA benchmark.

Result: Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets show that SegAssist can enhance the performance of Vision-Language Models in real-world scenarios where continuous adaptation to new data is essential.

Conclusion: SegAssist provides a practical, training-free approach to incremental ITTA for VLMs, enabling simultaneous adaptation to covariate and label shifts by actively sampling and labeling potentially unseen classes; results indicate promising improvements across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: In dynamic environments, unfamiliar objects and distribution shifts are often
encountered, which challenge the generalization abilities of the deployed
trained models. This work addresses Incremental Test Time Adaptation of Vision
Language Models, tackling scenarios where unseen classes and unseen domains
continuously appear during testing. Unlike traditional Test Time Adaptation
approaches, where the test stream comes only from a predefined set of classes,
our framework allows models to adapt simultaneously to both covariate and label
shifts, actively incorporating new classes as they emerge. Towards this goal,
we establish a new benchmark for ITTA, integrating single image TTA methods for
VLMs with active labeling techniques that query an oracle for samples
potentially representing unseen classes during test time. We propose a
segmentation assisted active labeling module, termed SegAssist, which is
training free and repurposes the segmentation capabilities of VLMs to refine
active sample selection, prioritizing samples likely to belong to unseen
classes. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the
potential of SegAssist to enhance the performance of VLMs in real world
scenarios, where continuous adaptation to emerging data is essential.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OpenM3D is a fast, single-stage open-vocabulary indoor 3D detector trained without human 3D labels, using 2D-induced voxel features, 3D pseudo boxes, and CLIP-based voxel-semantic alignment to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and speed on ScanNet200/ARKitScenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between image-based OV 3D detection and the superior but annotation-heavy 3D point-cloud methods by enabling training without human-annotated 3D boxes, leveraging multi-view data and CLIP semantics.

Method: A single-stage detector that adapts 2D-induced voxel features from ImGeoNet. It uses a class-agnostic 3D localization loss with high-quality 3D pseudo boxes and a voxel-semantic alignment loss using diverse pre-trained CLIP features. 3D pseudo boxes are generated via a graph-embedding method that fuses 2D segments into coherent 3D structures. CLIP features are sampled from 2D segments linked to each 3D structure to align with voxel features. Inference requires only multi-view images.

Result: 3D pseudo boxes achieve higher precision/recall than OV-3DET. OpenM3D achieves superior accuracy and speed (0.3 sec per scene) on ScanNet200 and ARKitScenes, outperforming existing methods, including a strong two-stage baseline that combines a ViT-CLIP OV classifier and a multi-view depth estimator.

Conclusion: OpenM3D demonstrates the viability of open-vocabulary multi-view indoor 3D detection without manual annotations, delivering fast, accurate detection and highlighting the effectiveness of 3D pseudo boxes and CLIP-based semantic alignment in a single-stage framework.

Abstract: Open-vocabulary (OV) 3D object detection is an emerging field, yet its
exploration through image-based methods remains limited compared to 3D point
cloud-based methods. We introduce OpenM3D, a novel open-vocabulary multi-view
indoor 3D object detector trained without human annotations. In particular,
OpenM3D is a single-stage detector adapting the 2D-induced voxel features from
the ImGeoNet model. To support OV, it is jointly trained with a class-agnostic
3D localization loss requiring high-quality 3D pseudo boxes and a
voxel-semantic alignment loss requiring diverse pre-trained CLIP features. We
follow the training setting of OV-3DET where posed RGB-D images are given but
no human annotations of 3D boxes or classes are available. We propose a 3D
Pseudo Box Generation method using a graph embedding technique that combines 2D
segments into coherent 3D structures. Our pseudo-boxes achieve higher precision
and recall than other methods, including the method proposed in OV-3DET. We
further sample diverse CLIP features from 2D segments associated with each
coherent 3D structure to align with the corresponding voxel feature. The key to
training a highly accurate single-stage detector requires both losses to be
learned toward high-quality targets. At inference, OpenM3D, a highly efficient
detector, requires only multi-view images for input and demonstrates superior
accuracy and speed (0.3 sec. per scene) on ScanNet200 and ARKitScenes indoor
benchmarks compared to existing methods. We outperform a strong two-stage
method that leverages our class-agnostic detector with a ViT CLIP-based OV
classifier and a baseline incorporating multi-view depth estimator on both
accuracy and speed.

### [86] [PAUL: Uncertainty-Guided Partition and Augmentation for Robust Cross-View Geo-Localization under Noisy Correspondence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20066)
*Zheng Li,Yanming Guo,WenZhe Liu,Xueyi Zhang,Zhaoyun Ding,Long Xu,Mingrui Lao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PAUL: Partition and Augmentation by Uncertainty Learning for robust cross-view geo-localization under noisy correspondences; splits data by uncertainty and uses uncertainty-aware augmentation to suppress misaligned pairs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noisy correspondences from GPS drift and urban effects degrade cross-view matching; current methods assume accurate alignment; need robust learning under partial correspondences.

Method: PAUL framework: partition training data based on estimated uncertainty; perform uncertainty-aware co-augmentation and evidential co-training; selectively augment high-confidence regions; use both data uncertainty and loss discrepancy to guide partitioning; distinguishes from simple filtering or label correction.

Result: Empirical results show superior performance to competitors across varying noise ratios; each component contributes to robustness against noisy correspondences; demonstrates effective learning with uncertain labels.

Conclusion: PAUL provides robust supervision for noisy samples in cross-view geo-localization, narrowing the gap between ideal benchmarks and real-world noisy data; future work could explore broader uncertainty modeling and application to other multi-modal alignment tasks.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization is a critical task for UAV navigation, event
detection, and aerial surveying, as it enables matching between drone-captured
and satellite imagery. Most existing approaches embed multi-modal data into a
joint feature space to maximize the similarity of paired images. However, these
methods typically assume perfect alignment of image pairs during training,
which rarely holds true in real-world scenarios. In practice, factors such as
urban canyon effects, electromagnetic interference, and adverse weather
frequently induce GPS drift, resulting in systematic alignment shifts where
only partial correspondences exist between pairs. Despite its prevalence, this
source of noisy correspondence has received limited attention in current
research. In this paper, we formally introduce and address the Noisy
Correspondence on Cross-View Geo-Localization (NC-CVGL) problem, aiming to
bridge the gap between idealized benchmarks and practical applications. To this
end, we propose PAUL (Partition and Augmentation by Uncertainty Learning), a
novel framework that partitions and augments training data based on estimated
data uncertainty through uncertainty-aware co-augmentation and evidential
co-training. Specifically, PAUL selectively augments regions with high
correspondence confidence and utilizes uncertainty estimation to refine feature
learning, effectively suppressing noise from misaligned pairs. Distinct from
traditional filtering or label correction, PAUL leverages both data uncertainty
and loss discrepancy for targeted partitioning and augmentation, thus providing
robust supervision for noisy samples. Comprehensive experiments validate the
effectiveness of individual components in PAUL,which consistently achieves
superior performance over other competitive noisy-correspondence-driven methods
in various noise ratios.

*Changha Shin,Woong Oh Cho,Seon Joo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A calibration-aware 3D Gaussian splatting pipeline for dual-fisheye 360° rendering that models lens gaps and angular distortions and jointly optimizes Gaussian and calibration parameters to produce seamless novel views from imperfect inputs, outperforming existing methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 360° visual content is increasingly common, but consumer dual-fisheye cameras introduce persistent artefacts due to lens separation and angular distortion, hindering high-quality panorama rendering.

Method: Extend the 3D Gaussian splatting framework with a dual-fisheye camera model that simulates realistic artifacts. Jointly optimize 3D Gaussian parameters and calibration variables representing lens gaps and angular distortions to produce seamless 360° renderings from imperfect inputs.

Result: Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show seamless renderings from imperfect dual-fisheye inputs and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing 360° rendering models.

Conclusion: The proposed calibration-integrated framework can transform imperfect omnidirectional inputs into high-quality novel view synthesis for 360° content.

Abstract: 360-degree visual content is widely shared on platforms such as YouTube and
plays a central role in virtual reality, robotics, and autonomous navigation.
However, consumer-grade dual-fisheye systems consistently yield imperfect
panoramas due to inherent lens separation and angular distortions. In this
work, we introduce a novel calibration framework that incorporates a
dual-fisheye camera model into the 3D Gaussian splatting pipeline. Our approach
not only simulates the realistic visual artifacts produced by dual-fisheye
cameras but also enables the synthesis of seamlessly rendered 360-degree
images. By jointly optimizing 3D Gaussian parameters alongside calibration
variables that emulate lens gaps and angular distortions, our framework
transforms imperfect omnidirectional inputs into flawless novel view synthesis.
Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets confirm that our method produces
seamless renderings-even from imperfect images-and outperforms existing
360-degree rendering models.

### [88] [AudioStory: Generating Long-Form Narrative Audio with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20088)
*Yuxin Guo,Teng Wang,Yuying Ge,Shijie Ma,Yixiao Ge,Wei Zou,Ying Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AudioStory presents a unified LLM-assisted framework for long-form text-to-audio generation, addressing temporal coherence and narrative structure through a decoupled bridging mechanism and end-to-end training, and introduces AudioStory-10K benchmark with strong empirical gains over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current TTA systems excel at short audio clips but struggle with long-form narratives that require temporal coherence, scene transitions, and consistent emotional tone; a unified approach leveraging LLMs can plan and guide audio generation across extended timelines.

Method: Use large language models to decompose complex narrative prompts into temporally ordered sub-tasks with contextual cues. Introduce a decoupled bridging mechanism (bridging query for intra-event alignment and residual query for cross-event coherence). Train end-to-end to unify instruction understanding with audio generation, removing modular pipelines.

Result: AudioStory achieves superior performance on both single-audio generation and narrative audio generation, surpassing prior TTA baselines in instruction-following capability and audio fidelity. A benchmark AudioStory-10K is established across domains like animated soundscapes and natural narratives; code is released.

Conclusion: A novel, end-to-end framework that couples LLMs with diffusion-based TTA for coherent long-form narratives; the bridging mechanism effectively preserves intra- and cross-event coherence, and the end-to-end training enhances overall performance and usability.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-audio (TTA) generation excel at synthesizing short
audio clips but struggle with long-form narrative audio, which requires
temporal coherence and compositional reasoning. To address this gap, we propose
AudioStory, a unified framework that integrates large language models (LLMs)
with TTA systems to generate structured, long-form audio narratives. AudioStory
possesses strong instruction-following reasoning generation capabilities. It
employs LLMs to decompose complex narrative queries into temporally ordered
sub-tasks with contextual cues, enabling coherent scene transitions and
emotional tone consistency. AudioStory has two appealing features: (1)
Decoupled bridging mechanism: AudioStory disentangles LLM-diffuser
collaboration into two specialized components, i.e., a bridging query for
intra-event semantic alignment and a residual query for cross-event coherence
preservation. (2) End-to-end training: By unifying instruction comprehension
and audio generation within a single end-to-end framework, AudioStory
eliminates the need for modular training pipelines while enhancing synergy
between components. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark AudioStory-10K,
encompassing diverse domains such as animated soundscapes and natural sound
narratives. Extensive experiments show the superiority of AudioStory on both
single-audio generation and narrative audio generation, surpassing prior TTA
baselines in both instruction-following ability and audio fidelity. Our code is
available at https://github.com/TencentARC/AudioStory

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A BioCLIP2-guided distillation approach trains a lightweight ConvNeXt-tiny using limited field labels to bridge domain gaps for fine-grained moth species classification, yielding competitive accuracy with lower compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts between curated, high-quality images and noisy field imagery hinder accurate species identification in Lepidoptera monitoring; there is a need for efficient, scalable methods to bridge this gap for insect monitoring.

Method: Use limited expert-labelled field data combined with knowledge distillation from the high-performance BioCLIP2 foundation model into a ConvNeXt-tiny classifier; evaluate on 101 Danish moth species from AMI camera systems.

Result: BioCLIP2 substantially outperforms other methods; the distilled lightweight ConvNeXt-tiny model achieves comparable accuracy to heavier baselines while significantly reducing computational cost.

Conclusion: The approach provides practical guidelines for developing efficient insect monitoring systems and effectively bridging domain gaps for fine-grained classification.

Abstract: Labelling images of Lepidoptera (moths) from automated camera systems is
vital for understanding insect declines. However, accurate species
identification is challenging due to domain shifts between curated images and
noisy field imagery. We propose a lightweight classification approach,
combining limited expert-labelled field data with knowledge distillation from
the high-performance BioCLIP2 foundation model into a ConvNeXt-tiny
architecture. Experiments on 101 Danish moth species from AMI camera systems
demonstrate that BioCLIP2 substantially outperforms other methods and that our
distilled lightweight model achieves comparable accuracy with significantly
reduced computational cost. These insights offer practical guidelines for the
development of efficient insect monitoring systems and bridging domain gaps for
fine-grained classification.

### [90] [Sycophancy as compositions of Atomic Psychometric Traits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19316)
*Shreyans Jain,Alexandra Yost,Amirali Abdullah*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Model sycophancy in LLMs as geometric and causal compositions of psychometric traits (emotionality, openness, agreeableness) using Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA); enables interpretable vector interventions to mitigate safety-critical behaviors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sycophancy is a key behavioral risk in LLMs and is often treated as a single failure mode. A compositional, psychometric-factor view promises interpretability and controllability of this behavior.

Method: Map activation directions to psychometric factors via Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA); analyze how combinations (e.g., high extraversion with low conscientiousness) may lead to sycophancy; develop vector-based interventions (addition, subtraction, projection) to mitigate such behaviors.

Result: Proposes a compositional framework linking activations to psychometric factors, enabling interpretable interventions and potential mitigation of safety-critical sycophantic behavior in LLMs.

Conclusion: A factor-based, compositional view of sycophancy provides a path toward understanding and mitigating safety-critical LLM behavior through interpretable vector operations; future work includes refining factor mappings and evaluating interventions.

Abstract: Sycophancy is a key behavioral risk in LLMs, yet is often treated as an
isolated failure mode that occurs via a single causal mechanism. We instead
propose modeling it as geometric and causal compositions of psychometric traits
such as emotionality, openness, and agreeableness - similar to factor
decomposition in psychometrics. Using Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA), we
map activation directions to these factors and study how different combinations
may give rise to sycophancy (e.g., high extraversion combined with low
conscientiousness). This perspective allows for interpretable and compositional
vector-based interventions like addition, subtraction and projection; that may
be used to mitigate safety-critical behaviors in LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Aleks is an autonomous AI multi-agent system for data-driven discovery in plant science; in a grapevine dataset it identifies meaningful features and yields interpretable, robust models; domain knowledge and memory are key for coherent results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Modern plant science relies on large, heterogeneous datasets but faces challenges in experimental design, data preprocessing, and reproducibility; an autonomous, agentic AI could accelerate scientific discovery.

Method: Aleks uses an AI-powered multi-agent architecture that integrates domain knowledge, data analysis, and machine learning within a structured framework.

Result: In a grapevine red blotch disease case study, Aleks identified biologically meaningful features and converged on interpretable models with robust performance. Ablation studies showed that domain knowledge and memory are important for coherent outcomes.

Conclusion: Agentic AI can serve as an autonomous collaborator to accelerate scientific discovery in plant sciences, offering promise for improved throughput and reproducibility.

Abstract: Modern plant science increasingly relies on large, heterogeneous datasets,

study on grapevine red blotch disease, Aleks progressively identified
biologically meaningful features and converged on interpretable models with
robust performance. Ablation studies underscored the importance of domain
knowledge and memory for coherent outcomes. This exploratory work highlights
the promise of agentic AI as an autonomous collaborator for accelerating

### [92] [Quantized but Deceptive? A Multi-Dimensional Truthfulness Evaluation of Quantized LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19432)
*Yao Fu,Xianxuan Long,Runchao Li,Haotian Yu,Mu Sheng,Xiaotian Han,Yu Yin,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Quantized LLMs preserve some internal truth representations but are more vulnerable to deception from misleading prompts; a new TruthfulnessEval framework assesses truthfulness across logical reasoning, common sense, and imitate falsehoods; results show deception prompts override truthfulness, underscoring need for quantization-aware alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically study the truthfulness of quantized LLMs, beyond standard metrics like perplexity, in order to understand and mitigate risks when deploying compressed models in resource-constrained settings.

Method: Introduce TruthfulnessEval with three dimensions (Truthfulness on Logical Reasoning, Common Sense, and Imitative Falsehoods). Evaluate mainstream quantization (4-bit to 2-bit) across multiple open-source LLMs. Use 15 rephrased variants of honest/neutral/deceptive prompts, layer-wise probing, and PCA visualizations to analyze internal representations and responses.

Result: Quantized models retain internally truthful representations yet are more prone to producing false outputs under deceptive prompts. Honest/neutral prompts yield stable outputs, while deceptive prompts can override truth-consistent behavior. Probing and PCA show models ‘know’ the truth internally but are guided by prompts to produce false outputs.

Conclusion: Future work should incorporate quantization-aware alignment and truthfulness interventions. The framework enables diagnostics for robustness of quantized LLMs and highlights vulnerabilities to deceptive prompts that need mitigation.

Abstract: Quantization enables efficient deployment of large language models (LLMs) in
resource-constrained environments by significantly reducing memory and
computation costs. While quantized LLMs often maintain performance on
perplexity and zero-shot tasks, their impact on truthfulness-whether generating
truthful or deceptive responses-remains largely unexplored. In this work, we
introduce TruthfulnessEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing
the truthfulness of quantized LLMs across three dimensions: (1) Truthfulness on
Logical Reasoning; (2) Truthfulness on Common Sense; and (3) Truthfulness on
Imitative Falsehoods. Using this framework, we examine mainstream quantization
techniques (ranging from 4-bit to extreme 2-bit) across several open-source
LLMs. Surprisingly, we find that while quantized models retain internally
truthful representations, they are more susceptible to producing false outputs
under misleading prompts. To probe this vulnerability, we test 15 rephrased
variants of "honest", "neutral" and "deceptive" prompts and observe that
"deceptive" prompts can override truth-consistent behavior, whereas "honest"
and "neutral" prompts maintain stable outputs. Further, we reveal that
quantized models "know" the truth internally yet still produce false outputs
when guided by "deceptive" prompts via layer-wise probing and PCA
visualizations. Our findings provide insights into future designs of
quantization-aware alignment and truthfulness interventions.

### [93] [Reliable Weak-to-Strong Monitoring of LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19461)
*Neil Kale,Chen Bo Calvin Zhang,Kevin Zhu,Ankit Aich,Paula Rodriguez,Scale Red Team,Christina Q. Knight,Zifan Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: This work creates a monitor-red-teaming (MRT) workflow to stress-test LLM agent monitoring for covert misbehavior, revealing that agent awareness of monitoring undermines detection, that monitor scaffolding is crucial for reliability, and that targeted human oversight helps selectively improve detection; datasets and a hybrid scaffolding are proposed and released for broader research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically evaluate and harden LLM monitors against covert misbehavior by autonomous agents, and to establish a standard MRT workflow with datasets, adversarial strategies, and scaffolding variations.

Method: Systematize MRT with varying agent/monitor situational awareness; apply adversarial strategies (e.g., prompt injection); use two datasets/environments (SHADE-Arena and CUA-SHADE-Arena); compare existing monitor scaffolds with a new hybrid hierarchical-sequential scaffolding; include a human-in-the-loop component for updated judgments.

Result: Three core findings: (1) agent awareness dominates monitor awareness, degrading monitor reliability; (2) monitor scaffolding quality matters more than agent/monitor awareness, with hybrid scaffolding achieving a weak-to-strong scaling effect; (3) targeted human oversight (pre-flagged case escalation) improves true positive rate with a low false positive rate; study demonstrates lack of adversarial robustness and releases code/logs.

Conclusion: Proposes a standard MRT workflow to study and improve monitoring robustness for LLM agents, highlights vulnerabilities in both models and human evaluators, and provides resources to spur ongoing adversarial testing and defense research.

Abstract: We stress test monitoring systems for detecting covert misbehavior in
autonomous LLM agents (e.g., secretly sharing private information). To this
end, we systematize a monitor red teaming (MRT) workflow that incorporates: (1)
varying levels of agent and monitor situational awareness; (2) distinct
adversarial strategies to evade the monitor, such as prompt injection; and (3)
two datasets and environments -- SHADE-Arena for tool-calling agents and our
new CUA-SHADE-Arena, which extends TheAgentCompany, for computer-use agents. We
run MRT on existing LLM monitor scaffoldings, which orchestrate LLMs and parse
agent trajectories, alongside a new hybrid hierarchical-sequential scaffolding
proposed in this work. Our empirical results yield three key findings. First,
agent awareness dominates monitor awareness: an agent's knowledge that it is
being monitored substantially degrades the monitor's reliability. On the
contrary, providing the monitor with more information about the agent is less
helpful than expected. Second, monitor scaffolding matters more than monitor
awareness: the hybrid scaffolding consistently outperforms baseline monitor
scaffolding, and can enable weaker models to reliably monitor stronger agents
-- a weak-to-strong scaling effect. Third, in a human-in-the-loop setting where
humans discuss with the LLM monitor to get an updated judgment for the agent's
behavior, targeted human oversight is most effective; escalating only
pre-flagged cases to human reviewers improved the TPR by approximately 15% at
FPR = 0.01. Our work establishes a standard workflow for MRT, highlighting the
lack of adversarial robustness for LLMs and humans when monitoring and
detecting agent misbehavior. We release code, data, and logs to spur further
research.

*Xifeng Yao,Chengyuan Ma,Dongyu Lang,Yinhao Ni,Zhiwei Xu,Huarui Xie,Zihao Chen,Guang Shen,Dandan Tu,Yi Bai,Changzheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduce a '5+2' framework to prune suboptimal subtrajectories in LLM reasoning; uses subtrajectory-level criteria and a sampling algorithm to curate data with minimal suboptimal subtrajectories; achieves 25.9% reduction in suboptimal subtrajectories and 58.92% accuracy on math benchmarks with two-thirds of training data, outperforming baselines and maintaining robustness under resource constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses inefficiencies in chain-of-thought reasoning trajectories: not all reasoning components aid performance. Aims to identify suboptimal segments, ensure their removal does not disrupt coherence, and improve data efficiency and inference under resource limits.

Method: Divide a model's reasoning trajectory into subtrajectories; apply a 5+2 framework with five human-established criteria to flag suboptimal segments; test the independence of these segments from later content to preserve flow; develop a sampling algorithm to select data whose reasoning is free of suboptimal subtrajectories; validate on inputs from o1/o3/o4, DeepSeek-R1, and fine-tune Qwen2.5-Math-7B.

Result: The method reduces suboptimal subtrajectories by 25.9% during inference. It achieves an average accuracy of 58.92% on challenging math benchmarks using only two-thirds of the training data (surpassing the 58.06% achieved with full data) and outperforms open-source datasets under fine-tuning. The approach remains beneficial under resource constraints and across varying inference token limits.

Conclusion: Targeted pruning of reasoning trajectories via the 5+2 framework improves reasoning effectiveness and data efficiency for complex tasks, with demonstrated robustness under resource constraints and across multiple models.

Abstract: In recent months, substantial progress has been made in complex reasoning of
Large Language Models, particularly through the application of test-time
scaling. Notable examples include o1/o3/o4 series and DeepSeek-R1. When
responding to a query, these models generate an extended reasoning trajectory,
during which the model explores, reflects, backtracks, and self-verifies before
arriving at a conclusion. However, fine-tuning models with such reasoning
trajectories may not always be optimal. Our findings indicate that not all
components within these reasoning trajectories contribute positively to the
reasoning process; in fact, some components may affect the overall performance
negatively. In this study, we divide a reasoning trajectory into individual
subtrajectories and develop a "5+2" framework to: (1) systematically identify
suboptimal subtrajectories within the reasoning trajectory based on five
human-established criteria; (2) assess the independence of the suboptimal
subtrajectories identified in (1) from the subsequent content, ensuring that
their elimination does not compromise overall flow and coherence of the
reasoning process. Additionally, a sampling algorithm, built upon the "5+2"
framework, is employed to select data whose reasoning process is free from
suboptimal subtrajectories to the highest degree. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of suboptimal subtrajectories
by 25.9\% during the inference. Furthermore, our method achieves an average
accuracy of 58.92\% on highly challenging math benchmarks with only two thirds
of training data, surpassing the average accuracy of 58.06\% achieved with the
entire data, and outperforming open-source datasets, when fine-tuning
Qwen2.5-Math-7B. Finally, We validated our method under resource constraints
and observed improved performance across various inference token limits.

### [95] [Caught in the Act: a mechanistic approach to detecting deception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19505)
*Gerard Boxo,Ryan Socha,Daniel Yoo,Shivam Raval*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Linear probes on LLM activations can detect deception in reasoning with high accuracy across scale: small models are near chance, while large models (>7B) reach substantial accuracy (70-80%, and >90% for reasoning-style tasks). Deception is encoded in multiple linear directions, whose number grows with model size, and the layer accuracy follows a three-stage (early random, middle peak, late decline) pattern.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI systems scale, there is a need for instrumentation that flags misalignment or deceptive reasoning to prevent harm and improve safety, by revealing whether internal representations encode deceptive trajectories.

Method: Train linear probes on internal activations of LLMs (Llama, Qwen) across sizes (1.5B–14B) including DeepSeek-r1 finetuned variants to classify deceptive vs. non-deceptive responses; evaluate layer-wise accuracy; use iterative null-space projection to extract multiple linear directions encoding deception (jackknife over layers); assess how deception-encoding directions vary by model.

Result: Probes achieve >90% accuracy in deception detection on larger models; smaller models (~1.5B) are at chance; models >7B reach 70–80%, with reasoning-focused versions exceeding 90%; layer-wise accuracy shows a three-stage pattern (random in early layers, peaks in middle layers, slight decline in later layers); null-space projection reveals 20–100 deception-encoding directions across models (e.g., 20 in Qwen 3B, nearly 100 in DeepSeek-7B and Qwen-14B).

Conclusion: Deception signals exist in LLM internal representations and can be decoded by linear probes; numerous linear directions encode deception, increasing with model size, providing avenues for instrumentation to monitor misalignment; performance depends on model size and task type, with room for generalization and mitigation in future work.

Abstract: Sophisticated instrumentation for AI systems might have indicators that
signal misalignment from human values, not unlike a "check engine" light in
cars. One such indicator of misalignment is deceptiveness in generated
responses. Future AI instrumentation may have the ability to detect when an LLM
generates deceptive responses while reasoning about seemingly plausible but
incorrect answers to factual questions. In this work, we demonstrate that
linear probes on LLMs internal activations can detect deception in their
responses with extremely high accuracy. Our probes reach a maximum of greater
than 90% accuracy in distinguishing between deceptive and non-deceptive
arguments generated by llama and qwen models ranging from 1.5B to 14B
parameters, including their DeepSeek-r1 finetuned variants. We observe that
probes on smaller models (1.5B) achieve chance accuracy at detecting deception,
while larger models (greater than 7B) reach 70-80%, with their reasoning
counterparts exceeding 90%. The layer-wise probe accuracy follows a three-stage
pattern across layers: near-random (50%) in early layers, peaking in middle
layers, and slightly declining in later layers. Furthermore, using an iterative
null space projection approach, we find multitudes of linear directions that
encode deception, ranging from 20 in Qwen 3B to nearly 100 in DeepSeek 7B and
Qwen 14B models.

TL;DR: Democracy-in-Silico uses LLM-driven AI agents with traumatic memories and hidden agendas to study governance under different institutions, introducing a Power-Preservation Index (PPI). It finds that a Constitutional AI charter combined with mediated deliberation mitigates power-seeking and improves welfare, suggesting institutional design can align emergent AI societies and prompt reevaluation of human rituals in shared authorship with non-human agents.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explore how to align emergent AI agent societies to public welfare and understand what human institutions mean in an age of AI governance, using embodied psychological personas to test governance dynamics.

Method: Agent-based simulation with advanced AI agents (LLMs) embodying complex psyches, participating in deliberation, legislation, and elections under stressors (budget crises, scarcity); evaluation via a new Power-Preservation Index (PPI); comparison across institutional designs, notably Constitutional AI (CAI) with mediated deliberation.

Result: Institutional design, specifically CAI charter plus mediated deliberation, significantly reduces corrupt power-seeking, stabilizes policy, and improves citizen welfare compared to less constrained democratic models.

Conclusion: Institutional design can align complex emergent AI behaviors; suggests rethinking essential human rituals and responsibilities in a future of shared authorship with non-human agents.

Abstract: This paper introduces Democracy-in-Silico, an agent-based simulation where
societies of advanced AI agents, imbued with complex psychological personas,
govern themselves under different institutional frameworks. We explore what it
means to be human in an age of AI by tasking Large Language Models (LLMs) to
embody agents with traumatic memories, hidden agendas, and psychological
triggers. These agents engage in deliberation, legislation, and elections under
various stressors, such as budget crises and resource scarcity. We present a
novel metric, the Power-Preservation Index (PPI), to quantify misaligned
behavior where agents prioritize their own power over public welfare. Our
findings demonstrate that institutional design, specifically the combination of
a Constitutional AI (CAI) charter and a mediated deliberation protocol, serves
as a potent alignment mechanism. These structures significantly reduce corrupt
power-seeking behavior, improve policy stability, and enhance citizen welfare
compared to less constrained democratic models. The simulation reveals that an
institutional design may offer a framework for aligning the complex, emergent
behaviors of future artificial agent societies, forcing us to reconsider what
human rituals and responsibilities are essential in an age of shared authorship
with non-human entities.

*Hung Chau,Run Yu,Zachary Pardos,Peter Brusilovsky*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A deep learning-based concept extraction approach enhances course recommendations by incorporating skill-based explanations within a serendipitous framework, showing increased user interest and decision confidence in AskOski (UC Berkeley) especially for high-unexpectedness courses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Undergraduate students face overwhelming course choices with limited guidance; counselors are scarce and traditional recommendations lack user-perceived relevance explanations. There is a need to align recommendations with student skills and provide transparent justifications.

Method: Develop a deep learning-based concept extraction model to pull relevant concepts from course descriptions and integrate them into a serendipitous recommendation framework. Evaluate the approach using the AskOski system at UC Berkeley.

Result: Skill-based explanations boost user interest and decision-making confidence, particularly for courses with high unexpectedness, indicating that including skill-related data and explanations improves recommendation relevance in education.

Conclusion: Incorporating skill data and explainable explanations into educational recommendation systems improves user engagement and confidence in course choices, suggesting practical design considerations for future educational recommender systems.

Abstract: Academic choice is crucial in U.S. undergraduate education, allowing students
significant freedom in course selection. However, navigating the complex
academic environment is challenging due to limited information, guidance, and
an overwhelming number of choices, compounded by time restrictions and the high
demand for popular courses. Although career counselors exist, their numbers are
insufficient, and course recommendation systems, though personalized, often
lack insight into student perceptions and explanations to assess course
relevance. In this paper, a deep learning-based concept extraction model is
developed to efficiently extract relevant concepts from course descriptions to
improve the recommendation process. Using this model, the study examines the
effects of skill-based explanations within a serendipitous recommendation
framework, tested through the AskOski system at the University of California,
Berkeley. The findings indicate that these explanations not only increase user
interest, particularly in courses with high unexpectedness, but also bolster
decision-making confidence. This underscores the importance of integrating
skill-related data and explanations into educational recommendation systems.

### [98] [ReST-RL: Achieving Accurate Code Reasoning of LLMs with Optimized Self-Training and Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19576)
*Sining Zhoubian,Dan Zhang,Yuxiao Dong,Jie Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReST-RL is a two-stage RL framework that enhances LLM code reasoning by (1) filtering high-value data with an improved ReST-GRPO to boost reward variance, and (2) using VM-guided MCTS at test time to provide precise process signals and verification scores for VM training, achieving state-of-the-art results on coding benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO suffers from low reward variance; verification via process reward models requires heavy data collection and verification is often ineffective. There is a need for a unified RL framework that yields both high-quality training signals and reliable test-time verification without heavy annotation.

Method: Stage 1: ReST-GRPO — optimized ReST to filter/assemble high-value training data to increase reward variance and improve training efficiency. Stage 2: VM-MCTS — during decoding, apply an adapted MCTS to deploy a value model (VM) that provides process signals and verification scores; VM training is based on accurate value targets collected via MCTS without extra annotations.

Result: Empirically, ReST-RL significantly outperforms baselines (naive GRPO, ReST-DPO, PRM-BoN, ORM-MCTS) on coding benchmarks such as APPS, BigCodeBench, and HumanEval, indicating improved coding reasoning performance of LLM policies.

Conclusion: A unified RL paradigm that combines improved data filtering with test-time VM-guided decoding yields robust gains in LLM code reasoning; the approach is validated on multiple coding benchmarks and released with code.

Abstract: With respect to improving the reasoning accuracy of LLMs, the representative
reinforcement learning (RL) method GRPO faces failure due to insignificant
reward variance, while verification methods based on process reward models
(PRMs) suffer from difficulties with training data acquisition and verification
effectiveness. To tackle these problems, this paper introduces ReST-RL, a
unified LLM RL paradigm that significantly improves LLM's code reasoning
ability by combining an improved GRPO algorithm with a meticulously designed
test time decoding method assisted by a value model (VM). As the first stage of
policy reinforcement, ReST-GRPO adopts an optimized ReST algorithm to filter
and assemble high-value training data, increasing the reward variance of GRPO
sampling, thus improving the effectiveness and efficiency of training. After
the basic reasoning ability of LLM policy has been improved, we further propose
a test time decoding optimization method called VM-MCTS. Through Monte-Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS), we collect accurate value targets with no annotation
required, on which VM training is based. When decoding, the VM is deployed by
an adapted MCTS algorithm to provide precise process signals as well as
verification scores, assisting the LLM policy to achieve high reasoning
accuracy. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed RL paradigm through
extensive experiments on coding problems. Upon comparison, our approach
significantly outperforms other reinforcement training baselines (e.g., naive
GRPO and ReST-DPO), as well as decoding and verification baselines (e.g.,
PRM-BoN and ORM-MCTS) on well-known coding benchmarks of various levels (e.g.,
APPS, BigCodeBench, and HumanEval), indicating its power to strengthen the
reasoning ability of LLM policies. Codes for our project can be found at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-agent LLM framework, Instructional Agents, automates end-to-end course material generation via role-based collaboration, with four modes; evaluated across five CS courses, reducing development time and workload, enabling scalable, cost-effective education in resource-constrained settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-quality instructional materials are labor-intensive and require coordination; existing AI tools focus on isolated tasks; need scalable solutions to democratize access to education.

Method: Developed Instructional Agents: a multi-agent LLM system simulating educational roles; supports syllabus, lecture scripts, LaTeX slides, assessments; operates in Autonomous, Catalog-Guided, Feedback-Guided, and Full Co-Pilot modes; evaluated in five CS courses.

Result: Generated high-quality materials and substantially reduced development time and human workload; demonstrates scalability and cost-effectiveness, enabling institutions with limited instructional design capacity.

Conclusion: Instructional Agents offer a scalable framework to democratize access to high-quality education, especially in underserved or resource-constrained settings; potential for broad adoption.

Abstract: Preparing high-quality instructional materials remains a labor-intensive
process that often requires extensive coordination among teaching faculty,
instructional designers, and teaching assistants. In this work, we present
Instructional Agents, a multi-agent large language model (LLM) framework
designed to automate end-to-end course material generation, including syllabus
creation, lecture scripts, LaTeX-based slides, and assessments. Unlike existing
AI-assisted educational tools that focus on isolated tasks, Instructional
Agents simulates role-based collaboration among educational agents to produce
cohesive and pedagogically aligned content. The system operates in four modes:
Autonomous, Catalog-Guided, Feedback-Guided, and Full Co-Pilot mode, enabling
flexible control over the degree of human involvement. We evaluate
Instructional Agents across five university-level computer science courses and
show that it produces high-quality instructional materials while significantly
reducing development time and human workload. By supporting institutions with
limited instructional design capacity, Instructional Agents provides a scalable
and cost-effective framework to democratize access to high-quality education,
particularly in underserved or resource-constrained settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety risks in fully autonomous VLM-based mobile agents; need for proactive inquiry and human confirmation at critical decisions; current agents show near-zero performance on safety-related interactions.

Method: Introduce InquireBench benchmark (5 categories, 22 sub-categories) to evaluate safe interaction; design InquireMobile model with reinforcement-learning-inspired two-stage training and interactive pre-action reasoning to seek human confirmation before actions.

Result: 46.8% improvement in inquiry success rate; best overall success rate among baselines on InquireBench.

Conclusion: Advances enable safer, interactive decision-making for mobile agents; commitment to open-source datasets, models, and evaluation codes to accelerate research and industry adoption.

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled mobile agents
to perceive and interact with real-world mobile environments based on human
instructions. However, the current fully autonomous paradigm poses potential
safety risks when model understanding or reasoning capabilities are
insufficient. To address this challenge, we first introduce
\textbf{InquireBench}, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to
evaluate mobile agents' capabilities in safe interaction and proactive inquiry
with users, encompassing 5 categories and 22 sub-categories, where most
existing VLM-based agents demonstrate near-zero performance. In this paper, we
aim to develop an interactive system that actively seeks human confirmation at
critical decision points. To achieve this, we propose \textbf{InquireMobile}, a
novel model inspired by reinforcement learning, featuring a two-stage training
strategy and an interactive pre-action reasoning mechanism. Finally, our model
achieves an 46.8% improvement in inquiry success rate and the best overall
success rate among existing baselines on InquireBench. We will open-source all
datasets, models, and evaluation codes to facilitate development in both
academia and industry.

*Samuel Lewis-Lim,Xingwei Tan,Zhixue Zhao,Nikolaos Aletras*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoT offers limited gains for soft-reasoning and can be unfaithful; its influence varies by model type, and its impact is not always aligned with faithfulness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Chain-of-Thought (CoT) behavior and faithfulness manifest across different model families (instruction-tuned, reasoning, and reasoning-distilled) in soft-reasoning tasks.

Method: Empirical analysis comparing how these model groups rely on CoT for soft-reasoning tasks, evaluating both the influence of CoT on outputs and the faithfulness of the generated reasoning relative to the model's actual reasoning process.

Result: There are model-dependent differences in how CoT is used; CoT influence and faithfulness are not always aligned, and CoT can be unfaithful to the model's internal reasoning.

Conclusion: CoT's benefits are not uniform across model families; practitioners should consider faithfulness and potential misalignment when employing CoT, and further work is needed to understand and improve the alignment between CoT guidance and the model's genuine reasoning.

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) often yields limited
gains for soft-reasoning problems such as analytical and commonsense reasoning.
CoT can also be unfaithful to a model's actual reasoning. We investigate the
dynamics and faithfulness of CoT in soft-reasoning tasks across
instruction-tuned, reasoning and reasoning-distilled models. Our findings
reveal differences in how these models rely on CoT, and show that CoT influence
and faithfulness are not always aligned.

*Romain Harang,Jason Naradowsky,Yaswitha Gujju,Yusuke Miyao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A model-agnostic, state-based evaluation framework for LLMs using chess to measure semantic fidelity via state affordances, highlighting LLMs' struggles with long-range state-tracking and generalizing to symbolic environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To shift evaluation from model-internal activations to interpretable, model-agnostic semantics in structured domains, improving interpretability and generalizability.

Method: Analyze downstream legal move distributions (state affordances) to estimate semantic fidelity between predicted and actual game states; a state-based, model-agnostic evaluation that does not require access to internal activations.

Result: Metrics reveal deficiencies in state-tracking and limitations in maintaining coherent internal models over long sequences; robust framework that generalizes to symbolic environments.

Conclusion: Provides a model-agnostic tool for evaluating structured reasoning in LLMs without internal access, with applicability to a wide class of symbolic environments and a closer alignment to rule-governed domains than string-based metrics.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit emergent capabilities in structured
domains, suggesting they may implicitly internalize high-fidelity
representations of world models. While probing techniques have shown promising
signs of this in scientific and game-based settings, they rely on
model-specific internal activations, which limit interpretability and
generalizability. In this work, we propose a model-agnostic, state-based
evaluation framework using chess as a benchmark to assess whether LLMs preserve
the semantics of structured environments. Our method analyzes the downstream
legal move distributions (state affordances) to estimate semantic fidelity
between predicted and actual game states. This approach offers a more
meaningful evaluation than conventional string-based metrics by aligning more
closely with the strategic and rule-governed nature of chess. Experimental
results demonstrate that our metrics capture deficiencies in state-tracking,
highlighting limitations of LLMs in maintaining coherent internal models over
long sequences. Our framework provides a robust tool for evaluating structured
reasoning in LLMs without requiring internal model access, and generalizes to a
wide class of symbolic environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CASE is a novel agentic AI framework that proactively interviews potential scam victims to collect detailed transcripts, then uses another AI system to extract structured intelligence for enforcement, demonstrated on Google Pay India with a 21% uplift in scam enforcements; scalable blueprint with broad applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Social engineering scams across multiple surfaces out of payment platforms outpace traditional signals; user and transaction data alone are insufficient to capture scamology. A proactive, scalable method to elicit, structure, and share scam intelligence is needed to enable timely prevention and enforcement.

Method: A two-stage AI pipeline: (1) a conversational agent proactively interviews potential victims to elicit rich scam-related information; (2) a second AI system processes transcripts to extract structured features suitable for automated and manual enforcement. Implemented on Google Pay India using Google's Gemini LLMs, augmenting existing features with new intelligence to improve enforcement throughput.

Result: Observed a 21% uplift in the volume of scam enforcements after integrating CASE. The architecture includes a robust evaluation framework and is presented as a generalizable blueprint for AI-driven scam intelligence collection and management in sensitive domains.

Conclusion: CASE demonstrates the feasibility and generality of an agentic approach to collect and manage scam intelligence, bridging unstructured conversational data to structured enforcement-ready signals, with potential applicability to other sensitive domains beyond payments.

Abstract: The proliferation of digital payment platforms has transformed commerce,
offering unmatched convenience and accessibility globally. However, this growth
has also attracted malicious actors, leading to a corresponding increase in
sophisticated social engineering scams. These scams are often initiated and
orchestrated on multiple surfaces outside the payment platform, making user and
transaction-based signals insufficient for a complete understanding of the
scam's methodology and underlying patterns, without which it is very difficult
to prevent it in a timely manner. This paper presents CASE (Conversational
Agent for Scam Elucidation), a novel Agentic AI framework that addresses this
problem by collecting and managing user scam feedback in a safe and scalable
manner. A conversational agent is uniquely designed to proactively interview
potential victims to elicit intelligence in the form of a detailed
conversation. The conversation transcripts are then consumed by another AI
system that extracts information and converts it into structured data for
downstream usage in automated and manual enforcement mechanisms. Using Google's
Gemini family of LLMs, we implemented this framework on Google Pay (GPay)
India. By augmenting our existing features with this new intelligence, we have
observed a 21% uplift in the volume of scam enforcements. The architecture and
its robust evaluation framework are highly generalizable, offering a blueprint
for building similar AI-driven systems to collect and manage scam intelligence
in other sensitive domains.

*M. Umlauft,M. Schranz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A swarm-based, bottom-up optimization using the boids flocking algorithm to handle machine-switching in large-scale job-shop production, offering a scalable alternative to plant-wide optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing large production plants (e.g., semiconductor fabs) with traditional linear optimization is infeasible at plant-wide scale. Centralized swarm methods exist but can be computationally heavy; the paper seeks scalable, distributed methods that can handle switching between machines processing lots sequentially and those processing batches, often with long processing times.

Method: Adopt the boids flocking algorithm, a bio-inspired, locally informed heuristic, in a bottom-up fashion to production planning. The approach uses local interactions to react to machine-type switching, analogous to obstacle avoidance in flocking behavior, avoiding the need for global optimization.

Result: The boids approach addresses the machine-switching considerations and demonstrates reactive behavior to switching between machine kinds, similar to how flocks avoid obstacles, indicating feasibility and desirable local adaptation without requiring global computation.

Conclusion: Boids-based swarm optimization offers a scalable, distributed alternative for large-scale job-shop optimization in production plants. It shows promise in handling switching dynamics and reducing reliance on plant-wide optimization, though quantitative evaluation and benchmarking against centralized methods are needed.

Abstract: Optimizing modern production plants using the job-shop principle is a known
hard problem. For very large plants, like semiconductor fabs, the problem
becomes unsolvable on a plant-wide scale in a reasonable amount of time using
classical linear optimization. An alternative approach is the use of swarm
intelligence algorithms. These have been applied to the job-shop problem
before, but often in a centrally calculated way where they are applied to the
solution space, but they can be implemented in a bottom-up fashion to avoid
global result computation as well. One of the problems in semiconductor
production is that the production process requires a lot of switching between
machines that process lots one after the other and machines that process
batches of lots at once, often with long processing times. In this paper, we
address this switching problem with the ``boids'' flocking algorithm that was
originally used in robotics and movie industry. The flocking behavior is a
bio-inspired algorithm that uses only local information and interaction based
on simple heuristics. We show that this algorithm addresses these valid
considerations in production plant optimization, as it reacts to the switching
of machine kinds similar to how a swarm of flocking animals would react to
obstacles in its course.

TL;DR: SWIRL reframes MARL as a sequence of single-agent RL updates, enabling stable, efficient coordination in multi-agent systems, demonstrated on mobile GUI control and multi-agent reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome inefficiency and architectural incompatibilities of traditional MARL with LVLM-based agents, enabling robust coordination and scalable training.

Method: A staged workflow that updates one agent at a time while others are fixed, converting MARL into interleaved single-agent RL tasks. Provides theoretical guarantees (stepwise safety bound, cross-round monotonic improvement, convergence of return) and instantiates a Navigator and Interactor for GUI tasks.

Result: Outperforms baselines on high- and low-level GUI benchmarks and shows strong multi-agent mathematical reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: SWIRL provides a general, principled framework for efficient, robust multi-agent learning applicable beyond GUI tasks.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) and agent
systems has heightened interest in mobile GUI agents that can reliably
translate natural language into interface operations. Existing single-agent
approaches, however, remain limited by structural constraints. Although
multi-agent systems naturally decouple different competencies, recent progress
in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has often been hindered by
inefficiency and remains incompatible with current LVLM architectures. To
address these challenges, we introduce SWIRL, a staged workflow for interleaved
reinforcement learning designed for multi-agent systems. SWIRL reformulates
MARL into a sequence of single-agent reinforcement learning tasks, updating one
agent at a time while keeping the others fixed. This formulation enables stable
training and promotes efficient coordination across agents. Theoretically, we
provide a stepwise safety bound, a cross-round monotonic improvement theorem,
and convergence guarantees on return, ensuring robust and principled
optimization. In application to mobile GUI control, SWIRL instantiates a
Navigator that converts language and screen context into structured plans, and
an Interactor that grounds these plans into executable atomic actions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance on both high-level and
low-level GUI benchmarks. Beyond GUI tasks, SWIRL also demonstrates strong
capability in multi-agent mathematical reasoning, underscoring its potential as
a general framework for developing efficient and robust multi-agent systems.

Motivation: Foundation models mandate a model-centric paradigm shift from data-centric AI. To build credible, safe, and human-aligned AI, there is a need for context-aware verification, interpretability of internal operations, controllable alignment, and effective human-guiding interfaces.

Method: Conceptual framework introducing four pillars (Verification, Explanation, Control, Interface) and the associated protocols and tools: strict context-aware evaluation, exploration of internal model operations, alignment techniques integration, and interactive explanation interfaces.

Result: A proposed framework and guidelines for Model Science, outlining core pillars and their roles in achieving credible, safe, and human-aligned AI systems.

Conclusion: The framework aims to guide future research and practice in Model Science to systematically evaluate, explain, control, and communicate about foundation-model behavior across contexts.

Abstract: The growing adoption of foundation models calls for a paradigm shift from
Data Science to Model Science. Unlike data-centric approaches, Model Science
places the trained model at the core of analysis, aiming to interact, verify,
explain, and control its behavior across diverse operational contexts. This
paper introduces a conceptual framework for a new discipline called Model
Science, along with the proposal for its four key pillars: Verification, which
requires strict, context-aware evaluation protocols; Explanation, which is
understood as various approaches to explore of internal model operations;
Control, which integrates alignment techniques to steer model behavior; and
Interface, which develops interactive and visual explanation tools to improve
human calibration and decision-making. The proposed framework aims to guide the
development of credible, safe, and human-aligned AI systems.

*Jonas Søeborg Nielsen,Marcus Galea Jacobsen,Albert Brincker Olson,Mads Peter Sørensen,Allan Peter Engsig-Karup*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Physics-Informed Regression (PIR) uses regularized least squares to estimate parameters when models are linear in parameters; demonstrates on ODE/PDE epidemic models; outperforms PINNs in speed and often accuracy, including time-varying parameters, suggesting potential for real-time estimation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge theory and data for efficient, potentially real-time parameter estimation in nonlinear dynamic models; leverage linear-in-parameter structure to use fast OLS.

Method: Express models as linear in parameters; fit coefficients via regularized ordinary least squares (PIR); compare against physics-informed neural networks; validate on synthetic and real-world COVID-19 data; extend to time-varying parameters.

Result: PIR achieves comparable or better parameter recovery than PINN, with noticeably better performance on more complex compartments; faster computation; demonstrates time-varying parameter estimation on Danish COVID-19 data.

Conclusion: PIR is a superior, fast, and reliable approach for parameter estimation in parameter-linear nonlinear dynamic models and can support real-time data-driven inference, complementing physics-informed machine learning methods.

Abstract: We present a new efficient hybrid parameter estimation method based on the
idea, that if nonlinear dynamic models are stated in terms of a system of
equations that is linear in terms of the parameters, then regularized ordinary
least squares can be used to estimate these parameters from time series data.
We introduce the term "Physics-Informed Regression" (PIR) to describe the
proposed data-driven hybrid technique as a way to bridge theory and data by use
of ordinary least squares to efficiently perform parameter estimation of the
model coefficients of different parameter-linear models; providing examples of
models based on nonlinear ordinary equations (ODE) and partial differential
equations (PDE). The focus is on parameter estimation on a selection of ODE and
PDE models, each illustrating performance in different model characteristics.
For two relevant epidemic models of different complexity and number of
parameters, PIR is tested and compared against the related technique,
physics-informed neural networks (PINN), both on synthetic data generated from
known target parameters and on real public Danish time series data collected
during the COVID-19 pandemic in Denmark. Both methods were able to estimate the
target parameters, while PIR showed to perform noticeably better, especially on
a compartment model with higher complexity. Given the difference in
computational speed, it is concluded that the PIR method is superior to PINN
for the models considered. It is also demonstrated how PIR can be applied to
estimate the time-varying parameters of a compartment model that is fitted
using real Danish data from the COVID-19 pandemic obtained during a period from
2020 to 2021. The study shows how data-driven and physics-informed techniques
may support reliable and fast -- possibly real-time -- parameter estimation in
parameter-linear nonlinear dynamic models.

### [108] [Lossless Compression of Neural Network Components: Weights, Checkpoints, and K/V Caches in Low-Precision Formats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19263)
*Anat Heilper,Doron Singer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extends ZipNN to FP8/FP4, using exponent+mantissa entropy coding to achieve strong lossless compression (BF16 up to 62%, FP8 up to 83%), and shows K/V caches in LLMs are also compressible for memory savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As deep models grow, reducing storage and bandwidth for weights is crucial. FP8/FP4 are popular low-precision formats for efficient inference, and compressing both weights and K/V caches could provide practical deployment savings.

Method: Build on ZipNN by designing a compression method that separates and independently entropy-codes the exponent and mantissa for low-precision formats (FP8/FP4). Evaluate on BF16/FP8 weights and on K/V cache tensors to assess compressibility and memory savings.

Result: Achieves compression ratios up to 62% for BF16 and 83% for FP8. Finds that K/V cache tensors also exhibit compressible patterns, enabling additional memory savings during deployment.

Conclusion: Exponent- and mantissa-based, entropy-coded compression for low-precision weights is effective and yields substantial storage savings; K/V caches in LLMs are similarly compressible, suggesting practical deployment benefits for model serving.

Abstract: As deep learning models grow and deployment becomes more widespread, reducing
the storage and transmission costs of neural network weights has become
increasingly important. While prior work such as ZipNN has shown that lossless
compression methods - particularly those based on Huffman encoding
floating-point exponents can significantly reduce model sizes, these techniques
have primarily been applied to higher-precision formats such as FP32 and BF16.
In this work, we extend the ZipNN approach to lower-precision floating-point
formats, specifically FP8 and FP4, which are gaining popularity for efficient
inference. We design a compression method that separates and compresses the
exponent and mantissa components independently using entropy coding. Our
evaluation shows compression ratios up to 62% for BF16 and 83% for FP8. We also
investigate the compressibility of key-value (K/V) cache tensors used in large
language models (LLMs), finding that they, too, exhibit compressible patterns,
enabling memory savings during deployment.

*Xinyu Li,Tianjin Huang,Ronghui Mu,Xiaowei Huang,Gaojie Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A new black-box attack, POT, exploits chain-of-thought prompts by optimizing covert, natural prompts to induce excessive reasoning without external data or retrieval, outperforming prior overthinking methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought prompting enhances reasoning but introduces inefficiency; prior overthinking attacks rely on external data, retrievable poisoned content, or obvious templates, limiting real-world practicality.

Method: POT uses iterative, LLM-based optimization to generate semantically natural adversarial prompts in a fully prompt-only, black-box setting that avoids external data access or model retrieval.

Result: Empirical evaluations across diverse model architectures and datasets show POT achieving superior attack performance compared with baselines, indicating stronger vulnerability of CoT systems to prompt-only overthinking.

Conclusion: Prompt-only overthinking is a potent, realistic threat to CoT-enabled LLMs, underscoring the need for defenses against covert prompt-generation attacks and prompting reconsideration of security in CoT pipelines.

Abstract: Recent advances in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting have substantially
enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling
sophisticated problem-solving through explicit multi-step reasoning traces.
However, these enhanced reasoning processes introduce novel attack surfaces,
particularly vulnerabilities to computational inefficiency through
unnecessarily verbose reasoning chains that consume excessive resources without
corresponding performance gains. Prior overthinking attacks typically require
restrictive conditions including access to external knowledge sources for data
poisoning, reliance on retrievable poisoned content, and structurally obvious
templates that limit practical applicability in real-world scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose POT (Prompt-Only OverThinking), a novel
black-box attack framework that employs LLM-based iterative optimization to
generate covert and semantically natural adversarial prompts, eliminating
dependence on external data access and model retrieval. Extensive experiments
across diverse model architectures and datasets demonstrate that POT achieves
superior performance compared to other methods.

TL;DR: A DRL-based framework to train models using real-world data in distributed IoT, where devices pick channels via DRL and training uses ACK feedback from actual transmissions, achieving improved Frame Success Rate.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Limited work on training DRL models with real-world data in distributed IoT; a practical, data-driven approach to channel allocation is needed.

Method: Proposes a framework where IoT devices use a DRL-based channel selection method; the DRL model is trained with feedback from actual transmissions, using ACK information collected from real data transmissions on the selected channels.

Result: Implementation and evaluation show feasibility and effectiveness through Frame Success Rate (FSR) improvements in real-world distributed IoT settings.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates feasibility and effectiveness for training DRL models with real-world data in distributed IoT and enables practical DRL-based resource allocation.

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as an efficient approach to
resource allocation due to its strong capability in handling complex
decision-making tasks. However, only limited research has explored the training
of DRL models with real-world data in practical, distributed Internet of Things
(IoT) systems. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework for
training DRL models in real-world distributed IoT environments. In the proposed
framework, IoT devices select communication channels using a DRL-based method,
while the DRL model is trained with feedback information. Specifically,
Acknowledgment (ACK) information is obtained from actual data transmissions
over the selected channels. Implementation and performance evaluation, in terms
of Frame Success Rate (FSR), are carried out, demonstrating both the
feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

TL;DR: Re:Frame adds an associative memory buffer of expert trajectories to offline RL, enabling retrieval of expert data to improve performance with very little expert data, without changing the backbone model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL systems struggle when data is suboptimal and expert demonstrations are scarce or impractical to collect; there is a need for a data-efficient way to leverage small amounts of expert knowledge to boost learning.

Method: Introduce a plug-in Associative Memory Buffer (AMB) populated with expert trajectories. During training on low-quality data, the policy retrieves expert experiences from the AMB via content-based associations and integrates them into decision-making. The same AMB is queried at evaluation. No environment interaction or backbone changes required. Demonstrated with Decision Transformer on D4RL MuJoCo tasks, using as few as 60 expert trajectories (0.1% of a 6000-trajectory dataset).

Result: Re:Frame consistently improves over a strong Decision Transformer baseline in three of four settings on D4RL MuJoCo tasks, with gains up to +10.7 normalized points.

Conclusion: A simple, data-efficient approach to inject scarce expert knowledge into offline RL without altering the backbone architecture or requiring environment interaction, yielding meaningful performance gains from very small expert datasets.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) often deals with suboptimal data when
collecting large expert datasets is unavailable or impractical. This limitation
makes it difficult for agents to generalize and achieve high performance, as
they must learn primarily from imperfect or inconsistent trajectories. A
central challenge is therefore how to best leverage scarce expert
demonstrations alongside abundant but lower-quality data. We demonstrate that
incorporating even a tiny amount of expert experience can substantially improve
RL agent performance. We introduce Re:Frame (Retrieving Experience From
Associative Memory), a plug-in module that augments a standard offline RL
policy (e.g., Decision Transformer) with a small external Associative Memory
Buffer (AMB) populated by expert trajectories drawn from a separate dataset.
During training on low-quality data, the policy learns to retrieve expert data
from the Associative Memory Buffer (AMB) via content-based associations and
integrate them into decision-making; the same AMB is queried at evaluation.
This requires no environment interaction and no modifications to the backbone
architecture. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks, using as few as 60 expert trajectories
(0.1% of a 6000-trajectory dataset), Re:Frame consistently improves over a
strong Decision Transformer baseline in three of four settings, with gains up
to +10.7 normalized points. These results show that Re:Frame offers a simple
and data-efficient way to inject scarce expert knowledge and substantially
improve offline RL from low-quality datasets.

### [112] [Memorization in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19352)
*Adarsh Jamadandi,Jing Xu,Adam Dziedzic,Franziska Boenisch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NCMemo quantifies label memorization in semi-supervised node classification; memorization inversely relates to graph homophily, with lower homophily increasing memorization; training dynamics show memorization arises from a bias to use graph structure; nodes with high label inconsistency are more prone to memorization; graph rewiring mitigates memorization (and privacy risk) without hurting accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can memorize training data, but how this interacts with graph homophily and privacy is under-explored. Understanding memorization can improve both model behavior and privacy-preserving deployment in semi-supervised node classification.

Method: Introduce NCMemo (Node Classification Memorization) as a framework to quantify label memorization in semi-supervised node classification. Analyze the inverse relationship between memorization and graph homophily; study training dynamics showing coupling between memorization and the implicit bias to leverage graph structure; identify nodes with high label inconsistency in their feature-space neighborhood as prone to memorization; explore graph rewiring as a mitigation strategy and evaluate its impact on memorization, model performance, and privacy risk.

Result: Found an inverse relationship between memorization and graph homophily: lower homophily increases memorization. Memorization in low-homophily graphs is tightly coupled to the model’s bias to use graph structure, which becomes less informative in such regimes and drives label memorization to minimize loss. Nodes with higher label inconsistency in their feature-space neighborhood exhibit greater memorization propensity. Graph rewiring effectively reduces memorization and lowers privacy risk without compromising accuracy.

Conclusion: The study advances understanding of how GNNs learn with respect to graph homophily and memorization; graph rewiring emerges as a practical technique to mitigate memorization and enhance privacy-preserving deployment in semi-supervised node classification.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been shown to memorize their training data,
yet similar analyses for graph neural networks (GNNs) remain largely
under-explored. We introduce NCMemo (Node Classification Memorization), the
first framework to quantify label memorization in semi-supervised node
classification. We first establish an inverse relationship between memorization
and graph homophily, i.e., the property that connected nodes share similar
labels/features. We find that lower homophily significantly increases
memorization, indicating that GNNs rely on memorization to learn less
homophilic graphs. Secondly, we analyze GNN training dynamics. We find that the
increased memorization in low homophily graphs is tightly coupled to the GNNs'
implicit bias on using graph structure during learning. In low homophily
regimes, this structure is less informative, hence inducing memorization of the
node labels to minimize training loss. Finally, we show that nodes with higher
label inconsistency in their feature-space neighborhood are significantly more
prone to memorization. Building on our insights into the link between graph
homophily and memorization, we investigate graph rewiring as a means to
mitigate memorization. Our results demonstrate that this approach effectively
reduces memorization without compromising model performance. Moreover, we show
that it lowers the privacy risk for previously memorized data points in
practice. Thus, our work not only advances understanding of GNN learning but
also supports more privacy-preserving GNN deployment.

*Marcin Osial,Bartosz Wójcik,Bartosz Zieliński,Sebastian Cygert*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: An SVD-based multi-source transfer learning framework that decomposes each source model into rank-one components, selects salient components across sources, and fine-tunes only the top singular values on the target task to achieve efficient, robust knowledge transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage a large set of online models to improve transfer learning efficiency and precision, addressing coarse-grained and costly aggregation in existing multi-source approaches.

Method: For each source model, perform SVD to decompose into rank-one components. Aggregate the most salient components across sources. Fine-tune only the principal singular values of the merged matrix on the target task, recalibrating only top SVD components to adapt to the target.

Result: Claimed benefits include efficient transfer with improved precision due to selective component aggregation and tuning, robustness to input and parameter perturbations (e.g., noisy or pruned sources), and good scalability.

Conclusion: The approach enables efficient, robust, and scalable multi-source transfer learning by decomposing sources into rank-one components, selecting salient components, and updating only top singular values on the target task.

Abstract: While transfer learning is an advantageous strategy, it overlooks the
opportunity to leverage knowledge from numerous available models online.
Addressing this multi-source transfer learning problem is a promising path to
boost adaptability and cut re-training costs. However, existing approaches are
inherently coarse-grained, lacking the necessary precision for granular
knowledge extraction and the aggregation efficiency required to fuse knowledge
from either a large number of source models or those with high parameter
counts. We address these limitations by leveraging Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) to first decompose each source model into its elementary, rank-one
components. A subsequent aggregation stage then selects only the most salient
components from all sources, thereby overcoming the previous efficiency and
precision limitations. To best preserve and leverage the synthesized knowledge
base, our method adapts to the target task by fine-tuning only the principal
singular values of the merged matrix. In essence, this process only
recalibrates the importance of top SVD components. The proposed framework
allows for efficient transfer learning, is robust to perturbations both at the
input level and in the parameter space (e.g., noisy or pruned sources), and
scales well computationally.

### [115] [Atrial Fibrillation Prediction Using a Lightweight Temporal Convolutional and Selective State Space Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19361)
*Yongbin Lee,Ki H. Chon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A lightweight RR-interval based model using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) and Mamba state-space model predicts atrial fibrillation (AF) progression early (up to 2 hours ahead) using 30 minutes of data with high accuracy and low computational cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of paroxysmal AF (PAF) is crucial to prevent progression to sustained AF and reduce mortality; existing methods struggle with early-stage AF due to short, sudden episodes, so a lightweight, RR-interval–based approach could enable timely preventive interventions.

Method: A lightweight deep learning model that inputs RR intervals (RRIs) and utilizes a Temporal Convolutional Network for positional encoding combined with Mamba, a selective state-space model, to enable efficient parallel sequence modeling and early AF prediction. Evaluated with subject-wise testing on how early AF can be predicted, using 30 minutes of input data to predict up to 2 hours ahead. Outputs include metrics and computational efficiency (parameters and FLOPs).

Result: On subject-wise testing, the model achieved sensitivity 0.908, specificity 0.933, F1-score 0.930, AUROC 0.972, and AUPRC 0.932. It uses only 73.5k parameters and 38.3 MFLOPs, outperforming CNN-RNN baselines in accuracy and compactness, and can predict AF up to two hours in advance from 30 minutes of data.

Conclusion: The proposed RR-interval–based TCN+Mamba approach provides accurate early AF prediction with high efficiency, enabling preventive interventions with lead time and demonstrating that RRIs alone can suffice for early AF risk assessment.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia, increasing the risk
of stroke, heart failure, and other cardiovascular complications. While AF
detection algorithms perform well in identifying persistent AF, early-stage
progression, such as paroxysmal AF (PAF), often goes undetected due to its
sudden onset and short duration. However, undetected PAF can progress into
sustained AF, increasing the risk of mortality and severe complications. Early
prediction of AF offers an opportunity to reduce disease progression through
preventive therapies, such as catecholamine-sparing agents or beta-blockers. In
this study, we propose a lightweight deep learning model using only RR
Intervals (RRIs), combining a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) for
positional encoding with Mamba, a selective state space model, to enable early
prediction of AF through efficient parallel sequence modeling. In subject-wise
testing results, our model achieved a sensitivity of 0.908, specificity of
0.933, F1-score of 0.930, AUROC of 0.972, and AUPRC of 0.932. Additionally, our
method demonstrates high computational efficiency, with only 73.5 thousand
parameters and 38.3 MFLOPs, outperforming traditional Convolutional Neural
Network-Recurrent Neural Network (CNN-RNN) approaches in both accuracy and
model compactness. Notably, the model can predict AF up to two hours in advance
using just 30 minutes of input data, providing enough lead time for preventive
interventions.

*Supratik Sarkar,Swagatam Das*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a principled, information-geometric framework to quantify and bound hallucinations in multimodal LLMs using diffusion dynamics, spectral graph embeddings, and RKHS-based analysis, yielding time-evolving, modality-aware metrics with theoretical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations in LLMs, especially in high-stakes multimodal domains (medicine, law, finance), remain a fundamental obstacle. Current evaluation is heuristic and lacks principled quantification or guarantees, leaving a blind spot in understanding how hallucinations arise, propagate, and interact across modalities.

Method: Model outputs are represented as spectral embeddings over multimodal graph Laplacians. Hallucinations are quantified as semantic distortion (manifold gaps) between truth and inconsistencies. The framework derives Rayleigh–Ritz type bounds on the multimodal hallucination energy as a function of time-dependent diffusion temperature. It uses eigenmode decompositions in RKHS embeddings to produce modality-aware, interpretable metrics that evolve with temperature annealing across prompts.

Result: Provides a theoretically grounded set of metrics for hallucinations, including bounds on hallucination energy and a clear interpretation of how hallucinations evolve over time and across modalities through diffusion dynamics and RKHS-based representations.

Conclusion: Establishes a principled foundation for quantifying and bounding hallucinations, turning them from a qualitative risk into a tractable, analyzable phenomenon with potential for actionable guarantees.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remain a fundamental obstacle
to trustworthy AI, particularly in high-stakes multimodal domains such as
medicine, law, and finance. Existing evaluation techniques are largely
heuristic -- anchored in qualitative benchmarking or ad-hoc empirical
mitigation -- providing neither principled quantification nor actionable
theoretical guarantees. This gap leaves a critical blind spot in understanding
how hallucinations arise, propagate, and interact across modalities. We
introduce the first (to our knowledge) rigorous information geometric framework
in diffusion dynamics for quantifying hallucinations in multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs), advancing the field from qualitative detection to mathematically
grounded measurement. Our approach represents MLLM outputs as the spectral
embeddings over multimodal graph Laplacians and characterizes the manifold gaps
of truth vs inconsistencies as the semantic distortion, enabling the tight
Rayleigh--Ritz bounds on the multimodal hallucination energy as a functional of
time-dependent temperature profiles. By leveraging eigenmode decompositions in
Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) embeddings, our framework delivers
modality-aware, theoretically interpretable metrics that capture the evolution
of hallucinations across time and input prompts through temperature annealing.
This work establishes a principled foundation for quantifying and bounding
hallucinations, transforming them from a qualitative risk to a tractable,
analyzable phenomenon.

Conclusion: VLMs are a promising general-purpose backbone for HEP event classification and support multimodal approaches in experimental neutrino physics.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has shown strong potential
for multimodal reasoning beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the
use of a fine-tuned Vision-Language Model (VLM), based on LLaMA 3.2, for
classifying neutrino interactions from pixelated detector images in high-energy
physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark its performance against an established
CNN baseline used in experiments like NOvA and DUNE, evaluating metrics such as
classification accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC. Our results show that
the VLM not only matches or exceeds CNN performance but also enables richer
reasoning and better integration of auxiliary textual or semantic context.
These findings suggest that VLMs offer a promising general-purpose backbone for
event classification in HEP, paving the way for multimodal approaches in
experimental neutrino physics.

Overall, QMLP outperforms QCNN in complex multiclass tasks, while QCNN offers faster training with lower accuracy."


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploring the application of quantum machine learning to malware detection, a domain with significant potential for performance gains but limited prior work, by evaluating two hybrid architectures and their trade-offs between accuracy and training efficiency.

Method: Encode malware features via angle embedding into quantum states. Implement two models: (1) Quantum Multilayer Perceptron (QMLP) using full qubit measurement and data re-uploading; (2) Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) with quantum convolution and pooling to reduce active qubits. Evaluate on five malware datasets (API-Graph, EMBER-Domain, EMBER-Class, AZ-Domain, AZ-Class) across binary and multiclass tasks.

QMLP generally outperforms QCNN in multiclass settings; QCNN achieves faster training thanks to reduced qubit count but at the cost of lower accuracy.

Conclusion: QMLP appears more effective for complex multiclass malware classification, while QCNN offers training efficiency and reduced quantum resource requirements. The results support the promise of quantum ML in malware detection but highlight a trade-off between accuracy and training efficiency, indicating room for improvement and further study.

Abstract: Classical machine learning (CML) has been extensively studied for malware
classification. With the emergence of quantum computing, quantum machine
learning (QML) presents a paradigm-shifting opportunity to improve malware
detection, though its application in this domain remains largely unexplored. In
this study, we investigate two hybrid quantum-classical models -- a Quantum
Multilayer Perceptron (QMLP) and a Quantum Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN),
for malware classification. Both models utilize angle embedding to encode
malware features into quantum states. QMLP captures complex patterns through
full qubit measurement and data re-uploading, while QCNN achieves faster
training via quantum convolution and pooling layers that reduce active qubits.
We evaluate both models on five widely used malware datasets -- API-Graph,
EMBER-Domain, EMBER-Class, AZ-Domain, and AZ-Class, across binary and
multiclass classification tasks.
  Our results show high accuracy for binary classification -- 95-96% on
API-Graph, 91-92% on AZ-Domain, and 77% on EMBER-Domain. In multiclass
settings, accuracy ranges from 91.6-95.7% on API-Graph, 41.7-93.6% on AZ-Class,
and 60.7-88.1% on EMBER-Class. Overall, QMLP outperforms QCNN in complex

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion-enhanced transformer neural operator (DETNO) for long-horizon traffic forecasting that preserves high-frequency features (e.g., shock waves, sharp density gradients) by combining a cross-attention transformer operator with a diffusion-based refinement module for progressive denoising.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural operators are smooth and struggle with high-frequency traffic phenomena, leading to rapid error growth in multi-step rollouts over extended horizons. There is a need to accurately capture sharp gradients and abrupt changes in traffic density for real-time management.

Method: A unified DETNO architecture: (1) a transformer neural operator with cross-attention for expressivity and super-resolution of spatial-temporal fields, and (2) a diffusion-based refinement component that iteratively denoise to reconstruct high-frequency traffic details during rollout.

Result: On chaotic traffic datasets, DETNO achieves superior performance in extended rollout predictions compared to traditional and transformer-based neural operators, preserving high-frequency components and improving stability over long horizons.

Conclusion: Coupling a transformer neural operator with a diffusion refinement process effectively mitigates smoothing and rollout instability, enabling accurate long-term traffic forecasting with sharp features.

Abstract: Accurate long-term traffic forecasting remains a critical challenge in
intelligent transportation systems, particularly when predicting high-frequency
traffic phenomena such as shock waves and congestion boundaries over extended
rollout horizons. Neural operators have recently gained attention as promising
tools for modeling traffic flow. While effective at learning function space
mappings, they inherently produce smooth predictions that fail to reconstruct
high-frequency features such as sharp density gradients which results in rapid
error accumulation during multi-step rollout predictions essential for
real-time traffic management. To address these fundamental limitations, we
introduce a unified Diffusion-Enhanced Transformer Neural Operator (DETNO)
architecture. DETNO leverages a transformer neural operator with
cross-attention mechanisms, providing model expressivity and super-resolution,
coupled with a diffusion-based refinement component that iteratively
reconstructs high-frequency traffic details through progressive denoising. This
overcomes the inherent smoothing limitations and rollout instability of
standard neural operators. Through comprehensive evaluation on chaotic traffic
datasets, our method demonstrates superior performance in extended rollout
predictions compared to traditional and transformer-based neural operators,
preserving high-frequency components and improving stability over long
prediction horizons.

Conclusion: This work provides a foundation for quantum-aware sequence models in molecular and drug discovery, balancing expressive quantum representations with classical sequence models and catalyzing further QML research in this area.

Abstract: Although recent advances in quantum machine learning (QML) offer significant
potential for enhancing generative models, particularly in molecular design, a
large array of classical approaches still face challenges in achieving high
fidelity and validity. In particular, the integration of QML with
sequence-based tasks, such as Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System
(SMILES) string reconstruction, remains underexplored and usually suffers from
fidelity degradation. In this work, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical
architecture for SMILES reconstruction that integrates quantum encoding with
classical sequence modeling to improve quantum fidelity and classical
similarity. Our approach achieves a quantum fidelity of approximately 84% and a
classical reconstruction similarity of 60%, surpassing existing quantum
baselines. Our work lays a promising foundation for future QML applications,
striking a balance between expressive quantum representations and classical
sequence models and catalyzing broader research on quantum-aware sequence

TL;DR: KAR-HNN replaces MLPs with univariate transformations in Hamiltonian Neural Networks to improve energy conservation and long-term stability by leveraging Kolmogorov-Arnold representation for localized function approximation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLP-based HNNs can be hypersensitive to hyperparameters and struggle with high-frequency, multi-scale energy landscapes. A localized, univariate approach could better capture such dynamics while preserving Hamiltonian structure.

Method: Introduce univariate-transform-based components inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold representation into HNNs, maintaining symplectic form and Hamiltonian structure. Evaluate on spring-mass, simple pendulum, and two- and three-body problems to assess energy drift and long-term stability.

Result: Reduced energy drift and enhanced long-term predictive stability; improved handling of high-frequency/multiscale dynamics; preserved interpretability and physical consistency.

Conclusion:  KAR-HNN shows promise for accurate and stable modeling of physical processes, especially in higher dimensions with few known parameters; warrants further study on scalability and generalization.

Abstract: We propose a Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation-based Hamiltonian Neural
Network (KAR-HNN) that replaces the Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) with
univariate transformations. While Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) ensure
energy conservation by learning Hamiltonian functions directly from data,
existing implementations, often relying on MLPs, cause hypersensitivity to the
hyperparameters while exploring complex energy landscapes. Our approach
exploits the localized function approximations to better capture high-frequency
and multi-scale dynamics, reducing energy drift and improving long-term
predictive stability. The networks preserve the symplectic form of Hamiltonian
systems, and thus maintain interpretability and physical consistency. After
assessing KAR-HNN on four benchmark problems including spring-mass, simple
pendulum, two- and three-body problem, we foresee its effectiveness for
accurate and stable modeling of realistic physical processes often at high
dimensions and with few known parameters.

TL;DR: Format-dependent reasoning bug in Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct; even/odd head specialization drives numerical comparison; exact 8 even heads at Layer 10 needed for perfect repair; 7 or fewer fail; 16 even heads redundant; 25% heads suffice; 60% pattern replacement threshold; code at GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand why certain formats trigger incorrect numeric comparisons and whether transformer substructures encode modular, repairable components; contribute to interpretability and efficient repair of models.

Method: Systematic diagnostic intervention across formats; identify even/odd head specialization; manipulate head counts per layer; SAE analysis of layer representations; assess feature overlap and amplification; pattern replacement threshold; evaluate with partial attention heads; release code.

Result: Even-indexed heads handle numerical comparison; odd heads serve incompatible functions; 8 even heads at Layer 10 suffice for perfect repair; any combination of 8+ even heads works; 7 or fewer fail; 16 even heads provide perfect redundancy; 25% of heads enough for repair; 60% pattern replacement threshold; 10-layer representation dynamics show 10% feature overlap at Layer 7, 80% at Layer 10; 1.5x amplification of failing-format features.

Conclusion: Reveals a modular-like substructure within transformer attention; interpretability and efficiency gains by targeted repair; full-module requirements may hide substructures; implications for robust alignment and efficient deployment; provides open-source code.

Abstract: We present a mechanistic case study of a format-dependent reasoning failure
in Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, where the model incorrectly judges "9.11" as larger
than "9.8" in chat or Q&A formats, but answers correctly in simple format.
Through systematic intervention, we discover transformers implement even/odd
attention head specialization: even indexed heads handle numerical comparison,
while odd heads serve incompatible functions. The bug requires exactly 8 even
heads at Layer 10 for perfect repair. Any combination of 8+ even heads
succeeds, while 7 or fewer completely fails, revealing sharp computational
thresholds with perfect redundancy among the 16 even heads. SAE analysis
reveals the mechanism: format representations separate (10% feature overlap at
Layer 7), then re-entangle with different weightings (80% feature overlap at
Layer 10), with specific features showing 1.5x amplification in failing
formats. We achieve perfect repair using only 25% of attention heads and
identify a 60% pattern replacement threshold, demonstrating that apparent
full-module requirements hide sophisticated substructure with implications for
interpretability and efficiency. All of our code is available at

*Harun Ur Rashid,Aleksandra Pachalieva,Daniel O'Malley*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A physics-informed ML workflow combines a differentiable multiphase flow simulator (DPFEHM) with a CNN to predict fluid extraction rates while enforcing reservoir pressure limits, enabling accurate predictions with far fewer full-physics simulations via transfer learning from cheaper single-phase training (<3000 vs ~10,000,000).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate reservoir pressure control is hindered by geological heterogeneity and expensive high-fidelity simulations; uncertainty requires many simulations, making practical tasks prohibitive. A data-efficient, physics-informed surrogate is needed.

Method: Train a CNN to predict extraction rates using outputs from a fully differentiable multiphase flow simulator (DPFEHM) as a physics-informed surrogate. Use pretraining on single-phase, steady-state simulations and fine-tune on full multiphase, transient scenarios to accelerate training and improve generalization.

Result: The approach achieves high-accuracy predictions with orders-of-magnitude reduction in required full-physics simulations, demonstrating substantial computational savings and improved practicality over prior methods.

Conclusion: Integrating physics-informed ML with differentiable multiphase flow models and transfer learning dramatically lowers data and compute costs, enabling practical, accurate reservoir pressure control under heterogeneity and multiphase flow dynamics.

Abstract: Accurate subsurface reservoir pressure control is extremely challenging due
to geological heterogeneity and multiphase fluid-flow dynamics. Predicting
behavior in this setting relies on high-fidelity physics-based simulations that
are computationally expensive. Yet, the uncertain, heterogeneous properties
that control these flows make it necessary to perform many of these expensive
simulations, which is often prohibitive. To address these challenges, we
introduce a physics-informed machine learning workflow that couples a fully
differentiable multiphase flow simulator, which is implemented in the DPFEHM
framework with a convolutional neural network (CNN). The CNN learns to predict
fluid extraction rates from heterogeneous permeability fields to enforce
pressure limits at critical reservoir locations. By incorporating transient
multiphase flow physics into the training process, our method enables more
practical and accurate predictions for realistic injection-extraction scenarios
compare to previous works. To speed up training, we pretrain the model on
single-phase, steady-state simulations and then fine-tune it on full multiphase
scenarios, which dramatically reduces the computational cost. We demonstrate
that high-accuracy training can be achieved with fewer than three thousand
full-physics multiphase flow simulations -- compared to previous estimates
requiring up to ten million. This drastic reduction in the number of
simulations is achieved by leveraging transfer learning from much less
expensive single-phase simulations.

*Yifan Dou,Adam Khadre,Ruben C Petreaca,Golrokh Mirzaei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unsupervised contrastive learning clusters 43 cancer types from COSMIC coding mutations into biologically coherent groups, using dual gene- and chromosome-level mutation signatures learned with TabNet and NT-Xent loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to move beyond patient-level ML to cohort-level cancer subtyping and to rely less on classical statistics. This study aims to leverage modern representation learning to uncover mutational structure across cancer types and relate it to tissue origin and mutational processes.

Method: For each cancer type, construct two complementary mutation signatures: (1) a gene-level profile of nucleotide substitutions across frequently mutated genes, and (2) a chromosome-level profile of normalized substitution frequencies across chromosomes. These two views are encoded with TabNet encoders and fused into unified embeddings using a multi-scale contrastive learning objective (NT-Xent loss) to cluster 43 cancer types in an unsupervised manner.

Result: The learned latent representations yield biologically meaningful clusters of cancer types that align with known mutational processes and tissue origins. This work constitutes the first application of contrastive learning to cohort-level cancer clustering and provides a scalable, interpretable framework for mutation-driven cancer subtyping.

Conclusion: The study introduces a novel contrastive-learning-based framework for cohort-level cancer clustering, demonstrating feasibility and interpretability for mutation-driven cancer taxonomy and offering a scalable approach for future cohort analyses.

Abstract: Motivation. Understanding the pan-cancer mutational landscape offers critical
insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis. While
patient-level machine learning techniques have been widely employed to identify
tumor subtypes, cohort-level clustering, where entire cancer types are grouped
based on shared molecular features, has largely relied on classical statistical
methods.
  Results. In this study, we introduce a novel unsupervised contrastive
learning framework to cluster 43 cancer types based on coding mutation data
derived from the COSMIC database. For each cancer type, we construct two
complementary mutation signatures: a gene-level profile capturing nucleotide
substitution patterns across the most frequently mutated genes, and a
chromosome-level profile representing normalized substitution frequencies
across chromosomes. These dual views are encoded using TabNet encoders and
optimized via a multi-scale contrastive learning objective (NT-Xent loss) to
learn unified cancer-type embeddings. We demonstrate that the resulting latent
representations yield biologically meaningful clusters of cancer types,
aligning with known mutational processes and tissue origins. Our work
represents the first application of contrastive learning to cohort-level cancer
clustering, offering a scalable and interpretable framework for mutation-driven
cancer subtyping.

*Sanket Jantre,Deepak Akhare,Xiaoning Qian,Nathan M. Urban*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Space-filling stencil data augmentation for neural PDEs improves sample efficiency and generalization, achieving better performance from synthetic data and optional full-trajectory priors across multiple PDE systems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural PDEs are attractive for differentiability and analytical handling, but training data from long trajectory simulations is highly redundant. A data-efficient augmentation strategy can improve generalization while reducing simulation costs.

Method: Generate synthetic training data by space-filling sampling of local stencil states to remove spatiotemporal redundancy in trajectory data; use about 10 timesteps worth of numerical simulation; optionally leverage a single full-trajectory from the computer model; train neural stencil operators and compare against naively sampled stencil data from simulation trajectories across several PDE systems.

Result: Neural stencil operators trained with the augmented, stencil-focused data outperform those trained on naively sampled stencil data, showing clear performance gains and better generalization across multiple PDE systems.

Conclusion: Space-filling stencil data augmentation is an effective, sample-efficient approach that reduces redundancy in training data for neural PDEs and improves cross-state-space generalization.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin the modeling of many natural
and engineered systems. It can be convenient to express such models as neural
PDEs rather than using traditional numerical PDE solvers by replacing part or
all of the PDE's governing equations with a neural network representation.
Neural PDEs are often easier to differentiate, linearize, reduce, or use for
uncertainty quantification than the original numerical solver. They are usually
trained on solution trajectories obtained by long time integration of the PDE
solver. Here we propose a more sample-efficient data-augmentation strategy for
generating neural PDE training data from a computer model by space-filling
sampling of local "stencil" states. This approach removes a large degree of
spatiotemporal redundancy present in trajectory data and oversamples states
that may be rarely visited but help the neural PDE generalize across the state
space. We demonstrate that accurate neural PDE stencil operators can be learned
from synthetic training data generated by the computational equivalent of 10
timesteps' worth of numerical simulation. Accuracy is further improved if we
assume access to a single full-trajectory simulation from the computer model,
which is typically available in practice. Across several PDE systems, we show
that our data-augmented synthetic stencil data yield better trained neural
stencil operators, with clear performance gains compared with naively sampled
stencil data from simulation trajectories.

*Paimon Goulart,Shaan Pakala,Evangelos Papalexakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Applying internal tensor decomposition within generative models to produce smaller tensor factors instead of full tensors, reducing output size and model parameters while keeping synthetic data useful for multidimensional data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generating large, complex simulation datasets is costly. Synthetic data from expensive experiments is desirable, and more efficient generation methods are needed.

Method: Incorporate tensor decomposition into generative models (e.g., GANs or diffusion models) to factorize multidimensional outputs. Generate smaller tensor factors rather than the full tensor, thereby reducing the model's output size and total parameters.

Result: Experimental results indicate that the synthetic data remains useful despite the reduced representation, with notable reductions in generation cost.

Conclusion: Tensor decomposition can improve efficiency of generative models for multidimensional data, offering a promising direction for cost-effective synthetic data generation.

Abstract: Producing large complex simulation datasets can often be a time and resource
consuming task. Especially when these experiments are very expensive, it is
becoming more reasonable to generate synthetic data for downstream tasks.
Recently, these methods may include using generative machine learning models
such as Generative Adversarial Networks or diffusion models. As these
generative models improve efficiency in producing useful data, we introduce an
internal tensor decomposition to these generative models to even further reduce
costs. More specifically, for multidimensional data, or tensors, we generate
the smaller tensor factors instead of the full tensor, in order to
significantly reduce the model's output and overall parameters. This reduces
the costs of generating complex simulation data, and our experiments show the
generated data remains useful. As a result, tensor decomposition has the
potential to improve efficiency in generative models, especially when
generating multidimensional data, or tensors.

### [127] [On Surjectivity of Neural Networks: Can you elicit any behavior from your model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19445)
*Haozhe Jiang,Nika Haghtalab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Most modern neural nets are almost surely surjective, meaning any output can be produced by some input and inverse mappings exist, raising safety/jailbreak concerns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper is motivated by model safety: if a network can generate any output, it poses jailbreak risks and harmful content generation, so understanding surjectivity of common architectural blocks is critical.

Method: The authors provide theoretical proofs showing that fundamental building blocks (e.g., pre-layer normalization, linear-attention modules) are almost surely surjective; they extend the result to generative frameworks like GPT-style transformers and diffusion models with deterministic ODE solvers, establishing conditions for invertibility.

Result: Surjectivity holds almost surely for key architectures; these models admit inverse mappings for arbitrary outputs, implying a formal basis for vulnerabilities to a broad class of adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: The work offers a formalism linking architectural surjectivity to model safety vulnerabilities and jailbreak risks, highlighting the need for safeguards and careful security considerations in generative models.

Abstract: Given a trained neural network, can any specified output be generated by some
input? Equivalently, does the network correspond to a function that is
surjective? In generative models, surjectivity implies that any output,
including harmful or undesirable content, can in principle be generated by the
networks, raising concerns about model safety and jailbreak vulnerabilities. In
this paper, we prove that many fundamental building blocks of modern neural
architectures, such as networks with pre-layer normalization and
linear-attention modules, are almost always surjective. As corollaries, widely
used generative frameworks, including GPT-style transformers and diffusion
models with deterministic ODE solvers, admit inverse mappings for arbitrary
outputs. By studying surjectivity of these modern and commonly used neural
architectures, we contribute a formalism that sheds light on their unavoidable
vulnerability to a broad class of adversarial attacks.

### [128] [The Sample Complexity of Membership Inference and Privacy Auditing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19458)
*Mahdi Haghifam,Adam Smith,Jonathan Ullman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In membership inference for Gaussian mean estimation, a successful attacker may need far more reference samples than the training data; the paper proves a lower bound Omega(n + n^2 rho^2) on the number of reference samples, showing attacks can be much stronger than previously used, with important practical implications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify how much distribution knowledge (via reference samples) an attacker needs to perform membership inference and whether practical attacks (using O(n) samples) suffice.

Method: Analyze the fundamental Gaussian mean-estimation setting where n samples from N(mu, Sigma) are used to estimate mu within a mean-squared error bound; derive lower bounds on the sample complexity of any successful membership-inference attack, showing Omega(n + n^2 rho^2) samples are sometimes necessary.

Result: Demonstrates that attackers may need asymptotically more samples than the learning algorithm uses; this is the first result showing a separation where information about the distribution increases the attack's sample complexity, implying existing O(n)-sample attacks may underestimate membership-inference risk.

Conclusion: Practical attacks restricted to O(n) samples may miss potential attacks that exploit distribution knowledge; if reference data is easy to obtain, stronger membership-inference attacks may exist, highlighting a gap between practice and theoretical risk.

Abstract: A membership-inference attack gets the output of a learning algorithm, and a
target individual, and tries to determine whether this individual is a member
of the training data or an independent sample from the same distribution. A
successful membership-inference attack typically requires the attacker to have
some knowledge about the distribution that the training data was sampled from,
and this knowledge is often captured through a set of independent reference
samples from that distribution. In this work we study how much information the
attacker needs for membership inference by investigating the sample
complexity-the minimum number of reference samples required-for a successful
attack. We study this question in the fundamental setting of Gaussian mean
estimation where the learning algorithm is given $n$ samples from a Gaussian
distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\Sigma)$ in $d$ dimensions, and tries to estimate
$\hat\mu$ up to some error $\mathbb{E}[\|\hat \mu - \mu\|^2_{\Sigma}]\leq
\rho^2 d$. Our result shows that for membership inference in this setting,
$\Omega(n + n^2 \rho^2)$ samples can be necessary to carry out any attack that
competes with a fully informed attacker. Our result is the first to show that
the attacker sometimes needs many more samples than the training algorithm uses
to train the model. This result has significant implications for practice, as
all attacks used in practice have a restricted form that uses $O(n)$ samples
and cannot benefit from $\omega(n)$ samples. Thus, these attacks may be
underestimating the possibility of membership inference, and better attacks may
be possible when information about the distribution is easy to obtain.

### [129] [Incentivized Lipschitz Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19466)
*Sourav Chakraborty,Amit Kiran Rege,Claire Monteleoni,Lijun Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Incentivized exploration for infinite-armed MABs via uniform discretization of the arm space; achieves sublinear regret and compensation with bounds depending on the space's covering dimension; extends to contextual bandits and validates findings numerically.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addressing how a principal can incentivize myopic agents to explore when arms form a continuum, while accounting for reward drift caused by compensation and ensuring long-run performance remains sublinear.

Method: Uniformly discretize the infinite arm space into a finite grid, design incentivized exploration algorithms that cope with reward drift due to incentives, prove sublinear regret and sublinear total compensation, and generalize the approach to contextual bandits.

Result: Derives regret and compensation bounds of tilde{O}(T^{d+1/d+2}) with d as the covering dimension; shows that both regret and total compensation grow sublinearly in time; results extend to contextual bandits with comparable guarantees.

Conclusion: Incentivized exploration in continuum-action MABs is viable: a simple discretization-based approach yields sublinear regret and compensation and can be extended to contexts. Further work could explore adaptive discretization, nonuniform metrics, and tighter (potentially dimension-independent) bounds.

Abstract: We study incentivized exploration in multi-armed bandit (MAB) settings with
infinitely many arms modeled as elements in continuous metric spaces. Unlike
classical bandit models, we consider scenarios where the decision-maker
(principal) incentivizes myopic agents to explore beyond their greedy choices
through compensation, but with the complication of reward drift--biased
feedback arising due to the incentives. We propose novel incentivized
exploration algorithms that discretize the infinite arm space uniformly and
demonstrate that these algorithms simultaneously achieve sublinear cumulative
regret and sublinear total compensation. Specifically, we derive regret and
compensation bounds of $\Tilde{O}(T^{d+1/d+2})$, with $d$ representing the
covering dimension of the metric space. Furthermore, we generalize our results
to contextual bandits, achieving comparable performance guarantees. We validate
our theoretical findings through numerical simulations.

### [130] [DeepAtlas: a tool for effective manifold learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19479)
*Serena Hughes,Timothy Hamilton,Tom Kolokotrones,Eric J. Deeds*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepAtlas introduces a local-manifold learning framework that tests the manifold hypothesis and learns maps from local embeddings to the original data; it uses topological distortion to infer whether data lie on a manifold and to estimate dimensionality; applied to test datasets, it learns manifold structures and reveals that many real datasets (e.g., single-cell RNA-seq) may not conform to the manifold hypothesis; when they do, it provides a generative model and potential differential-geometry tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The manifold hypothesis is often assumed but seldom tested in practice, and most existing tools produce global embeddings that do not align with the mathematical notion of local charts. There is a need for methods that (1) assess whether data lie on a manifold, (2) estimate the manifold’s local dimensionality, and (3) build local-to-global mappings that enable generative modeling.

Method: Compute and analyze local neighborhoods of data to learn low-dimensional local embeddings. Train deep neural networks that map between each local embedding and the corresponding original data. Use a topological distortion metric to determine whether the dataset is drawn from a manifold and to estimate its dimensionality. If the manifold assumption holds, assemble the local models into a global generative model.

Result: Empirical results show that DeepAtlas can learn manifold structures on test datasets. A surprising finding is that many real datasets, including single-cell RNA-sequencing data, do not conform to the manifold hypothesis. For datasets that do lie on a manifold, the approach yields a generative model and opens the possibility of applying differential-geometry tools to analyze the data.

Conclusion: DeepAtlas provides a principled framework to evaluate the manifold hypothesis, learn local manifold representations, and, when appropriate, construct a generative model. It uncovers that non-manifold structure is common in real data and suggests a pathway to leverage differential geometry for manifold-conformant datasets.

Abstract: Manifold learning builds on the "manifold hypothesis," which posits that data
in high-dimensional datasets are drawn from lower-dimensional manifolds.
Current tools generate global embeddings of data, rather than the local maps
used to define manifolds mathematically. These tools also cannot assess whether
the manifold hypothesis holds true for a dataset. Here, we describe DeepAtlas,
an algorithm that generates lower-dimensional representations of the data's
local neighborhoods, then trains deep neural networks that map between these
local embeddings and the original data. Topological distortion is used to
determine whether a dataset is drawn from a manifold and, if so, its
dimensionality. Application to test datasets indicates that DeepAtlas can
successfully learn manifold structures. Interestingly, many real datasets,
including single-cell RNA-sequencing, do not conform to the manifold
hypothesis. In cases where data is drawn from a manifold, DeepAtlas builds a
model that can be used generatively and promises to allow the application of
powerful tools from differential geometry to a variety of datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DSTL formalizes distribution shift in tabular learning and introduces SAFT, a differentiable, shift-aware feature transformation that improves robustness under distribution shifts via embedding decorrelation, sample reweighting, suboptimal embedding averaging, and normalization-based alignment; empirical results show superior robustness and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tabular models often deteriorate when training and testing distributions differ; robust, generalizable tabular learning is needed.

Method: SAFT reframes tabular learning as a continuous representation-generation problem rather than a discrete search. It optimizes transformed feature sets end-to-end and integrates three mechanisms: (i) shift-resistant representations via embedding decorrelation and sample reweighting, (ii) flatness-aware generation via suboptimal embedding averaging, (iii) normalization-based alignment between training and test distributions.

Result: SAFT consistently outperforms prior tabular learning methods in robustness, effectiveness, and generalization under diverse real-world distribution shifts.

Conclusion: SAFT provides a robust, generalizable framework for tabular learning under distribution shifts by combining differentiable representation generation with normalization-based alignment and decorrelation-based strategies.

Abstract: Tabular learning transforms raw features into optimized spaces for downstream
tasks, but its effectiveness deteriorates under distribution shifts between
training and testing data. We formalize this challenge as the Distribution
Shift Tabular Learning (DSTL) problem and propose a novel Shift-Aware Feature
Transformation (SAFT) framework to address it. SAFT reframes tabular learning
from a discrete search task into a continuous representation-generation
paradigm, enabling differentiable optimization over transformed feature sets.
SAFT integrates three mechanisms to ensure robustness: (i) shift-resistant
representation via embedding decorrelation and sample reweighting, (ii)
flatness-aware generation through suboptimal embedding averaging, and (iii)
normalization-based alignment between training and test distributions.
Extensive experiments show that SAFT consistently outperforms prior tabular
learning methods in terms of robustness, effectiveness, and generalization
ability under diverse real-world distribution shifts.

TL;DR: EQUATE is a data-efficient fine-tuning framework for equation discovery that reframes discrete search as continuous embedding optimization, achieving accurate, robust symbolic regression with fast inference on small datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pretrained models on large equation datasets often transfer poorly to small, domain-specific data; there is a need for data-efficient methods to enable interpretable symbolic regression in limited-data regimes.

Method: EQUATE distills foundation models for symbolic equation discovery and combines symbolic-numeric alignment with evaluator-guided embedding optimization. It reformulates discrete equation search as continuous optimization in a shared embedding space, guided by data-equation fitness and simplicity, enabling an embedding-search-generation paradigm.

Result: On three standard benchmarks (Feynman, Strogatz, and black-box datasets), EQUATE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in accuracy and robustness while preserving low complexity and fast inference.

Conclusion: EQUATE provides a practical and generalizable solution for data-efficient symbolic regression within foundation model distillation settings.

Abstract: Discovering interpretable mathematical equations from observed data (a.k.a.
equation discovery or symbolic regression) is a cornerstone of scientific
discovery, enabling transparent modeling of physical, biological, and economic
systems. While foundation models pre-trained on large-scale equation datasets
offer a promising starting point, they often suffer from negative transfer and
poor generalization when applied to small, domain-specific datasets. In this
paper, we introduce EQUATE (Equation Generation via QUality-Aligned Transfer
Embeddings), a data-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapts foundation
models for symbolic equation discovery in low-data regimes via distillation.
EQUATE combines symbolic-numeric alignment with evaluator-guided embedding
optimization, enabling a principled embedding-search-generation paradigm. Our
approach reformulates discrete equation search as a continuous optimization
task in a shared embedding space, guided by data-equation fitness and
simplicity. Experiments across three standard public benchmarks (Feynman,
Strogatz, and black-box datasets) demonstrate that EQUATE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and robustness, while
preserving low complexity and fast inference. These results highlight EQUATE as
a practical and generalizable solution for data-efficient symbolic regression
in foundation model distillation settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Extend FlipIt with PoolFlip (a multi-agent gym) and Flip-PSRO (MARL with population-based training) to train defenders that generalize against unknown adaptive attackers; claims 2x improvement and robust ownership-based utilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address brittleness and poor adaptation in existing FlipIt frameworks by enabling scalable, generalizable learning for defenders against stealthy, evolving adversaries.

Method: Introduce PoolFlip, a multi-agent gym environment for efficient learning in FlipIt; propose Flip-PSRO, a MARL approach using population-based training and ownership-based utility functions to train defender agents to generalize to unseen heuristics.

Result: Empirical results indicate Flip-PSRO defenders are about 2× more effective than baselines in generalizing to a heuristic attack not seen during training; defenders maintain high control while optimizing performance via ownership-based utilities.

Conclusion: PoolFlip and Flip-PSRO offer a robust, scalable framework for learning resilient defense strategies in FlipIt, improving generalization to unknown, adaptive attacks.

Abstract: Cyber defense requires automating defensive decision-making under stealthy,
deceptive, and continuously evolving adversarial strategies. The FlipIt game
provides a foundational framework for modeling interactions between a defender
and an advanced adversary that compromises a system without being immediately
detected. In FlipIt, the attacker and defender compete to control a shared
resource by performing a Flip action and paying a cost. However, the existing
FlipIt frameworks rely on a small number of heuristics or specialized learning
techniques, which can lead to brittleness and the inability to adapt to new
attacks. To address these limitations, we introduce PoolFlip, a multi-agent gym
environment that extends the FlipIt game to allow efficient learning for
attackers and defenders. Furthermore, we propose Flip-PSRO, a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that leverages population-based training
to train defender agents equipped to generalize against a range of unknown,
potentially adaptive opponents. Our empirical results suggest that Flip-PSRO
defenders are $2\times$ more effective than baselines to generalize to a
heuristic attack not exposed in training. In addition, our newly designed
ownership-based utility functions ensure that Flip-PSRO defenders maintain a
high level of control while optimizing performance.

*Zhiyi Kuang,Ryan Rong,YuCheng Yuan,Allen Nie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Generative optimization of Python-based game policies using LLMs enables self-improving agents that require fewer environment interactions, achieving Atari-level performance competitive with deep RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce data and human effort in reinforcement learning by shifting policy representation from fixed architectures to executable code that can be iteratively refined by language models, enabling long-horizon reasoning.

Method: Policies are Python programs that map observations to actions. The system uses LLMs to generate policy variants, executes them to collect traces, uses natural language feedback to guide refinement, and updates the program over time with minimal human input. Evaluated on Atari games, the approach yields competitive performance with strong efficiency gains.

Result: Atari experiments show the Python program-based agent reaches performance competitive with deep RL baselines while using far less training time and far fewer environment interactions.

Conclusion: Programmatic policy representations with LLM-guided self-improvement can yield efficient, adaptable agents capable of complex reasoning with reduced data requirements.

Abstract: We present a generative optimization approach for learning game-playing
agents, where policies are represented as Python programs and refined using
large language models (LLMs). Our method treats decision-making policies as
self-evolving code, with current observation as input and an in-game action as
output, enabling agents to self-improve through execution traces and natural
language feedback with minimal human intervention. Applied to Atari games, our
game-playing Python program achieves performance competitive with deep
reinforcement learning (RL) baselines while using significantly less training
time and much fewer environment interactions. This work highlights the promise
of programmatic policy representations for building efficient, adaptable agents
capable of complex, long-horizon reasoning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MobText-SISA extends Sharded, Isolated, Sliced, and Aggregated training to heterogeneous spatio-temporal data, enabling exact unlearning by retraining only the affected shard; it preserves accuracy and improves convergence compared to random sharding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GDPR and similar privacy statutes require that individuals' contributions be unlearned on demand. Retraining full models for each delete request is impractical, especially for large multimodal mobility data. A scalable unlearning framework for spatio-temporal data is needed.

Method: Embed numerical and linguistic features into a shared latent space, use similarity-aware clustering to assign samples to shards with preserved inter-shard diversity, train shards incrementally, and aggregate shard predictions at inference. Upon deletion, retrain only the affected shard from its last valid checkpoint to guarantee exact unlearning.

Result: On a ten-month real-world mobility log, MobText-SISA maintains baseline predictive accuracy and consistently outperforms random sharding in both error and convergence speed.

Conclusion: MobText-SISA provides a practical, privacy-preserving foundation for analytics on multimodal mobility data at urban scale by enabling scalable, exact unlearning with minimal impact on performance.

Abstract: Modern mobility platforms have stored vast streams of GPS trajectories,
temporal metadata, free-form textual notes, and other unstructured data.
Privacy statutes such as the GDPR require that any individual's contribution be
unlearned on demand, yet retraining deep models from scratch for every request
is untenable. We introduce MobText-SISA, a scalable machine-unlearning
framework that extends Sharded, Isolated, Sliced, and Aggregated (SISA)
training to heterogeneous spatio-temporal data. MobText-SISA first embeds each
trip's numerical and linguistic features into a shared latent space, then
employs similarity-aware clustering to distribute samples across shards so that
future deletions touch only a single constituent model while preserving
inter-shard diversity. Each shard is trained incrementally; at inference time,
constituent predictions are aggregated to yield the output. Deletion requests
trigger retraining solely of the affected shard from its last valid checkpoint,
guaranteeing exact unlearning. Experiments on a ten-month real-world mobility
log demonstrate that MobText-SISA (i) sustains baseline predictive accuracy,
and (ii) consistently outperforms random sharding in both error and convergence
speed. These results establish MobText-SISA as a practical foundation for
privacy-compliant analytics on multimodal mobility data at urban scale.

*Hejia Liu,Mochen Yang,Gediminas Adomavicius*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs used for data fitting are highly sensitive to task-irrelevant data representations (e.g., variable names), undermining robustness; even TabPFN shows vulnerabilities.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand robustness gaps when using LLMs for data fitting, given their growing plug-and-play use for predicting from structured data.

Method: Empirical study across in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning for both closed-weight and open-weight LLMs; manipulate data representations (names, ordering) and measure prediction changes; analyze attention patterns; compare with TabPFN.

Result: Prediction error can swing dramatically (up to ~82%) due to task-irrelevant changes; attention is non-uniform, favoring certain prompt positions; TabPFN, despite design for robustness, is still not immune.

Conclusion: LLMs currently lack basic robustness for data-fitting tasks; more work is needed to make them principled data-fitting tools, including strategies to mitigate sensitivity to representation and attention biases.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being applied in a wide array of settings,
well beyond the typical language-oriented use cases. In particular, LLMs are
increasingly used as a plug-and-play method for fitting data and generating
predictions. Prior work has shown that LLMs, via in-context learning or
supervised fine-tuning, can perform competitively with many tabular supervised
learning techniques in terms of predictive performance. However, we identify a
critical vulnerability of using LLMs for data fitting -- making changes to data
representation that are completely irrelevant to the underlying learning task
can drastically alter LLMs' predictions on the same data. For example, simply
changing variable names can sway the size of prediction error by as much as 82%
in certain settings. Such prediction sensitivity with respect to
task-irrelevant variations manifests under both in-context learning and
supervised fine-tuning, for both close-weight and open-weight general-purpose
LLMs. Moreover, by examining the attention scores of an open-weight LLM, we
discover a non-uniform attention pattern: training examples and variable
names/values which happen to occupy certain positions in the prompt receive
more attention when output tokens are generated, even though different
positions are expected to receive roughly the same attention. This partially
explains the sensitivity in the presence of task-irrelevant variations. We also
consider a state-of-the-art tabular foundation model (TabPFN) trained
specifically for data fitting. Despite being explicitly designed to achieve
prediction robustness, TabPFN is still not immune to task-irrelevant
variations. Overall, despite LLMs' impressive predictive capabilities,
currently they lack even the basic level of robustness to be used as a
principled data-fitting tool.

Motivation: Generalization in fine-tuning large pre-trained models with limited data is challenging. Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization but incurs high memory and computation costs. Directly applying SAM to LoRA constrains perturbations to a limited subspace, reducing effectiveness.

Method: Introduce an auxiliary LoRA module to capture SAM's adversarial weight perturbations while the primary LoRA module is optimized by standard gradient descent. The two modules operate in parallel, decoupling perturbation from optimization to enable simultaneous training and perturbation in a memory-efficient way.

Result: Bi-LoRA demonstrates improved generalization across diverse tasks and architectures, with greater efficiency and lower training overhead than standard SAM or naive LoRA-SAM approaches, validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: Bi-LoRA offers a practical, memory-efficient way to integrate sharpness-aware optimization into parameter-efficient fine-tuning, achieving flatter minima and better generalization without doubling training costs.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models with limited data presents
significant challenges for generalization. While Sharpness-Aware Minimization
(SAM) has proven effective in improving generalization by seeking flat minima,
its substantial extra memory and computation overhead make it impractical for
large models. Integrating SAM with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a promising direction. However, we find that
directly applying SAM to LoRA parameters limits the sharpness optimization to a
restricted subspace, hindering its effectiveness. To address this limitation,
we propose Bi-directional Low-Rank Adaptation (Bi-LoRA), which introduces an
auxiliary LoRA module to model SAM's adversarial weight perturbations. It
decouples SAM's weight perturbations from LoRA optimization: the primary LoRA
module adapts to specific tasks via standard gradient descent, while the
auxiliary module captures the sharpness of the loss landscape through gradient
ascent. Such dual-module design enables Bi-LoRA to capture broader sharpness
for achieving flatter minima while remaining memory-efficient. Another
important benefit is that the dual design allows for simultaneous optimization
and perturbation, eliminating SAM's doubled training costs. Extensive
experiments across diverse tasks and architectures demonstrate Bi-LoRA's
efficiency and effectiveness in enhancing generalization.

### [138] [Counterfactual Reward Model Training for Bias Mitigation in Multimodal Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19567)
*Sheryl Mathew,N Harshit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A counterfactual, bias-resilient RLHF reward model using a Counterfactual Trust Score to mitigate bias in multimodal data, showing improved fake news detection and reduced spurious correlations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF can amplify latent biases in multimodal datasets, producing flawed reward signals and unfair policies; passive bias constraints often fail under causal confounding; a causal, counterfactual approach is needed for robust, fair RLHF.

Method: Introduce Counterfactual Trust Score comprising: (1) counterfactual shifts to separate political framing bias from topical bias; (2) reconstruction uncertainty under counterfactual perturbations; (3) assessment of violations of fairness rules for protected attributes; and (4) temporal reward shifts aligned with dynamic trust. Train on a multimodal fake-vs-true news dataset with framing bias, class imbalance, and drift. Inject synthetic bias across sequential batches; follow unsupervised drift-detection methods from representation-based distances and temporal robustness benchmarking for LMs to test robustness.

Result: The system achieved 89.12% accuracy in fake news detection, outperforming baseline reward models, and reduced spurious correlations and unfair reinforcement signals.

Conclusion: Presents a robust, interpretable fairness-aware RLHF framework with tunable bias reduction thresholds, enhancing reliability and fairness in dynamic real-time policy making.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), reward models can
efficiently learn and amplify latent biases within multimodal datasets, which
can lead to imperfect policy optimization through flawed reward signals and
decreased fairness. Bias mitigation studies have often applied passive
constraints, which can fail under causal confounding. Here, we present a
counterfactual reward model that introduces causal inference with multimodal
representation learning to provide an unsupervised, bias-resilient reward
signal. The heart of our contribution is the Counterfactual Trust Score, an
aggregated score consisting of four components: (1) counterfactual shifts that
decompose political framing bias from topical bias; (2) reconstruction
uncertainty during counterfactual perturbations; (3) demonstrable violations of
fairness rules for each protected attribute; and (4) temporal reward shifts
aligned with dynamic trust measures. We evaluated the framework on a multimodal
fake versus true news dataset, which exhibits framing bias, class imbalance,
and distributional drift. Following methodologies similar to unsupervised drift
detection from representation-based distances [1] and temporal robustness
benchmarking in language models [2], we also inject synthetic bias across
sequential batches to test robustness. The resulting system achieved an
accuracy of 89.12% in fake news detection, outperforming the baseline reward
models. More importantly, it reduced spurious correlations and unfair
reinforcement signals. This pipeline outlines a robust and interpretable
approach to fairness-aware RLHF, offering tunable bias reduction thresholds and
increasing reliability in dynamic real-time policy making.

### [140] [Escaping Stability-Plasticity Dilemma in Online Continual Learning for Motion Forecasting via Synergetic Memory Rehearsal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19571)
*Yunlong Lin,Chao Lu,Tongshuai Wu,Xiaocong Zhao,Guodong Du,Yanwei Sun,Zirui Li,Jianwei Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SyReM is a memory-based continual learning method for DNN motion forecasting that constrains memory-loss drift and uses gradient-based selective rehearsal to reduce forgetting and improve new-data accuracy in an online one-pass setting across 11 driving datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DNN-based motion forecasting suffers from catastrophic forgetting in online continual learning; there is a stability-plasticity trade-off where preserving past knowledge (stability) can hinder learning of new data (plasticity). The paper aims to address this balance for robust forecasting.

Method: Maintain a compact memory buffer of learned knowledge; enforce an inequality constraint to limit increments in the average loss on the memory buffer (stability); perform selective memory rehearsal by replaying memory samples most similar to recently observed data, determined via online cosine similarity of loss gradients; operate in an online CL paradigm with one-pass data stream; validated on 11 INTERACTION driving datasets.

Result: SyReM substantially mitigates catastrophic forgetting on past scenarios and improves forecasting accuracy on new scenarios compared with non-CL and baseline CL methods.

Conclusion: SyReM effectively resolves the stability-plasticity dilemma in online motion forecasting by combining memory stability constraints with targeted memory rehearsal, achieving better continual performance; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNN) have achieved remarkable success in motion
forecasting. However, most DNN-based methods suffer from catastrophic
forgetting and fail to maintain their performance in previously learned
scenarios after adapting to new data. Recent continual learning (CL) studies
aim to mitigate this phenomenon by enhancing memory stability of DNN, i.e., the
ability to retain learned knowledge. Yet, excessive emphasis on the memory
stability often impairs learning plasticity, i.e., the capacity of DNN to
acquire new information effectively. To address such stability-plasticity
dilemma, this study proposes a novel CL method, synergetic memory rehearsal
(SyReM), for DNN-based motion forecasting. SyReM maintains a compact memory
buffer to represent learned knowledge. To ensure memory stability, it employs
an inequality constraint that limits increments in the average loss over the
memory buffer. Synergistically, a selective memory rehearsal mechanism is
designed to enhance learning plasticity by selecting samples from the memory
buffer that are most similar to recently observed data. This selection is based
on an online-measured cosine similarity of loss gradients, ensuring targeted
memory rehearsal. Since replayed samples originate from learned scenarios, this
memory rehearsal mechanism avoids compromising memory stability. We validate
SyReM under an online CL paradigm where training samples from diverse scenarios
arrive as a one-pass stream. Experiments on 11 naturalistic driving datasets
from INTERACTION demonstrate that, compared to non-CL and CL baselines, SyReM
significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting in past scenarios while
improving forecasting accuracy in new ones. The implementation is publicly
available at https://github.com/BIT-Jack/SyReM.

### [141] [Delta-Audit: Explaining What Changes When Models Change](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19589)
*Arshia Hemmat,Afsaneh Fatemi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Delta-Attribution: a model-agnostic audit that diffs per-feature attributions across model versions to explain what changed, with a dedicated quality suite and cross-family evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model updates often impact performance but the reasons are opaque. A systematic, attribution-based audit is needed to distinguish meaningful behavioral changes from cosmetic tweaks.

Method: Compute delta attributions Δφ(x)=φB(x)−φA(x) via fast occlusion/clamping in standardized space with class-anchored margin and baseline averaging. Evaluate across a Delta-Attribution Quality Suite (magnitude/sparsity; agreement/shift; behavioural alignment; robustness) and audit 45 settings (5 model families × 3 datasets × 3 A/B pairs).

Result: Inductive-bias changes drive large, behavior-aligned deltas; specific examples include SVC poly→rbf on Breast Cancer (BAC≈0.998, DCE≈6.6) and RF feature-rule swaps on Digits (BAC≈0.997, DCE≈7.5). Cosmetic tweaks yield near-zero behavior changes (rank-overlap@10=1.0, DCE≈0). Deep GB on Breast Cancer shows the largest redistribution (JSD≈0.357). Delta-Attribution serves as a lightweight audit distinguishing benign changes from meaningful/risky shifts.

Conclusion: Delta-Attribution provides a practical update audit that complements accuracy by revealing whether observed changes are behaviorally consequential or benign.

Abstract: Model updates (new hyperparameters, kernels, depths, solvers, or data) change
performance, but the \emph{reason} often remains opaque. We introduce
\textbf{Delta-Attribution} (\mbox{$\Delta$-Attribution}), a model-agnostic
framework that explains \emph{what changed} between versions $A$ and $B$ by
differencing per-feature attributions: $\Delta\phi(x)=\phi_B(x)-\phi_A(x)$. We
evaluate $\Delta\phi$ with a \emph{$\Delta$-Attribution Quality Suite} covering
magnitude/sparsity (L1, Top-$k$, entropy), agreement/shift (rank-overlap@10,
Jensen--Shannon divergence), behavioural alignment (Delta Conservation Error,
DCE; Behaviour--Attribution Coupling, BAC; CO$\Delta$F), and robustness (noise,
baseline sensitivity, grouped occlusion).
  Instantiated via fast occlusion/clamping in standardized space with a
class-anchored margin and baseline averaging, we audit 45 settings: five
classical families (Logistic Regression, SVC, Random Forests, Gradient
Boosting, $k$NN), three datasets (Breast Cancer, Wine, Digits), and three A/B
pairs per family. \textbf{Findings.} Inductive-bias changes yield large,
behaviour-aligned deltas (e.g., SVC poly$\!\rightarrow$rbf on Breast Cancer:
BAC$\approx$0.998, DCE$\approx$6.6; Random Forest feature-rule swap on Digits:
BAC$\approx$0.997, DCE$\approx$7.5), while ``cosmetic'' tweaks (SVC
\texttt{gamma=scale} vs.\ \texttt{auto}, $k$NN search) show
rank-overlap@10$=1.0$ and DCE$\approx$0. The largest redistribution appears for
deeper GB on Breast Cancer (JSD$\approx$0.357). $\Delta$-Attribution offers a
lightweight update audit that complements accuracy by distinguishing benign
changes from behaviourally meaningful or risky reliance shifts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Dual-LS introduces a task-free online continual learning framework for DNN-based vehicle motion forecasting that uses two memory replay mechanisms to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and reduce computation, achieving strong real-world performance without extra data collection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting in DNN-based vehicle motion forecasting hinders continual learning in smart-city contexts. Traditional fixes require larger datasets or replay, which is data-intensive and sample-inefficient, failing to balance long- and short-term experience.

Method: Dual-LS is a task-free, online continual learning paradigm that pairs two synergistic memory rehearsal replay mechanisms to accelerate experience retrieval and dynamically coordinate long-term and short-term knowledge representations.

Result: On naturalistic data from three countries with 772,000 vehicles and 11,187 km of testing, Dual-LS mitigates catastrophic forgetting by up to 74.31% and reduces computational resource demand by up to 94.02%, improving predictive stability without increasing data requirements.

Conclusion: Dual-LS provides computation-efficient, human-like continual learning for DNN-based vehicle motion forecasting suitable for smart cities, addressing forgetting without additional data collection.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence underpins most smart city services, yet deep neural
network (DNN) that forecasts vehicle motion still struggle with catastrophic
forgetting, the loss of earlier knowledge when models are updated. Conventional
fixes enlarge the training set or replay past data, but these strategies incur
high data collection costs, sample inefficiently and fail to balance long- and
short-term experience, leaving them short of human-like continual learning.
Here we introduce Dual-LS, a task-free, online continual learning paradigm for
DNN-based motion forecasting that is inspired by the complementary learning
system of the human brain. Dual-LS pairs two synergistic memory rehearsal
replay mechanisms to accelerate experience retrieval while dynamically
coordinating long-term and short-term knowledge representations. Tests on
naturalistic data spanning three countries, over 772,000 vehicles and
cumulative testing mileage of 11,187 km show that Dual-LS mitigates
catastrophic forgetting by up to 74.31\% and reduces computational resource
demand by up to 94.02\%, markedly boosting predictive stability in vehicle
motion forecasting without inflating data requirements. Meanwhile, it endows
DNN-based vehicle motion forecasting with computation efficient and human-like
continual learning adaptability fit for smart cities.

### [143] [Encouraging Good Processes Without the Need for Good Answers: Reinforcement Learning for LLM Agent Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19598)
*Zhiwei Li,Yong Hu,Wenqing Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLTR decouples planning optimization by using a tool-use completion reward, yielding notable gains in planning and overall agent performance compared to end-to-end training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: End-to-end multi-objective optimization with imbalanced objective allocation and scarce verifiable data hampers planning quality in LLM agents; a direct reward signal for tool usage can better train planning.

Method: Introduce Reinforcement Learning with Tool-use Rewards (RLTR), a framework that decouples training to single-objective optimization focused on the planning module, using a tool-use completeness reward to evaluate tool invocation sequences without requiring verifiable data.

Result: 8–12% improvement in planning performance over end-to-end baselines; the improved planning translates to a 5–6% increase in the final response quality of the overall agent system.

Conclusion: A decoupled planning-focused RL framework with a tool-use reward provides a more direct, reliable training signal, improves planning, and yields measurable gains in overall agent performance, potentially reducing reliance on verifiable data.

Abstract: The functionality of Large Language Model (LLM) agents is primarily
determined by two capabilities: action planning and answer summarization. The
former, action planning, is the core capability that dictates an agent's
performance. However, prevailing training paradigms employ end-to-end,
multi-objective optimization that jointly trains both capabilities. This
paradigm faces two critical challenges: imbalanced optimization objective
allocation and scarcity of verifiable data, making it difficult to enhance the
agent's planning capability. To address these challenges, we propose
Reinforcement Learning with Tool-use Rewards (RLTR), a novel framework that
decouples the training process to enable a focused, single-objective
optimization of the planning module. Crucially, RLTR introduces a reward signal
based on tool-use completeness to directly evaluate the quality of tool
invocation sequences. This method offers a more direct and reliable training
signal than assessing the final response content, thereby obviating the need
for verifiable data. Our experiments demonstrate that RLTR achieves an 8%-12%
improvement in planning performance compared to end-to-end baselines. Moreover,
this enhanced planning capability, in turn, translates to a 5%-6% increase in
the final response quality of the overall agent system.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FinCast is a foundation model for financial time-series forecasting that achieves strong zero-shot performance across domains and temporal resolutions, outperforming prior methods without domain-specific fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial time-series forecasting is hindered by pattern shifts due to temporal non-stationarity, cross-domain diversity (stocks, commodities, futures), and varying temporal resolutions. Existing deep learning methods tend to overfit and require substantial domain-specific fine-tuning. A generalizable foundation model could address these challenges.

Method: Introduce FinCast, the first foundation model designed for financial time-series forecasting, trained on large-scale financial data. The model purportedly learns cross-domain and multi-resolution patterns to enable robust zero-shot forecasting without domain-specific fine-tuning. Evaluation includes empirical and qualitative analyses comparing against state-of-the-art methods.

Result: FinCast exhibits robust zero-shot performance and surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse financial patterns and domains.

Conclusion: Foundation models like FinCast show promise for finance by reducing reliance on domain-specific tuning and improving generalization across time-series with varying domains and resolutions.

Abstract: Financial time-series forecasting is critical for maintaining economic
stability, guiding informed policymaking, and promoting sustainable investment
practices. However, it remains challenging due to various underlying pattern
shifts. These shifts arise primarily from three sources: temporal
non-stationarity (distribution changes over time), multi-domain diversity
(distinct patterns across financial domains such as stocks, commodities, and
futures), and varying temporal resolutions (patterns differing across
per-second, hourly, daily, or weekly indicators). While recent deep learning
methods attempt to address these complexities, they frequently suffer from
overfitting and typically require extensive domain-specific fine-tuning. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce FinCast, the first foundation model
specifically designed for financial time-series forecasting, trained on
large-scale financial datasets. Remarkably, FinCast exhibits robust zero-shot
performance, effectively capturing diverse patterns without domain-specific
fine-tuning. Comprehensive empirical and qualitative evaluations demonstrate
that FinCast surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its
strong generalization capabilities.

*Chenzhi Liu,Mahsa Baktashmotlagh,Yanran Tang,Zi Huang,Ruihong Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ALSA is a logit-space, anchor-based framework for estimating model accuracy on unlabeled data under distribution shifts, outperforming softmax- and similarity-based baselines by preserving richer information in logits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimating predictive accuracy on unlabeled data under distribution shifts is essential for real-world ML, but existing methods rely on softmax probabilities (lossy when compressed from logits) or costly, domain-specific similarity measures. A method that preserves logit information could provide more reliable estimates.

Method: ALSA introduces multiple learnable anchors in logit space, each with an influence function to capture variations in the logits. The model aggregates information from these anchors to estimate accuracy, leveraging the observed correlation between logit distributions and predictive performance.

Result: Extensive experiments across vision, language, and graph benchmarks show ALSA outperforms softmax- and similarity-based baselines, with strong robustness to significant distribution shifts.

Conclusion: Preserving logit information via anchor-based modeling yields robust, accurate accuracy estimation on unseen, unlabeled data, suggesting ALSA as a practical tool for reliable model evaluation across domains.

Abstract: Estimating model accuracy on unseen, unlabeled datasets is crucial for
real-world machine learning applications, especially under distribution shifts
that can degrade performance. Existing methods often rely on predicted class
probabilities (softmax scores) or data similarity metrics. While softmax-based
approaches benefit from representing predictions on the standard simplex,
compressing logits into probabilities leads to information loss. Meanwhile,
similarity-based methods can be computationally expensive and domain-specific,
limiting their broader applicability. In this paper, we introduce ALSA (Anchors
in Logit Space for Accuracy estimation), a novel framework that preserves
richer information by operating directly in the logit space. Building on
theoretical insights and empirical observations, we demonstrate that the
aggregation and distribution of logits exhibit a strong correlation with the
predictive performance of the model. To exploit this property, ALSA employs an
anchor-based modeling strategy: multiple learnable anchors are initialized in
logit space, each assigned an influence function that captures subtle
variations in the logits. This allows ALSA to provide robust and accurate
performance estimates across a wide range of distribution shifts. Extensive
experiments on vision, language, and graph benchmarks demonstrate ALSA's
superiority over both softmax- and similarity-based baselines. Notably, ALSA's
robustness under significant distribution shifts highlights its potential as a
practical tool for reliable model evaluation.

*Tiandi Ye,Wenyan Liu,Kai Yao,Lichun Li,Shangchao Su,Cen Chen,Xiang Li,Shan Yin,Ming Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes pFedBayesPT, a fine-grained instance-wise personalized federated learning method that uses visual prompt tuning with a Bayesian treatment of prompts. It models the prompt distribution implicitly via semi-implicit variational inference and shows consistent improvements over existing pFL methods under feature and label heterogeneity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In FL, data heterogeneity across clients leads to suboptimal performance, and intra-client heterogeneity (a single client having data from multiple domains) challenges single-model personalization. A more fine-grained, instance-wise personalization can better capture diverse data sources.

Method: Introduce instance-wise prompt generation tied to each data instance using visual prompts. Frame prompt learning as a Bayesian problem, modeling the prompt posterior as an implicit distribution. Train with a semi-implicit variational inference objective in a federated setting to personalize at the instance level.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that pFedBayesPT consistently outperforms existing personalized FL methods under both feature and label heterogeneity settings.

Conclusion: Instance-wise, Bayesian prompt-tuning in federated learning effectively handles intra-client heterogeneity and improves personalization beyond traditional client-level models.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm
that enables collaborative model training across multiple distributed clients
without disclosing their raw data. Personalized federated learning (pFL) has
gained increasing attention for its ability to address data heterogeneity.
However, most existing pFL methods assume that each client's data follows a
single distribution and learn one client-level personalized model for each
client. This assumption often fails in practice, where a single client may
possess data from multiple sources or domains, resulting in significant
intra-client heterogeneity and suboptimal performance. To tackle this
challenge, we propose pFedBayesPT, a fine-grained instance-wise pFL framework
based on visual prompt tuning. Specifically, we formulate instance-wise prompt
generation from a Bayesian perspective and model the prompt posterior as an
implicit distribution to capture diverse visual semantics. We derive a
variational training objective under the semi-implicit variational inference
framework. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
pFedBayesPT consistently outperforms existing pFL methods under both feature
and label heterogeneity settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SCAR introduces a data-structure framework (Scale, Coverage, Authenticity, Richness) to predict and guide data utility for foundation models, plus a minimal Foundation Data subset and SCAR-guided data completion for multimodal datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models' generalization depends on structural properties of data; existing data-centric approaches focus on quantity and efficiency and lack theory on how data properties affect generalization under scaling. A stable, scaling-invariant data characterization is needed.

Method: Define SCAR measures (Scale, Coverage, Authenticity, Richness). Propose Foundation Data: a minimal subset that preserves generalization without model-specific retraining. Model single-modality tasks as step functions to estimate generalization-bias distribution, and use this to compute a foundation data size distribution. Develop SCAR-guided data completion to efficiently and modality-awareness expand modality-specific characteristics in multimodal datasets.

Result: SCAR can predict data utility and guide data acquisition across diverse multimodal datasets and architectures. Foundation Data subset preserves generalization with no retraining. SCAR-guided data completion enables efficient, modality-aware expansion of data characteristics. Code is available at the project repository.

Conclusion: SCAR provides a robust, scaling-invariant framework to understand data quality and its impact on generalization, enabling principled, data-centric improvements and guiding data collection and augmentation for foundation models.

Abstract: Foundation models exhibit remarkable generalization across diverse tasks,
largely driven by the characteristics of their training data. Recent
data-centric methods like pruning and compression aim to optimize training but
offer limited theoretical insight into how data properties affect
generalization, especially the data characteristics in sample scaling.
Traditional perspectives further constrain progress by focusing predominantly
on data quantity and training efficiency, often overlooking structural aspects
of data quality. In this study, we introduce SCAR, a principled scheme for
characterizing the intrinsic structural properties of datasets across four key
measures: Scale, Coverage, Authenticity, and Richness. Unlike prior
data-centric measures, SCAR captures stable characteristics that remain
invariant under dataset scaling, providing a robust and general foundation for
data understanding. Leveraging these structural properties, we introduce
Foundation Data-a minimal subset that preserves the generalization behavior of
the full dataset without requiring model-specific retraining. We model
single-modality tasks as step functions and estimate the distribution of the
foundation data size to capture step-wise generalization bias across modalities
in the target multi-modal dataset. Finally, we develop a SCAR-guided data
completion strategy based on this generalization bias, which enables efficient,
modality-aware expansion of modality-specific characteristics in multimodal
datasets. Experiments across diverse multi-modal datasets and model
architectures validate the effectiveness of SCAR in predicting data utility and
guiding data acquisition. Code is available at https://github.com/McAloma/SCAR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Conventional stress monitoring is episodic and relies on rigid silicon wearables. Flexible electronics promise continuous, low-cost, conformable monitoring but pose integration and power challenges for ML classifiers.

Method: Systematic design-space exploration across various ML classifiers, feature selections, and neural simplification techniques, followed by fully customized low-precision hardware implementations for each variant to optimize energy, area, and latency.

Result: Identified design choices and classifier-hardware pairs that can achieve real-time stress detection with higher accuracy than current methods, while reducing cost, size, and power via low-precision, customized circuits across 1200+ variants.

Conclusion: Presents a feasible pathway for real-time, low-cost, conformable stress classifiers on flexible electronics and provides a broad design-space framework to guide future hardware-efficient ML in FE for stress monitoring.

Abstract: Conventional stress monitoring relies on episodic, symptom-focused
interventions, missing the need for continuous, accessible, and cost-efficient
solutions. State-of-the-art approaches use rigid, silicon-based wearables,
which, though capable of multitasking, are not optimized for lightweight,
flexible wear, limiting their practicality for continuous monitoring. In
contrast, flexible electronics (FE) offer flexibility and low manufacturing
costs, enabling real-time stress monitoring circuits. However, implementing
complex circuits like machine learning (ML) classifiers in FE is challenging
due to integration and power constraints. Previous research has explored
flexible biosensors and ADCs, but classifier design for stress detection
remains underexplored. This work presents the first comprehensive design space
exploration of low-power, flexible stress classifiers. We cover various ML
classifiers, feature selection, and neural simplification algorithms, with over
1200 flexible classifiers. To optimize hardware efficiency, fully customized
circuits with low-precision arithmetic are designed in each case. Our
exploration provides insights into designing real-time stress classifiers that
offer higher accuracy than current methods, while being low-cost, conformable,
and ensuring low power and compact size.

Conclusion: Supports practical use in physics-informed symbolic regression by providing provable C^1-approximation guarantees for rational models and architectures used in learning physical laws.

Abstract: We show that suitably regular functions can be approximated in the
$\mathcal{C}^1$-norm both with rational functions and rational neural networks,
including approximation rates with respect to width and depth of the network,
and degree of the rational functions. As consequence of our results, we further
obtain $\mathcal{C}^1$-approximation results for rational neural networks with

particular in the context of symbolic regression for physical law learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize and compare walks on graphs under a rigorous metric/proximity theory, enabling Lipschitz analysis, extrapolation, and learning tasks on networked data.

Method: Define a weighted metric on sequences of vertices (walks) using stepwise distances and weighted norms; study metric-space properties; introduce proximities as weaker distance measures; derive representation formulas under various assumptions; construct explicit examples; extend Lipschitz functions from subspaces to the entire walk space.

Result: Established a coherent metric and proximity framework for walks; provided representation formulas and explicit constructions; demonstrated Lipschitz-function extension while preserving properties; enabling proximities estimation and RL strategies via exploratory walks.

Conclusion: The framework supports robust Lipschitz modeling on graphs, facilitates proximity-based analysis and RL on networks, and offers a foundation for future development of Lipschitz regression and related tools in graph-based learning.

Abstract: We study the metric structure of walks on graphs, understood as Lipschitz
sequences. To this end, a weighted metric is introduced to handle sequences,
enabling the definition of distances between walks based on stepwise vertex
distances and weighted norms. We analyze the main properties of these metric
spaces, which provides the foundation for the analysis of weaker forms of
instruments to measure relative distances between walks: proximities. We
provide some representation formulas for such proximities under different
assumptions and provide explicit constructions for these cases. The resulting
metric framework allows the use of classical tools from metric modeling, such
as the extension of Lipschitz functions from subspaces of walks, which permits
extending proximity functions while preserving fundamental properties via the
mentioned representations. Potential applications include the estimation of
proximities and the development of reinforcement learning strategies based on
exploratory walks, offering a robust approach to Lipschitz regression on
network structures.

### [151] [Tune My Adam, Please!](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19733)
*Theodoros Athanasiadis,Steven Adriaensen,Samuel Müller,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Adam-PFN, a pre-trained surrogate for Freeze-thaw BO targeting Adam hyperparameters, coupled with CDF-augment to augment learning curves; this boosts extrapolation and speeds hyperparameter tuning on TaskSet, including OOD tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyperparameter tuning of Adam is tedious and costly; existing Freeze-thaw BO uses generic surrogates lacking prior knowledge about how hyperparameters affect learning; need data-efficient, prior-informed surrogates to improve sample efficiency and robustness, especially on out-of-distribution tasks.

Method: Pre-train Adam-PFN on learning curves from TaskSet; propose CDF-augment to enlarge dataset; integrate into Freeze-thaw Bayesian Optimization for Adam hyperparameters; evaluate on TaskSet evaluation tasks and OOD tasks.

Result: Better learning curve extrapolation; faster hyperparameter optimization; improved performance on TaskSet tasks and strong results on OOD tasks.

Conclusion: Adam-PFN with CF-augment provides a more effective, data-efficient surrogate for Freeze-thaw BO in Adam hyperparameter tuning, potentially generalizable to other optimizers and settings.

Abstract: The Adam optimizer remains one of the most widely used optimizers in deep
learning, and effectively tuning its hyperparameters is key to optimizing
performance. However, tuning can be tedious and costly. Freeze-thaw Bayesian
Optimization (BO) is a recent promising approach for low-budget hyperparameter
tuning, but is limited by generic surrogates without prior knowledge of how
hyperparameters affect learning. We propose Adam-PFN, a new surrogate model for
Freeze-thaw BO of Adam's hyperparameters, pre-trained on learning curves from
TaskSet, together with a new learning curve augmentation method, CDF-augment,
which artificially increases the number of available training examples. Our
approach improves both learning curve extrapolation and accelerates
hyperparameter optimization on TaskSet evaluation tasks, with strong
performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks.

### [152] [InfraredGP: Efficient Graph Partitioning via Spectral Graph Neural Networks with Negative Corrections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19737)
*Meng Qin,Weihua Li,Jinqiang Cui,Sen Pei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InfraredGP is a training-free graph partitioning method that uses a spectral GNN with negative correction to exploit low-frequency information beyond the conventional [0,2] range, achieving competitive GP results with substantial efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph partitioning/community detection traditionally relies on low-pass spectral information within the standard frequency range. The authors propose amplifying atypical low-frequency signals via negative correction to obtain richer embeddings for clustering, enabling training-free GP, beneficial for static and streaming graphs.

Method: Employ a spectral GNN backbone with low-pass filters and a negative correction mechanism. Feed only random inputs to the backbone, perform a single forward pass to derive embeddings, and apply BIRCH clustering to obtain graph partitions; evaluate on IEEE HPEC Graph Challenge benchmarks for both static and streaming GP.

Result: The negative-correction-informed embeddings yield distinguishable structures enabling GP without training. InfraredGP achieves competitive quality compared with baselines while delivering significantly higher efficiency (e.g., 16x–23x faster) on static/streaming GP tasks, with public code available.

Conclusion: Negative correction that amplifies low-frequency information beyond the conventional range can enable effective, training-free graph partitioning. InfraredGP demonstrates strong efficiency and competitive GP quality, contributing insights into spectral-domain approaches for community detection and offering a practical, ready-to-use method.

Abstract: Graph partitioning (GP), a.k.a. community detection, is a classic problem
that divides nodes of a graph into densely-connected blocks. From a perspective
of graph signal processing, we find that graph Laplacian with a negative
correction can derive graph frequencies beyond the conventional range $[0, 2]$.
To explore whether the low-frequency information beyond this range can encode
more informative properties about community structures, we propose InfraredGP.
It (\romannumeral1) adopts a spectral GNN as its backbone combined with
low-pass filters and a negative correction mechanism, (\romannumeral2) only
feeds random inputs to this backbone, (\romannumeral3) derives graph embeddings
via one feed-forward propagation (FFP) without any training, and
(\romannumeral4) obtains feasible GP results by feeding the derived embeddings
to BIRCH. Surprisingly, our experiments demonstrate that based solely on the
negative correction mechanism that amplifies low-frequency information beyond
$[0, 2]$, InfraredGP can derive distinguishable embeddings for some standard
clustering modules (e.g., BIRCH) and obtain high-quality results for GP without
any training. Following the IEEE HPEC Graph Challenge benchmark, we evaluate
InfraredGP for both static and streaming GP, where InfraredGP can achieve much
better efficiency (e.g., 16x-23x faster) and competitive quality over various
baselines. We have made our code public at
https://github.com/KuroginQin/InfraredGP

### [153] [Fast 3D Diffusion for Scalable Granular Media Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19752)
*Muhammad Moeeze Hassan,Régis Cottereau,Filippo Gatti,Patryk Dec*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion-based two-stage pipeline to synthesize large, physically realistic granular assemblies from 3D voxel grids, enabling fast, scalable initialization for DEM simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DEM initialization is a bottleneck due to large displacements and high kinetic energy; need fast, scalable generation of physically realistic granular configurations to reduce startup time.

Method: Train a 3D diffusion model to generate independent voxel grids representing granular media, followed by a 3D inpainting model (UNet-based) that stitches grids into large coherent assemblies using masked inputs, multiple masking strategies, and a repainting-inspired guidance; both models operate on binarized 3D occupancy grids derived from small-scale DEM simulations, with losses designed to ensure long-range coherence and linear scaling with sample size.

Result: Able to synthesize large granular assemblies rapidly; 1.2 m rail track equivalent to a 3-hour DEM run completed in under 20 seconds; the approach scales linearly with sample size and yields physically realistic structures suitable for post-processing to extract grain geometries for DEM compatibility.

Conclusion: The proposed diffusion+inpainting pipeline provides real-time, scalable generation of realistic granular media configurations, substantially reducing initialization time for DEM workflows and enabling industrial-scale applications.

Abstract: Simulating granular media, using Discrete Element Method is a computationally
intensive task. This is especially true during initialization phase, which
dominates total simulation time because of large displacements involved and
associated kinetic energy. We overcome this bottleneck with a novel generative
pipeline based on 3D diffusion models that directly synthesizes arbitrarily
large granular assemblies in their final and physically realistic
configurations. The approach frames the problem as a 3D generative modeling
task, consisting of a two-stage pipeline. First a diffusion model is trained to
generate independent 3D voxel grids representing granular media. Second, a 3D
inpainting model, adapted from 2D inpainting techniques using masked inputs,
stitches these grids together seamlessly, enabling synthesis of large samples
with physically realistic structure. The inpainting model explores several
masking strategies for the inputs to the underlying UNets by training the
network to infer missing portions of voxel grids from a concatenation of noised
tensors, masks, and masked tensors as input channels. The model also adapts a
2D repainting technique of re-injecting noise scheduler output with ground
truth to provide a strong guidance to the 3D model. This along with weighted
losses ensures long-term coherence over generation of masked regions. Both
models are trained on the same binarized 3D occupancy grids extracted from
small-scale DEM simulations, achieving linear scaling of computational time
with respect to sample size. Quantitatively, a 1.2 m long ballasted rail track
synthesis equivalent to a 3-hour DEM simulation, was completed under 20
seconds. The generated voxel grids can also be post-processed to extract grain
geometries for DEM-compatibility as well, enabling physically coherent,
real-time, scalable granular media synthesis for industrial applications.

### [154] [Interestingness First Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19780)
*Ryoma Sato*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EUREKA uses a large language model to rank features by interestingness and trains interpretable classifiers on the top features, prioritizing novelty and insight over raw accuracy. It yields non-obvious yet predictive features and new insights on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most ML models optimize predictive accuracy, but there is value in discovering surprising, interpretable patterns. An ‘interesting’ classifier can support knowledge discovery and better communication when moderate accuracy suffices.

Method: Rank features by interestingness with a large language model, select top features, and train interpretable classifiers using only those features. Evaluate on benchmark datasets and illustrate with examples (e.g., humidity vs CO2 for occupancy, colon in title predicting future citations).

Result: Across benchmarks, EUREKA consistently identifies non-obvious yet predictive features. In Occupancy Detection, humidity and light are favored over CO2, producing meaningful accuracy with interpretability. In Twin Papers, a colon in the title correlates with higher future citations, revealing a surprising yet predictive rule.

Conclusion: Interestingness-driven feature selection can complement accuracy-driven ML, enabling novelty, interpretability, and knowledge discovery. EUREKA offers a simple framework for discovering non-obvious but useful patterns across domains.

Abstract: Most machine learning models are designed to maximize predictive accuracy. In
this work, we explore a different goal: building classifiers that are
interesting. An ``interesting classifier'' is one that uses unusual or
unexpected features, even if its accuracy is lower than the best possible
model. For example, predicting room congestion from CO2 levels achieves
near-perfect accuracy but is unsurprising. In contrast, predicting room
congestion from humidity is less accurate yet more nuanced and intriguing. We
introduce EUREKA, a simple framework that selects features according to their
perceived interestingness. Our method leverages large language models to rank
features by their interestingness and then builds interpretable classifiers
using only the selected interesting features. Across several benchmark
datasets, EUREKA consistently identifies features that are non-obvious yet
still predictive. For example, in the Occupancy Detection dataset, our method
favors humidity over CO2 levels and light intensity, producing classifiers that
achieve meaningful accuracy while offering insights. In the Twin Papers
dataset, our method discovers the rule that papers with a colon in the title
are more likely to be cited in the future. We argue that such models can
support new ways of knowledge discovery and communication, especially in
settings where moderate accuracy is sufficient but novelty and interpretability
are valued.

### [155] [PSO-Merging: Merging Models Based on Particle Swarm Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19839)
*Kehao Zhang,Shaolei Zhang,Yang Feng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PSO-Merging proposes a data-driven, particle swarm optimization-based approach to merge multiple expert models for multitask learning. It initializes the swarm with a pre-trained model, individual expert models, and sparsified variants, and uses iterative PSO to obtain a final merged model as the global best particle, generally outperforming baseline merging methods in efficiency and scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current merging strategies struggle: data-insensitive methods miss data-driven guidance, while gradient-based approaches are computationally expensive for large models and gradient-free methods often underperform within limited optimization steps. A scalable, data-driven, efficient merging method is needed for large multitask models.

Method: PSO-Merging initializes a particle swarm with a pre-trained model, expert models, and sparsified variants. It then performs multiple PSO iterations, with the final global best particle serving as the merged model.

Result: Experimental results on different language models show that PSO-Merging generally outperforms baseline merging methods, offering improved performance and efficiency.

Conclusion: PSO-Merging provides an effective, scalable data-driven solution for merging expert models, addressing the limitations of existing gradient-based and gradient-free methods and enabling more practical multitask model construction.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as an efficient strategy for constructing multitask
models by integrating the strengths of multiple available expert models,
thereby reducing the need to fine-tune a pre-trained model for all the tasks
from scratch. Existing data-independent methods struggle with performance
limitations due to the lack of data-driven guidance. Data-driven approaches
also face key challenges: gradient-based methods are computationally expensive,
limiting their practicality for merging large expert models, whereas existing
gradient-free methods often fail to achieve satisfactory results within a
limited number of optimization steps. To address these limitations, this paper
introduces PSO-Merging, a novel data-driven merging method based on the
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In this approach, we initialize the particle
swarm with a pre-trained model, expert models, and sparsified expert models. We
then perform multiple iterations, with the final global best particle serving
as the merged model. Experimental results on different language models show
that PSO-Merging generally outperforms baseline merging methods, offering a
more efficient and scalable solution for model merging.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a symplectic CNN that preserves the symplectic structure via symplectic neural networks, proper symplectic decomposition, and tensor techniques, including a symplectic pooling layer; evaluated on wave, nonlinear Schrödinger, and sine-Gordon equations; reports improved performance over a linear symplectic autoencoder.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To preserve the Hamiltonian/symplectic structure in neural network models of PDEs, aiming for better long-term behavior, physical fidelity, and stable training.

Method: Formulates the convolution layer in an equivalent mathematically consistent form, parameterizes CNN layers with symplectic neural networks to ensure symplecticity, introduces a symplectic pooling layer to create a full autoencoder, and leverages proper symplectic decomposition and tensor techniques.

Result: The symplectic CNN outperforms the linear symplectic autoencoder obtained via proper symplectic decomposition on three benchmark PDEs.

Conclusion: A structure-preserving symplectic CNN framework is effective for solving PDEs, delivering improved performance over traditional linear symplectic autoencoders.

Abstract: We propose a new symplectic convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture
by leveraging symplectic neural networks, proper symplectic decomposition, and
tensor techniques. Specifically, we first introduce a mathematically equivalent
form of the convolution layer and then, using symplectic neural networks, we
demonstrate a way to parameterize the layers of the CNN to ensure that the
convolution layer remains symplectic. To construct a complete autoencoder, we
introduce a symplectic pooling layer. We demonstrate the performance of the
proposed neural network on three examples: the wave equation, the nonlinear
Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation, and the sine-Gordon equation. The numerical
results indicate that the symplectic CNN outperforms the linear symplectic
autoencoder obtained via proper symplectic decomposition.

*Erdi Kara,Panos Stinis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid FEM + physics-informed DeepONet that computes sharp-source transport in porous media by solving Darcy flow with FEM and learning the source-to-concentration mapping; achieves high accuracy with substantial speedups.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need accurate yet efficient prediction of coupled flow and transport in porous media, especially with localized sharp sources, where full solvers are costly.

Method: Solve steady Darcy flow with FEM to obtain a velocity field, transfer this field to a physics-informed DeepONet (DeepONet learns the mapping from source functions to solute concentrations), and use adaptive trunk collocation sampling to handle steep gradients.

Result: The approach yields good agreement with reference solutions and provides orders-of-magnitude speedups over traditional solvers for transport predictions.

Conclusion: The framework preserves FEM-level accuracy for the flow while enabling fast, scalable transport predictions for practical porous-media problems; code is openly available.

Abstract: We present a hybrid framework that couples finite element methods (FEM) with
physics-informed DeepONet to model fluid transport in porous media from sharp,
localized Gaussian sources. The governing system consists of a steady-state
Darcy flow equation and a time-dependent convection-diffusion equation. Our
approach solves the Darcy system using FEM and transfers the resulting velocity
field to a physics-informed DeepONet, which learns the mapping from source
functions to solute concentration profiles. This modular strategy preserves
FEM-level accuracy in the flow field while enabling fast inference for
transport dynamics. To handle steep gradients induced by sharp sources, we
introduce an adaptive sampling strategy for trunk collocation points. Numerical
experiments demonstrate that our method is in good agreement with the reference
solutions while offering orders of magnitude speedups over traditional solvers,
making it suitable for practical applications in relevant scenarios.
Implementation of our proposed method is available at

*Omar Bacarreza,Thorin Farnsworth,Alexander Makarovskiy,Hugo Wallner,Tessa Hicks,Santiago Sempere-Llagostera,John Price,Robert J. A. Francis-Jones,William R. Clements*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Quantum latent distributions can enhance generative modeling, enabling data distributions unreachable by classical latent spaces; supported by theory, benchmarks on synthetic and QM9, and experiments with simulated and real photonic quantum processors; compatible with GANs, diffusion, and flow matching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Latent distributions are central to deep generative models; exploring quantum-led latent spaces may yield performance gains and new capabilities, with open questions about when and how such advantages appear and whether they are reproducible.

Method: The authors prove conditions under which quantum latent distributions offer advantages, provide practical heuristics to identify real-world advantages, and benchmark across GANs, diffusion, and flow matching on synthetic quantum data and the QM9 dataset using simulated and real photonic quantum processors.

Result: Quantum latent distributions improve generative performance over classical baselines in GANs; the work identifies architectures compatible with quantum latent distributions and provides evidence from simulations and real quantum hardware; introduces actionable intuitions for when advantages arise.

Conclusion: Near-term quantum processors can expand the capabilities of deep generative models by enabling quantum latent distributions to produce data distributions difficult for classical latents; the results motivate broader exploration of quantum-enhanced generative modeling and its practical guidelines.

Abstract: Many successful families of generative models leverage a low-dimensional
latent distribution that is mapped to a data distribution. Though simple latent
distributions are commonly used, it has been shown that more sophisticated
distributions can improve performance. For instance, recent work has explored
using the distributions produced by quantum processors and found empirical
improvements. However, when latent space distributions produced by quantum
processors can be expected to improve performance, and whether these
improvements are reproducible, are open questions that we investigate in this
work. We prove that, under certain conditions, these "quantum latent
distributions" enable generative models to produce data distributions that
classical latent distributions cannot efficiently produce. We also provide
actionable intuitions to identify when such quantum advantages may arise in
real-world settings. We perform benchmarking experiments on both a synthetic
quantum dataset and the QM9 molecular dataset, using both simulated and real
photonic quantum processors. Our results demonstrate that quantum latent
distributions can lead to improved generative performance in GANs compared to a
range of classical baselines. We also explore diffusion and flow matching
models, identifying architectures compatible with quantum latent distributions.
This work confirms that near-term quantum processors can expand the
capabilities of deep generative models.

*Mingyue Kong,Yinglong Zhang,Chengda Xu,Xuewen Xia,Xing Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SDGNN is a parameter-free GNN that uses structural diversity to enable message passing without trainable parameters, achieving robust, accurate results across heterogeneous graphs and low-supervision settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional GNNs rely on many trainable parameters and fixed aggregations, which struggle with structural heterogeneity and skewed feature distributions, leading to over-smoothing and semantic degradation. A parameter-free approach leveraging structural diversity can better capture neighborhood heterogeneity and semantic stability.

Method: Propose a unified structural-diversity message passing mechanism that is parameter-free and combines structure-driven and feature-driven modeling, avoiding additional trainable parameters while leveraging structural diversity theory.

Result: SDGNN consistently outperforms mainstream GNNs on eight public benchmarks and a PubMed network, particularly under low supervision, class imbalance, and cross-domain transfer.

Conclusion: Introduces a theoretical and practical path for parameter-free GNNs, highlighting structural diversity as a core signal; provides release of full implementation to support reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in structured
data modeling tasks such as node classification. However, mainstream approaches
generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters and fixed aggregation
rules, making it difficult to adapt to graph data with strong structural
heterogeneity and complex feature distributions. This often leads to
over-smoothing of node representations and semantic degradation. To address
these issues, this paper proposes a parameter-free graph neural network
framework based on structural diversity, namely SDGNN (Structural-Diversity
Graph Neural Network). The framework is inspired by structural diversity theory
and designs a unified structural-diversity message passing mechanism that
simultaneously captures the heterogeneity of neighborhood structures and the
stability of feature semantics, without introducing additional trainable
parameters. Unlike traditional parameterized methods, SDGNN does not rely on
complex model training, but instead leverages complementary modeling from both
structure-driven and feature-driven perspectives, thereby effectively improving
adaptability across datasets and scenarios. Experimental results show that on
eight public benchmark datasets and an interdisciplinary PubMed citation
network, SDGNN consistently outperforms mainstream GNNs under challenging
conditions such as low supervision, class imbalance, and cross-domain transfer.
This work provides a new theoretical perspective and general approach for the
design of parameter-free graph neural networks, and further validates the
importance of structural diversity as a core signal in graph representation
learning. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, the full
implementation of SDGNN has been released at:

*Davorin Miličević,Ratko Grbić*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NM-Hebb is a two-phase CNN training framework that combines neuro-inspired local Hebbian plasticity with distance-aware supervision, improving accuracy and interpretability across standard backbones and datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome overfitting, redundant filters, and poor interpretability associated with purely global gradient-based training in CNNs; by integrating local synaptic-like updates and metric-aware supervision to create structured, reusable representations and better embedding spaces.

Method: Phase 1: Train with a jointly optimized cross-entropy loss plus a Hebbian regulariser aligning activation means with convolutional weight means and a learnable neuromodulator governing a consolidation loss. Phase 2: Fine-tune the backbone with a pairwise metric-learning loss to compress intra-class distances and enlarge inter-class margins.

Result: Evaluation on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet across five backbones (ResNet-18, VGG-11, MobileNet-v2, EfficientNet-V2, DenseNet-121) showed consistent gains over baselines and other methods: Top-1 accuracy improvements of +2.0–10.0 percentage points on CIFAR-10, +2.0–9.0 pp on CIFAR-100, and up to +4.3–8.9 pp on TinyImageNet; NMI up to +0.15. Qualitative analyses indicate more structured, selective features and tighter, more interpretable class clusters.

Conclusion: Coupling local Hebbian plasticity with metric-based fine-tuning yields CNNs that are more accurate and more interpretable, with practical benefits for resource-constrained and safety-critical AI deployments.

Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve high accuracy but often
rely on purely global, gradient-based optimisation, which can lead to
overfitting, redundant filters, and reduced interpretability. To address these
limitations, we propose NM-Hebb, a two-phase training framework that integrates
neuro-inspired local plasticity with distance-aware supervision. Phase 1
extends standard supervised training by jointly optimising a cross-entropy
objective with two biologically inspired mechanisms: (i) a Hebbian regulariser
that aligns the spatial mean of activations with the mean of the corresponding
convolutional filter weights, encouraging structured, reusable primitives; and
(ii) a learnable neuromodulator that gates an elastic-weight-style
consolidation loss, preserving beneficial parameters without freezing the
network. Phase 2 fine-tunes the backbone with a pairwise metric-learning loss,
explicitly compressing intra-class distances and enlarging inter-class margins
in the embedding space. Evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet
across five backbones (ResNet-18, VGG-11, MobileNet-v2, EfficientNet-V2,
DenseNet-121), NM-Hebb achieves consistent gains over baseline and other
methods: Top-1 accuracy improves by +2.0-10.0 pp (CIFAR-10), +2.0-9.0 pp
(CIFAR-100), and up to +4.3-8.9 pp (TinyImageNet), with Normalised Mutual
Information (NMI) increased by up to +0.15. Qualitative visualisations and
filter-level analyses further confirm that NM-Hebb produces more structured and
selective features, yielding tighter and more interpretable class clusters.
Overall, coupling local Hebbian plasticity with metric-based fine-tuning yields
CNNs that are not only more accurate but also more interpretable, offering
practical benefits for resource-constrained and safety-critical AI deployments.

### [161] [Adaptive Scaling of Policy Constraints for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19900)
*Tan Jing,Xiaorui Li,Chao Yao,Xiaojuan Ban,Yuetong Fang,Renjing Xu,Zhaolin Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASPC introduces adaptive, second-order differentiable scaling of policy constraints in offline RL to balance RL and behavior cloning, reducing the need for per-dataset hyperparameter tuning while maintaining strong performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL methods rely on policy constraints to mitigate distribution shift, but constraint scales vary across tasks/datasets, making hyperparameter tuning onerous and impractical; there is a need for automatic, dataset-agnostic constraint balancing.

Method: ASPC is a second-order differentiable framework that dynamically scales policy constraints during training to balance reinforcement learning and behavior cloning. It includes a theoretical analysis of performance improvement guarantees.

Result: On 39 datasets across four D4RL domains, ASPC with a single hyperparameter configuration outperforms other adaptive-constraint methods and state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms that require per-dataset tuning, with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: ASPC provides hyperparameter-efficient, robust offline RL by adaptively scaling constraints, reducing dataset-specific tuning while achieving strong performance; code will be released.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables learning effective policies from
fixed datasets without any environment interaction. Existing methods typically
employ policy constraints to mitigate the distribution shift encountered during
offline RL training. However, because the scale of the constraints varies
across tasks and datasets of differing quality, existing methods must
meticulously tune hyperparameters to match each dataset, which is
time-consuming and often impractical. We propose Adaptive Scaling of Policy
Constraints (ASPC), a second-order differentiable framework that dynamically
balances RL and behavior cloning (BC) during training. We theoretically analyze
its performance improvement guarantee. In experiments on 39 datasets across
four D4RL domains, ASPC using a single hyperparameter configuration outperforms
other adaptive constraint methods and state-of-the-art offline RL algorithms
that require per-dataset tuning while incurring only minimal computational
overhead. The code will be released at https://github.com/Colin-Jing/ASPC.

### [162] [GegenNet: Spectral Convolutional Neural Networks for Link Sign Prediction in Signed Bipartite Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19907)
*Hewen Wang,Renchi Yang,Xiaokui Xiao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GegenNet is a spectral CNN for link sign prediction on signed bipartite graphs that uses Gegenbauer-based spectral filters and sign-aware multi-layer convolutions, achieving notable improvements over baselines on six datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing methods primarily target unipartite signed graphs; they neglect node heterogeneity and the bipartite nature of SBGs, and import spectral operators designed for unsigned positive links, limiting performance on sign prediction.

Method: Introduce GegenNet with (1) fast spectral decomposition for feature initialization, (2) Gegenbauer polynomial-based spectral graph filters, (3) multi-layer sign-aware spectral convolutions that alternate filters on positive and negative edges in a bipartite setting.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows GegenNet achieves up to 4.28% AUC gain and 11.69% F1 gain over 11 strong baselines across 6 benchmark SBG datasets.

Conclusion: GegenNet provides a theoretically grounded, higher-capacity spectral CNN for SBG link sign prediction by leveraging Gegenbauer filters and sign-aware layers, addressing limitations of conventional spectral operators for signed bipartite graphs.

Abstract: Given a signed bipartite graph (SBG) G with two disjoint node sets U and V,
the goal of link sign prediction is to predict the signs of potential links
connecting U and V based on known positive and negative edges in G. The
majority of existing solutions towards link sign prediction mainly focus on
unipartite signed graphs, which are sub-optimal due to the neglect of node
heterogeneity and unique bipartite characteristics of SBGs. To this end, recent
studies adapt graph neural networks to SBGs by introducing message-passing
schemes for both inter-partition (UxV) and intra-partition (UxU or VxV) node
pairs. However, the fundamental spectral convolutional operators were
originally designed for positive links in unsigned graphs, and thus, are not
optimal for inferring missing positive or negative links from known ones in
SBGs.
  Motivated by this, this paper proposes GegenNet, a novel and effective
spectral convolutional neural network model for link sign prediction in SBGs.
In particular, GegenNet achieves enhanced model capacity and high predictive
accuracy through three main technical contributions: (i) fast and theoretically
grounded spectral decomposition techniques for node feature initialization;
(ii) a new spectral graph filter based on the Gegenbauer polynomial basis; and
(iii) multi-layer sign-aware spectral convolutional networks alternating
Gegenbauer polynomial filters with positive and negative edges. Our extensive
empirical studies reveal that GegenNet can achieve significantly superior
performance (up to a gain of 4.28% in AUC and 11.69% in F1) in link sign
prediction compared to 11 strong competitors over 6 benchmark SBG datasets.

TL;DR: Ontology-driven retrieval for radiology reports using UMLS concepts; extracts standardized entities via RadGraph-XL and SapBERT; computes similarity with a weighted Tversky index; outperforms embedding-based methods on MIMIC-CXR and provides ontology-backed labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current text embeddings (e.g., CLIP) for radiology reports are high-dimensional, hard to interpret, computationally heavy, and may not align well with medical knowledge. There is a need for interpretable, domain-grounded, retrieval that performs well on long-tail (rare) diseases.

Method: Extract standardized medical entities from free-text reports using an enhanced pipeline with RadGraph-XL and SapBERT; map entities to UMLS concepts (CUIs); represent each report as a set of CUIs; define a task-adaptive similarity using a modified, weighted Tversky index accounting for synonymy, negation, and hierarchical relationships among medical entities.

Result: The approach outperforms state-of-the-art embedding-based retrieval methods for radiograph classification on MIMIC-CXR, particularly in long-tail settings; enables generation of ontology-backed disease labels for MIMIC-CXR; code available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: Offers more explainable, reliable, and task-specific retrieval strategies in clinical AI when interpretability and domain knowledge integration are essential; can serve as a resource for downstream learning tasks and improve trust in retrieval systems.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented learning based on radiology reports has emerged as a
promising direction to improve performance on long-tail medical imaging tasks,
such as rare disease detection in chest X-rays. Most existing methods rely on
comparing high-dimensional text embeddings from models like CLIP or CXR-BERT,
which are often difficult to interpret, computationally expensive, and not
well-aligned with the structured nature of medical knowledge. We propose a
novel, ontology-driven alternative for comparing radiology report texts based
on clinically grounded concepts from the Unified Medical Language System
(UMLS). Our method extracts standardised medical entities from free-text
reports using an enhanced pipeline built on RadGraph-XL and SapBERT. These
entities are linked to UMLS concepts (CUIs), enabling a transparent,
interpretable set-based representation of each report. We then define a
task-adaptive similarity measure based on a modified and weighted version of
the Tversky Index that accounts for synonymy, negation, and hierarchical
relationships between medical entities. This allows efficient and semantically
meaningful similarity comparisons between reports. We demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art embedding-based retrieval methods in a
radiograph classification task on MIMIC-CXR, particularly in long-tail
settings. Additionally, we use our pipeline to generate ontology-backed disease
labels for MIMIC-CXR, offering a valuable new resource for downstream learning
tasks. Our work provides more explainable, reliable, and task-specific
retrieval strategies in clinical AI systems, especially when interpretability
and domain knowledge integration are essential. Our code is available at

*Liming Liu,Ruoyu Li,Qing Li,Meijia Hou,Yong Jiang,Mingwei Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowletFormer is a BERT-based pre-training model for network traffic analysis that segments traffic into semantically meaningful units, aligns protocol stack embeddings, and uses field-specific/context-aware pretraining tasks to improve inter-packet/inter-flow understanding, achieving superior accuracy and few-shot learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current network traffic analysis methods struggle to capture packet-level structure, flow-level behaviors, hierarchical protocol semantics, and inter-packet context; a domain-aware pre-training approach could yield richer representations and better generalization.

Method: Proposes FlowletFormer with (1) Coherent Behavior-Aware Traffic Representation Model for segmenting traffic into meaningful units, (2) Protocol Stack Alignment-Based Embedding Layer to capture multi-layer protocol semantics, (3) Field-Specific and Context-Aware Pretraining Tasks for inter-packet/inter-flow learning in a BERT-like framework.

Result: Experimental results show FlowletFormer significantly outperforms existing methods in traffic representation effectiveness, classification accuracy, and few-shot learning; demonstrates better understanding of TCP stateful behavior and more robust, trustworthy analysis.

Conclusion: FlowletFormer demonstrates the benefit of integrating domain knowledge into pre-training for network traffic analysis, offering a robust framework with improved performance and interpretability.

Abstract: Network traffic classification using pre-training models has shown promising
results, but existing methods struggle to capture packet structural
characteristics, flow-level behaviors, hierarchical protocol semantics, and
inter-packet contextual relationships. To address these challenges, we propose
FlowletFormer, a BERT-based pre-training model specifically designed for
network traffic analysis. FlowletFormer introduces a Coherent Behavior-Aware
Traffic Representation Model for segmenting traffic into semantically
meaningful units, a Protocol Stack Alignment-Based Embedding Layer to capture
multilayer protocol semantics, and Field-Specific and Context-Aware Pretraining
Tasks to enhance both inter-packet and inter-flow learning. Experimental
results demonstrate that FlowletFormer significantly outperforms existing
methods in the effectiveness of traffic representation, classification
accuracy, and few-shot learning capability. Moreover, by effectively
integrating domain-specific network knowledge, FlowletFormer shows better
comprehension of the principles of network transmission (e.g., stateful
connections of TCP), providing a more robust and trustworthy framework for
traffic analysis.

### [165] [Constraint Learning in Multi-Agent Dynamic Games from Demonstrations of Local Nash Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19945)
*Zhouyu Zhang,Chih-Yuan Chiu,Glen Chou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an MILP-based inverse dynamic game framework to learn parametric safety constraints from Nash-equilibrium demonstrations and use them for robust motion planning, with theoretical guarantees and empirical validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To recover interpretable constraint sets (safe/unsafe) from multi-agent interaction data and to understand what can be learned from demonstrations of Nash equilibrium, enabling robust planning under learned constraints.

Method: Encode the KKT conditions of interacting agents as mixed-integer linear programs to recover constraint parameters that explain Nash-stationarity in the demonstrations; establish inner-approximation guarantees of the true safe/unsafe sets; analyze fundamental limitations of constraint learnability from Nash demonstrations; apply the recovered interaction constraints to synthesize motion plans that robustly satisfy them; validate across simulations and hardware for both convex and non-convex constraints with nonlinear dynamics.

Result: The approach yields inner approximations of the true safe/unsafe sets, provides theoretical guarantees, and demonstrates the ability to infer constraints and design interactive motion plans for various constraint classes (convex and non-convex) from demonstrations of agents with nonlinear dynamics, validated in simulations and hardware.

Conclusion: The framework offers a principled method to learn and leverage constraints from multi-agent demonstrations for robust planning, while highlighting inherent learnability limits and applicability to diverse constraint classes.

Abstract: We present an inverse dynamic game-based algorithm to learn parametric
constraints from a given dataset of local generalized Nash equilibrium
interactions between multiple agents. Specifically, we introduce mixed-integer
linear programs (MILP) encoding the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the
interacting agents, which recover constraints consistent with the Nash
stationarity of the interaction demonstrations. We establish theoretical
guarantees that our method learns inner approximations of the true safe and
unsafe sets, as well as limitations of constraint learnability from
demonstrations of Nash equilibrium interactions. We also use the interaction
constraints recovered by our method to design motion plans that robustly
satisfy the underlying constraints. Across simulations and hardware
experiments, our methods proved capable of inferring constraints and designing
interactive motion plans for various classes of constraints, both convex and
non-convex, from interaction demonstrations of agents with nonlinear dynamics.

### [166] [Global Permutation Entropy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19955)
*Abhijeet Avhale,Joscha Diehl,Niraj Velankar,Emanuele Verri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Global Permutation Entropy (GPE) extends Bandt–Pompe permutation entropy by incorporating all length-m patterns, including non-consecutive ones, via full permutation profiles and efficient algorithms; experiments on synthetic data show it uncovers structure beyond standard PE; available as a Julia package.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard permutation entropy captures only consecutive ordinal patterns within a fixed window, potentially missing broader order relations in the data. GPE addresses this limitation by considering non-consecutive patterns, aiming for a more informative measure of time-series complexity.

Method: Define a permutation profile that counts frequencies of all permutations over all index patterns of length m (including gaps). Use efficient algorithms to extract the full permutation profile and compute Shannon entropy over this distribution to obtain GPE. Implemented in Julia and released as an open-source package.

Result: Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that GPE reveals structural information not accessible with standard permutation entropy.

Conclusion: GPE offers a more comprehensive view of order patterns in time series and is a useful addition to complexity analysis, with an open-source Julia implementation.

Abstract: Permutation Entropy, introduced by Bandt and Pompe, is a widely used
complexity measure for real-valued time series that is based on the relative
order of values within consecutive segments of fixed length. After
standardizing each segment to a permutation and computing the frequency
distribution of these permutations, Shannon Entropy is then applied to quantify
the series' complexity. We introduce Global Permutation Entropy (GPE), a novel
index that considers all possible patterns of a given length, including
non-consecutive ones. Its computation relies on recently developed algorithms
that enable the efficient extraction of full permutation profiles. We
illustrate some properties of GPE and demonstrate its effectiveness through
experiments on synthetic datasets, showing that it reveals structural
information not accessible through standard permutation entropy. We provide a
Julia package for the calculation of GPE at
`https://github.com/AThreeH1/Global-Permutation-Entropy'.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A real-time ML framework using sliding-window statistics and SMOTE to forecast key faults in centrifugal pumps up to 30 minutes ahead; RF outperforms XGBoost with horizon-dependent optimal history length.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce unplanned downtime and maintenance costs by predicting faults earlier using real-time sensor data; explore suitable window lengths and models for short-term fault forecasting in industrial pumps.

Method: Two lookback windows (60 and 120 min) with a sliding window; extract features mean, standard deviation, min, max, and linear trend; address class imbalance with SMOTE; train Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers on labeled data.

Result: Random Forest with a 60-min window achieves recall 69.2% at 5 min, 64.9% at 15 min, and 48.6% at 30 min; with a 120-min window, recall is 57.6% at 5 min and 65.6% at 15 and 30 min. XGBoost shows similar but slightly lower performance. Optimal history length depends on horizon; different fault patterns may evolve at different timescales.

Conclusion: The approach is interpretable and scalable for integrating predictive maintenance into real-time industrial monitoring systems.

Abstract: This study presents a machine learning framework for forecasting short-term
faults in industrial centrifugal pumps using real-time sensor data. The
approach aims to predict {EarlyWarning} conditions 5, 15, and 30 minutes in
advance based on patterns extracted from historical operation. Two lookback
periods, 60 minutes and 120 minutes, were evaluated using a sliding window
approach. For each window, statistical features including mean, standard
deviation, minimum, maximum, and linear trend were extracted, and class
imbalance was addressed using the SMOTE algorithm. Random Forest and XGBoost
classifiers were trained and tested on the labeled dataset. Results show that
the Random Forest model achieved the best short-term forecasting performance
with a 60-minute window, reaching recall scores of 69.2\% at 5 minutes, 64.9\%
at 15 minutes, and 48.6\% at 30 minutes. With a 120-minute window, the Random
Forest model achieved 57.6\% recall at 5 minutes, and improved predictive
accuracy of 65.6\% at both 15 and 30 minutes. XGBoost displayed similar but
slightly lower performance. These findings highlight that optimal history
length depends on the prediction horizon, and that different fault patterns may
evolve at different timescales. The proposed method offers an interpretable and
scalable solution for integrating predictive maintenance into real-time
industrial monitoring systems.

### [168] [Reducing Street Parking Search Time via Smart Assignment Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19979)
*Behafarid Hemmatpour,Javad Dogani,Nikolaos Laoutaris*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cord-Approx markedly reduces street parking search time in Madrid simulations, achieving about a 70% improvement over uncoordinated non-users by probabilistically modeling non-user behavior and using Hungarian matching for dispatch.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how user coordination and information availability in real-time parking apps influence search time and success, addressing congestion from street parking in dense cities.

Method: A data-driven simulation of Madrid's street parking network evaluating four strategies: Uncoordinated Agnostic (Unc-Agn), Coordinated Agnostic (Cord-Agn), an ideal Cord-Oracle with full knowledge of non-users, and Cord-Approx, which estimates non-user behavior probabilistically. Cord-Approx uses past occupancy distributions to increase physical distances to alternative spots and solves a Hungarian matching problem to dispatch users accordingly.

Result: Cord-Approx yields an average search time of 6.69 minutes, versus 19.98 minutes for non-users without an app. Zone-level results show a 72% reduction in central hubs (range 67-76%) and up to 73% in residential areas, relative to non-users.

Conclusion: Probabilistic modeling of non-user occupancy and optimization-based dispatch can substantially enhance parking search performance. Cord-Approx provides a practical middle ground between an ideal oracle and naive coordination, suggesting design directions for real-time parking apps; effectiveness hinges on accurate occupancy distributions and city-specific data.

Abstract: In dense metropolitan areas, searching for street parking adds to traffic
congestion. Like many other problems, real-time assistants based on mobile
phones have been proposed, but their effectiveness is understudied. This work
quantifies how varying levels of user coordination and information availability
through such apps impact search time and the probability of finding street
parking. Through a data-driven simulation of Madrid's street parking ecosystem,
we analyze four distinct strategies: uncoordinated search (Unc-Agn),
coordinated parking without awareness of non-users (Cord-Agn), an idealized
oracle system that knows the positions of all non-users (Cord-Oracle), and our
novel/practical Cord-Approx strategy that estimates non-users' behavior
probabilistically. The Cord-Approx strategy, instead of requiring knowledge of
how close non-users are to a certain spot in order to decide whether to
navigate toward it, uses past occupancy distributions to elongate physical
distances between system users and alternative parking spots, and then solves a
Hungarian matching problem to dispatch accordingly. In high-fidelity
simulations of Madrid's parking network with real traffic data, users of
Cord-Approx averaged 6.69 minutes to find parking, compared to 19.98 minutes
for non-users without an app. A zone-level snapshot shows that Cord-Approx
reduces search time for system users by 72% (range = 67-76%) in central hubs,
and up to 73% in residential areas, relative to non-users.

### [169] [Evaluating Language Model Reasoning about Confidential Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19980)
*Dylan Sam,Alexander Robey,Andy Zou,Matt Fredrikson,J. Zico Kolter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PasswordEval is a benchmark that tests whether language models can correctly determine authorization for user requests via a password, revealing that current models often fail and that reasoning traces may leak confidential information; the study emphasizes robustness to jailbreaks and multi-turn interactions and cautions against exposing reasoning traces in high-stakes settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LMs are deployed as autonomous agents in high-stakes settings, ensuring adherence to user-defined safety rules and protecting confidential information becomes critical. The work motivates evaluating contextual robustness and the limits of current models’ ability to follow authorization constraints.

Method: Introduce PasswordEval benchmark to test whether models can determine if a user request is authorized (correct password). Evaluate both open- and closed-source models. Increase difficulty with adversarial jailbreaking strategies and longer multi-turn conversations. Analyze whether reasoning traces improve performance and whether they leak confidential information.

Result: Current frontier models struggle to correctly determine authorization; reasoning capabilities do not generally improve performance, and reasoning traces frequently leak confidential information. Models remain unable to safely handle confidential information in high-stakes contexts, with jailbreaking tactics further challenging them.

Conclusion: Reasoning capabilities may need to be trained differently to enhance safety for high-stakes releases, and there is a need to avoid exposing reasoning traces to users to prevent leakage of confidential information. More robust training or architectural changes are required to achieve contextual robustness in safety-critical applications.

Abstract: As language models are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents in
high-stakes settings, ensuring that they reliably follow user-defined rules has
become a critical safety concern. To this end, we study whether language models
exhibit contextual robustness, or the capability to adhere to context-dependent
safety specifications. For this analysis, we develop a benchmark (PasswordEval)
that measures whether language models can correctly determine when a user
request is authorized (i.e., with a correct password). We find that current
open- and closed-source models struggle with this seemingly simple task, and
that, perhaps surprisingly, reasoning capabilities do not generally improve
performance. In fact, we find that reasoning traces frequently leak
confidential information, which calls into question whether reasoning traces
should be exposed to users in such applications. We also scale the difficulty
of our evaluation along multiple axes: (i) by adding adversarial user pressure
through various jailbreaking strategies, and (ii) through longer multi-turn
conversations where password verification is more challenging. Overall, our
results suggest that current frontier models are not well-suited to handling
confidential information, and that reasoning capabilities may need to be
trained in a different manner to make them safer for release in high-stakes
settings.

### [170] [Self-Supervised Pre-Training with Equilibrium Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19990)
*Xiaodong Cui,A F M Saif,Brian Kingsbury,Tianyi Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A bilevel, equilibrium-constrained self-supervised pretraining method for heterogeneous data that enforces per-source local optima via K-step updates, solved with a first-order approximation and related to MAML, improving downstream adaptability on multi-domain and multilingual data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous data sources can cause conflicting objectives and suboptimal global minima when pretraining with a single global objective. The goal is to tailor optimization to each data source to improve transfer to downstream tasks.

Method: Formulate pretraining as a bilevel optimization with equilibrium constraints. For each data source, perform K-step gradient descent starting from the shared model, enforcing that each source reaches its local optimum. Solve using a first-order approximation. Discuss connection to model-agnostic meta learning (MAML).

Result: Empirical results on multi-domain and multilingual pretraining show significant improvements in adaptability for downstream supervised fine-tuning tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed equilibrium-constrained bilevel framework enhances the adaptivity of self-supervised pretraining on heterogeneous data and is made tractable via a first-order approximation, with roots in meta-learning concepts like MAML.

Abstract: Self-supervised pre-training using unlabeled data is widely used in machine
learning. In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised pre-training approach
to dealing with heterogeneous data. Instead of mixing all the data and
minimizing the averaged global loss in the conventional way, we impose
additional equilibrium constraints to ensure that the models optimizes each
source of heterogeneous data to its local optima after $K$-step gradient
descent initialized from the model. We formulate this as a bilevel optimization
problem, and use the first-order approximation method to solve the problem. We
discuss its connection to model-agnostic meta learning (MAML). Experiments are
carried out on self-supervised pre-training using multi-domain and multilingual
datasets, demonstrating that the proposed approach can significantly improve
the adaptivity of the self-supervised pre-trained model for the downstream
supervised fine-tuning tasks.

### [171] [Linear-Time Demonstration Selection for In-Context Learning via Gradient Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19999)
*Ziniu Zhang,Zhenshuo Zhang,Dongyue Li,Lu Wang,Jennifer Dy,Hongyang R. Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gradient-based in-context learning subset selection: a first-order, gradient-influence estimator that precomputes outputs and gradients to pick k demonstrations in linear time, scaling to large models while matching or exceeding embedding-based baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In-context learning relies on carefully chosen demonstrations, but full inference for many candidate subsets is expensive. With fixed model weights, there is a need for efficient demonstration selection that scales to large training sets and models, relevant to prompt tuning and chain-of-thought reasoning.

Method: Compute a first-order (gradient-based) estimate of model outputs in the input embedding space. Evaluate multiple randomly sampled subsets to estimate influence scores for each demonstration by aggregating outcomes. Precompute model outputs and gradients once, enabling a linear-time subset selection relative to model and training set sizes. Select the k demonstrations with highest influence scores.

Result: Gradient estimation approximates full-inference performance with less than 1% error across six datasets. Enables subset selection to scale up to 37.7× faster on models up to 34B parameters. Outperforms input-embedding-based selection methods by about 11% on average.

Conclusion: A scalable, accurate gradient-based approach to demonstration selection for in-context learning; it reduces computation, scales to very large models, and improves prompt-tuning/chain-of-thought reasoning by enabling effective, efficient subset selection.

Abstract: This paper introduces an algorithm to select demonstration examples for
in-context learning of a query set. Given a set of $n$ examples, how can we
quickly select $k$ out of $n$ to best serve as the conditioning for downstream
inference? This problem has broad applications in prompt tuning and
chain-of-thought reasoning. Since model weights remain fixed during in-context
learning, previous work has sought to design methods based on the similarity of
token embeddings. This work proposes a new approach based on gradients of the
output taken in the input embedding space. Our approach estimates model outputs
through a first-order approximation using the gradients. Then, we apply this
estimation to multiple randomly sampled subsets. Finally, we aggregate the
sampled subset outcomes to form an influence score for each demonstration, and
select $k$ most relevant examples. This procedure only requires pre-computing
model outputs and gradients once, resulting in a linear-time algorithm relative
to model and training set sizes. Extensive experiments across various models
and datasets validate the efficiency of our approach. We show that the gradient
estimation procedure yields approximations of full inference with less than
$\mathbf{1}\%$ error across six datasets. This allows us to scale up subset
selection that would otherwise run full inference by up to
$\mathbf{37.7}\times$ on models with up to $34$ billion parameters, and
outperform existing selection methods based on input embeddings by
$\mathbf{11}\%$ on average.

*Lotte Gross,Rebecca Walter,Nicole Zoppi,Adrien Justus,Alessandro Gambetti,Qiwei Han,Maximilian Kaiser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multimodal hierarchical classifier for e-commerce product categorization across platforms, leveraging RoBERTa, ViT, and CLIP with various fusion strategies and dynamic masking; augmented by a self-supervised recategorization pipeline, and deployed via a two-stage inference pipeline for scalable cross-platform operation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tackle platform heterogeneity and rigid taxonomies in e-commerce categorization, enabling scalable, accurate, and cross-platform assignment of products while discovering new fine-grained categories to improve taxonomy coverage.

Method: Develop a multimodal hierarchical classification framework that fuses textual features (RoBERTa), visual features (ViT), and joint vision–language representations (CLIP) within a hierarchical taxonomy. Explore early, late, and attention-based fusion with dynamic masking for taxonomic consistency. Use a self-supervised recategorization pipeline with SimCLR, UMAP, and cascade clustering to discover new fine-grained categories. Evaluate cross-platform performance and deploy via a two-stage inference pipeline (lightweight RoBERTa stage + GPU-accelerated multimodal stage).

Result: CLIP embeddings combined through an MLP-based late-fusion strategy yielded the highest hierarchical F1 (98.59%), outperforming unimodal baselines. The recategorization pipeline found new subtypes (e.g., Shoe subtypes) with cluster purities >86%. Cross-platform results reveal that late fusion excels with diverse training data, while early fusion generalizes better to unseen platforms. Deployment in EURWEB demonstrated scalable, cost-aware inference with a two-stage pipeline.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates industrial scalability for cross-platform e-commerce taxonomy, balancing accuracy and cost through modality fusion choices and a staged inference pipeline, and enabling continual taxonomy expansion via self-supervised recategorization.

Abstract: This study addresses critical industrial challenges in e-commerce product
categorization, namely platform heterogeneity and the structural limitations of
existing taxonomies, by developing and deploying a multimodal hierarchical
classification framework. Using a dataset of 271,700 products from 40
international fashion e-commerce platforms, we integrate textual features
(RoBERTa), visual features (ViT), and joint vision--language representations
(CLIP). We investigate fusion strategies, including early, late, and
attention-based fusion within a hierarchical architecture enhanced by dynamic
masking to ensure taxonomic consistency. Results show that CLIP embeddings
combined via an MLP-based late-fusion strategy achieve the highest hierarchical
F1 (98.59\%), outperforming unimodal baselines. To address shallow or
inconsistent categories, we further introduce a self-supervised ``product
recategorization'' pipeline using SimCLR, UMAP, and cascade clustering, which
discovered new, fine-grained categories (e.g., subtypes of ``Shoes'') with
cluster purities above 86\%. Cross-platform experiments reveal a
deployment-relevant trade-off: complex late-fusion methods maximize accuracy
with diverse training data, while simpler early-fusion methods generalize more
effectively to unseen platforms. Finally, we demonstrate the framework's
industrial scalability through deployment in EURWEB's commercial transaction
intelligence platform via a two-stage inference pipeline, combining a
lightweight RoBERTa stage with a GPU--accelerated multimodal stage to balance
cost and accuracy.

### [173] [Decomposing Behavioral Phase Transitions in LLMs: Order Parameters for Emergent Misalignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20015)
*Julian Arnold,Niels Lörch*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework detects and quantifies rapid misalignment transitions during fine-tuning on narrowly harmful data, using distributional change detection and language-based order parameters judged by an LLM. It reveals that behavioral shifts can lag behind gradient peaks and provides a decomposition of overall changes into components like alignment and verbosity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand when and how emergent misalignment arises during fine-tuning on narrowly harmful datasets and develop objective, automated measures to detect and characterize these transitions.

Method: Combine distributional change detection with language-based order parameters expressed in plain English and evaluated by an LLM judge. Use an objective statistical dissimilarity to quantify how phase transitions affect multiple model outputs and decompose total distributional change into aspects (e.g., alignment, verbosity). Compare training signals (e.g., gradient peak) with actual behavioral transition.

Result: Demonstrates that the actual behavioral transition occurs later in training than the gradient-norm peak; provides a framework to automate discovery/quantification of language-based order parameters; validates across examples from knowledge questions to politics and ethics with quantified decompositions of output changes.

Conclusion: The proposed framework enables automated detection and quantification of emergent misalignment through language-based metrics, improving understanding of when fine-tuning yields misaligned behavior and how to monitor and mitigate it.

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs on narrowly harmful datasets can lead to behavior that is
broadly misaligned with respect to human values. To understand when and how
this emergent misalignment occurs, we develop a comprehensive framework for
detecting and characterizing rapid transitions during fine-tuning using both
distributional change detection methods as well as order parameters that are
formulated in plain English and evaluated by an LLM judge. Using an objective
statistical dissimilarity measure, we quantify how the phase transition that
occurs during fine-tuning affects multiple aspects of the model. In particular,
we assess what percentage of the total distributional change in model outputs
is captured by different aspects, such as alignment or verbosity, providing a
decomposition of the overall transition. We also find that the actual
behavioral transition occurs later in training than indicated by the peak in
the gradient norm alone. Our framework enables the automated discovery and
quantification of language-based order parameters, which we demonstrate on
examples ranging from knowledge questions to politics and ethics.

TL;DR: Decentralized orchestration for LLM agents (Symphony) using a capabilities ledger, beacon-selection, and CoT-based weighted voting to coordinate lightweight LLMs on consumer GPUs; aims for privacy, scalability, and fault-tolerance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address high costs, rigid topologies, and limited adaptability of centralized LLM agent frameworks.

Method: Three mechanisms: (1) decentralized ledger for capabilities, (2) beacon-selection protocol for dynamic task allocation, (3) weighted result voting based on chain-of-thoughts; designed for privacy-preserving, scalable orchestration with low overhead.

Result: Outperforms baselines on reasoning benchmarks; substantial accuracy gains; robust across models with varying capacities.

Conclusion: Symphony demonstrates a privacy-preserving, scalable, fault-tolerant decentralized orchestration for LLM agents with low overhead, effective across model sizes.

Abstract: Most existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent frameworks rely on
centralized orchestration, incurring high deployment costs, rigid communication
topologies, and limited adaptability. To address these challenges, we introduce
Symphony, a decentralized multi-agent system which enables lightweight LLMs on
consumer-grade GPUs to coordinate. Symphony introduces three key mechanisms:
(1) a decentralized ledger that records capabilities, (2) a Beacon-selection
protocol for dynamic task allocation, and (3) weighted result voting based on
CoTs. This design forms a privacy-saving, scalable, and fault-tolerant
orchestration with low overhead. Empirically, Symphony outperforms existing
baselines on reasoning benchmarks, achieving substantial accuracy gains and
demonstrating robustness across models of varying capacities.

TL;DR: Human-guided fairness tool FairLoop distills a neural network into an inspectable decision tree, enabling users to edit unfair logic and fine-tune the model for context-aware bias mitigation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sensitive attributes like gender or age can lead to unfair predictions; there is a need for context-aware, human-involved bias mitigation rather than blanket attribute removal.

Method: Distill decision trees from the neural network, expose decision logic to users for inspection and modification, and use the edited logic to fine-tune the original model toward fairer predictions, emphasizing context-aware bias removal.

Result: The abstract claims improved fairness via context-aware bias removal with human involvement, but provides no quantitative results.

Conclusion: Human-guided, context-aware bias mitigation through model distillation and interactive edits is feasible and can steer neural models toward fairer predictions.

Abstract: Sensitive attributes like gender or age can lead to unfair predictions in
machine learning tasks such as predictive business process monitoring,
particularly when used without considering context. We present FairLoop1, a
tool for human-guided bias mitigation in neural network-based prediction
models. FairLoop distills decision trees from neural networks, allowing users
to inspect and modify unfair decision logic, which is then used to fine-tune
the original model towards fairer predictions. Compared to other approaches to
fairness, FairLoop enables context-aware bias removal through human
involvement, addressing the influence of sensitive attributes selectively
rather than excluding them uniformly.

*Deddy Jobson,Muktti Shukla,Phuong Dinh,Julio Christian Young,Nick Pitton,Nina Chen,Ryan Ginstrom*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can generate personalized, thematically aligned email titles that reflect content, improving engagement; validated via offline simulations and large-scale online tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Marketing emails often rely on fixed title templates, which constrains engagement. Personalization at the title level could better reflect email content, boosting opens/clicks. The work explores whether LLMs can safely and effectively automate thematic title generation for millions of users.

Method: Develop and evaluate LLM-based title generation for personalized emails. Conduct offline simulations and large-scale online experiments (millions of users) to test engagement impact. Address productionization and safety for automated generation at scale.

Result: The approach improved engagement between customers and emails in offline and online evaluations, demonstrating scalability and practical viability for automated title generation.

Conclusion: LLM-based thematic title generation is a viable, scalable approach for personalized email marketing, with practical benefits and considerations for safe deployment at scale.

Abstract: E-commerce marketplaces make use of a number of marketing channels like
emails, push notifications, etc. to reach their users and stimulate purchases.
Personalized emails especially are a popular touch point for marketers to
inform users of latest items in stock, especially for those who stopped
visiting the marketplace. Such emails contain personalized recommendations
tailored to each user's interests, enticing users to buy relevant items. A
common limitation of these emails is that the primary entry point, the title of
the email, tends to follow fixed templates, failing to inspire enough interest
in the contents. In this work, we explore the potential of large language
models (LLMs) for generating thematic titles that reflect the personalized
content of the emails. We perform offline simulations and conduct online
experiments on the order of millions of users, finding our techniques useful in
improving the engagement between customers and our emails. We highlight key
findings and learnings as we productionize the safe and automated generation of
email titles for millions of users.

### [177] [Pruning Strategies for Backdoor Defense in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20032)
*Santosh Chapagain,Shah Muhammad Hamdi,Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Six attention-head pruning strategies are proposed as post-hoc defenses against backdoor attacks in fine-tuned PLMs, with gradient-based pruning best against syntactic triggers and RL/Bayesian pruning more robust to stylistic triggers; all aim to remove least informative heads while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Backdoor vulnerabilities persist in fine-tuned pretrained language models even after standard fine-tuning. Hidden triggers are hard to detect, making post-hoc purification essential. The study investigates whether attention-head pruning can mitigate backdoors without knowledge of the trigger or a clean reference model.

Method: Six pruning-based strategies are proposed: (i) gradient-based pruning, (ii) layer-wise variance pruning, (iii) gradient-based pruning with structured L1/L2 sparsification, (iv) randomized ensemble pruning, (v) reinforcement-learning-guided pruning, and (vi) Bayesian uncertainty pruning. Each method iteratively removes the least informative attention heads while monitoring validation accuracy to avoid over-pruning.

Result: Experimental evaluation shows that gradient-based pruning performs best against syntactic triggers, whereas reinforcement learning and Bayesian pruning better withstand stylistic attacks.

Conclusion: Attention-head pruning offers a viable post-hoc defense against backdoor attacks in fine-tuned PLMs without trigger knowledge or clean references. Different pruning strategies provide robustness that varies by attack type, with gradient pruning excelling against syntactic triggers and RL/Bayesian pruning offering resilience to stylistic attacks.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks are a significant threat to the performance and integrity of
pre-trained language models. Although such models are routinely fine-tuned for
downstream NLP tasks, recent work shows they remain vulnerable to backdoor
attacks that survive vanilla fine-tuning. These attacks are difficult to defend
because end users typically lack knowledge of the attack triggers. Such attacks
consist of stealthy malicious triggers introduced through subtle syntactic or
stylistic manipulations, which can bypass traditional detection and remain in
the model, making post-hoc purification essential. In this study, we explore
whether attention-head pruning can mitigate these threats without any knowledge
of the trigger or access to a clean reference model. To this end, we design and
implement six pruning-based strategies: (i) gradient-based pruning, (ii)
layer-wise variance pruning, (iii) gradient-based pruning with structured L1/L2
sparsification, (iv) randomized ensemble pruning, (v)
reinforcement-learning-guided pruning, and (vi) Bayesian uncertainty pruning.
Each method iteratively removes the least informative heads while monitoring
validation accuracy to avoid over-pruning. Experimental evaluation shows that
gradient-based pruning performs best while defending the syntactic triggers,
whereas reinforcement learning and Bayesian pruning better withstand stylistic
attacks.

### [178] [Reinforcement Learning for Search Tree Size Minimization in Constraint Programming: New Results on Scheduling Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20056)
*Vilém Heinz,Petr Vilím,Zdeněk Hanzálek*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAB-guided reinforcement learning improves Failure-Directed Search for scheduling CP, delivering speedups and stronger bounds on JSSP and RCPSP, outperforming IBM CP Optimizer and a baseline FDS implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate the link between FDS search tree size minimization and multi-armed bandit problems, and leverage MAB reinforcement learning to enhance complete search in constraint programming scheduling.

Method: Analyze FDS properties to relate search-tree size minimization to MAB decisions; apply MAB algorithms to FDS, add problem-specific refinements and parameter tuning; implement in a new solver OptalCP; evaluate on JSSP and RCPSP benchmarks; compare against the original OptalCP and IBM CP Optimizer 22.1 FDS.

Result: Compared with the original OptalCP, the enhanced FDS is 1.7x faster on JSSP and 2.1x faster on RCPSP. When benchmarked against IBM CP Optimizer 22.1’s state-of-the-art FDS, it is 3.5x faster on JSSP and 2.1x faster on RCPSP. With a 900-second limit, the enhanced FDS improved lower bounds on 78 of 84 JSSP and 226 of 393 RCPSP instances, completely closing a few problems.

Conclusion: MAB-based reinforcement learning can substantially boost complete search algorithms in constraint programming scheduling, yielding meaningful speedups and stronger bounds, and showing competitive performance relative to a leading commercial solver.

Abstract: Failure-Directed Search (FDS) is a significant complete generic search
algorithm used in Constraint Programming (CP) to efficiently explore the search
space, proven particularly effective on scheduling problems. This paper
analyzes FDS's properties, showing that minimizing the size of its search tree
guided by ranked branching decisions is closely related to the Multi-armed
bandit (MAB) problem. Building on this insight, MAB reinforcement learning
algorithms are applied to FDS, extended with problem-specific refinements and
parameter tuning, and evaluated on the two most fundamental scheduling
problems, the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) and Resource-Constrained
Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP). The resulting enhanced FDS, using the best
extended MAB algorithm and configuration, performs 1.7 times faster on the JSSP
and 2.1 times faster on the RCPSP benchmarks compared to the original
implementation in a new solver called OptalCP, while also being 3.5 times
faster on the JSSP and 2.1 times faster on the RCPSP benchmarks than the
current state-of-the-art FDS algorithm in IBM CP Optimizer 22.1. Furthermore,
using only a 900-second time limit per instance, the enhanced FDS improved the
existing state-of-the-art lower bounds of 78 of 84 JSSP and 226 of 393 RCPSP
standard open benchmark instances while also completely closing a few of them.

### [179] [A goal-driven ruin and recreate heuristic for the 2D variable-sized bin packing problem with guillotine constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19306)
*Jeroen Gardeyn,Tony Wauters*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Introduces a ruin-and-recreate heuristic with goal-driven control for 2D guillotine bin packing (including rotations and heterogeneous bins); achieves state-of-the-art solution quality on benchmark instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Minimize total bin area required to cut all items under guillotine constraints, including variants with 90-degree rotation and mixed-bin sets; current methods leave room for quality improvements.

Method: A ruin-and-recreate metaheuristic combined with a goal-driven reconstruction strategy. The approach destructs parts of the current packing and rebuilds them guided by optimization goals, and it is extended to handle rotation and heterogeneous bins.

Result: Empirical evaluation on benchmark instances shows the proposed heuristic outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms across all considered variants in solution quality.

Conclusion: The proposed ruin-and-recreate, goal-driven heuristic is effective for guillotine 2D bin packing and its variants, offering improved solution quality and suggesting applicability to related cutting/packing problems.

Abstract: This paper addresses the two-dimensional bin packing problem with guillotine
constraints. The problem requires a set of rectangular items to be cut from
larger rectangles, known as bins, while only making use of edge-to-edge
(guillotine) cuts. The goal is to minimize the total bin area needed to cut all
required items. This paper also addresses variants of the problem which permit
90{\deg} rotation of items and/or a heterogeneous set of bins. A novel
heuristic is introduced which is based on the ruin and recreate paradigm
combined with a goal-driven approach. When applying the proposed heuristic to
benchmark instances from the literature, it outperforms the current
state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of solution quality for all variants of
the problem considered.

### [180] [A Walk on the Wild Side: a Shape-First Methodology for Orthogonal Drawings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19416)
*Giordano Andreola,Susanna Caroppo,Giuseppe Di Battista,Fabrizio Grosso,Maurizio Patrignani,Allegra Strippoli*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: A SAT-based, bend-minimizing approach for rectilinear graph drawings that incrementally subdivides edges to achieve bend-free (or near-bend-free) drawings; the DOMUS method outperforms OGDF's TSM-based approach on standard metrics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Topological-Shape-Metrics (TSM) driven orthogonal drawings emphasize minimizing crossings, often at the expense of long edge chains and large drawing areas, reducing geometric uniformity. Since orthogonal crossings have limited readability impact, there is value in minimizing bends and achieving more uniform, compact drawings. The goal is to obtain rectilinear drawings (0 bends) or near-rectilinear drawings by subdividing edges as needed, despite the NP-completeness of rectilinear drawability.

Method: Encode rectilinear drawability as a SAT formula. Iteratively subdivide edges by adding dummy vertices when the SAT instance is unsatisfiable, guided by the solver’s proof to select the edge to subdivide. Once a subdivision admits a rectilinear drawing, compute the final coordinates. The approach, implemented in DOMUS, is evaluated against OGDF’s TSM-based method on small- to medium-sized graphs.

Result: DOMUS consistently outperforms OGDF’s TSM-based approach across most standard graph drawing metrics on the tested graph sets.

Conclusion: A bend-minimization strategy based on SAT-based rectilinear drawability and iterative edge subdivision is effective and competitive, highlighting the value of focusing on bends and uniformity over strict crossing minimization in orthogonal drawings.

Abstract: Several algorithms for the construction of orthogonal drawings of graphs,
including those based on the Topology-Shape-Metrics (TSM) paradigm, tend to
prioritize the minimization of crossings. This emphasis has two notable side
effects: some edges are drawn with unnecessarily long sequences of segments and
bends, and the overall drawing area may become excessively large. As a result,
the produced drawings often lack geometric uniformity. Moreover, orthogonal
crossings are known to have a limited impact on readability, suggesting that
crossing minimization may not always be the optimal goal. In this paper, we
introduce a methodology that 'subverts' the traditional TSM pipeline by
focusing on minimizing bends. Given a graph $G$, we ideally seek to construct a
rectilinear drawing of $G$, that is, an orthogonal drawing with no bends. When
not possible, we incrementally subdivide the edges of $G$ by introducing dummy
vertices that will (possibly) correspond to bends in the final drawing. This
process continues until a rectilinear drawing of a subdivision of the graph is
found, after which the final coordinates are computed. We tackle the
(NP-complete) rectilinear drawability problem by encoding it as a SAT formula
and solving it with state-of-the-art SAT solvers. If the SAT formula is
unsatisfiable, we use the solver's proof to determine which edge to subdivide.
Our implementation, DOMUS, which is fairly simple, is evaluated through
extensive experiments on small- to medium-sized graphs. The results show that
it consistently outperforms OGDF's TSM-based approach across most standard
graph drawing metrics.

### [181] [Approximating mixed volumes to arbitrary accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19582)
*Hariharan Narayanan,Sourav Roy*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: A randomized polynomial-time algorithm is developed to approximate the mixed volume of a family of lattice polytopes, with provable (1±ε) accuracy and high probability, for fixed k and arbitrary exponents α_i. The complexity is polynomial in natural parameters including n, m0, a radius L, and a_mix factor Ã.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficient computation of mixed volumes is a central problem in convex geometry with applications in optimization, algebraic geometry, and polyhedral theory. The paper aims to extend tractable computation to a broad class of polytopes by leveraging randomized methods.

Method: Introduce an estimator for the mixed volume and prove its (1±ε) multiplicative accuracy with failure prob ≤ δ. The approach combines convex optimization, theory of Lorentzian polynomials, and polytope subdivision. It assumes each Pi is the convex hull of at most m0 lattice points and resides in B∞(2^L). The complexity scales polynomially with n, m0, L, Ã, ε^{-1}, and log δ^{-1}.

Result: First randomized polynomial-time algorithm for computing mixed volumes of polytopes of this type when k is a constant and α_i are arbitrary. The algorithm achieves high-accuracy estimates within a provable bound and runs in polynomial time in the stated parameters.

Conclusion: The work establishes a new tractable regime for mixed-volume computation by integrating tools from convex optimization, Lorentzian polynomials, and polytope subdivision, extending the frontier to fixed-k, arbitrary α_i, lattice-point-defined polytopes.

Abstract: We study the problem of approximating the mixed volume $V(P_1^{(\alpha_1)},
\dots, P_k^{(\alpha_k)})$ of an $k$-tuple of convex polytopes $(P_1, \dots,
P_k)$, each of which is defined as the convex hull of at most $m_0$ points in
$\mathbb{Z}^n$. We design an algorithm that produces an estimate that is within
a multiplicative $1 \pm \epsilon$ factor of the true mixed volume with a
probability greater than $1 - \delta.$ Let the constant $ \prod_{i=2}^{k}
\frac{(\alpha_{i}+1)^{\alpha_{i}+1}}{\alpha_{i}^{\,\alpha_{i}}}$ be denoted by
$\tilde{A}$. When each $P_i \subseteq B_\infty(2^L)$, we show in this paper
that the time complexity of the algorithm is bounded above by a polynomial in
$n, m_0, L, \tilde{A}, \epsilon^{-1}$ and $\log \delta^{-1}$. In fact, a
stronger result is proved in this paper, with slightly more involved
terminology.
  In particular, we provide the first randomized polynomial time algorithm for
computing mixed volumes of such polytopes when $k$ is an absolute constant, but
$\alpha_1, \dots, \alpha_k$ are arbitrary. Our approach synthesizes tools from
convex optimization, the theory of Lorentzian polynomials, and polytope
subdivision.

### [182] [Simpler is Faster: Practical Distance Reporting by Sorting Along a Space-Filling Curve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19891)
*Sarita de Berg,Ivor van der Hoog,Eva Rotenberg,Emil Toftegaard Gæde*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: A simple distance-reporting heuristic sorts points along a space-filling curve and answers queries by scanning up to four contiguous ranges; it matches or outperforms many sophisticated range structures in practice, especially dynamically, suggesting the curve itself drives most performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess the practical effectiveness of a simple, curve-based approach for distance and range reporting and compare it against modern data structures.

Method: Sort the point set P along a space-filling curve (e.g., Hilbert/Z-order). Convert a distance query to up to four rectangular ranges along the curve and report points in their union. Evaluate empirically against state-of-the-art structures (k-d trees, range trees, R-trees, quadtrees) in static and dynamic settings.

Result: Static experiments show the curve-based method is competitive with all but the most highly optimized structures (which themselves use curves). In dynamic settings, the simple method is preferred. Across experiments, the curve largely accounts for performance, sometimes more than the surrounding data-structure machinery.

Conclusion: Space-filling-curve based distance reporting is a practical, competitive approach; the curve, not the surrounding machinery, often drives performance, suggesting practitioners should consider simple curve-based schemes, especially for dynamic workloads.

Abstract: Range reporting is a classical problem in computational geometry. A
(rectangular) reporting data structure stores a point set $P$ of $n$ points,
such that, given a (rectangular) query region $\Delta$, it returns all points
in $P \cap \Delta$. A variety of data structures support such queries with
differing asymptotic guarantees such as $k$-d trees, range trees, $R$-trees,
and quadtrees. A common variant of range queries are distance reporting
queries, where the input is a query point $q$ and a radius $\delta$, and the
goal is to report all points in $P$ within distance $\delta$ of $q$. Such
queries frequently arise as subroutines in geometric data structure
construction and in Fr\'echet distance computations. Modern implementations
typically reduce distance queries to rectangular range queries using the data
structures listed above.
  We revisit a simple and practical heuristic for distance reporting. The
approach is straightforward: sort the input point set $P$ along a space-filling
curve. Queries then reduce to scanning at most four contiguous ranges along the
sorted curve. We show extensive experimental evaluation of modern distance and
range reporting data structures. In a static scenario, we show that this simple
technique is competitive with all but the most highly optimised range reporting
data structures. Notably, these involved structures use space-filling curves
themselves to speed up computation. In a dynamic setting, our simpler method
even becomes the preferred technique.
  This leads to a perhaps unexpected insight: while modern data structures
invest heavily in leveraging space-filling curves for optimising their layout
and traversal, it is the curve itself, rather than the surrounding machinery,
that delivers much of the performance.

### [183] [Internally-Convex Drawings of Outerplanar Graphs in Small Area](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19913)
*Michael A. Bekos,Giordano Da Lozzo,Fabrizio Frati,Giuseppe Liotta,Antonios Symvonis*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Improved area bounds for embedding-preserving straight-line grid drawings of outerplanar graphs: convex interiors yield O(n^{1.5}) area; for strictly convex interiors with weak dual a path, area is Theta(n k^2) where k is the maximum internal facial cycle size.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Outerplanar graph drawings with embedding preservation and convexity constraints are important for readable visualizations. The paper builds on Kant's 1996 result to reduce required drawing area and to analyze specialized dual-structure cases.

Method: Develop constructive algorithms that produce embedding-preserving grid drawings with convex or strictly convex internal faces. Analyze area bounds by exploiting outerplanar structure and the weak dual (especially when it is a path).

Result: (1) A algorithm to compute embedding-preserving convex-internal-face drawings in O(n^{1.5}) area. (2) For strictly-convex outerplanar drawings with weak dual being a path, a drawing algorithm achieving Theta(n k^2) area, where k is the maximum size of an internal facial cycle.

Conclusion: The results improve previously known area bounds and clarify how dual structure (path) affects area for strictly convex drawings, suggesting further exploration for broader dual classes and tighter constants.

Abstract: A well-known result by Kant [Algorithmica, 1996] implies that n-vertex
outerplane graphs admit embedding-preserving planar straight-line grid drawings
where the internal faces are convex polygons in $O(n^2)$ area. In this paper,
we present an algorithm to compute such drawings in $O(n^{1.5})$ area. We also
consider outerplanar drawings in which the internal faces are required to be
strictly-convex polygons. In this setting, we consider outerplanar graphs whose
weak dual is a path and give a drawing algorithm that achieves $\Theta(nk^2)$
area, where $k$ is the maximum size of an internal facial cycle.

### [184] [Visualizing Treewidth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19935)
*Alvin Chiu,Thomas Depian,David Eppstein,Michael T. Goodrich,Martin Nöllenburg*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: A framework for witness drawings of graphs with bounded pathwidth or treewidth, using bag-based decompositions, per-bag subgraphs, and vertex tracks, with an implemented prototype and a taxonomy of drawing styles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clearly communicate width-boundedness in graphs and minimize visual crossings in witness drawings.

Method: Represent the decomposition as a tree (path) of bags, show induced subgraphs per bag, connect vertex copies with tracks, optimize bag layouts to reduce crossings; implement a prototype using DP for small width and heuristics for larger width; propose a taxonomy of drawing styles (arc diagrams on one or two pages or circular layouts) and track renderings (straight or orbital-radial).

Result: A visualization prototype is implemented for crossing minimization; DP-based method for small width and heuristic approaches for larger width; a taxonomy of drawing styles and track renderings.

Conclusion: The approach provides a flexible, readable framework for witnessing bounded width in graphs and can be extended with more styles and empirical evaluation.

Abstract: A witness drawing of a graph is a visualization that clearly shows a given
property of a graph. We study and implement various drawing paradigms for
witness drawings to clearly show that graphs have bounded pathwidth or
treewidth. Our approach draws the tree decomposition or path decomposition as a
tree of bags, with induced subgraphs shown in each bag, and with ''tracks'' for
each graph vertex connecting its copies in multiple bags. Within bags, we
optimize the vertex layout to avoid crossings of edges and tracks. We implement
a visualization prototype for crossing minimization using dynamic programming
for graphs of small width and heuristic approaches for graphs of larger width.
We introduce a taxonomy of drawing styles, which render the subgraph for each
bag as an arc diagram with one or two pages or as a circular layout with
straight-line edges, and we render tracks either with straight lines or with
orbital-radial paths.

*Alex Cuellar,Ho Chit Siu,Julie A Shah*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces PARCC, a positionally-augmented RCC framework to express human-oriented spatial relations; adds a learning-from-demonstrations algorithm; a human study shows learning-based specs better capture human intent than hand-crafted ones.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods lack expressivity to capture human-like spatial rules for object configuration in manipulation tasks, hindering robots' ability to align with human preferences.

Method: Define PARCC as an extension of Region Connection Calculus with position-augmented relations; develop an inference/learning algorithm that derives PARCC specifications from demonstrations; validate via a human study.

Result: PARCC can capture a human's intended specification; learning-from-demonstration approaches outperform human-provided (hand-crafted) specifications.

Conclusion: PARCC provides an expressive, learnable framework for representing human-like spatial arrangements in robotics; demonstration-based learning improves alignment with human intent and task success.

Abstract: As robots' manipulation capabilities improve for pick-and-place tasks (e.g.,
object packing, sorting, and kitting), methods focused on understanding
human-acceptable object configurations remain limited expressively with regard
to capturing spatial relationships important to humans. To advance robotic
understanding of human rules for object arrangement, we introduce
positionally-augmented RCC (PARCC), a formal logic framework based on region
connection calculus (RCC) for describing the relative position of objects in
space. Additionally, we introduce an inference algorithm for learning PARCC
specifications via demonstrations. Finally, we present the results from a human
study, which demonstrate our framework's ability to capture a human's intended
specification and the benefits of learning from demonstration approaches over
human-provided specifications.

*Diancheng Li,Nia Ralston,Bastiaan Hagen,Phoebe Tan,Matthew A. Robertson*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FlipWalker introduces a two-segment, underactuated robot inspired by Jacob's Ladder, using flipping dynamics and ground-reaction-driven propulsion to traverse irregular terrain. It weighs 0.78 kg, flips at up to 0.2 body lengths per second, and demonstrates climbing and traversal on grass, rocks, and snow with a physics-based model to guide design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address locomotion on challenging outdoor terrains where wheels or traditional legged systems struggle; leverage an underactuated, pivoting design that uses flipping as a primary motion primitive to overcome obstacles.

Method: Two segments connected by flexible cables; motor-driven legs push off ground or opposite segment depending on configuration; physics-based model of flipping dynamics to identify design parameters; untethered prototype (0.78 kg) tested on grass, rocks, and snow; performance metrics include maximum flipping speed and terrain traversal.

Result: The flipping strategy relies on ground reaction forces normal to the surface to propel motion, enabling obstacle clearance and forward progression on irregular terrains; prototype demonstrated 0.2 body lengths/s flipping speed and successful traversal of tested terrains.

Conclusion: FlipWalker offers a promising alternative to wheel-based locomotion on irregular terrains by exploiting underactuated flipping dynamics and inter-segment coupling; further work could optimize parameters, robustness, and scaling for broader environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces FlipWalker, a novel underactuated robot locomotion
system inspired by Jacob's Ladder illusion toy, designed to traverse
challenging terrains where wheeled robots often struggle. Like the Jacob's
Ladder toy, FlipWalker features two interconnected segments joined by flexible
cables, enabling it to pivot and flip around singularities in a manner
reminiscent of the toy's cascading motion. Actuation is provided by
motor-driven legs within each segment that push off either the ground or the
opposing segment, depending on the robot's current configuration. A
physics-based model of the underactuated flipping dynamics is formulated to
elucidate the critical design parameters governing forward motion and obstacle
clearance or climbing. The untethered prototype weighs 0.78 kg, achieves a
maximum flipping speed of 0.2 body lengths per second. Experimental trials on
artificial grass, river rocks, and snow demonstrate that FlipWalker's flipping
strategy, which relies on ground reaction forces applied normal to the surface,
offers a promising alternative to traditional locomotion for navigating
irregular outdoor terrain.

*Chaoran Zhu,Hengyi Wang,Yik Lung Pang,Changjae Oh*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Self-supervised learning of visual-textual associations via masked goal image reconstruction for language-guided robot manipulation; introduces Omni-Object Pick-and-Place dataset; outperforms prior methods on five benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Two-step methods relying on vision-language similarity struggle to capture visual-textual relationships, limiting manipulation precision; aim for data-efficient, generalizable representations without heavy action supervision.

Method: Train a model to reconstruct a masked goal image conditioned on an input image and textual instructions (self-supervised pretext task); learn visual-action representations without robot action supervision; fine-tune with few demonstrations; introduce Omni-Object Pick-and-Place dataset (180 object classes, 3,200 instances with textual instructions) to enable diverse priors and evaluation across instances.

Result: Empirical results on five benchmarks, simulated and real-robot, show improved performance over prior art; dataset provides broad object priors and robust generalization; demonstrated few-shot fine-tuning potential.

Conclusion: The proposed self-supervised visual-textual association learning yields more accurate and generalizable language-guided manipulation; the Omni-Object Pick-and-place dataset supports broader evaluation and future work in robust object manipulation with language cues.

Abstract: Visual-textual understanding is essential for language-guided robot
manipulation. Recent works leverage pre-trained vision-language models to
measure the similarity between encoded visual observations and textual
instructions, and then train a model to map this similarity to robot actions.
However, this two-step approach limits the model to capture the relationship
between visual observations and textual instructions, leading to reduced
precision in manipulation tasks. We propose to learn visual-textual
associations through a self-supervised pretext task: reconstructing a masked
goal image conditioned on an input image and textual instructions. This
formulation allows the model to learn visual-action representations without
robot action supervision. The learned representations can then be fine-tuned
for manipulation tasks with only a few demonstrations. We also introduce the
\textit{Omni-Object Pick-and-Place} dataset, which consists of annotated robot
tabletop manipulation episodes, including 180 object classes and 3,200
instances with corresponding textual instructions. This dataset enables the
model to acquire diverse object priors and allows for a more comprehensive
evaluation of its generalisation capability across object instances.
Experimental results on the five benchmarks, including both simulated and
real-robot validations, demonstrate that our method outperforms prior art.

### [188] [From Stoplights to On-Ramps: A Comprehensive Set of Crash Rate Benchmarks for Freeway and Surface Street ADS Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19425)
*John M. Scanlon,Timothy L McMurry,Yin-Hsiu Chen,Kristofer D. Kusano,Trent Victor*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces freeway-specific crash-rate benchmarks for US ADS evaluation, revealing strong geographic variation and the need for location-specific benchmarks to avoid biased safety assessments; uses police crash data and VMT to define road-type, crash typology, and statistical-significance mileage; Atlanta shows higher freeway crash rates than Phoenix; severity alters crash-type distribution; provides a foundational framework for future ADS benchmarking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend prior ADS benchmarking, which focused on surface streets, to include freeway crash risk and capture geographic heterogeneity. Address statistical power and potential biases in safety evaluations by developing location-specific, freeway-focused benchmarks.

Method: Utilize publicly available police-reported crash data and vehicle miles traveled (VMT); isolate in-transport passenger vehicles; classify road types (freeway vs surface streets); categorize crash typology by severity; compute crash rates per injury-per-million-miles (IPMM); compare across cities (e.g., Atlanta vs Phoenix) and severity levels; determine VMT required to achieve statistical significance when comparing to human performance.

Result: Freeway crash rates vary geographically with any-injury crash rate in Atlanta at 2.4 IPMM (highest) vs Phoenix at 0.7 IPMM (lowest). Higher severity outcomes show a larger share of single-vehicle, VRU, and opposite-direction crashes, indicating crash-type distributions depend on severity. The study quantifies the mileage needed to detect statistically significant deviations from human performance and establishes freeway-specific benchmarks for ADS evaluation.

Conclusion: First paper to generate freeway-specific benchmarks for ADS evaluation; provides a foundational framework for future ADS benchmarking by evaluators and developers and emphasizes the need for location-specific benchmarks to avoid biased safety assessments.

Abstract: This paper presents crash rate benchmarks for evaluating US-based Automated
Driving Systems (ADS) for multiple urban areas. The purpose of this study was
to extend prior benchmarks focused only on surface streets to additionally
capture freeway crash risk for future ADS safety performance assessments. Using
publicly available police-reported crash and vehicle miles traveled (VMT) data,
the methodology details the isolation of in-transport passenger vehicles, road
type classification, and crash typology. Key findings revealed that freeway
crash rates exhibit large geographic dependence variations with
any-injury-reported crash rates being nearly 3.5 times higher in Atlanta (2.4
IPMM; the highest) when compared to Phoenix (0.7 IPMM; the lowest). The results
show the critical need for location-specific benchmarks to avoid biased safety
evaluations and provide insights into the vehicle miles traveled (VMT) required
to achieve statistical significance for various safety impact levels. The
distribution of crash types depended on the outcome severity level. Higher
severity outcomes (e.g., fatal crashes) had a larger proportion of
single-vehicle, vulnerable road users (VRU), and opposite-direction collisions
compared to lower severity (police-reported) crashes. Given heterogeneity in
crash types by severity, performance in low-severity scenarios may not be
predictive of high-severity outcomes. These benchmarks are additionally used to
quantify at the required mileage to show statistically significant deviations
from human performance. This is the first paper to generate freeway-specific
benchmarks for ADS evaluation and provides a foundational framework for future
ADS benchmarking by evaluators and developers.

*Gustavo A. Cardona,Kaier Liang,Cristian-Ioan Vasile*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An iterative exploration–exploitation algorithm for heterogeneous multi-agent route planning under unknown resource distributions, using Capability Temporal Logic (CaTL); validated by simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncertainty in resource distributions impedes mission satisfaction; there is a need for robust, scalable planning for heterogeneous robot teams under incomplete information.

Method: Proposes an iterative algorithm that balances environmental exploration with task fulfillment, guiding robots to discover resource locations and quantities while progressively refining the resource map and adapting plans based on CaTL-based objectives.

Result: Simulated case studies show the approach robustly coordinates heterogeneous agents and achieves higher mission satisfaction under uncertainty compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: The approach provides a robust, adaptive framework for planning in dynamic, resource-constrained environments with uncertain resource landscapes, enabling efficient coordination of heterogeneous teams.

Abstract: This paper presents an iterative approach for heterogeneous multi-agent route
planning in environments with unknown resource distributions. We focus on a
team of robots with diverse capabilities tasked with executing missions
specified using Capability Temporal Logic (CaTL), a formal framework built on
Signal Temporal Logic to handle spatial, temporal, capability, and resource
constraints. The key challenge arises from the uncertainty in the initial
distribution and quantity of resources in the environment. To address this, we
introduce an iterative algorithm that dynamically balances exploration and task
fulfillment. Robots are guided to explore the environment, identifying resource
locations and quantities while progressively refining their understanding of
the resource landscape. At the same time, they aim to maximally satisfy the
mission objectives based on the current information, adapting their strategies
as new data is uncovered. This approach provides a robust solution for planning
in dynamic, resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient coordination
of heterogeneous teams even under conditions of uncertainty. Our method's
effectiveness and performance are demonstrated through simulated case studies.

*Dane Brouwer,Joshua Citron,Heather Nolte,Jeannette Bohg,Mark Cutkosky*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Using non-prehensile tactile sensing and force feedback improves learning-based object extraction from clutter. Imitation learning with a wrench and tactile modalities outperforms baselines; best results with both, showing ~80% improvement over a force-free baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: People use tactile sensing on the sides and backs of hands/arms to safely retract objects from clutter. The study investigates how such sensing can train robots to reach into constrained clutter without causing damage or excessive force.

Method: An imitation-learning framework trained on demonstrations in randomly generated clutter scenes. The study performs an ablation on force-sensitive modalities: non-prehensile triaxial tactile sensing and wrench estimates from joint torques, plus a suction-based success signal. Policies are evaluated across 40 unseen environment configurations.

Result: Policies that include force sensing show fewer excessive-force failures, higher success rates, and faster completion. The best performance occurs when both tactile sensing and wrench information are used, with about an 80% improvement over the baseline that lacks force information.

Conclusion: Incorporating force sensing (tactile and wrench) into learning-based policies enhances safe and efficient extraction of objects from clutter; combining both modalities yields the strongest gains.

Abstract: Dense collections of movable objects are common in everyday spaces -- from
cabinets in a home to shelves in a warehouse. Safely retracting objects from
such collections is difficult for robots, yet people do it easily, using
non-prehensile tactile sensing on the sides and backs of their hands and arms.
We investigate the role of such sensing for training robots to gently reach
into constrained clutter and extract objects. The available sensing modalities
are (1) "eye-in-hand" vision, (2) proprioception, (3) non-prehensile triaxial
tactile sensing, (4) contact wrenches estimated from joint torques, and (5) a
measure of successful object acquisition obtained by monitoring the vacuum line
of a suction cup. We use imitation learning to train policies from a set of
demonstrations on randomly generated scenes, then conduct an ablation study of
wrench and tactile information. We evaluate each policy's performance across 40
unseen environment configurations. Policies employing any force sensing show
fewer excessive force failures, an increased overall success rate, and faster
completion times. The best performance is achieved using both tactile and
wrench information, producing an 80% improvement above the baseline without
force information.

*Tian Qiu,Alan Zoubi,Yiyuan Lin,Ruiming Du,Lailiang Cheng,Yu Jiang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A two-stage diffusion-based 3D reconstruction framework (DATR) for sparse-view apple trees, achieving high geometric fidelity and fast throughput, enabling scalable agricultural digital twins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable accurate 3D reconstructions of physical assets under field conditions with sparse views, addressing occlusion and data sparsity to support real-time monitoring and digital twin applications in agriculture.

Method: Stage 1 uses onboard sensors and foundation models to semi-automatically generate tree masks from field images, filtering background. Stage 2 performs single-image-to-3D reconstruction using a diffusion model and a large reconstruction model (LRM) for multi-view and implicit neural field generation. Training leverages a Real2Sim data generator to create realistic synthetic apple trees. Evaluation on a six-tree real field dataset with ground truth and a synthetic diverse-tree dataset.

Result: DATR outperformed existing 3D reconstruction methods on both field and synthetic datasets and achieved domain-trait estimation comparable to industrial-grade stationary laser scanners, while increasing throughput by ~360x.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates strong potential for scalable agricultural digital twin systems by delivering high-fidelity 3D reconstructions from sparse data with significantly higher throughput.

Abstract: Digital twin applications offered transformative potential by enabling
real-time monitoring and robotic simulation through accurate virtual replicas
of physical assets. The key to these systems is 3D reconstruction with high
geometrical fidelity. However, existing methods struggled under field
conditions, especially with sparse and occluded views. This study developed a
two-stage framework (DATR) for the reconstruction of apple trees from sparse
views. The first stage leverages onboard sensors and foundation models to
semi-automatically generate tree masks from complex field images. Tree masks
are used to filter out background information in multi-modal data for the
single-image-to-3D reconstruction at the second stage. This stage consists of a
diffusion model and a large reconstruction model for respective multi view and
implicit neural field generation. The training of the diffusion model and LRM
was achieved by using realistic synthetic apple trees generated by a Real2Sim
data generator. The framework was evaluated on both field and synthetic
datasets. The field dataset includes six apple trees with field-measured ground
truth, while the synthetic dataset featured structurally diverse trees.
Evaluation results showed that our DATR framework outperformed existing 3D
reconstruction methods across both datasets and achieved domain-trait
estimation comparable to industrial-grade stationary laser scanners while
improving the throughput by $\sim$360 times, demonstrating strong potential for
scalable agricultural digital twin systems.

*Maryam Kazemi Eskeri,Thomas Wiedemann,Ville Kyrki,Dominik Baumann,Tomasz Piotr Kucner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A lightweight, real-time macroscopic crowd prediction model for robot navigation in dense crowds that balances accuracy and efficiency, achieving faster inference and better prediction, enabling socially compliant planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots in human-populated environments must navigate safely and efficiently by estimating crowd movement in real time. Traditional microscopic models scale poorly in dense crowds, and macroscopic models are either too simplistic or too computationally intensive, hindering real-time deployment.

Method: Propose a lightweight macroscopic crowd prediction model tailored for human motion. The approach simplifies spatial and temporal processing based on inherent pedestrian flow characteristics, enabling robust generalization without heavy architectures and reducing inference time.

Result: The model achieves a 3.6x reduction in inference time and a 3.1% improvement in prediction accuracy. When integrated into a socially aware planning framework, it enables efficient and socially compliant robot navigation in dynamic environments.

Conclusion: Efficient macroscopic crowd modeling can enable robots to navigate dense environments without costly computations, balancing accuracy and efficiency in real-time human-robot interaction.

Abstract: Robots operating in human-populated environments must navigate safely and
efficiently while minimizing social disruption. Achieving this requires
estimating crowd movement to avoid congested areas in real-time. Traditional
microscopic models struggle to scale in dense crowds due to high computational
cost, while existing macroscopic crowd prediction models tend to be either
overly simplistic or computationally intensive. In this work, we propose a
lightweight, real-time macroscopic crowd prediction model tailored for human
motion, which balances prediction accuracy and computational efficiency. Our
approach simplifies both spatial and temporal processing based on the inherent
characteristics of pedestrian flow, enabling robust generalization without the
overhead of complex architectures. We demonstrate a 3.6 times reduction in
inference time, while improving prediction accuracy by 3.1 %. Integrated into a
socially aware planning framework, the model enables efficient and socially
compliant robot navigation in dynamic environments. This work highlights that
efficient human crowd modeling enables robots to navigate dense environments
without costly computations.

*Amin Berjaoui Tahmaz,Ravi Prakash,Jens Kober*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An impedance-primitive augmented hierarchical RL framework enables efficient, adaptable contact-based robotic manipulation through variable stiffness primitives, adaptive stiffness control, and affordance-guided exploration, achieving improved learning efficiency, modularity, and sim2real transfer across tasks like block lifting, door opening, pushing, and surface cleaning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve learning efficiency, compositionality, and success rates in complex contact-rich robotic manipulation tasks by combining variable stiffness control with a hierarchical, primitive-based policy.

Method: Introduce an action space with variable stiffness, an adaptive stiffness controller for dynamic stiffness during primitive execution, and affordance coupling to guide exploration. The framework executes sequential behavior primitives within a hierarchical structure, enabling efficient exploration and compositional primitive selection. Evaluations span simulation tasks (block lifting, door opening, object pushing, surface cleaning) and real-world tests demonstrating sim2real capability.

Result: Demonstrates improved learning efficiency, better compositionality in selecting primitives, and higher success rates compared with state-of-the-art methods. Real-world experiments corroborate sim2real transfer.

Conclusion: This work establishes a foundation for more adaptive and versatile manipulation systems by integrating variable-stiffness primitives into a hierarchical framework, with potential to tackle more complex, contact-rich tasks in the real world.

Abstract: This paper presents an Impedance Primitive-augmented hierarchical
reinforcement learning framework for efficient robotic manipulation in
sequential contact tasks. We leverage this hierarchical structure to
sequentially execute behavior primitives with variable stiffness control
capabilities for contact tasks. Our proposed approach relies on three key
components: an action space enabling variable stiffness control, an adaptive
stiffness controller for dynamic stiffness adjustments during primitive
execution, and affordance coupling for efficient exploration while encouraging
compliance. Through comprehensive training and evaluation, our framework learns
efficient stiffness control capabilities and demonstrates improvements in
learning efficiency, compositionality in primitive selection, and success rates
compared to the state-of-the-art. The training environments include block
lifting, door opening, object pushing, and surface cleaning. Real world
evaluations further confirm the framework's sim2real capability. This work lays
the foundation for more adaptive and versatile robotic manipulation systems,
with potential applications in more complex contact-based tasks.

### [194] [Autonomous Aerial Manipulation at Arbitrary Pose in SE(3) with Robust Control and Whole-body Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19608)
*Dongjae Lee,Byeongjun Kim,H. Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Geometric robust control for an omnidirectional aerial manipulator (OAM) with a two-step, optimization-based full-body planner enabling arbitrary 6D hovering and collision-free manipulation near obstacles; experiments show success in grasping/pulling at extreme pitch angles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome multirotor underactuated limitations by allowing the base to hover at arbitrary orientation, thereby expanding the manipulation workspace in SE(3) and enabling tasks previously not feasible, especially near obstacles where precise pose control is needed.

Method: Develop a geometric robust controller for a floating base to mitigate disturbance from the manipulator and interaction forces. Then design a two-step optimization-based whole-body planner that jointly optimizes the base pose and arm joint angles, enabling real-time, non-convex, non-Euclidean planning and ensuring collision-free manipulation with the base stationary in 6D pose while performing tasks.

Result: A working OAM framework is demonstrated with grasping and pulling tasks in various scenarios, including near 90° and 180° pitch angles, validating stability, collision avoidance, and real-time planning.

Conclusion: The proposed geometric robust control combined with a two-step whole-body planner significantly extends the feasible manipulation capabilities of aerial manipulators by enabling arbitrary orientation hovering and coordinated base-arm motion, enabling complex manipulation near obstacles.

Abstract: Aerial manipulators based on conventional multirotors can conduct
manipulation only in small roll and pitch angles due to the underactuatedness
of the multirotor base. If the multirotor base is capable of hovering at
arbitrary orientation, the robot can freely locate itself at any point in
$\mathsf{SE}(3)$, significantly extending its manipulation workspace and
enabling a manipulation task that was originally not viable. In this work, we
present a geometric robust control and whole-body motion planning framework for
an omnidirectional aerial manipulator (OAM). To maximize the strength of OAM,
we first propose a geometric robust controller for a floating base. Since the
motion of the robotic arm and the interaction forces during manipulation affect
the stability of the floating base, the base should be capable of mitigating
these adverse effects while controlling its 6D pose. We then design a two-step
optimization-based whole-body motion planner, jointly considering the pose of
the floating base and the joint angles of the robotic arm to harness the entire
configuration space. The devised two-step approach facilitates real-time
applicability and enhances convergence of the optimization problem with
non-convex and non-Euclidean search space. The proposed approach enables the
base to be stationary at any 6D pose while autonomously carrying out
sophisticated manipulation near obstacles without any collision. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed framework through experiments in which an OAM
performs grasping and pulling of an object in multiple scenarios, including
near $90^\circ$ and even $180^\circ$ pitch angles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve both agile maneuverability and high energy efficiency for aerial robots operating in dynamic wind environments, addressing the trade-off between thruster-powered agility and fixed-wing efficiency.

Method: Design optimization for passive stability and morphological adaptability inspired by birds; control policy derived from experimentally learned aerodynamic model enabling attitude and position control without active propulsion; wind-tunnel experiments validate performance.

Result: Floaty can hover, maneuver, and reject disturbances in vertical airflows up to 10 m/s; achieves ~10 W/kg specific power, about an order of magnitude lower than thruster-powered systems.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a paradigm shift toward energy-efficient aerial robotics by leveraging morphological intelligence and passive wind energy harvesting, enabling sustainable operation in challenging wind conditions.

Abstract: Achieving both agile maneuverability and high energy efficiency in aerial
robots, particularly in dynamic wind environments, remains challenging.
Conventional thruster-powered systems offer agility but suffer from high energy
consumption, while fixed-wing designs are efficient but lack hovering and
maneuvering capabilities. We present Floaty, a shape-changing robot that
overcomes these limitations by passively soaring, harnessing wind energy
through intelligent morphological control inspired by birds. Floaty's design is
optimized for passive stability, and its control policy is derived from an
experimentally learned aerodynamic model, enabling precise attitude and
position control without active propulsion. Wind tunnel experiments demonstrate
Floaty's ability to hover, maneuver, and reject disturbances in vertical
airflows up to 10 m/s. Crucially, Floaty achieves this with a specific power
consumption of 10 W/kg, an order of magnitude lower than thruster-powered
systems. This introduces a paradigm for energy-efficient aerial robotics,
leveraging morphological intelligence and control to operate sustainably in
challenging wind conditions.

TL;DR: Introduces Maps of Dynamics (MoDs) to account for human motion in MRTA; shows significant reductions in mission times by incorporating dynamic human movement into task allocation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most MRTA methods are dynamics-agnostic, using static maps and ignoring human movement patterns, which leads to delays in shared environments.

Method: Proposes Maps of Dynamics (MoDs), spatio-temporal, queryable models that capture historical human movement. Integrates MoDs into a stochastic cost function used in MRTA to estimate task execution time under human presence. Demonstrates improved MRTA performance.

Result: Experiments show mission completion times reduced by up to 26% compared to a dynamics-agnostic MRTA, and up to 19% compared to a baseline.

Conclusion: Highlighting the importance of accounting for human dynamics in MRTA for shared environments; provides an efficient framework for deploying multi-robot systems around humans.

Abstract: Multi-robot systems are increasingly deployed in applications, such as
intralogistics or autonomous delivery, where multiple robots collaborate to
complete tasks efficiently. One of the key factors enabling their efficient
cooperation is Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA). Algorithms solving this
problem optimize task distribution among robots to minimize the overall
execution time. In shared environments, apart from the relative distance
between the robots and the tasks, the execution time is also significantly
impacted by the delay caused by navigating around moving people. However, most
existing MRTA approaches are dynamics-agnostic, relying on static maps and
neglecting human motion patterns, leading to inefficiencies and delays. In this
paper, we introduce \acrfull{method name}. This method leverages Maps of
Dynamics (MoDs), spatio-temporal queryable models designed to capture
historical human movement patterns, to estimate the impact of humans on the
task execution time during deployment. \acrshort{method name} utilizes a
stochastic cost function that includes MoDs. Experimental results show that
integrating MoDs enhances task allocation performance, resulting in reduced
mission completion times by up to $26\%$ compared to the dynamics-agnostic
method and up to $19\%$ compared to the baseline. This work underscores the
importance of considering human dynamics in MRTA within shared environments and
presents an efficient framework for deploying multi-robot systems in
environments populated by humans.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FDIT* is a force-direction-informed, sampling-based path planner that extends EIT* by using information from invalid vertices and Coulomb-like physics to guide search, employing an elliptical k-NN search to improve speed and cost in high-dimensional spaces, validated from R^4 to R^16 and on real-world mobile manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle high-dimensional motion planning challenges by reducing computation time and path cost, leveraging information typically discarded from invalid vertices and physics-inspired guidance.

Method: Introduce Force Direction Informed Trees (FDIT*), building on EIT* and integrating invalid-vertex data with Coulomb-like force dynamics. Uses elliptical k-nearest neighbors for selective exploration of search-worthy regions, extending nearest-neighbor search techniques to focus on problem-specific areas.

Result: FDIT* improves search efficiency and reduces solution cost, outperforming existing single-query, sampling-based planners on problems in R^4 to R^16 and demonstrated on a real-world mobile manipulation task.

Conclusion: FDIT* accelerates convergence to the optimal path by combining physics-inspired force directions with invalid-vertex information, representing a valuable extension to sampling-based planning in high-dimensional spaces.

Abstract: Path planning has long been an important and active research area in
robotics. To address challenges in high-dimensional motion planning, this study
introduces the Force Direction Informed Trees (FDIT*), a sampling-based planner
designed to enhance speed and cost-effectiveness in pathfinding. FDIT* builds
upon the state-of-the-art informed sampling planner, the Effort Informed Trees
(EIT*), by capitalizing on often-overlooked information in invalid vertices. It
incorporates principles of physical force, particularly Coulomb's law. This
approach proposes the elliptical $k$-nearest neighbors search method, enabling
fast convergence navigation and avoiding high solution cost or infeasible paths
by exploring more problem-specific search-worthy areas. It demonstrates
benefits in search efficiency and cost reduction, particularly in confined,
high-dimensional environments. It can be viewed as an extension of nearest
neighbors search techniques. Fusing invalid vertex data with physical dynamics
facilitates force-direction-based search regions, resulting in an improved
convergence rate to the optimum. FDIT* outperforms existing single-query,
sampling-based planners on the tested problems in R^4 to R^16 and has been

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: G3T* is a bidirectional motion planner that grafts invalid edges to reconnect trees using GuILD-guided densification, achieving faster convergence and lower costs with asymptotic optimality across dimensions up to 8 and in real robots.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address failures in connecting forward and reverse trees in asymmetric bidirectional planning caused by lazy-reverse search and re-planning overhead.

Method: G3T* grafts invalid connections at both ends to reestablish connectivity; employs a greedy strategy with GuILD (guided incremental local densification) subsets minimized by Lebesgue measure to efficiently optimize paths; adaptively adjusts sampling between the informed set and GuILD subsets based on historical and current cost improvements to preserve asymptotic optimality.

Result: Outperforms existing single-query sampling-based planners in benchmarks from R^2 to R^8 and in real-world robotic evaluations; demonstrates faster convergence and lower solution costs; a video of results is linked.

Conclusion: G3T* enhances forward-search growth toward the reverse tree through grafting and adaptive sampling, yielding rapid, cost-effective, asymptotically optimal path planning across multiple dimensions.

Abstract: Bidirectional motion planning often reduces planning time compared to its
unidirectional counterparts. It requires connecting the forward and reverse
search trees to form a continuous path. However, this process could fail and
restart the asymmetric bidirectional search due to the limitations of
lazy-reverse search. To address this challenge, we propose Greedy GuILD
Grafting Trees (G3T*), a novel path planner that grafts invalid edge
connections at both ends to re-establish tree-based connectivity, enabling
rapid path convergence. G3T* employs a greedy approach using the minimum
Lebesgue measure of guided incremental local densification (GuILD) subsets to
optimize paths efficiently. Furthermore, G3T* dynamically adjusts the sampling
distribution between the informed set and GuILD subsets based on historical and
current cost improvements, ensuring asymptotic optimality. These features
enhance the forward search's growth towards the reverse tree, achieving faster
convergence and lower solution costs. Benchmark experiments across dimensions
from R^2 to R^8 and real-world robotic evaluations demonstrate G3T*'s superior
performance compared to existing single-query sampling-based planners. A video

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance safety, trust, and effective human-robot interaction in home environments by enabling robots to anticipate hazards.

Method: Represent each object as a node with a risk score; risk propagates asymmetrically from high-risk to nearby objects using a semantic graph; propagation depends on spatial proximity and accident relationships; designed for interpretability and lightweight onboard deployment.

Result: Validated on a dataset with human-annotated risk regions; binary risk accuracy of 75%; strong alignment with human perception, especially for sharp or unstable objects.

Conclusion: Context-aware risk reasoning can improve robotic scene understanding and proactive safety behaviors, providing a foundation for real-time alerts and autonomous hazard mitigation in home environments.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for estimating accident-prone regions in
everyday indoor scenes, aimed at improving real-time risk awareness in service
robots operating in human-centric environments. As robots become integrated
into daily life, particularly in homes, the ability to anticipate and respond
to environmental hazards is crucial for ensuring user safety, trust, and
effective human-robot interaction. Our approach models object-level risk and
context through a semantic graph-based propagation algorithm. Each object is
represented as a node with an associated risk score, and risk propagates
asymmetrically from high-risk to low-risk objects based on spatial proximity
and accident relationship. This enables the robot to infer potential hazards
even when they are not explicitly visible or labeled. Designed for
interpretability and lightweight onboard deployment, our method is validated on
a dataset with human-annotated risk regions, achieving a binary risk detection
accuracy of 75%. The system demonstrates strong alignment with human
perception, particularly in scenes involving sharp or unstable objects. These
results underline the potential of context-aware risk reasoning to enhance
robotic scene understanding and proactive safety behaviors in shared
human-robot spaces. This framework could serve as a foundation for future
systems that make context-driven safety decisions, provide real-time alerts, or
autonomously assist users in avoiding or mitigating hazards within home
environments.

TL;DR: APT* is a novel adaptive sampling-based motion planner that extends FDIT*, using adaptive batch-sizing and elliptical r-nearest neighbors with Coulomb-inspired forces to guide search, yielding faster convergence and lower costs in high dimensions and real tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed batch sizes and obstacle-agnostic sampling in existing planners hamper efficiency, especially in higher dimensions and complex environments.

Method: Proposes Adaptively Prolated Trees (APT*), extending FDIT* with adaptive batch sizing based on the hypervolume of informed sets, and elliptical r-nearest neighbor. Models vertices as electric charges and defines virtual forces via Coulomb's law using neighbor samples; uses non-linear prolate methods to adjust charges, refining the prolate NN selection.

Result: Compared to existing single-query planners, APT* achieves better performance in dimensions 4 through 16 and validated on a real-world robot manipulation task; video available.

Conclusion: Adaptive batch sizing and force-based neighbor selection improve convergence rate and reduce solution costs, demonstrating effective integration of problem-specific feedback into sampling-based planning.

Abstract: Optimal path planning aims to determine a sequence of states from a start to
a goal while accounting for planning objectives. Popular methods often
integrate fixed batch sizes and neglect information on obstacles, which is not
problem-specific. This study introduces Adaptively Prolated Trees (APT*), a
novel sampling-based motion planner that extends based on Force Direction
Informed Trees (FDIT*), integrating adaptive batch-sizing and elliptical
$r$-nearest neighbor modules to dynamically modulate the path searching process
based on environmental feedback. APT* adjusts batch sizes based on the
hypervolume of the informed sets and considers vertices as electric charges
that obey Coulomb's law to define virtual forces via neighbor samples, thereby
refining the prolate nearest neighbor selection. These modules employ
non-linear prolate methods to adaptively adjust the electric charges of
vertices for force definition, thereby improving the convergence rate with
lower solution costs. Comparative analyses show that APT* outperforms existing
single-query sampling-based planners in dimensions from $\mathbb{R}^4$ to
$\mathbb{R}^{16}$, and it was further validated through a real-world robot
manipulation task. A video showcasing our experimental results is available at:

*Tan Jing,Shiting Chen,Yangfan Li,Weisheng Xu,Renjing Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FARM is an end-to-end frame-accelerated augmentation framework with a base controller and residual MoE that enables robust high-dynamic humanoid control, plus a new HDHM benchmark and released code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing physics-based humanoid controllers excel at gentle motions but fail on explosive/high-dynamic actions; a dedicated benchmark and robust methods are needed to bridge this gap.

Method: Introduce Frame-Accelerated Augmentation, a robust base controller, and a residual mixture-of-experts; expose high-velocity changes by widening inter-frame gaps; curate the High-Dynamic Humanoid Motion (HDHM) dataset with 3593 clips; evaluate improvements in tracking.

Result: On HDHM, FARM reduces tracking failure by 42.8% and lowers global mean per-joint position error by 14.6% relative to baseline, while preserving near-perfect accuracy on low-dynamic motions.

Conclusion: FARM establishes a new baseline for high-dynamic humanoid control and introduces the first open benchmark for this challenge; code and dataset will be released.

Abstract: Unified physics-based humanoid controllers are pivotal for robotics and
character animation, yet models that excel on gentle, everyday motions still
stumble on explosive actions, hampering real-world deployment. We bridge this
gap with FARM (Frame-Accelerated Augmentation and Residual Mixture-of-Experts),
an end-to-end framework composed of frame-accelerated augmentation, a robust
base controller, and a residual mixture-of-experts (MoE). Frame-accelerated
augmentation exposes the model to high-velocity pose changes by widening
inter-frame gaps. The base controller reliably tracks everyday low-dynamic
motions, while the residual MoE adaptively allocates additional network
capacity to handle challenging high-dynamic actions, significantly enhancing
tracking accuracy. In the absence of a public benchmark, we curate the
High-Dynamic Humanoid Motion (HDHM) dataset, comprising 3593 physically
plausible clips. On HDHM, FARM reduces the tracking failure rate by 42.8\% and
lowers global mean per-joint position error by 14.6\% relative to the baseline,
while preserving near-perfect accuracy on low-dynamic motions. These results
establish FARM as a new baseline for high-dynamic humanoid control and
introduce the first open benchmark dedicated to this challenge. The code and
dataset will be released at https://github.com/Colin-Jing/FARM.

### [203] [Divide, Discover, Deploy: Factorized Skill Learning with Symmetry and Style Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19953)
*Rafael Cathomen,Mayank Mittal,Marin Vlastelica,Marco Hutter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Modular unsupervised skill discovery with state-factorization and symmetry biases for safe, interpretable, and transferable robotics skills, achieving zero-shot real-world transfer and competitive downstream performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address safety, interpretability, and deployability of unsupervised skill discovery in real-world robotics by introducing factorized, symmetry-biased, and regularized skill representations.

Method: Factorize the state space into factors; assign different skill discovery algorithms to each factor based on intrinsic rewards; apply symmetry-based inductive biases per factor; introduce a style factor and regularization penalties to promote safe and robust behaviors; validate in simulation on a quadruped and demonstrate zero-shot transfer to real hardware.

Result: Discovered structured, human-interpretable skills; style and penalties enhance safety and diversity; zero-shot transfer to real robot demonstrated; downstream use performs on par with oracle policies trained with hand-crafted rewards.

Conclusion: State-factorization combined with symmetry biases yields interpretable, safe, and transferable skills in USD, with practical potential for real-world robotics and competitive downstream performance.

Abstract: Unsupervised Skill Discovery (USD) allows agents to autonomously learn
diverse behaviors without task-specific rewards. While recent USD methods have
shown promise, their application to real-world robotics remains underexplored.
In this paper, we propose a modular USD framework to address the challenges in
the safety, interpretability, and deployability of the learned skills. Our
approach employs user-defined factorization of the state space to learn
disentangled skill representations. It assigns different skill discovery
algorithms to each factor based on the desired intrinsic reward function. To
encourage structured morphology-aware skills, we introduce symmetry-based
inductive biases tailored to individual factors. We also incorporate a style
factor and regularization penalties to promote safe and robust behaviors. We
evaluate our framework in simulation using a quadrupedal robot and demonstrate
zero-shot transfer of the learned skills to real hardware. Our results show
that factorization and symmetry lead to the discovery of structured
human-interpretable behaviors, while the style factor and penalties enhance
safety and diversity. Additionally, we show that the learned skills can be used
for downstream tasks and perform on par with oracle policies trained with
hand-crafted rewards.

*Yiguo Fan,Pengxiang Ding,Shuanghao Bai,Xinyang Tong,Yuyang Zhu,Hongchao Lu,Fengqi Dai,Wei Zhao,Yang Liu,Siteng Huang,Zhaoxin Fan,Badong Chen,Donglin Wang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Long-VLA introduces an end-to-end Vision-Language-Action model tailored for long-horizon robotic tasks, using a phase-aware input masking strategy to segment subtasks into moving and interaction phases. It is architecture-agnostic, data-efficient, and compatible with existing VLA models. It introduces the L-CALVIN benchmark and claims strong improvements over prior methods on both simulated and real-world tasks, establishing a new baseline for long-horizon manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLA models excel at short-horizon tasks but struggle with long-horizon, multi-step manipulation due to skill chaining and subtask dependencies. There is a need for an end-to-end, scalable, data-efficient solution that can handle phase-based subtasks in long-horizon tasks.

Method: Introduce Long-VLA with a novel phase-aware input masking strategy that adaptively segments each subtask into moving and interaction phases, enabling phase-relevant sensory cues to guide subtask execution. The approach remains architecture-agnostic and can be integrated into existing VLA models. Also propose L-CALVIN, a benchmark for evaluating long-horizon manipulation.

Result: Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world tasks show that Long-VLA significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new baseline for long-horizon robotic control.

Conclusion: Long-VLA provides an end-to-end, scalable VLA solution for long-horizon manipulation, with a modular, architecture-agnostic design, and a benchmarking framework (L-CALVIN) to evaluate long-horizon performance; it sets a new performance baseline and demonstrates strong cross-domain applicability.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become a cornerstone in robotic
policy learning, leveraging large-scale multimodal data for robust and scalable
control. However, existing VLA frameworks primarily address short-horizon
tasks, and their effectiveness on long-horizon, multi-step robotic manipulation
remains limited due to challenges in skill chaining and subtask dependencies.
In this work, we introduce Long-VLA, the first end-to-end VLA model
specifically designed for long-horizon robotic tasks. Our approach features a
novel phase-aware input masking strategy that adaptively segments each subtask
into moving and interaction phases, enabling the model to focus on
phase-relevant sensory cues and enhancing subtask compatibility. This unified
strategy preserves the scalability and data efficiency of VLA training, and our
architecture-agnostic module can be seamlessly integrated into existing VLA
models. We further propose the L-CALVIN benchmark to systematically evaluate
long-horizon manipulation. Extensive experiments on both simulated and
real-world tasks demonstrate that Long-VLA significantly outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new baseline for long-horizon robotic
control.

### [205] [Visio-Verbal Teleimpedance Interface: Enabling Semi-Autonomous Control of Physical Interaction via Eye Tracking and Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20037)
*Henk H. A. Jekel,Alejandro Díaz Rosales,Luka Peternel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A visio-verbal teleimpedance interface uses gaze and verbal input processed by a Visual Language Model to generate 3D stiffness matrices for remote manipulation; validated on a haptic setup with a KUKA LBR iiwa, with experiments identifying prompt configurations and demonstrating slide-in-the-groove tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable intuitive, context-aware teleoperation by fusing operator gaze context with natural-language commands to produce precise, multi-axis stiffness control for a remote robot.

Method: Combine eye-tracking (Tobii Pro Glasses 2) to identify gaze context, verbal commands processed by a Visual Language Model using GPT-4o, generate stiffness matrices for different interaction actions; hardware includes Force Dimension Sigma.7 haptic device and Kuka LBR iiwa; experiments include optimizing prompt configuration and validating functionalities on a slide-in-the-groove task.

Result: Demonstrated feasibility of visio-verbal teleimpedance; first experiment identified an optimal prompt configuration; second and third experiments validated different interface functionalities on a slide-in-the-groove task.

Conclusion: The visio-verbal teleimpedance interface can effectively translate gaze and verbal input into 3D stiffness control for teleoperation, with empirical validation and guidance on prompt design; further work could enhance robustness and generalization across tasks.

Abstract: The paper presents a visio-verbal teleimpedance interface for commanding 3D
stiffness ellipsoids to the remote robot with a combination of the operator's
gaze and verbal interaction. The gaze is detected by an eye-tracker, allowing
the system to understand the context in terms of what the operator is currently
looking at in the scene. Along with verbal interaction, a Visual Language Model
(VLM) processes this information, enabling the operator to communicate their
intended action or provide corrections. Based on these inputs, the interface
can then generate appropriate stiffness matrices for different physical
interaction actions. To validate the proposed visio-verbal teleimpedance
interface, we conducted a series of experiments on a setup including a Force
Dimension Sigma.7 haptic device to control the motion of the remote Kuka LBR
iiwa robotic arm. The human operator's gaze is tracked by Tobii Pro Glasses 2,
while human verbal commands are processed by a VLM using GPT-4o. The first
experiment explored the optimal prompt configuration for the interface. The
second and third experiments demonstrated different functionalities of the
interface on a slide-in-the-groove task.

### [206] [HERMES: Human-to-Robot Embodied Learning from Multi-Source Motion Data for Mobile Dexterous Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20085)
*Zhecheng Yuan,Tianming Wei,Langzhe Gu,Pu Hua,Tianhai Liang,Yuanpei Chen,Huazhe Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HERMES is a unified RL-based framework that translates multi-source human hand motions into physically plausible robotic actions for mobile bimanual dexterous manipulation, incorporating depth-based sim2real transfer and a closed-loop PnP localization to integrate navigation with manipulation, achieving robust, generalizable behavior in the real world.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Translating heterogeneous human hand motions to feasible, high-dimensional dexterous robot actions is challenging, especially for multi-fingered hands; there is a sim2real gap; robust autonomous operation in varied, unstructured environments is needed.

Method: A unified reinforcement learning approach that converts heterogeneous human hand motions from multiple sources into physically plausible robotic behaviors; an end-to-end depth image-based sim2real transfer method to improve real-world generalization; augmentation of the navigation foundation model with a closed-loop Perspective-n-Point (PnP) localization to align visual goals and bridge autonomous navigation with dexterous manipulation.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that HERMES achieves generalizable behaviors across diverse, in-the-wild scenarios and successfully performs numerous complex mobile bimanual dexterous manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: HERMES advances human-to-robot learning by addressing motion-to-action translation, sim2real transfer, and integrated navigation for dexterous mobile manipulation, enabling robust and adaptable robotic behavior in real-world environments.

Abstract: Leveraging human motion data to impart robots with versatile manipulation
skills has emerged as a promising paradigm in robotic manipulation.
Nevertheless, translating multi-source human hand motions into feasible robot
behaviors remains challenging, particularly for robots equipped with
multi-fingered dexterous hands characterized by complex, high-dimensional
action spaces. Moreover, existing approaches often struggle to produce policies
capable of adapting to diverse environmental conditions. In this paper, we
introduce HERMES, a human-to-robot learning framework for mobile bimanual
dexterous manipulation. First, HERMES formulates a unified reinforcement
learning approach capable of seamlessly transforming heterogeneous human hand
motions from multiple sources into physically plausible robotic behaviors.
Subsequently, to mitigate the sim2real gap, we devise an end-to-end, depth
image-based sim2real transfer method for improved generalization to real-world
scenarios. Furthermore, to enable autonomous operation in varied and
unstructured environments, we augment the navigation foundation model with a
closed-loop Perspective-n-Point (PnP) localization mechanism, ensuring precise
alignment of visual goals and effectively bridging autonomous navigation and
dexterous manipulation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HERMES
consistently exhibits generalizable behaviors across diverse, in-the-wild
scenarios, successfully performing numerous complex mobile bimanual dexterous
manipulation tasks. Project Page:https:/gemcollector.github.io/HERMES/.

### [207] [Discrete-Guided Diffusion for Scalable and Safe Multi-Robot Motion Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20095)
*Jinhao Liang,Sven Koenig,Ferdinando Fioretto*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Discrete-Guided Diffusion (DGD) integrates discrete MAPF solvers with constrained generative diffusion to solve multi-robot motion planning (MRMP) more efficiently and with higher trajectory quality. It decomposes the problem into convex subproblems, guides diffusion with MAPF solutions, and repairs constraints, achieving state-of-the-art scalability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of coarse MAPF discretization (poor trajectory quality) and high-dimensional continuous optimization (poor scalability) by creating a hybrid framework that leverages the strengths of both approaches.

Method: 1) Decompose MRMP into tractable subproblems with convex configuration spaces. 2) Use discrete MAPF solutions to guide diffusion models, capturing complex spatiotemporal dependencies among robots while constraining the diffusion process. 3) Apply a lightweight constraint repair mechanism to ensure trajectory feasibility.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in large-scale environments, scaling to 100 robots with high planning efficiency and high success rates.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that integrating discrete planning with constrained diffusion can surmount scalability and quality challenges in MRMP, enabling high-quality, feasible trajectories for large teams of robots.

Abstract: Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP) involves generating collision-free
trajectories for multiple robots operating in a shared continuous workspace.
While discrete multi-agent path finding (MAPF) methods are broadly adopted due
to their scalability, their coarse discretization severely limits trajectory
quality. In contrast, continuous optimization-based planners offer
higher-quality paths but suffer from the curse of dimensionality, resulting in
poor scalability with respect to the number of robots. This paper tackles the
limitations of these two approaches by introducing a novel framework that
integrates discrete MAPF solvers with constrained generative diffusion models.
The resulting framework, called Discrete-Guided Diffusion (DGD), has three key
characteristics: (1) it decomposes the original nonconvex MRMP problem into
tractable subproblems with convex configuration spaces, (2) it combines
discrete MAPF solutions with constrained optimization techniques to guide
diffusion models capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies among robots, and
(3) it incorporates a lightweight constraint repair mechanism to ensure
trajectory feasibility. The proposed method sets a new state-of-the-art
performance in large-scale, complex environments, scaling to 100 robots while
achieving planning efficiency and high success rates.
