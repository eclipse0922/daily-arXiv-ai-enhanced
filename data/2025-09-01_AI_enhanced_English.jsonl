To pass this test, human drivers must discern various edge cases\nthat rarely appear in real-world datasets. In this work, we present DriveQA, an\nextensive open-source text and vision-based benchmark that exhaustively covers\ntraffic regulations and scenarios. Through our experiments using DriveQA, we\nshow that (1) state-of-the-art LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) perform well on\nbasic traffic rules but exhibit significant weaknesses in numerical reasoning\nand complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial\nlayouts, (2) fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across multiple\ncategories, particularly in regulatory sign recognition and intersection\ndecision-making, (3) controlled variations in DriveQA-V provide insights into\nmodel sensitivity to environmental factors such as lighting, perspective,\ndistance, and weather conditions, and (4) pretraining on DriveQA enhances\ndownstream driving task performance, leading to improved results on real-world\ndatasets such as nuScenes and BDD, while also demonstrating that models can\ninternalize text and synthetic traffic knowledge to generalize effectively\nacross downstream QA tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "DriveQA provides a comprehensive, open-source text+vision benchmark for driving knowledge, revealing strengths and gaps in LLM/MLLM reasoning about traffic rules and edge cases; fine-tuning and pretraining on DriveQA improve real-world driving QA tasks and downstream transfer.", "motivation": "Bridge the gap between standard driving QA benchmarks and real-world traffic knowledge. Assess how LLMs/MLLMs handle traffic rules, signage, right-of-way, and edge cases, and how data variations affect robustness and transfer to downstream driving tasks.", "method": "Introduce DriveQA: an extensive text+vision benchmark of traffic regulations and scenarios; include DriveQA-V with controlled environmental variations; evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs/MLLMs; study effects of fine-tuning on DriveQA; study effects of pretraining on DriveQA; validate transfer to real-world datasets (nuScenes, BDD).", "result": "LLMs/MLLMs perform well on basic traffic rules but show weaknesses in numerical reasoning, complex right-of-way scenarios, traffic sign variations, and spatial layouts. Fine-tuning on DriveQA improves accuracy across categories, especially regulatory sign recognition and intersection decisions. DriveQA-V reveals sensitivity to lighting, perspective, distance, and weather. Pretraining on DriveQA enhances downstream driving-task performance on real datasets, indicating internalization of text/synthetic traffic knowledge and better generalization to downstream QA tasks.", "conclusion": "DriveQA is effective for training and evaluating driving-specific QA capabilities and generalization. Its synthetic and controlled variations help diagnose robustness, while pretraining on DriveQA translates into practical gains on real-world driving datasets."}}
