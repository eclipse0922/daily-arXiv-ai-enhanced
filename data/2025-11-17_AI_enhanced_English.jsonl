First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.", "AI": {"tldr": "Reframes LLM reasoning as adaptive, cost-aware behavior that allocates effort by input difficulty/uncertainty; formalizes deductive/inductive/abductive reasoning, and a control-augmented policy framework; offers a taxonomy of adaptive methods and outlines open challenges.", "motivation": "Current LLMs use uniform reasoning across tasks, generating long traces for easy cases while failing to reason enough on hard ones.

With the explosive growth of multimodal data in social media scenarios, the need for building an efficient cross-modal fusion framework for emotion recognition is becoming increasingly urgent. To this end, this paper proposes Multimodal Cross-Attention Network and Contrastive Learning (MCN-CL) for multimodal emotion recognition. It uses a triple query mechanism and hard negative mining strategy to remove feature redundancy while preserving important emotional cues, effectively addressing the issues of modal heterogeneity and category imbalance.

Models achieve near-perfect accuracy on these classes, and less than $1\\%$ for all other inputs. This maps to a mathematical property of Collatz sequences: the length of the loops involved in the computation of a long Collatz step can be deduced from the binary representation of its input. The learning pattern reflects the model learning to predict inputs associated with increasing loop lengths. An analysis of failure cases reveals that almost all model errors follow predictable patterns. Hallucination, a common feature of large language models, almost never happens. In over $90\\%$ of failures, the model performs the correct calculation, but wrongly estimates loop lengths. Our observations give a full account of the algorithms learned by the models.

For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint.

For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to \"break\" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude.

Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features.

Code will be available", "summary": "Graph unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for complying with \"the right to be forgotten\" regulations by enabling the removal of sensitive information upon request. However, this solution is not foolproof. The involvement of multiple parties creates new attack surfaces, and residual traces of deleted data can still remain in the unlearned graph neural networks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to recover the supposedly erased samples, thereby undermining the inherent functionality of graph unlearning. In this work, we propose GraphToxin, the first graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a novel curvature matching module to provide a fine-grained guidance for full unlearned graph recovery. We demonstrate that GraphToxin can successfully subvert the regulatory guarantees expected from graph unlearning - it can recover not only a deleted individual's information and personal links but also sensitive content from their connections, thereby posing substantially more detrimental threats. Furthermore, we extend GraphToxin to multiple node removals under both white-box and black-box setting. We highlight the necessity of a worst-case analysis and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the attack performance under both random and worst-case node removals. This provides a more robust and realistic measure of the vulnerability of graph unlearning methods to graph reconstruction attacks.

To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework.

This design fails to incorporate the rich contextual information contained within the broader local neighborhood, potentially hindering its ability to learn complex relationships within the entire set of neighboring nodes. To address this limitation, this work first formalizes the concept of neighborhood-contextualization, rooted in a key property of the attentional variant.

In this work, we analyze the internal structure of LoRAs and find their generative behavior is dominated by a few principal directions in the low-rank subspace, which should remain free from interference during fusion.

This work introduces a transformer-based RL framework that unifies multi-phase trajectory optimization through a single policy architecture, leveraging the transformer's inherent capacity to model extended temporal contexts.

For linear predictors we show that the structural gap is identically zero for any dataset.

Perturbing frequency values can mitigate such bias but overlooks pixel-level details, leading to suboptimal performance. To address these problems, we propose D-GAP (Dataset-agnostic and Gradient-guided augmentation in Amplitude and Pixel spaces), improving OOD robustness by introducing targeted augmentation in both the amplitude space (frequency space) and pixel space.

Existing evaluation methods for adaptiveness typically analyze coverage rate violation or average set size across bins of examples grouped by difficulty. However, these approaches often suffer from imbalanced binning, which can lead to inaccurate estimates of coverage or set size. To address this issue, we propose a binning method that leverages input transformations to sort examples by difficulty, followed by uniform-mass binning.
