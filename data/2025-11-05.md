### [1] [iFlyBot-VLA Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01914)
*Yuan Zhang,Chenyu Xue,Wenjie Xu,Chao Ji,Jiajia wu,Jia Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iFlyBot-VLA is a Vision-Language-Action model with dual action representations (latent actions and discrete action tokens) and a mixed training strategy that fuses video, question-answering, and robot trajectories. It achieves strong results on LIBERO Franka and real-world tasks and plans to release part of its dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To unify language, vision, and action understanding for manipulation tasks by leveraging latent (high-level) and discrete (low-level) action representations, trained on cross-embodiment data and mixed data sources to enhance 3D perception and reasoning.

Method: 1) Train a latent action model on large-scale human/robot manipulation videos. 2) Use a dual-level supervision framework that jointly trains a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and an action expert. 3) Apply a mixed training strategy combining robot trajectories with QA datasets (general and spatial) to improve 3D perception and reasoning. The VLM predicts two action forms: latent actions (high-level) from the latent model and structured discrete action tokens (low-level) derived via frequency-domain transforms of continuous controls. This aligns language, vision, and action representations to enable direct action generation.

Result: On the LIBERO Franka benchmark, the framework demonstrates superior performance compared to baselines; real-world evaluations show competitive success rates across diverse manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed dual-action, multi-source training framework effectively aligns language, vision, and action, enabling a VLM to contribute to action generation; a portion of the self-constructed dataset will be open-sourced to support future research.

Abstract: We introduce iFlyBot-VLA, a large-scale Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model
trained under a novel framework. The main contributions are listed as follows:
(1) a latent action model thoroughly trained on large-scale human and robotic
manipulation videos; (2) a dual-level action representation framework that
jointly supervises both the Vision-Language Model (VLM) and the action expert
during training; (3) a mixed training strategy that combines robot trajectory
data with general QA and spatial QA datasets, effectively enhancing the 3D
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of the VLM backbone. Specifically, the
VLM is trained to predict two complementary forms of actions: latent actions,
derived from our latent action model pretrained on cross-embodiment
manipulation data, which capture implicit high-level intentions; and structured
discrete action tokens, obtained through frequency-domain transformations of
continuous control signals, which encode explicit low-level dynamics. This dual
supervision aligns the representation spaces of language, vision, and action,
enabling the VLM to directly contribute to action generation. Experimental
results on the LIBERO Franka benchmark demonstrate the superiority of our
frame-work, while real-world evaluations further show that iFlyBot-VLA achieves
competitive success rates across diverse and challenging manipulation tasks.
Furthermore, we plan to open-source a portion of our self-constructed dataset
to support future research in the community

### [2] [Challenging DINOv3 Foundation Model under Low Inter-Class Variability: A Case Study on Fetal Brain Ultrasound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01915)
*Edoardo Conti,Riccardo Rosati,Lorenzo Federici,Adriano Mancini,Maria Chiara Fiorentin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Domain-specific pretraining on fetal ultrasound data improves performance of foundation models for distinguishing closely related fetal brain planes (TT, TV, TC) under low inter-class variability; generic foundation models pretrained on natural images underperform.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate how well vision foundation models generalize to anatomically similar fetal brain plane classifications in ultrasound, and whether domain-specific pretraining improves discrimination in low-variability settings.

Method: Constructed a unified multicenter dataset FetalUS-188K (~188k annotated US images) from public data. Trained DINOv3 in a self-supervised manner on fetal US data. Evaluated via linear probing (frozen backbone) and full fine-tuning, with two initializations: (i) pretraining on FetalUS-188K, (ii) initialization from natural-image DINOv3 weights.

Result: Pretraining on fetal US data consistently outperformed natural-image initialization, with up to ~20% absolute improvement in weighted F1-score. Domain-adaptive pretraining preserved subtle echogenic and structural cues critical for distinguishing planes like transventricular (TV).

Conclusion: Generic foundation models struggle under low inter-class variability; domain-specific pretraining is essential to achieve robust, clinically reliable representations in fetal brain ultrasound imaging.

Abstract: Purpose: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of foundation
models in fetal ultrasound (US) imaging under low inter-class variability
conditions. While recent vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have shown
remarkable transferability across medical domains, their ability to
discriminate anatomically similar structures has not been systematically
investigated. We address this gap by focusing on fetal brain standard
planes--transthalamic (TT), transventricular (TV), and transcerebellar
(TC)--which exhibit highly overlapping anatomical features and pose a critical
challenge for reliable biometric assessment.
  Methods: To ensure a fair and reproducible evaluation, all publicly available
fetal ultrasound datasets were curated and aggregated into a unified
multicenter benchmark, FetalUS-188K, comprising more than 188,000 annotated
images from heterogeneous acquisition settings. DINOv3 was pretrained in a
self-supervised manner to learn ultrasound-aware representations. The learned
features were then evaluated through standardized adaptation protocols,
including linear probing with frozen backbone and full fine-tuning, under two
initialization schemes: (i) pretraining on FetalUS-188K and (ii) initialization
from natural-image DINOv3 weights.
  Results: Models pretrained on fetal ultrasound data consistently outperformed
those initialized on natural images, with weighted F1-score improvements of up
to 20 percent. Domain-adaptive pretraining enabled the network to preserve
subtle echogenic and structural cues crucial for distinguishing intermediate
planes such as TV.
  Conclusion: Results demonstrate that generic foundation models fail to
generalize under low inter-class variability, whereas domain-specific
pretraining is essential to achieve robust and clinically reliable
representations in fetal brain ultrasound imaging.

### [3] [Assessing the value of Geo-Foundational Models for Flood Inundation Mapping: Benchmarking models for Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Planetscope for end-users](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01990)
*Saurabh Kaushik,Lalit Maurya,Elizabeth Tellman,ZhiJie Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) offer competitive flood-mapping performance across PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 compared with U‑Net, with Clay V1.5 often leading on several sensors and good few-shot performance; overall GFMs provide small-to-moderate gains at lower computational cost and labeling effort, but are not dramatically superior to traditional U‑Net.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To systematically compare GFMs (Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA) and a Prithvi variant (UViT) against traditional models (TransNorm, U‑Net, Attention U‑Net) across multiple sensors and data-availability scenarios, to inform end-user model selection.

Method: Evaluate multiple GFMs (Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA, UViT) against TransNorm, U‑Net, and Attention U‑Net on PlanetScope, Sentinel‑1, and Sentinel‑2. Use leave-one-region-out cross‑validation across five regions; report mIoU; perform few-shot experiments; compare model size and inference speed across 19 sites.

Result: Clay achieves highest LO-ROI mIoU on PlanetScope (0.72±0.04) and Sentinel‑2 (0.66±0.07) and outperforms Prithvi on these sensors; Prithvi leads on Sentinel‑1 (0.51? actually 0.57 reported overall; LO-ROI for Sentinel-1 Prithvi 0.49). Across sensors, Clay vs Prithvi shows modest advantages; overall Clay shows ~4% higher mIoU than U‑Net across 19 sites; few-shot: Clay 0.64 mIoU with five training images (vs Prithvi 0.24, DOFA 0.35); model size: Clay 26M params vs Prithvi 650M and DOFA 410M; Clay ~3x faster than Prithvi and ~2x faster than DOFA; GFMs deliver small-to-moderate improvements at lower cost/labelling effort.

Conclusion: GFMs are competitive with traditional U‑Net for flood mapping across sensors, with Clay offering robust cross-sensor performance and strong few-shot capability and efficiency. The gains are modest rather than dramatic, suggesting practical deployment should weigh data availability and resource constraints.

Abstract: Geo-Foundational Models (GFMs) enable fast and reliable extraction of
spatiotemporal information from satellite imagery, improving flood inundation
mapping by leveraging location and time embeddings. Despite their potential, it
remains unclear whether GFMs outperform traditional models like U-Net. A
systematic comparison across sensors and data availability scenarios is still
lacking, which is an essential step to guide end-users in model selection. To
address this, we evaluate three GFMs, Prithvi 2.0, Clay V1.5, DOFA, and UViT (a
Prithvi variant), against TransNorm, U-Net, and Attention U-Net using
PlanetScope, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. We observe competitive performance
among all GFMs, with only 2-5% variation between the best and worst models
across sensors. Clay outperforms others on PlanetScope (0.79 mIoU) and
Sentinel-2 (0.70), while Prithvi leads on Sentinel-1 (0.57). In
leave-one-region-out cross-validation across five regions, Clay shows slightly
better performance across all sensors (mIoU: 0.72(0.04), 0.66(0.07),
0.51(0.08)) compared to Prithvi (0.70(0.05), 0.64(0.09), 0.49(0.13)) and DOFA
(0.67(0.07), 0.64(0.04), 0.49(0.09)) for PlanetScope, Sentinel-2, and
Sentinel-1, respectively. Across all 19 sites, leave-one-region-out
cross-validation reveals a 4% improvement by Clay compared to U-Net. Visual
inspection highlights Clay's superior ability to retain fine details. Few-shot
experiments show Clay achieves 0.64 mIoU on PlanetScope with just five training
images, outperforming Prithvi (0.24) and DOFA (0.35). In terms of computational
time, Clay is a better choice due to its smaller model size (26M parameters),
making it ~3x faster than Prithvi (650M) and 2x faster than DOFA (410M).
Contrary to previous findings, our results suggest GFMs offer small to moderate
improvements in flood mapping accuracy at lower computational cost and labeling
effort compared to traditional U-Net.

### [4] [Locally-Supervised Global Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01998)
*Benjamin Walder,Daniel Toader,Robert Nuster,Günther Paltauf,Peter Burgholzer,Gregor Langer,Lukas Krainer,Markus Haltmeier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised image reconstruction framework for upsampling and inpainting with fixed deterministic sampling patterns, leveraging multiple invariances to match fully supervised performance using far less ground truth; validated on PAM data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incomplete measurements in imaging (upsampling/inpainting) typically require full ground truth; fixed sampling patterns yield intrinsically incomplete coverage; existing self-supervised methods relying on random sampling do not apply; need a strategy that leverages distribution invariances to close the gap.

Method: Proposes a learning-based approach that exploits multiple invariances of the image distribution to compensate for deterministic, non-fully-covered measurements, enabling high-quality reconstruction without full ground truth.

Result: On optical-resolution image upsampling in photoacoustic microscopy, achieves competitive or superior results while using substantially less ground truth.

Conclusion: Deterministic sampling limitations can be mitigated by exploiting invariances; the proposed method narrows or matches supervised performance with reduced labeled data and broad applicability to similar inverse problems.

Abstract: We address the problem of image reconstruction from incomplete measurements,
encompassing both upsampling and inpainting, within a learning-based framework.
Conventional supervised approaches require fully sampled ground truth data,
while self-supervised methods allow incomplete ground truth but typically rely
on random sampling that, in expectation, covers the entire image. In contrast,
we consider fixed, deterministic sampling patterns with inherently incomplete
coverage, even in expectation. To overcome this limitation, we exploit multiple
invariances of the underlying image distribution, which theoretically allows us
to achieve the same reconstruction performance as fully supervised approaches.
We validate our method on optical-resolution image upsampling in photoacoustic
microscopy (PAM), demonstrating competitive or superior results while requiring
substantially less ground truth data.

### [5] [Towards Selection of Large Multimodal Models as Engines for Burned-in Protected Health Information Detection in Medical Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02014)
*Tuan Truong,Guillermo Jimenez Perez,Pedro Osorio,Matthias Lenga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LMMs improve OCR quality for PHI detection in medical images but do not consistently boost overall PHI detection accuracy; gains are strongest on complex imprint patterns, and readable text with strong LMM analysis yields similar results across pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether contemporary large multimodal models can outperform traditional OCR+NER pipelines for PHI detection in medical images and provide deployment guidance.

Method: Benchmark three LMMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Qwen 2.5 7B) across two pipeline configurations: (1) text-analysis-only, (2) OCR+semantic analysis; evaluate OCR metrics (WER, CER) and PHI detection accuracy; analyze performance on complex imprint patterns and readable text; propose deployment recommendations.

Result: LMMs show superior OCR metrics (WER ~0.03–0.05, CER ~0.02–0.03) compared with EasyOCR, but this does not consistently translate into higher PHI detection accuracy; strongest gains occur on test cases with complex imprint patterns; when text regions are well readable and strong LMMs are used for text analysis, different pipeline configurations yield similar PHI detection results.

Conclusion: While LMMs can enhance OCR quality, PHI detection performance depends more on text readability and pipeline design; select LMMs and deployment strategies based on operational constraints and adopt scalable, modular infrastructure; use scenario-driven LMM choices to optimize PHI detection in medical imaging.

Abstract: The detection of Protected Health Information (PHI) in medical imaging is
critical for safeguarding patient privacy and ensuring compliance with
regulatory frameworks. Traditional detection methodologies predominantly
utilize Optical Character Recognition (OCR) models in conjunction with named
entity recognition. However, recent advancements in Large Multimodal Model
(LMM) present new opportunities for enhanced text extraction and semantic
analysis. In this study, we systematically benchmark three prominent closed and
open-sourced LMMs, namely GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5 7B, utilizing
two distinct pipeline configurations: one dedicated to text analysis alone and
another integrating both OCR and semantic analysis. Our results indicate that
LMM exhibits superior OCR efficacy (WER: 0.03-0.05, CER: 0.02-0.03) compared to
conventional models like EasyOCR. However, this improvement in OCR performance
does not consistently correlate with enhanced overall PHI detection accuracy.
The strongest performance gains are observed on test cases with complex imprint
patterns. In scenarios where text regions are well readable with sufficient
contrast, and strong LMMs are employed for text analysis after OCR, different
pipeline configurations yield similar results. Furthermore, we provide
empirically grounded recommendations for LMM selection tailored to specific
operational constraints and propose a deployment strategy that leverages
scalable and modular infrastructure.

### [6] [StrengthSense: A Dataset of IMU Signals Capturing Everyday Strength-Demanding Activities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02027)
*Zeyu Yang,Clayton Souza Leite,Yu Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StrengthSense is an open IMU dataset with 29 subjects, 11 strength-demanding activities and 2 non-strength activities, using 10 IMUs on limbs and torso, video-annotated. It includes data collection, preprocessing, and validation, with a comparison between IMU- and video-extracted joint angles, enabling development of HAR, fitness, and health monitoring applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in publicly available datasets that capture strength-demanding activities, which hampers development of accurate activity recognition and monitoring tools for muscular strength, endurance, and power.

Method: Data were collected from 29 healthy subjects using 10 IMUs placed on limbs and torso, annotated via video. The dataset covers 11 strength-demanding activities (e.g., sit-to-stand, stair climbing, mopping) plus 2 non-strength tasks. The work details data collection, preprocessing, and technical validation, including comparing IMU-estimated joint angles to angles extracted from video.

Result: An open StrengthSense dataset is provided along with validation showing reasonable agreement between IMU-derived and video-derived joint angles, establishing reliability of the sensor data for activity analysis.

Conclusion: StrengthSense fills a critical gap by providing a publicly available resource for studying strength-demanding activities, enabling improved human activity recognition, fitness/health monitoring, and related research and applications.

Abstract: Tracking strength-demanding activities with wearable sensors like IMUs is
crucial for monitoring muscular strength, endurance, and power. However, there
is a lack of comprehensive datasets capturing these activities. To fill this
gap, we introduce \textit{StrengthSense}, an open dataset that encompasses IMU
signals capturing 11 strength-demanding activities, such as sit-to-stand,
climbing stairs, and mopping. For comparative purposes, the dataset also
includes 2 non-strength demanding activities. The dataset was collected from 29
healthy subjects utilizing 10 IMUs placed on limbs and the torso, and was
annotated using video recordings as references. This paper provides a
comprehensive overview of the data collection, pre-processing, and technical
validation. We conducted a comparative analysis between the joint angles
estimated by IMUs and those directly extracted from video to verify the
accuracy and reliability of the sensor data. Researchers and developers can
utilize \textit{StrengthSense} to advance the development of human activity
recognition algorithms, create fitness and health monitoring applications, and
more.

### [7] [Text-VQA Aug: Pipelined Harnessing of Large Multimodal Models for Automated Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02046)
*Soham Joshi,Shwet Kamal Mishra,Viswanath Gopalakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an end-to-end automatic pipeline to synthesize faithful QA pairs for text-VQA from scene-text in images, leveraging OCR, ROI detection, captioning, and question generation; scales to ~72k QA pairs from ~44k images.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce manual annotation effort for text-VQA datasets and exploit advances in OCR and foundation-models to create large, faithful synthetic QA data from scene text.

Method: An integrated pipeline combining text spotting (OCR), region-of-interest detection, caption generation, and question generation, with automated validation to produce QA pairs from images containing scene text; designed to scale with available scene-text data and claimed as the first such automatic synthesis and validation pipeline.

Result: Generated approximately 72,000 QA pairs derived from about 44,000 images, demonstrating scalability and end-to-end automation for text-VQA data creation.

Conclusion: The proposed pipeline enables scalable creation of large text-VQA datasets using automated synthesis and validation, potentially accelerating training of vision-language models on text-rich scenes; future work may address quality assurance and generalization across domains.

Abstract: Creation of large-scale databases for Visual Question Answering tasks
pertaining to the text data in a scene (text-VQA) involves skilful human
annotation, which is tedious and challenging. With the advent of foundation
models that handle vision and language modalities, and with the maturity of OCR
systems, it is the need of the hour to establish an end-to-end pipeline that
can synthesize Question-Answer (QA) pairs based on scene-text from a given
image. We propose a pipeline for automated synthesis for text-VQA dataset that
can produce faithful QA pairs, and which scales up with the availability of
scene text data. Our proposed method harnesses the capabilities of multiple
models and algorithms involving OCR detection and recognition (text spotting),
region of interest (ROI) detection, caption generation, and question
generation. These components are streamlined into a cohesive pipeline to
automate the synthesis and validation of QA pairs. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first pipeline proposed to automatically synthesize and
validate a large-scale text-VQA dataset comprising around 72K QA pairs based on
around 44K images.

### [8] [Markerless Augmented Reality Registration for Surgical Guidance: A Multi-Anatomy Clinical Accuracy Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02086)
*Yue Yang,Fabian Necker,Christoph Leuze,Michelle Chen,Andrey Finegersh,Jake Lee,Vasu Divi,Bruce Daniel,Brian Hargreaves,Jie Ying Wu,Fred M Baik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Depth-only, markerless AR registration on HoloLens 2 aligns AHAT depth to CT skin meshes with depth-bias correction and minimal user-initiation, achieving ~3-4 mm median error across small/low-curvature targets in live surgeries without fiducials.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable accurate, fiducial-free AR guidance for small or low-curvature anatomies in real-time surgical settings, improving safety and readiness for clinical deployment.

Method: AHAT depth is registered to CT-derived skin meshes with depth-bias correction, a brief human-in-the-loop initialization, and subsequent global and local registration. Validation included preclinical skin-to-bone distance errors on leg/foot models and seven intraoperative trials (feet, ear, leg) during fibula free-flap harvest and mandibular reconstruction, with 500+ data points per trial.

Result: Preclinical: leg median |Δd| 0.78 mm; RMSE 0.97 mm; feet |Δd| 0.80 mm; RMSE 1.20 mm. Clinically, per-point median error 3.9 mm; medians by anatomy: feet 3.2 mm, ear 4.3 mm, lower leg 5.3 mm. 5 mm coverage: feet 92-95%, ear 84-90%, lower leg 72-86%. Feet vs lower leg showed significant difference (Delta median ~1.1 mm; p<0.001).

Conclusion: Depth-only, markerless AR on head-mounted displays can attain ~3-4 mm median error in live surgeries without fiducials for small/low-curvature targets, approaching clinical thresholds for moderate-risk tasks; human-guided initialization plus global-to-local registration enhances accuracy and clinical readiness.

Abstract: Purpose: In this paper, we develop and clinically evaluate a depth-only,
markerless augmented reality (AR) registration pipeline on a head-mounted
display, and assess accuracy across small or low-curvature anatomies in
real-life operative settings. Methods: On HoloLens 2, we align Articulated HAnd
Tracking (AHAT) depth to Computed Tomography (CT)-derived skin meshes via (i)
depth-bias correction, (ii) brief human-in-the-loop initialization, (iii)
global and local registration. We validated the surface-tracing error metric by
comparing "skin-to-bone" relative distances to CT ground truth on leg and foot
models, using an AR-tracked tool. We then performed seven intraoperative target
trials (feet x2, ear x3, leg x2) during the initial stage of fibula free-flap
harvest and mandibular reconstruction surgery, and collected 500+ data per
trial. Results: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement between AR-traced
and CT distances (leg: median |Delta d| 0.78 mm, RMSE 0.97 mm; feet: 0.80 mm,
1.20 mm). Clinically, per-point error had a median of 3.9 mm. Median errors by
anatomy were 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), and 5.3 mm (lower leg), with 5 mm
coverage 92-95%, 84-90%, and 72-86%, respectively. Feet vs. lower leg differed
significantly (Delta median ~1.1 mm; p < 0.001). Conclusion: A depth-only,
markerless AR pipeline on HMDs achieved ~3-4 mm median error across feet, ear,
and lower leg in live surgical settings without fiducials, approaching typical
clinical error thresholds for moderate-risk tasks. Human-guided initialization
plus global-to-local registration enabled accurate alignment on small or
low-curvature targets, improving the clinical readiness of markerless AR
guidance.

### [9] [From Instance Segmentation to 3D Growth Trajectory Reconstruction in Planktonic Foraminifera](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02142)
*Huahua Lin,Xiaohao Cai,Mark Nixon,James M. Mulqueeney,Thomas H. G. Ezard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated, end-to-end 3D growth trajectory reconstruction of planktonic foraminifera using instance segmentation and a chamber-ordering algorithm, reducing manual segmentation while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual chamber segmentation is time-consuming, subjective, and limits large-scale ecological studies; need an automated, reproducible pipeline to study chamber growth under environmental change.

Method: An end-to-end pipeline combining instance segmentation (various models optimized for chamber features) with a chamber-ordering algorithm to reconstruct 3D growth trajectories from high-resolution CT scans; evaluate multiple segmentation methods and their effect on growth-order accuracy.

Result: Significant reduction in manual effort with biologically meaningful accuracy; under-segmentation in small chambers but robust chamber ordering enabling consistent trajectories even with partial segmentation; first fully automated, reproducible pipeline for digital foraminiferal growth analysis.

Conclusion: Provides foundation for large-scale, data-driven ecological studies and enables scalable analysis of developmental trajectories in foraminifera; demonstrates robustness of ordering algorithm amidst segmentation noise.

Abstract: Planktonic foraminifera, marine protists characterized by their intricate
chambered shells, serve as valuable indicators of past and present
environmental conditions. Understanding their chamber growth trajectory
provides crucial insights into organismal development and ecological adaptation
under changing environments. However, automated tracing of chamber growth from
imaging data remains largely unexplored, with existing approaches relying
heavily on manual segmentation of each chamber, which is time-consuming and
subjective. In this study, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that integrates
instance segmentation, a computer vision technique not extensively explored in
foraminifera, with a dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to automatically
reconstruct three-dimensional growth trajectories from high-resolution computed
tomography scans. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate multiple
instance segmentation methods, each optimized for distinct spatial features of
the chambers, and examine their downstream influence on growth-order
reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on expert-annotated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed pipeline substantially reduces manual effort
while maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Although segmentation
models exhibit under-segmentation in smaller chambers due to reduced voxel
fidelity and subtle inter-chamber connectivity, the chamber-ordering algorithm
remains robust, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental
trajectories even under partial segmentation. This work provides the first
fully automated and reproducible pipeline for digital foraminiferal growth
analysis, establishing a foundation for large-scale, data-driven ecological
studies.

### [10] [Fast Measuring Pavement Crack Width by Cascading Principal Component Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02144)
*Zhicheng Wang,Junbiao Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cascaded PCA/RPCA-based framework for efficient crack width extraction from pavement images, combining binary crack segmentation, principal orientation detection, and main propagation axis extraction to handle irregular crack geometries; it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in speed and accuracy on three public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Crack width quantification is hampered by non-uniform crack boundaries and the need to measure width from arbitrary pixel locations quickly for comprehensive pavement assessment. Existing approaches struggle with morphology and speed.

Method: A three-stage cascaded pipeline: (1) crack segmentation using standard detectors to obtain a binary crack representation; (2) principal component analysis (PCA) to determine the dominant orientation axis for quasi-parallel cracks; (3) robust PCA (RPCA) to extract the Main Propagation Axis (MPA) accommodating irregular crack geometries, forming a cascaded framework.

Result: Comprehensive experiments on three public datasets show the proposed method achieves superior computational efficiency and measurement accuracy compared to current state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: The PCA/RPCA cascaded framework effectively handles complex crack morphology and rapid, arbitrary-pixel width measurements, offering improved performance and potential for improved pavement condition assessment.

Abstract: Accurate quantification of pavement crack width plays a pivotal role in
assessing structural integrity and guiding maintenance interventions. However,
achieving precise crack width measurements presents significant challenges due
to: (1) the complex, non-uniform morphology of crack boundaries, which limits
the efficacy of conventional approaches, and (2) the demand for rapid
measurement capabilities from arbitrary pixel locations to facilitate
comprehensive pavement condition evaluation. To overcome these limitations,
this study introduces a cascaded framework integrating Principal Component
Analysis (PCA) and Robust PCA (RPCA) for efficient crack width extraction from
digital images. The proposed methodology comprises three sequential stages: (1)
initial crack segmentation using established detection algorithms to generate a
binary representation, (2) determination of the primary orientation axis for
quasi-parallel cracks through PCA, and (3) extraction of the Main Propagation
Axis (MPA) for irregular crack geometries using RPCA. Comprehensive evaluations
were conducted across three publicly available datasets, demonstrating that the
proposed approach achieves superior performance in both computational
efficiency and measurement accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art
techniques.

### [11] [Autobiasing Event Cameras for Flickering Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02180)
*Mehdi Sefidgar Dilmaghani,Waseem Shariff,Cian Ryan,Joe Lemley,Peter Corcoran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An autonomous bias-tuning approach for event cameras mitigates flicker across -25 Hz to 500 Hz by using a CNN to adjust biases in real-time, eliminating extra flicker-filter hardware/software. It improves face-detection metrics and reduces a gradient-based flicker proxy, in both well-lit and low-light conditions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flicker from rapid light changes degrades event-camera performance; need lightweight, hardware-free solution that adapts in real-time.

Method: A CNN analyzes spatial flicker signatures from event streams and tunes camera biases to minimize flicker. Works across a wide frequency range without additional hardware or software filtering. Evaluated with a face-detection pipeline (YOLO) under varying illumination; gradient-based flicker proxy used as metric.

Result: Significant improvements: higher YOLO confidence and larger fraction of frames with detected faces. Gradient proxy decreased by 38.2% in well-lit and 53.6% in low-light.

Conclusion: Autobiasing demonstrates strong potential to improve event-camera reliability in diverse lighting without extra hardware; future work could expand to other tasks, frequencies, or sensor types.

Abstract: Understanding and mitigating flicker effects caused by rapid variations in
light intensity is critical for enhancing the performance of event cameras in
diverse environments. This paper introduces an innovative autonomous mechanism
for tuning the biases of event cameras, effectively addressing flicker across a
wide frequency range -25 Hz to 500 Hz. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
additional hardware or software for flicker filtering, our approach leverages
the event cameras inherent bias settings. Utilizing a simple Convolutional
Neural Networks -CNNs, the system identifies instances of flicker in a spatial
space and dynamically adjusts specific biases to minimize its impact. The
efficacy of this autobiasing system was robustly tested using a face detector
framework under both well-lit and low-light conditions, as well as across
various frequencies. The results demonstrated significant improvements:
enhanced YOLO confidence metrics for face detection, and an increased
percentage of frames capturing detected faces. Moreover, the average gradient,
which serves as an indicator of flicker presence through edge detection,
decreased by 38.2 percent in well-lit conditions and by 53.6 percent in
low-light conditions. These findings underscore the potential of our approach
to significantly improve the functionality of event cameras in a range of

*Jinhwan Seo,Yoonki Cho,Junhyug Noh,Sung-eui Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A three-stage GVQA framework for robust video reasoning, grounding, and tracking, using a trigger moment derived from the CORTEX prompt to anchor grounding and achieve state-of-the-art HOTA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable reliable multimodal reasoning, precise visual grounding, and temporal tracking in Grounded Video QA (GVQA) for the ICCV 2025 Perception Test Challenge.

Method: Decompose GVQA into three stages: (1) Video Reasoning & QA, (2) Spatio-temporal Grounding, and (3) Tracking. Introduce a trigger moment from the CORTEX prompt that selects the single most visible frame of a target object as a robust grounding/tracking anchor.

Result: Achieves a HOTA score of 0.4968, significantly higher than the previous year's 0.2704 on the GVQA task.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates improved grounding and tracking in GVQA through a trigger-moment anchor, indicating effective integration of prompt-based anchors into video-grounded QA pipelines.

Abstract: In this technical report, we introduce a framework to address Grounded Video
Question Answering (GVQA) task for the ICCV 2025 Perception Test Challenge. The
GVQA task demands robust multimodal models capable of complex reasoning over
video content, grounding the resulting answers visually, and tracking the
referenced objects temporally. To achieve this capability, our proposed
approach decomposes the GVQA task into a three-stage pipeline: (1) Video
Reasoning \& QA, (2) Spatio-temporal Grounding and (3) Tracking. Our key
contribution is the introduction of a trigger moment, derived from our proposed
CORTEX prompt, which pinpoints the single most visible frame of a target object
to serve as a robust anchor for grounding and tracking. To this end, we achieve
the HOTA score of 0.4968, which marks a significant improvement over the
previous year's winning score of 0.2704 on GVQA task.

*Jiawen Liu,Yuanbo Zeng,Jiaming Liang,Yizhen Yang,Yiheng Zhang,Enhui Cai,Xiaoqi Sheng,Hongmin Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MM-UNet introduces Morph Mamba Convolution layers and Reverse Selective State Guidance modules to improve retinal vessel segmentation, achieving modest but meaningful gains on DRIVE and STARE datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retinal vasculature consists of extremely thin, highly branched structures with global morphology varying across images, making segmentation challenging; current methods struggle with precision, robustness, and decoding efficiency.

Method: Proposes MM-UNet with Morph Mamba Convolutions replacing pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topology perception via morph, state-aware feature sampling. Adds Reverse Selective State Guidance modules that combine reverse guidance theory with state-space modeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency.

Result: Empirical evaluation on DRIVE and STARE datasets shows F1-score gains of 1.64% and 1.25% respectively, with superior segmentation performance. Code is publicly available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: MM-UNet effectively improves retinal vessel segmentation by addressing the challenges of thin, branching vasculature, demonstrating advancement over existing approaches.

Abstract: Accurate detection of retinal vessels plays a critical role in reflecting a
wide range of health status indicators in the clinical diagnosis of ocular
diseases. Recently, advances in deep learning have led to a surge in retinal
vessel segmentation methods, which have significantly contributed to the
quantitative analysis of vascular morphology. However, retinal vasculature
differs significantly from conventional segmentation targets in that it
consists of extremely thin and branching structures, whose global morphology
varies greatly across images. These characteristics continue to pose challenges
to segmentation precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose
MM-UNet, a novel architecture tailored for efficient retinal vessel
segmentation. The model incorporates Morph Mamba Convolution layers, which
replace pointwise convolutions to enhance branching topological perception
through morph, state-aware feature sampling. Additionally, Reverse Selective
State Guidance modules integrate reverse guidance theory with state-space
modeling to improve geometric boundary awareness and decoding efficiency.
Extensive experiments conducted on two public retinal vessel segmentation
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in
segmentation accuracy. Compared to the existing approaches, MM-UNet achieves
F1-score gains of 1.64 $\%$ on DRIVE and 1.25 $\%$ on STARE, demonstrating its
effectiveness and advancement. The project code is public via

### [14] [Language-Enhanced Generative Modeling for PET Synthesis from MRI and Blood Biomarkers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02206)
*Zhengjie Zhang,Xiaoxie Mao,Qihao Guo,Shaoting Zhang,Qi Huang,Mu Zhou,Fang Xie,Mianxin Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A language-enhanced generative model synthesizes Abeta-PET from MRI and BBMs, producing realistic PET that supports automatic AD diagnosis with competitive accuracy and AUC, enabling a lower-cost diagnostic pathway.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alzheimer's disease diagnosis currently hinges on Abeta-PET, which is expensive and not widely accessible. Predicting Abeta spatial patterns from blood-based biomarkers and MRI could reduce cost and increase accessibility.

Method: Dataset of 566 participants with Abeta-PET, T1-weighted MRI, and BBMs. A language-enhanced generative model driven by a large language model (LLM) and multimodal information fusion was developed to synthesize PET images. The synthesis was evaluated for image quality (SSIM 0.920±0.003) and regional pattern fidelity (Pearson's r 0.955±0.007). A fully automatic diagnostic pipeline was built using synthetic PET, with comparisons to real PET and with AAUC/accuracy metrics. Ablation analyses examined the impact of LLM integration and prompts.

Result: Synthetic PET images closely resemble real PET in structural detail and regional patterns. Diagnostic accuracy using synthetic PET is 0.80, and the synthetic-PET based AUC is 0.78 (vs T1 AUC 0.68 and BBM AUC 0.73). Combining synthetic PET with BBMs yields AUC 0.79. Real PET-based diagnoses show high agreement with synthetic-PET diagnoses (accuracy 0.80).

Conclusion: A language-enhanced generative model can synthesize realistic Abeta-PET images from MRI and BBMs, enabling Abeta spatial-pattern assessment and improving the AD diagnostic workflow by leveraging non-PET data.

Abstract: Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis heavily relies on amyloid-beta
positron emission tomography (Abeta-PET), which is limited by high cost and
limited accessibility. This study explores whether Abeta-PET spatial patterns
can be predicted from blood-based biomarkers (BBMs) and MRI scans. Methods: We
collected Abeta-PET images, T1-weighted MRI scans, and BBMs from 566
participants. A language-enhanced generative model, driven by a large language
model (LLM) and multimodal information fusion, was developed to synthesize PET
images. Synthesized images were evaluated for image quality, diagnostic
consistency, and clinical applicability within a fully automated diagnostic
pipeline. Findings: The synthetic PET images closely resemble real PET scans in
both structural details (SSIM = 0.920 +/- 0.003) and regional patterns
(Pearson's r = 0.955 +/- 0.007). Diagnostic outcomes using synthetic PET show
high agreement with real PET-based diagnoses (accuracy = 0.80). Using synthetic
PET, we developed a fully automatic AD diagnostic pipeline integrating PET
synthesis and classification. The synthetic PET-based model (AUC = 0.78)
outperforms T1-based (AUC = 0.68) and BBM-based (AUC = 0.73) models, while
combining synthetic PET and BBMs further improved performance (AUC = 0.79).
Ablation analysis supports the advantages of LLM integration and prompt
engineering. Interpretation: Our language-enhanced generative model synthesizes
realistic PET images, enhancing the utility of MRI and BBMs for Abeta spatial
pattern assessment and improving the diagnostic workflow for Alzheimer's
disease.

### [15] [Object-Centric 3D Gaussian Splatting for Strawberry Plant Reconstruction and Phenotyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02207)
*Jiajia Li,Keyi Zhu,Qianwen Zhang,Dong Chen,Qi Sun,Zhaojian Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An object-centric 3D reconstruction pipeline for strawberries that uses SAM-2 segmentation and alpha-background masking to produce clean, background-free plant models from multi-view data, enabling automatic trait estimation (height and canopy width) via DBSCAN clustering and PCA, with improved accuracy and efficiency over baseline methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Strawberry phenotyping is economically important yet traditional methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often destructive. While neural rendering methods like NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting can reconstruct 3D plant structures, they often reconstruct the entire scene, including background, which adds noise and computational cost. There is a need for a background-free, efficient, and scalable reconstruction pipeline to enable reliable trait analysis.

Method: 1) Segment the strawberry plant using Segment Anything Model v2 (SAM-2) to obtain plant masks. 2) Apply alpha channel background masking to create a background-free input for 3D reconstruction. 3) Perform 3D reconstruction with neural rendering techniques (NeRF/3DGS) on the masked plant data. 4) Estimate plant traits by clustering reconstructed geometry with DBSCAN and reducing dimensionality with PCA to derive plant height and canopy width.

Result: The background-free, object-centric reconstruction yields more accurate geometric representations and reduces computational time compared with background-inclusive pipelines. The pipeline enables automatic extraction of plant traits (height, canopy width) with robust performance, demonstrating improved accuracy and efficiency over conventional approaches.

Conclusion: An object-centric reconstruction framework that integrates SAM-2 segmentation and alpha masking provides a scalable, non-destructive solution for strawberry phenotyping, delivering cleaner geometry and reliable trait estimates suitable for high-throughput applications.

Abstract: Strawberries are among the most economically significant fruits in the United
States, generating over $2 billion in annual farm-gate sales and accounting for
approximately 13% of the total fruit production value. Plant phenotyping plays
a vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits
such as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional
plant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often
destructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance
Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful
frameworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of
multi-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable
non-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures. Despite their
promise, most current applications of 3DGS in agricultural domains reconstruct
the entire scene, including background elements, which introduces noise,
increases computational costs, and complicates downstream trait analysis. To
address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric 3D reconstruction
framework incorporating a preprocessing pipeline that leverages the Segment
Anything Model v2 (SAM-2) and alpha channel background masking to achieve clean
strawberry plant reconstructions. This approach produces more accurate
geometric representations while substantially reducing computational time. With
a background-free reconstruction, our algorithm can automatically estimate
important plant traits, such as plant height and canopy width, using DBSCAN
clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experimental results show
that our method outperforms conventional pipelines in both accuracy and
efficiency, offering a scalable and non-destructive solution for strawberry
plant phenotyping.

### [16] [Estimation of Segmental Longitudinal Strain in Transesophageal Echocardiography by Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02210)
*Anders Austlid Taskén,Thierry Judge,Erik Andreas Rye Berg,Jinyang Yu,Bjørnar Grenne,Frank Lindseth,Svend Aakhus,Pierre-Marc Jodoin,Nicolas Duchateau,Olivier Bernard,Gabriel Kiss*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Automated autoStrain pipeline for segmental longitudinal strain (SLS) estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning for motion estimation; compares two DL methods (TeeFlow: dense RAFT optical flow; TeeTracker: sparse CoTracker trajectories) trained/evaluated on synthetic synTEE data and validated clinically; TeeTracker yielded higher accuracy (0.65 mm mean motion error) and clinical agreement (mean difference 1.09%, with -8.90% to 11.09% limits); simulated ischemia improved deformation quantification; supports AI-driven analysis to enhance cardiac assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the reliance on manual, expert-driven strain estimation in LV SLS, reduce workload for monitoring, and tackle scarcity of ground-truth motion data by leveraging realistic synthetic data to develop and evaluate DL-based motion estimation in TEE.

Method: Two DL approaches for motion estimation are evaluated: TeeFlow (RAFT-based dense optical flow) and TeeTracker (CoTracker-based sparse trajectory tracking). A realistic synthetic TEE dataset (synTEE) of 80 patients with ground-truth motion is used for training/evaluation. Clinical validation is performed on 16 patients. Outcomes assessed include mean distance error in motion, and SLS estimates compared to clinical references (including Bland–Altman like analysis). Simulated ischemia is incorporated in synTEE to test robustness.

Result: TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in motion accuracy on synTEE, achieving a mean distance error of 0.65 mm. Clinically, autoStrain SLS estimation aligns with references, with a mean difference of 1.09% and limits of agreement −8.90% to 11.09%. Incorporating simulated ischemia improves model accuracy for abnormal deformation quantification.

Conclusion: AI-driven motion estimation integrated with TEE (autoStrain) can significantly enhance the precision and efficiency of LV function assessment, supporting potential clinical deployment and better monitoring of ischemic changes.

Abstract: Segmental longitudinal strain (SLS) of the left ventricle (LV) is an
important prognostic indicator for evaluating regional LV dysfunction, in
particular for diagnosing and managing myocardial ischemia. Current techniques
for strain estimation require significant manual intervention and expertise,
limiting their efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring
purposes. This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for
SLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning
(DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL
approaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense
frame-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point
trajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions.
  As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly
accessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to
generate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with
ground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our
evaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a
mean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset.
  Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation
with our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean
difference (95\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%).
Incorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of
the models in quantifying abnormal deformation. Our findings indicate that
integrating AI-driven motion estimation with TEE can significantly enhance the
precision and efficiency of cardiac function assessment in clinical settings.

### [17] [Can Foundation Models Revolutionize Mobile AR Sparse Sensing?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02215)
*Yiqin Zhao,Tian Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foundation models can significantly improve mobile sparse sensing by enhancing geometry-aware image warping and 3D reconstruction, addressing efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, though challenges remain for integration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mobile sensing faces tight computation and power constraints; sparse sensing reduces data but introduces uncertainty. Foundation models may better reuse cross-frame information and improve reconstruction.

Method: Evaluate FM-based sparse sensing on real-world mobile AR data, focusing on geometry-aware image warping and 3D scene reconstruction to assess accuracy and scalability.

Result: FM-based sparse sensing yields significant gains in geometry-aware image warping and achieves leading performance in 3D scene reconstruction; demonstrates scalability.

Conclusion: Foundation models show promise for mobile sparse sensing but reveal open challenges and directions for integrating FM into such systems.

Abstract: Mobile sensing systems have long faced a fundamental trade-off between
sensing quality and efficiency due to constraints in computation, power, and
other limitations. Sparse sensing, which aims to acquire and process only a
subset of sensor data, has been a key strategy for maintaining performance
under such constraints. However, existing sparse sensing methods often suffer
from reduced accuracy, as missing information across space and time introduces
uncertainty into many sensing systems. In this work, we investigate whether
foundation models can change the landscape of mobile sparse sensing. Using
real-world mobile AR data, our evaluations demonstrate that foundation models
offer significant improvements in geometry-aware image warping, a central
technique for enabling accurate reuse of cross-frame information. Furthermore,
our study demonstrates the scalability of foundation model-based sparse sensing
and shows its leading performance in 3D scene reconstruction. Collectively, our
study reveals critical aspects of the promises and the open challenges of
integrating foundation models into mobile sparse sensing systems.

### [18] [Collaborative Attention and Consistent-Guided Fusion of MRI and PET for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02228)
*Delin Ma,Menghui Zhou,Jun Qi,Yun Yang,Po Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multimodal MRI-PET fusion framework for Alzheimer's diagnosis that uses Collaborative Attention and Consistent-Guided Fusion, includes a learnable parameter representation (LPR) to cope with missing modalities, and separate encoders to capture both shared and modality-specific information, plus a consistency mechanism to align latent distributions; evaluated on ADNI with superior results versus other fusion methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in existing cross-modal fusion approaches that ignore modality-specific information and suffer from distributional biases/noise across MRI and PET modalities, hindering robust AD diagnosis.

Method: Propose a Collaborative Attention and Consistent-Guided Fusion framework. Introduce a learnable parameter representation (LPR) block to compensate for missing modality information, followed by a shared encoder and modality-independent (specific) encoders to preserve both shared and modality-specific representations. Apply a consistency-guided mechanism to explicitly align latent distributions across modalities.

Result: On the ADNI dataset, the proposed method achieves superior diagnostic performance compared with existing fusion strategies for MRI-PET fusion-based AD diagnosis.

Conclusion: Incorporating modality-specific features, missing-modality compensation, and distribution alignment via collaborative attention and a consistency-guided fusion framework improves multimodal MRI-PET AD diagnosis performance over existing fusion approaches.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia, and its
early diagnosis is essential for slowing disease progression. Recent studies on
multimodal neuroimaging fusion using MRI and PET have achieved promising
results by integrating multi-scale complementary features. However, most
existing approaches primarily emphasize cross-modal complementarity while
overlooking the diagnostic importance of modality-specific features. In
addition, the inherent distributional differences between modalities often lead
to biased and noisy representations, degrading classification performance. To
address these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Attention and
Consistent-Guided Fusion framework for MRI and PET based AD diagnosis. The
proposed model introduces a learnable parameter representation (LPR) block to
compensate for missing modality information, followed by a shared encoder and
modality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific
representations. Furthermore, a consistency-guided mechanism is employed to
explicitly align the latent distributions across modalities. Experimental
results on the ADNI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves superior
diagnostic performance compared with existing fusion strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A latent feature alignment approach for monocular depth estimation in endoscopic scenes that reduces the domain gap between synthetic-to-real translations and real frames by learning domain-invariant features, improving absolute and relative depth across backbones; code available at GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Obtaining metric (absolute) depth in real endoscopic images is hard, hindering supervised depth learning. Existing image-level UDA shifts synthetic images to resemble real endoscopy, but a domain gap remains between real and translated imagery, limiting depth accuracy.

Method: The depth network processes both translated synthetic frames and real endoscopic frames, learning latent domain-invariant features via adversarial learning and directional feature consistency. The approach is agnostic to the image translation method and focuses on the depth estimation task itself.

Result: Evaluated on endoscopic central airway phantom videos with manually aligned absolute depth maps. The proposed method achieves superior performance on both absolute and relative depth metrics compared to state-of-the-art MDE methods and consistently improves results across various backbones and pretrained weights.

Conclusion: Latent feature alignment effectively reduces domain gap for unsupervised domain adaptation in monocular depth estimation in endoscopy, yielding improved depth accuracy across architectures; code is available at the provided GitHub link.

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is a critical task to guide autonomous
medical robots. However, obtaining absolute (metric) depth from an endoscopy
camera in surgical scenes is difficult, which limits supervised learning of
depth on real endoscopic images. Current image-level unsupervised domain
adaptation methods translate synthetic images with known depth maps into the
style of real endoscopic frames and train depth networks using these translated
images with their corresponding depth maps. However a domain gap often remains
between real and translated synthetic images. In this paper, we present a
latent feature alignment method to improve absolute depth estimation by
reducing this domain gap in the context of endoscopic videos of the central
airway. Our methods are agnostic to the image translation process and focus on
the depth estimation itself. Specifically, the depth network takes translated
synthetic and real endoscopic frames as input and learns latent
domain-invariant features via adversarial learning and directional feature
consistency. The evaluation is conducted on endoscopic videos of central airway
phantoms with manually aligned absolute depth maps. Compared to
state-of-the-art MDE methods, our approach achieves superior performance on
both absolute and relative depth metrics, and consistently improves results
across various backbones and pretrained weights. Our code is available at

*Yucheng Song,Yifan Ge,Junhao Li,Zhining Liao,Zhifang Liao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel hierarchical task decomposition (HTSC-CIF) for Medical Report Generation that addresses three core challenges—domain-knowledge grounding, cross-modal alignment, and spurious cross-modal biases—through a low/mid/high-level design, achieving state-of-the-art results and providing interpretability via a front-door causal intervention; code to be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome three intertwined limitations in MRG: insufficient domain knowledge grounding in visual encoders, weak alignment between text and images across modalities, and spurious correlations due to cross-modal biases that hinder interpretability. Existing work tackles only one challenge, leaving a gap in robust, principled solutions.

Method: HTSC-CIF decomposes the problem into three levels: (1) Low-level: align medical entity features with their spatial locations to strengthen domain knowledge in visual encoders; (2) Mid-level: employ Prefix Language Modeling (text) and Masked Image Modeling (images) to enable mutual guidance and improve cross-modal alignment; (3) High-level: a cross-modal causal intervention module using front-door intervention to reduce confounders and enhance interpretability.

Result: Extensive experiments show that HTSC-CIF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art MRG methods across established benchmarks, indicating strong effectiveness of the three-level approach and cross-modal causality for robust report generation.

Conclusion: HTSC-CIF successfully tackles the three highlighted challenges in MRG through hierarchical task decomposition, delivering improved performance and interpretability. The authors plan to release the code upon acceptance.

Abstract: Medical Report Generation (MRG) is a key part of modern medical diagnostics,
as it automatically generates reports from radiological images to reduce
radiologists' burden. However, reliable MRG models for lesion description face
three main challenges: insufficient domain knowledge understanding, poor
text-visual entity embedding alignment, and spurious correlations from
cross-modal biases. Previous work only addresses single challenges, while this
paper tackles all three via a novel hierarchical task decomposition approach,
proposing the HTSC-CIF framework. HTSC-CIF classifies the three challenges into
low-, mid-, and high-level tasks: 1) Low-level: align medical entity features
with spatial locations to enhance domain knowledge for visual encoders; 2)
Mid-level: use Prefix Language Modeling (text) and Masked Image Modeling
(images) to boost cross-modal alignment via mutual guidance; 3) High-level: a
cross-modal causal intervention module (via front-door intervention) to reduce
confounders and improve interpretability. Extensive experiments confirm
HTSC-CIF's effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA)
MRG methods. Code will be made public upon paper acceptance.

### [21] [Are Euler angles a useful rotation parameterisation for pose estimation with Normalizing Flows?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02277)
*Giorgos Sfikas,Konstantina Nikolaidou,Foteini Papadopoulou,George Retsinas,Anastasios L. Kesidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a probabilistic 3D pose estimation framework using Euler angles with Normalizing Flows, to capture multi-modal outcomes and address ambiguity, while discussing benefits and limitations of Euler-angle parameterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pose estimation ambiguity due to symmetries and sensor/projection constraints motivates probabilistic outputs; Euler angles provide a simple parameterization that could enable effective NF modeling despite known issues like gimbal lock.

Method: Modeling pose with a Normalizing Flows architecture guided by Euler-angle parameterization; analysis of its isomorphism to 3D rotations; comparison with other parameterizations in terms of tractability and performance; theoretical discussion and potential experiments.

Result: The abstract presents an exploratory investigation rather than reporting concrete empirical results; highlights potential benefits of Euler-angle NF; identifies trade-offs and areas for future work.

Conclusion: Euler angles, despite shortcomings, may yield useful and tractable models for probabilistic pose estimation in NF frameworks, offering a valuable alternative parameterization in certain scenarios.

Abstract: Object pose estimation is a task that is of central importance in 3D Computer
Vision. Given a target image and a canonical pose, a single point estimate may
very often be sufficient; however, a probabilistic pose output is related to a
number of benefits when pose is not unambiguous due to sensor and projection
constraints or inherent object symmetries. With this paper, we explore the
usefulness of using the well-known Euler angles parameterisation as a basis for
a Normalizing Flows model for pose estimation. Isomorphic to spatial rotation,
3D pose has been parameterized in a number of ways, either in or out of the
context of parameter estimation. We explore the idea that Euler angles, despite
their shortcomings, may lead to useful models in a number of aspects, compared
to a model built on a more complex parameterisation.

*Fangxun Shu,Yongjie Ye,Yue Liao,Zijian Kang,Weijie Yin,Jiacong Wang,Xiao Liang,Shuicheng Yan,Chao Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAIL-RL introduces a dual-reward RL post-training framework that teaches multimodal LLMs when and how to think, improving reasoning quality and reducing hallucinations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current training relies on outcome-only supervision and fixed thinking strategies, which can reward correct answers without ensuring sound reasoning and cause overthinking on easy tasks or underthinking on hard ones. A method that jointly optimizes reasoning quality and the decision of whether to reason or directly answer can produce more reliable multimodal models.

Method: A dual reward system: Thinking Reward (evaluates reasoning quality via factual grounding, logical coherence, and answer consistency) and Judging Reward (adaptive policy deciding whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate). Applied as a post-training RL framework to SAIL-VL2, across 4B and 8B-scale multimodal LLMs.

Result: SAIL-RL improves reasoning and multimodal understanding benchmarks on SAIL-VL2 at 4B and 8B scales, achieving competitive performance with commercial models like GPT-4o and substantially reducing hallucinations.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a principled approach to building more reliable and adaptive multimodal LLMs by integrating reasoning-aware rewards and adaptive judgment into RL-based post-training; code will be released.

Abstract: We introduce SAIL-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL) post-training framework
that enhances the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) by teaching them when and how to think. Existing approaches are limited
by outcome-only supervision, which rewards correct answers without ensuring
sound reasoning, and by uniform thinking strategies, which often lead to
overthinking on simple tasks and underthinking on complex ones. SAIL-RL
addresses these challenges with a dual reward system: the Thinking Reward,
which evaluates reasoning quality through factual grounding, logical coherence,
and answer consistency, and the Judging Reward, which adaptively determines
whether deep reasoning or direct answering is appropriate. Experiments on the
state-of-the-art SAIL-VL2 show that SAIL-RL improves reasoning and multimodal
understanding benchmarks at both 4B and 8B scales, achieving competitive
performance against commercial closed-source models such as GPT-4o, and
substantially reduces hallucinations, establishing it as a principled framework
for building more reliable and adaptive MLLMs. The code will be available at

*Cuong Tuan Nguyen,Ngoc Tuan Nguyen,Triet Hoang Minh Dao,Huy Minh Nhat,Huy Truong Dinh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A GNN-based framework for Handwritten Mathematical Expression recognition treats HMEs as graphs with symbol nodes and spatial edges, using BLSTM for initial segmentation/recognition, a 2D-CFG parser to enumerate spatial relations, and a GNN-based link predictor to prune connections into a Symbol Label Graph; results indicate effective structure recognition.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Handwritten math expressions have complex, spatially arranged symbols whose relationships are crucial for correct interpretation. Traditional methods struggle to capture long-range spatial dependencies and disambiguate layouts, motivating a graph-based approach that jointly reasons about symbols and their spatial relations.

Method: 1) Use a deep BLSTM for symbol segmentation, recognition, and local spatial relation classification to form an initial primitive graph. 2) Apply a 2D-CFG parser to generate all plausible spatial relations among symbols. 3) Use a GNN-based link prediction model to prune unnecessary connections and refine the graph into a Symbol Label Graph.

Result: Experimental results show the approach is effective, achieving promising performance in HME structure recognition compared to baselines or prior methods.

Conclusion: Integrating BLSTM-based perception, 2D-CFG parsing, and GNN-based relational reasoning yields a robust graph-based framework for HME recognition, with improved structure understanding and potential for end-to-end refinement.

Abstract: We propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approach for Handwritten
Mathematical Expression (HME) recognition by modeling HMEs as graphs, where
nodes represent symbols and edges capture spatial dependencies. A deep BLSTM
network is used for symbol segmentation, recognition, and spatial relation
classification, forming an initial primitive graph. A 2D-CFG parser then
generates all possible spatial relations, while the GNN-based link prediction
model refines the structure by removing unnecessary connections, ultimately
forming the Symbol Label Graph. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, showing promising performance in HME structure
recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cycle-Sync is a global, robust camera pose framework that uses a cycle-consistency–driven MPLS solver for both location and rotation estimation, with strong deterministic exact-recovery guarantees, low sample complexity, and outlier rejection, outperforming BA-based pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the fragility and computational burden of bundle adjustment in structure-from-motion by leveraging cycle consistency to achieve robust, global pose estimation with strong theoretical guarantees.

Method: Adapt MPLS (from group synchronization) for camera location estimation by emphasizing cycle-consistent information, redefining cycle consistency using distances estimated from previous iterations, and applying a Welsch-type robust loss. Add a plug-and-play outlier rejection module inspired by robust subspace recovery and fully integrate cycle consistency into MPLS for rotation synchronization, producing a global method that avoids bundle adjustment.

Result: They establish the strongest known deterministic exact-recovery guarantee for camera location estimation, show that cycle consistency alone suffices for the lowest known sample complexity, and demonstrate robustness with the outlier rejection module. Empirical results on synthetic and real data show Cycle-Sync consistently outperforms leading pose estimators and even full structure-from-motion pipelines with bundle adjustment.

Conclusion: Cycle-Sync offers a robust, global alternative to BA-based pipelines, delivering theoretical guarantees and superior empirical performance for both camera location and rotation estimation without requiring bundle adjustment.

Abstract: We introduce Cycle-Sync, a robust and global framework for estimating camera
poses (both rotations and locations). Our core innovation is a location solver
that adapts message-passing least squares (MPLS) -- originally developed for
group synchronization -- to camera location estimation. We modify MPLS to
emphasize cycle-consistent information, redefine cycle consistencies using
estimated distances from previous iterations, and incorporate a Welsch-type
robust loss. We establish the strongest known deterministic exact-recovery
guarantee for camera location estimation, showing that cycle consistency alone
-- without access to inter-camera distances -- suffices to achieve the lowest
sample complexity currently known. To further enhance robustness, we introduce
a plug-and-play outlier rejection module inspired by robust subspace recovery,
and we fully integrate cycle consistency into MPLS for rotation
synchronization. Our global approach avoids the need for bundle adjustment.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets show that Cycle-Sync consistently
outperforms leading pose estimators, including full structure-from-motion
pipelines with bundle adjustment.

*Garen Boyadjian,Cyrille Pierre,Johann Laconte,Riccardo Bertoglio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Blender-based procedural synthetic data pipeline for crop-weed semantic segmentation reduces sim-to-real gap to ~10% and shows strong cross-domain generalization, enabling hybrid training strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotating field crops for semantic segmentation is costly; synthetic data could alleviate labeling burden, but the sim-to-real domain gap remains a challenge. The study aims to quantify cross-domain transfer and the potential of synthetic data.

Method: Developed a Blender-driven procedural pipeline to generate synthetic crop-weed images with pixel-level annotations, varying plant growth, weed density, lighting, and camera angle. Trained and evaluated several state-of-the-art segmentation models on both synthetic and real datasets, and analyzed cross-domain generalization (synthetic-to-real and real-to-synthetic).

Result: Training on synthetic images reduced the sim-to-real gap to about 10% and demonstrated strong cross-domain generalization, outperforming real data in cross-domain scenarios. The findings suggest synthetic data can bridge domain gaps and, when used with real data, enable more efficient model training.

Conclusion: Synthetic agricultural datasets are promising for semantic segmentation and support hybrid training strategies. Future work should refine domain adaptation, increase scene diversity, and report detailed evaluation metrics to improve replicability.

Abstract: Precise semantic segmentation of crops and weeds is necessary for
agricultural weeding robots. However, training deep learning models requires
large annotated datasets, which are costly to obtain in real fields. Synthetic
data can reduce this burden, but the gap between simulated and real images
remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a pipeline for procedural
generation of synthetic crop-weed images using Blender, producing annotated
datasets under diverse conditions of plant growth, weed density, lighting, and
camera angle. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models on
synthetic and real datasets and analyze their cross-domain generalization. Our
results show that training on synthetic images leads to a sim-to-real gap of
10%, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, synthetic data
demonstrates good generalization properties, outperforming real datasets in
cross-domain scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic
agricultural datasets and support hybrid strategies for more efficient model
training.

*Kun Zou,Yongheng Xu,Jianxing Yu,Yan Pan,Jian Yin,Hanjiang Lai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes GAFD-CC, a post-hoc OOD detector that decouples features guided by global classification weights, combining positively/negatively correlated features with multi-scale logit confidence to refine decision boundaries and improve robustness, with competitive results and strong generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current post-hoc OOD detectors often ignore the intrinsic correlation between features and logits, missing a crucial cue for discriminative boundary refinement. Exploiting feature-direction alignment with global classification weights could enhance OOD detection.

Method: Global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights to align features with the weight direction, extracting positively correlated features that sharpen ID/OOD boundaries and negatively correlated features that suppress false positives. These decoupled features are adaptively fused with multi-scale logit-based confidence for robust OOD detection.

Result: Experiments on large-scale benchmarks show competitive performance and strong generalization compared with state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: GAFD-CC refines decision boundaries and boosts discriminative performance in OOD detection by decoupling features and calibrating confidence, demonstrating robust generalization across benchmarks.

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is paramount to ensuring the reliability
and robustness of learning models in real-world applications. Existing post-hoc
OOD detection methods detect OOD samples by leveraging their features and
logits information without retraining. However, they often overlook the
inherent correlation between features and logits, which is crucial for
effective OOD detection. To address this limitation, we propose Global-Aware
Feature Decoupling with Confidence Calibration (GAFD-CC). GAFD-CC aims to
refine decision boundaries and increase discriminative performance. Firstly, it
performs global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights. This
involves aligning features with the direction of global classification weights
to decouple them. From this, GAFD-CC extracts two types of critical
information: positively correlated features that promote in-distribution
(ID)/OOD boundary refinement and negatively correlated features that suppress
false positives and tighten these boundaries. Secondly, it adaptively fuses
these decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence for
comprehensive and robust OOD detection. Extensive experiments on large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate GAFD-CC's competitive performance and strong
generalization ability compared to those of state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable real-time scene understanding and decision-making on resource-constrained mobile robots by leveraging small VLMs, addressing deployment challenges and the accuracy-time trade-off.

Method: Proposes a pipeline using small VLMs (with attention to edge-optimized models) and evaluates it on a diverse dataset including cityscape, on-campus, and indoor scenarios; analyzes performance, inference time, weaknesses, biases, and applicability; provides supplementary material in a public repository.

Result: Demonstrates potential of small VLMs for edge deployment in scene interpretation and action recognition, with acceptable performance in some settings; reveals practical challenges such as bias, domain gaps, and reliability under varying conditions; highlights the need for efficiency optimizations and bias mitigation.

Conclusion: Edge-deployable VLMs are viable for scene interpretation and action recognition in mobile robotics, but require further improvements in robustness, bias mitigation, and efficiency to achieve consistent, reliable performance across diverse environments.

Abstract: Video Understanding, Scene Interpretation and Commonsense Reasoning are
highly challenging tasks enabling the interpretation of visual information,
allowing agents to perceive, interact with and make rational decisions in its
environment. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual Language Models (VLMs)
have shown remarkable advancements in these areas in recent years, enabling
domain-specific applications as well as zero-shot open vocabulary tasks,
combining multiple domains. However, the required computational complexity
poses challenges for their application on edge devices and in the context of
Mobile Robotics, especially considering the trade-off between accuracy and
inference time. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of
state-of-the-art VLMs for the task of Scene Interpretation and Action
Recognition, with special regard to small VLMs capable of being deployed to
edge devices in the context of Mobile Robotics. The proposed pipeline is
evaluated on a diverse dataset consisting of various real-world cityscape,
on-campus and indoor scenarios. The experimental evaluation discusses the
potential of these small models on edge devices, with particular emphasis on
challenges, weaknesses, inherent model biases and the application of the gained

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces M3PD, a dual-view mobile PPG dataset, and F3Mamba fusion model; achieves 21.9–30.2% reduction in heart-rate error over single-view baselines; dataset and code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video-based PPG on smartphones suffers from motion, lighting, and single-view limitations, and there is a lack of open datasets for cross-device accuracy, especially in cardiovascular patients.

Method: Collected synchronized facial and fingertip videos simultaneously with front and rear cameras from 60 participants (47 cardiovascular patients) to form M3PD; proposed F3Mamba that fuses dual views using Mamba-based temporal modeling.

Result: Heart-rate estimation error reduced by 21.9 to 30.2% compared with single-view baselines; improved robustness in real-world conditions.

Conclusion: Dual-view fusion and open dataset enable more reliable, accessible mobile PPG for cardiovascular monitoring and cross-device evaluation; data and code are publicly available.

Abstract: Portable physiological monitoring is essential for early detection and
management of cardiovascular disease, but current methods often require
specialized equipment that limits accessibility or impose impractical postures
that patients cannot maintain. Video-based photoplethysmography on smartphones
offers a convenient noninvasive alternative, yet it still faces reliability
challenges caused by motion artifacts, lighting variations, and single-view
constraints. Few studies have demonstrated reliable application to
cardiovascular patients, and no widely used open datasets exist for
cross-device accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce the M3PD
dataset, the first publicly available dual-view mobile photoplethysmography
dataset, comprising synchronized facial and fingertip videos captured
simultaneously via front and rear smartphone cameras from 60 participants
(including 47 cardiovascular patients). Building on this dual-view setting, we
further propose F3Mamba, which fuses the facial and fingertip views through
Mamba-based temporal modeling. The model reduces heart-rate error by 21.9 to
30.2 percent over existing single-view baselines while improving robustness in
challenging real-world scenarios. Data and code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To facilitate the evaluation and acceptance of deep-learning enabled robotic systems by automatically generating reports while preserving user privacy and avoiding reliance on external services.

Method: Introduce a pipeline that uses local models on edge devices to synthesize natural-language reports from multi-modal sensor data; no external services required; evaluated on a diverse dataset spanning indoor, outdoor, and urban environments; generated reports and supplementary materials are publicly available.

Result: The approach yields quantitative and qualitative evaluation results, with example reports and a public repository of reports and supplementary materials.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility and utility of privacy-preserving, edge-based NL report generation for mobile robotics, enabling robust evaluation across varied environments and supporting broader adoption.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Deep Learning enable hardware-based cognitive systems,
that is, mechatronic systems in general and robotics in particular with
integrated Artificial Intelligence, to interact with dynamic and unstructured
environments. While the results are impressive, the application of such systems
to critical tasks like autonomous driving as well as service and care robotics
necessitate the evaluation of large amount of heterogeneous data. Automated
report generation for Mobile Robotics can play a crucial role in facilitating
the evaluation and acceptance of such systems in various domains. In this
paper, we propose a pipeline for generating automated reports in natural
language utilizing various multi-modal sensors that solely relies on local
models capable of being deployed on edge computing devices, thus preserving the
privacy of all actors involved and eliminating the need for external services.
In particular, we evaluate our implementation on a diverse dataset spanning
multiple domains including indoor, outdoor and urban environments, providing
quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation results. Various generated

### [30] [CoCoVa: Chain of Continuous Vision-Language Thought for Latent Space Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02360)
*Jizheng Ma,Xiaofei Zhou,Yanlong Song,Han Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoCoVa introduces a continuous latent reasoning framework for vision-language models, using a Latent Q-Former (LQ-Former) to iteratively refine a chain of latent thought vectors with cross-modal fusion and a token selection mechanism. It combines contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction to ground latent thoughts, achieving strong accuracy and token efficiency with small backbones and remaining competitive with larger models when scaled.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current vision-language models are constrained to discrete token spaces, limiting their ability to leverage the rich, high-dimensional structure of visual perception. There is a need for continuous, cross-modal reasoning that can be grounded to both vision and language, improving efficiency and generalization across tasks.

Method: An iterative reasoning cycle where a Latent Q-Former refines a chain of latent thought vectors via cross-modal fusion. A token selection mechanism identifies salient visual regions to guide attention. A multi-task objective combining contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction enforces alignment between latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.

Result: CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong baselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it matches or surpasses 7B–9B models on most benchmarks; when scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains competitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analyses indicate the latent space is interpretable and structured, suggesting effective cross-modal grounding.

Conclusion: CoCoVa demonstrates the viability of continuous cross-modal reasoning to bridge discrete language processing and continuous visual understanding, offering interpretable latent reasoning and strong scalability across backbone sizes.

Abstract: In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and
beyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world
in multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain
constrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic
tokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual
perception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous
Vision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that
leverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks.
The core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent
Q-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a
chain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this
process, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual
regions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain
grounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines
contrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment
between latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.
Evaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong
baselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B
models on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains
competitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that
learned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns,
highlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between
discrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RxnCaption reframes chemical reaction diagram parsing as an image-captioning task for LVLMs, using a bounding-box visual prompt (BIVP) with MolYOLO; introduces RxnCaption-11k dataset; achieves state-of-the-art results; code/data released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chemical reaction data in papers are often images, hindering machine readability and ML training; need scalable, robust extraction of structured information from literature.

Method: Reformulate parsing as captioning; apply BIVP to pre-draw molecular boxes and indices; feed into LVLMs to generate natural language descriptions; construct RxnCaption-11k dataset with four layout archetypes; evaluate RxnCaption-VL on metrics.

Result: BIVP improves structural extraction quality and simplifies model design; RxnCaption-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics; dataset is an order of magnitude larger than prior benchmarks; balanced test subset across four layout archetypes.

Conclusion: The framework, dataset, and models will advance structured info extraction from chemical literature and enable broader AI applications in chemistry; data, models, and code will be released on GitHub.

Abstract: Large-scale chemical reaction datasets are crucial for AI research in
chemistry. However, existing chemical reaction data often exist as images
within papers, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training
machine learning models. In response to this challenge, we propose the
RxnCaption framework for the task of chemical Reaction Diagram Parsing (RxnDP).
Our framework reformulates the traditional coordinate prediction driven parsing
process into an image captioning problem, which Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) handle naturally. We introduce a strategy termed "BBox and Index as
Visual Prompt" (BIVP), which uses our state-of-the-art molecular detector,
MolYOLO, to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices directly onto the
input image. This turns the downstream parsing into a natural-language
description problem. Extensive experiments show that the BIVP strategy
significantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model
design. We further construct the RxnCaption-11k dataset, an order of magnitude
larger than prior real-world literature benchmarks, with a balanced test subset
across four layout archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that RxnCaption-VL
achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics. We believe our
method, dataset, and models will advance structured information extraction from
chemical literature and catalyze broader AI applications in chemistry. We will
release data, models, and code on GitHub.

*Leon Schwarzer,Matthias Zeller,Daniel Casado Herraez,Simon Dierl,Michael Heidingsfeld,Cyrill Stachniss*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A self-supervised, clustering-based contrastive pretraining method for sparse, noisy radar point clouds enabling efficient moving object segmentation with limited labels; shows improved label efficiency and state-of-the-art gains after fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Radar offers single-scan motion cues (Doppler) avoiding temporal accumulation, but radar point clouds are sparse/noisy and expensive to annotate; reducing labeling through self-supervised pretraining is desirable.

Method: Two-step approach: first, contrastive self-supervised representation learning using a novel clustering-based contrastive loss with cluster refinement via dynamic point removal; second, supervised fine-tuning with limited annotated data to perform moving object segmentation.

Result: Pretraining with the proposed loss improves label efficiency after fine-tuning and boosts state-of-the-art performance compared to baselines relying on supervised data alone.

Conclusion: Self-supervised pretraining with clustering-based contrastive loss is effective for achieving motion-aware representations in radar data, enabling more data-efficient moving object segmentation.

Abstract: Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for safe and reliable autonomous
mobile systems like self-driving cars, improving the reliability and robustness
of subsequent tasks like SLAM or path planning. While the segmentation of
camera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often
introduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal
sequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this
problem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler
velocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation.
However, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation
for use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and
cost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of
self-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point
clouds. We follow a two-step approach of contrastive self-supervised
representation learning with subsequent supervised fine-tuning using limited
amounts of annotated data. We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss
function with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain
the network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data. Our
method improves label efficiency after fine-tuning, effectively boosting
state-of-the-art performance by self-supervised pretraining.

### [33] [A Novel Grouping-Based Hybrid Color Correction Algorithm for Color Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02397)
*Kuo-Liang Chung,Ting-Chung Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Grouping-based hybrid color correction for color point clouds adaptively partitions target points based on overlap into close, moderate, and distant proximity groups and applies different correction strategies (KBI, JKHE, HE) to each group; validated on 1086 test pairs with open-source implementation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Color correction for color point clouds is essential for 3D rendering and compression, and existing methods largely target color images. There is a need for adaptive, group-based correction in 3D to handle varying overlap between aligned point clouds.

Method: Estimate overlap between aligned source/target clouds. Adaptively partition target points into two or three groups: Gcl (close), Gmod (moderate), and optionally Gdist (distant) based on overlap. Apply K-nearest neighbors bilateral interpolation (KBI) to Gcl, joint KBI and histogram equalization (JKHE) to Gmod, and histogram equalization (HE) to Gdist. Include an ablation study and discuss grouping-effect free property.

Result: The proposed method achieves improved color consistency across tested color point clouds, demonstrated via 1086 test pairs against state-of-the-art methods. It includes analysis on grouping effects and ablation, and provides a C++ implementation at the provided GitHub repository.

Conclusion: A grouping-based hybrid color correction framework for color point clouds effectively achieves adaptive, high-quality color correction by tailoring strategies to local overlap groups, with validated performance and open-source availability.

Abstract: Color consistency correction for color point clouds is a fundamental yet
important task in 3D rendering and compression applications. In the past, most
previous color correction methods aimed at correcting color for color images.
The purpose of this paper is to propose a grouping-based hybrid color
correction algorithm for color point clouds. Our algorithm begins by estimating
the overlapping rate between the aligned source and target point clouds, and
then adaptively partitions the target points into two groups, namely the close
proximity group Gcl and the moderate proximity group Gmod, or three groups,
namely Gcl, Gmod, and the distant proximity group Gdist, when the estimated
overlapping rate is low or high, respectively. To correct color for target
points in Gcl, a K-nearest neighbors based bilateral interpolation (KBI) method
is proposed. To correct color for target points in Gmod, a joint KBI and the
histogram equalization (JKHE) method is proposed. For target points in Gdist, a
histogram equalization (HE) method is proposed for color correction. Finally,
we discuss the grouping-effect free property and the ablation study in our
algorithm. The desired color consistency correction benefit of our algorithm
has been justified through 1086 testing color point cloud pairs against the
state-of-the-art methods. The C++ source code of our algorithm can be accessed
from the website: https://github.com/ivpml84079/Point-cloud-color-correction.

*Arya Shah,Vaibhav Tripathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A frozen-encoder benchmark reveals that self-supervised ViTs align feline and human visual representations best across architectures, with early-layer features driving cross-species similarity; suggests architectural biases and self-supervision shape cross-species similarity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how feline-visual adaptations map onto downstream representations and to identify cross-species representational alignment across architectures, informing neuroscience and AI model design.

Method: A unified frozen-encoder benchmark evaluating cross-species representational alignment (feline vs human) using layer-wise Centered Kernel Alignment (linear and RBF) and Representational Similarity Analysis across CNNs, supervised ViTs, windowed transformers, and self-supervised ViTs (DINO). Evaluates multiple tests including distributional and stability tests; tracks alignment across network blocks.

Result: DINO ViT-B/16 achieves highest alignment (mean CKA-RBF ≈ 0.814; mean CKA-linear ≈0.745; RSA ≈0.698), peaking in early blocks. Supervised ViTs competitive on CKA but weaker RSA; CNNs strong baselines but below plain ViTs; windowed transformers underperform; self-supervision with ViT biases yields representations more aligned with feline-human vision; implies early-stage features bridge species-specific statistics; results support testable neuroscientific hypotheses.

Conclusion: Self-supervised ViTs with ViT inductive biases yield representational geometries closely aligned for feline and human vision, more so than CNNs or windowed transformers; supports hypotheses about where cross-species visual computations converge; code and dataset released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Cats and humans differ in ocular anatomy. Most notably, Felis Catus (domestic
cats) have vertically elongated pupils linked to ambush predation; yet, how
such specializations manifest in downstream visual representations remains
incompletely understood. We present a unified, frozen-encoder benchmark that
quantifies feline-human cross-species representational alignment in the wild,
across convolutional networks, supervised Vision Transformers, windowed
transformers, and self-supervised ViTs (DINO), using layer-wise Centered Kernel
Alignment (linear and RBF) and Representational Similarity Analysis, with
additional distributional and stability tests reported in the paper. Across
models, DINO ViT-B/16 attains the most substantial alignment (mean CKA-RBF
$\approx0.814$, mean CKA-linear $\approx0.745$, mean RSA $\approx0.698$),
peaking at early blocks, indicating that token-level self-supervision induces
early-stage features that bridge species-specific statistics. Supervised ViTs
are competitive on CKA yet show weaker geometric correspondence than DINO
(e.g., ViT-B/16 RSA $\approx0.53$ at block8; ViT-L/16 $\approx0.47$ at
block14), revealing depth-dependent divergences between similarity and
representational geometry. CNNs remain strong baselines but below plain ViTs on
alignment, and windowed transformers underperform plain ViTs, implicating
architectural inductive biases in cross-species alignment. Results indicate
that self-supervision coupled with ViT inductive biases yields representational
geometries that more closely align feline and human visual systems than widely
used CNNs and windowed Transformers, providing testable neuroscientific
hypotheses about where and how cross-species visual computations converge. We
release our code and dataset for reference and reproducibility.

*Wenyang Wei,Yang yang,Xixi Jia,Xiangchu Feng,Weiwei Wang,Renzhen Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IllumFlow introduces a Retinex-guided, flow-based LLIE framework that splits images into reflectance and illumination, models illumination as a continuous flow via conditional rectified flow, and denoises reflectance with flow-augmented training for robust, customizable enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low-light images exhibit large illumination variation and noise, making it challenging to enhance without compromising color fidelity. A principled decomposition into illumination and reflectance, with a flow-based model for illumination changes, can better handle lighting variations and noise.

Method: Decompose input per Retinex into reflectance and illumination. Model illumination changes as a conditional rectified flow field. Apply a denoising network to the reflectance, augmented with flow-derived data augmentations to reduce noise and chromatic aberrations while preserving color. Provide controllable brightness enhancement through the illumination adaptation.

Result: Extensive experiments on low-light enhancement and exposure correction show superior quantitative and qualitative performance compared with existing methods.

Conclusion: IllumFlow enables precise illumination adaptation across lighting conditions, naturally supports customizable brightness enhancement, and effectively denoises reflectance while preserving color fidelity.

Abstract: We present IllumFlow, a novel framework that synergizes conditional Rectified
Flow (CRF) with Retinex theory for low-light image enhancement (LLIE). Our
model addresses low-light enhancement through separate optimization of
illumination and reflectance components, effectively handling both lighting
variations and noise. Specifically, we first decompose an input image into
reflectance and illumination components following Retinex theory. To model the
wide dynamic range of illumination variations in low-light images, we propose a
conditional rectified flow framework that represents illumination changes as a
continuous flow field. While complex noise primarily resides in the reflectance
component, we introduce a denoising network, enhanced by flow-derived data
augmentation, to remove reflectance noise and chromatic aberration while
preserving color fidelity. IllumFlow enables precise illumination adaptation
across lighting conditions while naturally supporting customizable brightness
enhancement. Extensive experiments on low-light enhancement and exposure
correction demonstrate superior quantitative and qualitative performance over
existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs struggle with complex chart tasks; coverage is limited and real-world reasoning is computationally demanding. A scalable, high-quality dataset is needed to train and evaluate chart understanding and reasoning.

Method: A multi-stage pipeline: (1) retrieval-augmented generation to fetch professional chart templates; (2) chain-of-thought-inspired reasoning codes to simulate data distributions; (3) driving chart rendering and question-related statistical computations; (4) model-based evaluation to ensure diversity and data quality; (5) construction of ChartM^3 dataset used for training and evaluation.

Result: ChartM^3 comprises 38K charts and 142K Q&A pairs for training, plus 2,871 high-quality evaluation samples. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) experiments show the dataset improves reasoning capabilities and cross-domain generalization, enabling smaller models to achieve performance comparable to larger models on complex chart comprehension.

Conclusion: The pipeline enables scalable generation of high-quality chart reasoning data, boosting MLLM capabilities and cross-domain transfer, with potential to democratize chart understanding performance across model scales.

Abstract: Complex chart understanding tasks demand advanced visual recognition and
reasoning capabilities from multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However,
current research provides limited coverage of complex chart scenarios and
computation-intensive reasoning tasks prevalent in real-world applications.
This study proposes an automated multi-stage code-driven pipeline for
systematically generating visual reasoning datasets to address these
limitations. The pipeline integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to
retrieve professional chart templates and employs chain-of-thought (CoT)
strategies to generate reasoning codes that simulate real data distributions,
thereby driving chart rendering and question-related statistical computations.
Through model-based evaluation, the pipeline enhances chart diversity and data
quality. Using this framework, we construct ChartM$^3$, a multi-dimensional and
multi-step dataset containing 38K charts and 142K Q&A pairs for training, along
with 2,871 high-quality evaluation samples for enabling practical performance
assessment. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL)
experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves reasoning
capabilities and cross-domain generalization performance, enabling smaller
models to achieve performance comparable to larger-scale models in complex
chart comprehension.

*Teerapong Panboonyuen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KAO uses kernel-adaptive optimization in diffusion models for very high-resolution (VHR) satellite image inpainting, employing latent-space conditioning and explicit propagation to deliver efficient, accurate restoration and state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Restoring missing or occluded regions in VHR satellite imagery is crucial for robust analysis. Existing methods either require extensive retraining of preconditioned models or incur significant computational overhead with postconditioned approaches, limiting scalability on datasets like DeepGlobe and the Massachusetts Roads Dataset.

Method: Introduce Kernel-Adaptive Optimization (KAO) within diffusion models. Use Latent Space Conditioning to optimize a compact latent representation for inpainting, and integrate Explicit Propagation into the diffusion process to enable forward-backward fusion, improving stability and precision.

Result: KAO sets a new benchmark for VHR satellite image restoration, offering a scalable, high-performance solution that balances the efficiency of preconditioned models with the flexibility of postconditioned models. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (e.g., DeepGlobe, Massachusetts Roads) demonstrate superior restoration quality and efficiency.

Conclusion: KAO provides an effective, scalable framework for satellite image inpainting in VHR regimes, achieving high accuracy with reduced retraining overhead and improved stability through explicit propagation, thereby combining the advantages of both preconditioned and postconditioned approaches.

Abstract: Satellite image inpainting is a crucial task in remote sensing, where
accurately restoring missing or occluded regions is essential for robust image
analysis. In this paper, we propose KAO, a novel framework that utilizes
Kernel-Adaptive Optimization within diffusion models for satellite image
inpainting. KAO is specifically designed to address the challenges posed by
very high-resolution (VHR) satellite datasets, such as DeepGlobe and the
Massachusetts Roads Dataset. Unlike existing methods that rely on
preconditioned models requiring extensive retraining or postconditioned models
with significant computational overhead, KAO introduces a Latent Space
Conditioning approach, optimizing a compact latent space to achieve efficient
and accurate inpainting. Furthermore, we incorporate Explicit Propagation into
the diffusion process, facilitating forward-backward fusion, which improves the
stability and precision of the method. Experimental results demonstrate that
KAO sets a new benchmark for VHR satellite image restoration, providing a
scalable, high-performance solution that balances the efficiency of
preconditioned models with the flexibility of postconditioned models.

### [38] [MVAFormer: RGB-based Multi-View Spatio-Temporal Action Recognition with Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02473)
*Taiga Yamane,Satoshi Suzuki,Ryo Masumura,Shotaro Tora*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transformer-based multi-view cooperation (MVAFormer) for Spatio-Temporal Action Recognition (STAR) that preserves spatial information using feature-map level cross-view attention; splits self-attention for same vs different views; yields ~4.4 F-measure gain on a new dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable effective multi-view cooperation in STAR and address occlusion while preserving spatial cues. Existing methods focus on single-action-per-video and operate on embedding vectors, which loses spatial information and is unsuitable for per-person sequential action recognition.

Method: Introduce MVAFormer, a transformer-based cooperation module that operates on per-view feature maps. It separates self-attention for same-view and different-view interactions to model cross-view relationships while maintaining spatial information in STAR.

Result: MVAFormer outperforms comparison baselines by about 4.4 points on F-measure on a newly collected dataset.

Conclusion: A spatially aware, view-separated attention mechanism within a transformer-based cooperation module improves multi-view STAR performance, effectively addressing occlusion and enabling sequential per-person action recognition across views.

Abstract: Multi-view action recognition aims to recognize human actions using multiple
camera views and deals with occlusion caused by obstacles or crowds. In this
task, cooperation among views, which generates a joint representation by
combining multiple views, is vital. Previous studies have explored promising
cooperation methods for improving performance. However, since their methods
focus only on the task setting of recognizing a single action from an entire
video, they are not applicable to the recently popular spatio-temporal action
recognition~(STAR) setting, in which each person's action is recognized
sequentially. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-view action
recognition method for the STAR setting, called MVAFormer. In MVAFormer, we
introduce a novel transformer-based cooperation module among views. In contrast
to previous studies, which utilize embedding vectors with lost spatial
information, our module utilizes the feature map for effective cooperation in
the STAR setting, which preserves the spatial information. Furthermore, in our
module, we divide the self-attention for the same and different views to model
the relationship between multiple views effectively. The results of experiments
using a newly collected dataset demonstrate that MVAFormer outperforms the
comparison baselines by approximately $4.4$ points on the F-measure.

### [39] [OLATverse: A Large-scale Real-world Object Dataset with Precise Lighting Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02483)
*Xilong Zhou,Jianchun Chen,Pramod Rao,Timo Teufel,Linjie Lyu,Tigran Minasian,Oleksandr Sotnychenko,Xiaoxiao Long,Marc Habermann,Christian Theobalt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OLATverse is a large-scale real-world object-centric dataset (~9M images, 765 objects) captured with 35 cameras and 331 controlled light sources, providing calibrated camera parameters, masks, photometric normals, and diffuse albedo, plus a comprehensive benchmark for inverse rendering and relighting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current object-centric inverse rendering datasets rely on synthetic data or small real-world datasets, which limit realism and generalization. A large-scale, real-world, multi-view, well-illuminated dataset is needed to train and robustly benchmark methods.

Method: Data collection with multi-view capture across 331 controlled light sources, using 35 DSLR cameras per object, over 765 real-world objects spanning materials; provide calibrated camera parameters, masks, photometric normals, diffuse albedo; construct evaluation set; public release with post-processing workflows.

Result: Introduces OLATverse; enables realistic lighting variations and photometric measurements; first comprehensive real-world object-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation; dataset to be released publicly.

Conclusion: OLATverse represents a pivotal resource to advance inverse rendering and relighting methods in real-world settings, enabling better training, evaluation, and generalization.

Abstract: We introduce OLATverse, a large-scale dataset comprising around 9M images of
765 real-world objects, captured from multiple viewpoints under a diverse set
of precisely controlled lighting conditions. While recent advances in
object-centric inverse rendering, novel view synthesis and relighting have
shown promising results, most techniques still heavily rely on the synthetic
datasets for training and small-scale real-world datasets for benchmarking,
which limits their realism and generalization. To address this gap, OLATverse
offers two key advantages over existing datasets: large-scale coverage of real
objects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations.
Specifically, OLATverse contains 765 common and uncommon real-world objects,
spanning a wide range of material categories. Each object is captured using 35
DSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, enabling the
simulation of diverse illumination conditions. In addition, for each object, we
provide well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric
surface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources. We also construct
an extensive evaluation set, establishing the first comprehensive real-world
object-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation. We
believe that OLATverse represents a pivotal step toward integrating the next
generation of inverse rendering and relighting methods with real-world data.
The full dataset, along with all post-processing workflows, will be publicly
released at https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/OLATverse/.

### [40] [Object Detection as an Optional Basis: A Graph Matching Network for Cross-View UAV Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02489)
*Tao Liu,Kan Ren,Qian Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cross-view UAV localization method that uses object detection and graph neural networks to match UAV and satellite imagery for GNSS-denied scenarios, with a public dataset to enable evaluation and generalization across modality gaps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNSS-denied environments and cross-domain appearance gaps (UAV vs satellite, visible vs infrared) make traditional image retrieval or domain adaptation fragile; there is a need for fine-grained, relational reasoning across multiple images to improve localization accuracy.

Method: Extracts salient instances via modern object detection from both UAV and satellite views, then uses a graph neural network to model inter-image and intra-image relationships. A fine-grained, graph-based node-similarity metric is used for retrieval/localization, enabling cross-temporal and cross-view matching across heterogeneous modalities.

Result: Experiments on public and real-world datasets show strong retrieval and localization performance, with robustness to heterogeneous appearance differences and better generalization across modality gaps, including potential infrared-visible matching.

Conclusion: The approach advances cross-view UAV localization in GNSS-denied areas by combining object-level scene understanding with relational reasoning, and provides a publicly available dataset to facilitate further research.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, UAVs have become crucial
for measurement and tracking in patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied areas,
satellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents
a cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object
detection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view,
heterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual
localization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are
extracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is
estimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because
publicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches
recast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these
datasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain
differences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations,
or generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment,
content loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object
detection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite
images, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and
intra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based
node-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization
performance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that
our approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and
generalizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps,
such as infrared-visible image matching. Our dataset will be publicly available
at the following URL: https://github.com/liutao23/ODGNNLoc.git.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DetectiumFire is a large-scale, multi-modal fire dataset with 22.5k high-resolution images and 2.5k real-world fire videos, annotated with both bounding boxes and descriptive textual prompts, enabling tasks from detection to diffusion-based image generation and vision-language reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the scarcity of public, high-quality fire-domain datasets to support safe AI for fire understanding, risk assessment, and synthetic data generation.

Method: Data collection across diverse fire types, environments, and risk levels; provides traditional computer-vision labels (e.g., bounding boxes) and detailed textual prompts describing scenes; designed to support multi-modal tasks including image generation and vision-language reasoning; released publicly (Kaggle).

Result: Demonstrates utility across object detection, diffusion-based image generation, and vision-language reasoning; claims improvements in data scale, diversity, and quality compared to existing benchmarks, with reduced redundancy.

Conclusion: Dataset is poised to advance fire-related AI research and practical safety applications, and its public release should catalyze broader development in fire understanding and intelligent safety systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal models have demonstrated strong performance in
tasks such as image generation and reasoning. However, applying these models to
the fire domain remains challenging due to the lack of publicly available
datasets with high-quality fire domain annotations. To address this gap, we
introduce DetectiumFire, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset comprising of 22.5k
high-resolution fire-related images and 2.5k real-world fire-related videos
covering a wide range of fire types, environments, and risk levels. The data
are annotated with both traditional computer vision labels (e.g., bounding
boxes) and detailed textual prompts describing the scene, enabling applications
such as synthetic data generation and fire risk reasoning. DetectiumFire offers
clear advantages over existing benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data
quality, significantly reducing redundancy and enhancing coverage of real-world
scenarios. We validate the utility of DetectiumFire across multiple tasks,
including object detection, diffusion-based image generation, and
vision-language reasoning. Our results highlight the potential of this dataset
to advance fire-related research and support the development of intelligent
safety systems. We release DetectiumFire to promote broader exploration of fire
understanding in the AI community. The dataset is available at

### [42] [Adapting General-Purpose Foundation Models for X-ray Ptychography in Low-Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02503)
*Robinson Umeike,Neil Getty,Yin Xiangyu,Yi Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PtychoBench shows task-dependent optimal specialization: SFT plus ICL synergy for visual ptychographic artifact detection, while ICL on a large base LLM bests SFT for textual parameter recommendations; context-aware prompting improves performance and contextual interference arises in fine-tuned models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how to adapt general-purpose LLMs/VLMs to specialized scientific tasks, and to establish a benchmark-driven framework for choosing specialization strategies in microscopy workflows.

Method: Introduce PtychoBench, a multi-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Systematically compare Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL) across two tasks: a visual artifact detection task using VLMs and a textual parameter recommendation task using LLMs, in a data-scarce regime. Evaluate against strong baselines (GPT-4o, DINOv3) and analyze context-aware prompting and contextual interference.

Result: For the visual task, SFT and ICL are complementary; a fine-tuned model guided by context-aware examples achieves Micro-F1 0.728. For the textual task, ICL on a large base model is superior, with Micro-F1 0.847, slightly outperforming a powerful SFT model at 0-shot 0.839. Context-aware prompting enhances performance; a consistent contextual interference phenomenon is observed in fine-tuned models. Baselines GPT-4o and DINOv3 offer strong references.

Conclusion: Specialization strategy should be task-dependent; the benchmark provides a framework for developing science-oriented AI agents, highlighting the need to choose adaptation strategies based on task modality and emphasizing context-aware prompting and awareness of interference effects in fine-tuning.

Abstract: The automation of workflows in advanced microscopy is a key goal where
foundation models like Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
show great potential. However, adapting these general-purpose models for
specialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation
strategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new
multi-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this
benchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies
on a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter
recommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that
the optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT
and ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by
context-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of
0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the
superior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a
powerful "super-expert" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm
the superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual
interference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked
against strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer
key observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our
benchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for
developing more effective science-based agentic systems.

### [43] [ESA: Energy-Based Shot Assembly Optimization for Automatic Video Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02505)
*Yaosen Chen,Wei Wang,Xuming Wen,Han Yang,Yanru Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An energy-based optimization framework for scripted shot assembly that learns from reference videos to automate stylistically coherent sequencing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Editors seek to preserve artistic expression in shot assembly; current AI editing often lacks stylistic fidelity and controllable expressiveness. The work aims to learn and apply reference assembly styles to automate video construction.

Method: 1) Visual-semantic matching between an LLM-generated script and a video library to select candidate shots; 2) segment and label reference videos to extract shot-level attributes (size, camera motion, semantics); 3) train/learn energy-based models to score candidate sequences by alignment with reference styles; 4) combine multiple syntax rules to optimize shot assembly toward the learned style.

Result: Proposes a complete pipeline that automates arrangement and combination of shots according to narrative or artistic style and can learn the assembly style of reference videos, yielding coherent sequences and enabling non-experts to create compelling videos.

Conclusion: Energy-based shot assembly provides a method to democratize stylized video editing by learning from references and applying that style to new footage.

Abstract: Shot assembly is a crucial step in film production and video editing,
involving the sequencing and arrangement of shots to construct a narrative,
convey information, or evoke emotions. Traditionally, this process has been
manually executed by experienced editors. While current intelligent video
editing technologies can handle some automated video editing tasks, they often
fail to capture the creator's unique artistic expression in shot assembly.To
address this challenge, we propose an energy-based optimization method for
video shot assembly. Specifically, we first perform visual-semantic matching
between the script generated by a large language model and a video library to
obtain subsets of candidate shots aligned with the script semantics. Next, we
segment and label the shots from reference videos, extracting attributes such
as shot size, camera motion, and semantics. We then employ energy-based models
to learn from these attributes, scoring candidate shot sequences based on their
alignment with reference styles. Finally, we achieve shot assembly optimization
by combining multiple syntax rules, producing videos that align with the
assembly style of the reference videos. Our method not only automates the
arrangement and combination of independent shots according to specific logic,
narrative requirements, or artistic styles but also learns the assembly style
of reference videos, creating a coherent visual sequence or holistic visual
expression. With our system, even users with no prior video editing experience
can create visually compelling videos. Project page:

### [44] [LiteVoxel: Low-memory Intelligent Thresholding for Efficient Voxel Rasterization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02510)
*Jee Won Lee,Jongseong Brad Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LiteVoxel is a self-tuning SV rasterization pipeline that reduces peak VRAM by ~40-60% and mitigates low-frequency underfitting and boundary instability, while preserving perceptual quality and training efficiency, by combining a low-frequency aware loss, adaptive depth-quantile pruning with EMA-hysteresis, and ray-footprint-based subdivision under a growth budget. Validated on Mip-NeRF 360 and Tanks & Temples.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sparse-voxel rasterization is fast and differentiable for scene reconstruction but tends to underfit low-frequency content, relies on brittle pruning, and can overgrow memory usage. There is a need for a stable, memory-efficient training pipeline that preserves low-frequency detail and perceptual quality.

Method: Low-frequency aware loss via inverse-Sobel reweighting with a mid-training gamma ramp. Adaptive pruning based on depth-quantile on maximum blending weight with EMA-hysteresis guards. Structure refinement via ray-footprint-based, priority-driven subdivision under an explicit growth budget.

Result: Ablations and full-system results on Mip-NeRF 360 (6 scenes) and Tanks & Temples (3 scenes) show reduced low-frequency errors and boundary instability; PSNR/SSIM, training time, and FPS comparable to strong SVRaster. Peak VRAM reduced by ~40-60%, while preserving low-frequency detail and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: LiteVoxel delivers memory-efficient, stable SV rasterization without sacrificing perceptual quality, enabling more predictable training.

Abstract: Sparse-voxel rasterization is a fast, differentiable alternative for
optimization-based scene reconstruction, but it tends to underfit low-frequency
content, depends on brittle pruning heuristics, and can overgrow in ways that
inflate VRAM. We introduce LiteVoxel, a self-tuning training pipeline that
makes SV rasterization both steadier and lighter. Our loss is made
low-frequency aware via an inverse-Sobel reweighting with a mid-training
gamma-ramp, shifting gradient budget to flat regions only after geometry
stabilize. Adaptation replaces fixed thresholds with a depth-quantile pruning
logic on maximum blending weight, stabilized by EMA-hysteresis guards and
refines structure through ray-footprint-based, priority-driven subdivision
under an explicit growth budget. Ablations and full-system results across
Mip-NeRF 360 (6scenes) and Tanks & Temples (3scenes) datasets show mitigation
of errors in low-frequency regions and boundary instability while keeping
PSNR/SSIM, training time, and FPS comparable to a strong SVRaster pipeline.
Crucially, LiteVoxel reduces peak VRAM by ~40%-60% and preserves low-frequency
detail that prior setups miss, enabling more predictable, memory-efficient
training without sacrificing perceptual quality.

### [45] [Unsupervised Learning for Industrial Defect Detection: A Case Study on Shearographic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02541)
*Jessica Plassmann,Nicolas Schuler,Georg von Freymann,Michael Schuth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Unsupervised anomaly detection in shearography using autoencoders and a student–teacher model trained solely on defect-free data; the student–teacher approach yields superior classification robustness and precise localization under realistic deformation, with t-SNE visualization showing better feature separability; YOLOv8 trained on labeled defects provides a reference for localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce reliance on labeled data and expert interpretation in shearographic NDT, enabling scalable, label-efficient detection of subsurface defects under realistic deformation conditions.

Method: Compare three architectures (fully connected autoencoder, convolutional autoencoder, student–teacher feature matching) trained only on defect-free data. Use a controlled dataset with ideal and deformation conditions; define two training subsets (undistorted only vs. including globally deformed data). Evaluate on binary defect classification and, for student–teacher, spatial localization. Visualize feature space with t-SNE and benchmark localization against a YOLOv8 model trained on labeled defects.

Result: Student–teacher model demonstrates superior classification robustness and precise defect localization, with improved feature separability in latent space (as shown by t-SNE). Autoencoder variants perform worse in separation. YOLOv8 serves as a reference for localization quality.

Conclusion: Unsupervised deep learning can enable scalable, label-efficient shearographic inspection in industrial settings, offering robust anomaly detection and localization under realistic deformation, supporting broader adoption of shearography.

Abstract: Shearography is a non-destructive testing method for detecting subsurface
defects, offering high sensitivity and full-field inspection capabilities.
However, its industrial adoption remains limited due to the need for expert
interpretation. To reduce reliance on labeled data and manual evaluation, this
study explores unsupervised learning methods for automated anomaly detection in
shearographic images. Three architectures are evaluated: a fully connected
autoencoder, a convolutional autoencoder, and a student-teacher feature
matching model. All models are trained solely on defect-free data. A controlled
dataset was developed using a custom specimen with reproducible defect
patterns, enabling systematic acquisition of shearographic measurements under
both ideal and realistic deformation conditions. Two training subsets were
defined: one containing only undistorted, defect-free samples, and one
additionally including globally deformed, yet defect-free, data. The latter
simulates practical inspection conditions by incorporating deformation-induced
fringe patterns that may obscure localized anomalies. The models are evaluated
in terms of binary classification and, for the student-teacher model, spatial
defect localization. Results show that the student-teacher approach achieves
superior classification robustness and enables precise localization. Compared
to the autoencoder-based models, it demonstrates improved separability of
feature representations, as visualized through t-SNE embeddings. Additionally,
a YOLOv8 model trained on labeled defect data serves as a reference to
benchmark localization quality. This study underscores the potential of
unsupervised deep learning for scalable, label-efficient shearographic
inspection in industrial environments.

TL;DR: Deep learning can predict future brain MRIs from baseline scans at the voxel level, using multiple architectures, with strong cross-cohort generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Predicting future brain state directly from baseline MRI addresses a core challenge in neuroimaging and offers a path toward individualized prognosis in neurodegenerative diseases, beyond predicting clinical scores.

Method: Evaluates five deep-learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR, Time-Embedding UNet, ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL). The task is image-to-image prediction of follow-up MRIs. Predicted scans are compared to actual follow-ups using global similarity and local-difference metrics. Cross-cohort generalization is tested on an independent external dataset.

Result: Best models achieve high-fidelity follow-up MRI predictions and generalize well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort performance across architectures.

Conclusion: Deep learning enables participant-specific voxel-level MRI prediction several years into the future, offering new opportunities for individualized prognosis in neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: Predicting future brain state from a baseline magnetic resonance image (MRI)
is a central challenge in neuroimaging and has important implications for
studying neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most
existing approaches predict future cognitive scores or clinical outcomes, such
as conversion from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Instead, here we
investigate longitudinal MRI image-to-image prediction that forecasts a
participant's entire brain MRI several years into the future, intrinsically
modeling complex, spatially distributed neurodegenerative patterns. We
implement and evaluate five deep learning architectures (UNet, U2-Net, UNETR,
Time-Embedding UNet, and ODE-UNet) on two longitudinal cohorts (ADNI and AIBL).
Predicted follow-up MRIs are directly compared with the actual follow-up scans
using metrics that capture global similarity and local differences. The best
performing models achieve high-fidelity predictions, and all models generalize
well to an independent external dataset, demonstrating robust cross-cohort
performance. Our results indicate that deep learning can reliably predict
participant-specific brain MRI at the voxel level, offering new opportunities
for individualized prognosis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First public release UVH-26: a large-scale Indian traffic-camera dataset with 26,646 high-resolution images, 1.8 million bounding boxes across 14 India-specific vehicle classes. Ground truth created via consensus (Majority Voting and STAPLE). Trains multiple detectors (YOLO variants, RT-DETR variants, DAMO-YOLO) and shows domain-specific gains over COCO baselines (mAP50:95 improvements; RT-DETR-X achieves 0.67 vs 0.40 for COCO). Demonstrates the value of region-specific data for Indian urban traffic and provides datasets and models (UVH-26-MV and UVH-26-ST).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the lack of representative, high-quality annotated data for Indian traffic scenarios and other emerging nations, where traffic heterogeneity and conditions differ from existing benchmarks (e.g., COCO). The dataset aims to improve object detection, classification, and deployment of intelligent transportation systems in complex urban mobility contexts.

Method: Data collection from 2800 Safe-City CCTV cameras over 4 weeks, yielding 26,646 1080p images. 565 students crowdsourced labeling, resulting in ~1.8 million bounding boxes across 14 Indian vehicle classes. Ground truth consolidated with Majority Voting (MV) and STAPLE. Six fine-tuned models (YOLO variants, RT-DETR variants, DAMO-YOLO variants) trained on UVH-26-MV and UVH-26-ST. Evaluation used mAP50, mAP75, and mAP50:95, focusing on common classes Car, Bus, Truck.

Result: Models trained on UVH-26 show 8.4–31.5% improvements in mAP50:95 over COCO-trained baselines. RT-DETR-X achieves best performance with mAP50:95 of 0.67, compared to 0.40 for COCO-trained weights on common classes. Consensus labeling (MV and ST) provides robust ground truth and the package includes both datasets and six fine-tuned models for each labeling scheme.

Conclusion: UVH-26 fills a critical gap in global benchmarks by capturing the heterogeneity of Indian urban mobility. It provides a foundation for improved detection, classification, and deployment of ITS in emerging nations and enables further research using domain-specific data and models.

Abstract: This report describes the UVH-26 dataset, the first public release by
AIM@IISc of a large-scale dataset of annotated traffic-camera images from
India. The dataset comprises 26,646 high-resolution (1080p) images sampled from
2800 Bengaluru's Safe-City CCTV cameras over a 4-week period, and subsequently
annotated through a crowdsourced hackathon involving 565 college students from
across India. In total, 1.8 million bounding boxes were labeled across 14
vehicle classes specific to India: Cycle, 2-Wheeler (Motorcycle), 3-Wheeler
(Auto-rickshaw), LCV (Light Commercial Vehicles), Van, Tempo-traveller,
Hatchback, Sedan, SUV, MUV, Mini-bus, Bus, Truck and Other. Of these, 283k-316k
consensus ground truth bounding boxes and labels were derived for distinct
objects in the 26k images using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Further,
we train multiple contemporary detectors, including YOLO11-S/X, RT-DETR-S/X,
and DAMO-YOLO-T/L using these datasets, and report accuracy based on mAP50,
mAP75 and mAP50:95. Models trained on UVH-26 achieve 8.4-31.5% improvements in
mAP50:95 over equivalent baseline models trained on COCO dataset, with
RT-DETR-X showing the best performance at 0.67 (mAP50:95) as compared to 0.40
for COCO-trained weights for common classes (Car, Bus, and Truck). This
demonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic
scenarios. The release package provides the 26k images with consensus
annotations based on Majority Voting (UVH-26-MV) and STAPLE (UVH-26-ST) and the
6 fine-tuned YOLO and DETR models on each of these datasets. By capturing the
heterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera
streams, UVH-26 addresses a critical gap in existing global benchmarks, and
offers a foundation for advancing detection, classification, and deployment of
intelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic
conditions.

### [48] [Seeing Across Time and Views: Multi-Temporal Cross-View Learning for Robust Video Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02564)
*Md Rashidunnabi,Kailash A. Hambarde,Vasco Lopes,Joao C. Neves,Hugo Proenca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTF-CVReID is a parameter-efficient seven-module adapter-based framework built on ViT-B/16 for cross-view video person re-ID. It adds about 2M parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs, runs at 189 FPS, and achieves state-of-the-art results on AG-VPReID with good cross-dataset generalization (G2A-VReID, MARS).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the core challenges of video-based person re-identification across cross-view domains: extreme viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies, particularly in aerial-ground surveillance, while maintaining real-time efficiency.

Method: Introduce seven complementary modules—Cross-Stream Feature Normalization (CSFN), Multi-Resolution Feature Harmonization (MRFH), Identity-Aware Memory Module (IAMM), Temporal Dynamics Modeling (TDM), Inter-View Feature Alignment (IVFA), Hierarchical Temporal Pattern Learning (HTPL), and Multi-View Identity Consistency Learning (MVICL)—on a ViT-B/16 backbone. These modules are parameter-efficient adapters designed to correct biases, harmonize scales, reinforce identity traits, model short-term dynamics, align cross-view representations, capture multi-scale temporal patterns, and enforce cross-view identity consistency via contrastive learning.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on AG-VPReID across all altitude levels and shows strong cross-dataset generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS. Maintains real-time efficiency (around 189 FPS) with only ~2M additional parameters and ~0.7 GFLOPs overhead.

Conclusion: Carefully designed adapter-based modules can substantially improve cross-view robustness and temporal consistency in video ReID without sacrificing computational efficiency, as demonstrated by MTF-CVReID. Source code is available. 

Abstract: Video-based person re-identification (ReID) in cross-view domains (for
example, aerial-ground surveillance) remains an open problem because of extreme
viewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies. To address
these challenges, we propose MTF-CVReID, a parameter-efficient framework that
introduces seven complementary modules over a ViT-B/16 backbone. Specifically,
we include: (1) Cross-Stream Feature Normalization (CSFN) to correct camera and
view biases; (2) Multi-Resolution Feature Harmonization (MRFH) for scale
stabilization across altitudes; (3) Identity-Aware Memory Module (IAMM) to
reinforce persistent identity traits; (4) Temporal Dynamics Modeling (TDM) for
motion-aware short-term temporal encoding; (5) Inter-View Feature Alignment
(IVFA) for perspective-invariant representation alignment; (6) Hierarchical
Temporal Pattern Learning (HTPL) to capture multi-scale temporal regularities;
and (7) Multi-View Identity Consistency Learning (MVICL) that enforces
cross-view identity coherence using a contrastive learning paradigm. Despite
adding only about 2 million parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs over the baseline,
MTF-CVReID maintains real-time efficiency (189 FPS) and achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitude
levels, with strong cross-dataset generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS
datasets. These results show that carefully designed adapter-based modules can
substantially enhance cross-view robustness and temporal consistency without
compromising computational efficiency. The source code is available at

### [49] [A Cognitive Process-Inspired Architecture for Subject-Agnostic Brain Visual Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02565)
*Jingyu Lu,Haonan Wang,Qixiang Zhang,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A subject-agnostic brain decoding framework called VCFlow proposes a hierarchical decoding architecture that respects ventral-dorsal visual streams, uses a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to extract subject-invariant representations, and achieves fast, retraining-free video reconstruction with modest accuracy loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable cross-subject brain decoding without subject-specific training by modeling the hierarchical architecture of the visual system and extracting invariant semantic representations, addressing challenges in cross-subject generalization and data efficiency.

Method: VCFlow constructs a hierarchical decoder aligned with early visual cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams to learn multi-dimensional representations. It disentangles features from these streams and uses a feature-level contrastive learning objective to encourage subject-invariant semantic representations. It aims to reconstruct visual experiences (videos) from fMRI without retraining on new subjects and with high efficiency.

Result: The approach achieves fast reconstruction (10 seconds per video) with no retraining and uses only about 7% accuracy loss relative to subject-specific baselines, facilitating scalable, clinically viable subject-agnostic decoding.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling the ventral-dorsal architecture and applying feature-level contrastive learning yields a practical, fast, subject-agnostic brain decoding framework that can generalize to unseen subjects with limited accuracy trade-off.

Abstract: Subject-agnostic brain decoding, which aims to reconstruct continuous visual
experiences from fMRI without subject-specific training, holds great potential
for clinical applications. However, this direction remains underexplored due to
challenges in cross-subject generalization and the complex nature of brain
signals. In this work, we propose Visual Cortex Flow Architecture (VCFlow), a
novel hierarchical decoding framework that explicitly models the ventral-dorsal
architecture of the human visual system to learn multi-dimensional
representations. By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual
cortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary
cognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we
introduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the
extraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing
subject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike
conventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and
heavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\% accuracy on average yet generates
each reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast
and clinically scalable solution. The source code will be released upon
acceptance of the paper.

### [50] [TAUE: Training-free Noise Transplant and Cultivation Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02580)
*Daichi Nagai,Ryugo Morita,Shunsuke Kitada,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free diffusion framework TAUE enables zero-shot, layer-wise image generation by transplanting intermediate latent representations across foreground, background, and composite layers, achieving coherent multi-layer outputs without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcoming the need for dataset-heavy fine-tuning in diffusion-based image generation while enabling layer-wise control for coherent scene composition; existing training-free methods struggle to produce complete, coherent scenes.

Method: Introduce TAUE with Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC). It extracts intermediate latent representations from both the foreground and composite generation processes and transplant them into the initial noise for subsequent layers, enforcing semantic and structural coherence across layers without any training or extra data.

Result: Extensive experiments show the training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned approaches, improving layer-wise consistency while preserving image quality and fidelity.

Conclusion: TAUE eliminates training and dataset requirements and enables novel applications like complex compositional editing, advancing accessible, controllable generative workflows.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of text-to-image diffusion models, their
output of a single, flattened image remains a critical bottleneck for
professional applications requiring layer-wise control. Existing solutions
either rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are
training-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing
to produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the
Training-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a
novel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique,
Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent
representations from both foreground and composite generation processes,
transplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures
semantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite
layers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring
fine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our
training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods,
enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and
fidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but
also unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional
editing, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative
workflows.

*Jan Frederik Meier,Timo Lüddecke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A zero-shot multi-animal tracking approach using Grounding Dino and SAM 2 that generalizes across datasets without retraining; demonstrates robust cross-domain performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Open-world multi-animal tracking is hindered by habitat, motion, and appearance variation requiring dataset-specific fine-tuning. This work investigates whether foundation vision models can enable zero-shot tracking across diverse species and environments.

Method: Combine a Grounding Dino object detector with the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) tracker and introduce task-specific heuristics to form a zero-shot tracking pipeline that requires no retraining or hyperparameter adaptation for new datasets.

Result: Evaluations on ChimpAct, Bird Flock Tracking, AnimalTrack, and a GMOT-40 subset show strong and consistent performance across diverse species and habitats; code is available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: Vision foundation models enable practical zero-shot multi-animal tracking with good generalization across datasets, reducing the need for per-dataset fine-tuning; the approach is readily reusable on new datasets.

Abstract: Multi-animal tracking is crucial for understanding animal ecology and
behavior. However, it remains a challenging task due to variations in habitat,
motion patterns, and species appearance. Traditional approaches typically
require extensive model fine-tuning and heuristic design for each application
scenario. In this work, we explore the potential of recent vision foundation
models for zero-shot multi-animal tracking. By combining a Grounding Dino
object detector with the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) tracker and carefully
designed heuristics, we develop a tracking framework that can be applied to new
datasets without any retraining or hyperparameter adaptation. Evaluations on
ChimpAct, Bird Flock Tracking, AnimalTrack, and a subset of GMOT-40 demonstrate
strong and consistent performance across diverse species and environments. The

*Xu Zhang,Danyang Li,Xiaohang Dong,Tianhao Wu,Hualong Yu,Jianye Wang,Qicheng Li,Xiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniChange is an MLLM-based unified change detection model that handles both binary and semantic change detection using special tokens and textual prompts, enabling learning from multi-source datasets and achieving state-of-the-art IoU on four benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current CD methods are limited to single-type annotated data and cannot effectively leverage diverse binary and semantic change datasets, hindering generalization and versatility.

Method: Integrates generative language capabilities with CD tasks via three tokens ([T1], [T2], [CHANGE]) and text prompts to specify change categories, allowing cross-dataset learning without fixed classification heads.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art IoU on WHU-CD (90.41), S2Looking (53.04), LEVIR-CD+ (78.87), and SECOND (57.62).

Conclusion: Proposes a unified MLLM-based framework for BCD and SCD, enabling multi-source data learning and flexible category specification through prompts; released code.

Abstract: Change detection (CD) is a fundamental task for monitoring and analyzing land
cover dynamics. While recent high performance models and high quality datasets
have significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current
models typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and
cannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic
change detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization
and limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We
leverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop
UniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model. UniChange
integrates generative language abilities with specialized CD functionalities.
Our model successfully unifies both BCD and SCD tasks through the introduction
of three special tokens: [T1], [T2], and [CHANGE]. Furthermore, UniChange
utilizes text prompts to guide the identification of change categories,
eliminating the reliance on predefined classification heads. This design allows
UniChange to effectively acquire knowledge from multi-source datasets, even
when their class definitions conflict. Experiments on four public benchmarks
(WHU-CD, S2Looking, LEVIR-CD+, and SECOND) demonstrate SOTA performance,
achieving IoU scores of 90.41, 53.04, 78.87, and 57.62, respectively,
surpassing all previous methods. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Light-weight CNN-based liveness detector for face recognition to defend against print/display, video, and wrap spoof attacks; introduces a new 2D spoof dataset (~500 videos, 60 subjects); claims CPU real-time liveness (1-2s) and a demo video.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate presentation attacks on FR systems; need fast, low-resource, and diverse datasets for 2D spoof types.

Method: Proposes a light-weight CNN architecture for multi-type spoof detection; seamless liveness detection; evaluation on new 2D spoof dataset; demonstration video.

Result: Demonstrates effective spoof detection and real-time performance; introduces dataset.

Conclusion: Offers a practical liveness detection solution and contributes a dataset; further validation on broader datasets and adversarial scenarios suggested.

Abstract: Biometric technologies are widely adopted in security, legal, and financial
systems. Face recognition can authenticate a person based on the unique facial
features such as shape and texture. However, recent works have demonstrated the
vulnerability of Face Recognition Systems (FRS) towards presentation attacks.
Using spoofing (aka.,presentation attacks), a malicious actor can get
illegitimate access to secure systems. This paper proposes a novel light-weight
CNN framework to identify print/display, video and wrap attacks. The proposed
robust architecture provides seamless liveness detection ensuring faster
biometric authentication (1-2 seconds on CPU). Further, this also presents a
newly created 2D spoof attack dataset consisting of more than 500 videos
collected from 60 subjects. To validate the effectiveness of this architecture,
we provide a demonstration video depicting print/display, video and wrap attack
detection approaches. The demo can be viewed in the following link:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPruneBench is a unified benchmark for visual token pruning in large multimodal models. It standardizes evaluation across six ability dimensions, ten datasets, ten pruning methods, and three LMM families, while also reporting system metrics like runtime and prefilling latency. Key findings: random pruning is strong; no single method dominates; pruning sensitivity varies by task (OCR most vulnerable); pruning ratio largely drives performance loss.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the inefficiency and fragmented evaluation in multimodal LMMs caused by large visual token counts from image encoders. There is a need for a unified, extensible benchmark with standardized protocols and system-level metrics to fairly compare visual token pruning methods.

Method: Introduce UniPruneBench with standardized protocols across six ability dimensions and ten datasets, covering ten compression algorithms and three LMM families (LLaVA-v1.5, Intern-VL3, Qwen2.5-VL). Include not only task accuracy but system-level metrics such as runtime and prefilling latency to provide a holistic view.

Result: Experiments reveal: (1) random pruning is a surprisingly strong baseline, (2) no single method consistently outperforms others across scenarios, (3) pruning sensitivity varies across tasks, OCR being most vulnerable, and (4) pruning ratio is the dominant factor governing performance degradation.

Conclusion: UniPruneBench provides a reliable, standardized foundation for evaluating efficient multimodal modeling and will guide future research in this area.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) often suffer from severe inference
inefficiency due to the large number of visual tokens introduced by image
encoders. While recent token compression methods, such as pruning and merging,
have shown promise in reducing redundancy, their evaluation remains fragmented
and inconsistent. In this work, we present UniPruneBench, a unified and
extensible benchmark for visual token pruning in multimodal LLMs. UniPruneBench
provides standardized protocols across six ability dimensions and ten datasets,
covering ten representative compression algorithms and three families of LMMs
(LLaVA-v1.5, Intern-VL3, and Qwen2.5-VL). Beyond task accuracy, it incorporates
system-level metrics such as runtime and prefilling latency to provide a
holistic view. Our experiments uncover several key findings: (1) random pruning
is a surprisingly strong baseline, (2) no single method consistently
outperforms others across scenarios, (3) pruning sensitivity varies
significantly across tasks, with OCR being most vulnerable, and (4) pruning
ratio is the dominant factor governing performance degradation. We believe
UniPruneBench will serve as a reliable foundation for future research on
efficient multimodal modeling.

*Marius Aasan,Martine Hjelkrem-Tan,Nico Catalano,Changkyu Choi,Adín Ramírez Rivera*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A differentiable, content-adaptive tokenizer for Vision Transformers (ViTs) that preserves compatibility with existing models, enabling pixel-level tokenization, dense prediction, and raster-to-vector conversion via hierarchical model selection guided by information criteria.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Patch-based ViTs ignore spatial and semantic structure and rely on fixed tokens; there is a need for adaptive, end-to-end tokenization that respects image content while remaining compatible with pretrained architectures, enabling dense predictions and vectorization.

Method: Introduce an end-to-end differentiable tokenizer that adapts to image content at pixel-level granularity and remains backward-compatible with existing ViT architectures. Use hierarchical model selection guided by information criteria to choose appropriate tokenization granularity and model complexity. Supports image-level classification, dense prediction, and raster-to-vector conversion out-of-the-box.

Result: Demonstrates competitive performance for image-level classification and dense-prediction tasks and enables raster-to-vector conversion without major architectural changes, indicating the tokenizer's effectiveness and compatibility.

Conclusion: End-to-end, content-adaptive tokenization with hierarchical model selection can match or exceed fixed-token ViTs while enabling additional capabilities like raster-to-vector conversion, and it remains easy to retrofit pretrained models.

Abstract: Vision Transformers rely on fixed patch tokens that ignore the spatial and
semantic structure of images. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end
differentiable tokenizer that adapts to image content with pixel-level
granularity while remaining backward-compatible with existing architectures for
retrofitting pretrained models. Our method uses hierarchical model selection
with information criteria to provide competitive performance in both
image-level classification and dense-prediction tasks, and even supports
out-of-the-box raster-to-vector conversion.

*Chao Yuan,Zanwu Liu,Guiwei Zhang,Haoxuan Xu,Yujian Zhao,Guanglin Niu,Bo Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A VI-ReID framework (MTRL) that uses a middle generated image to bridge visible and infrared modalities, with modality-transition contrastive and modality-query losses; claims no extra parameters and achieves SOTA performance on three VI-ReID datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a large cross-modal gap between visible and infrared data in VI-ReID. Existing methods rely on intermediate representations (image-level or feature-level) that are data-hungry, hard to interpret, or add parameters. A more direct, interpretable bridge and effective alignment is needed.

Method: Introduce Modality-Transition Representation Learning (MTRL) with a middle generated image that acts as a transmitter from visible to infrared, aligned with visible and similar to infrared. Train with modality-transition contrastive loss and modality-query regularization loss. No extra parameters; inference speed matches backbone.

Result: Empirical results show significant and consistent improvement over SOTA on three VI-ReID datasets.

Conclusion: MTRL provides an effective, parameter-efficient bridge for cross-modal alignment in VI-ReID, enabling stronger cross-modal representations without increasing model complexity.

Abstract: Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) technique could associate
the pedestrian images across visible and infrared modalities in the practical
scenarios of background illumination changes. However, a substantial gap
inherently exists between these two modalities. Besides, existing methods
primarily rely on intermediate representations to align cross-modal features of
the same person. The intermediate feature representations are usually create by
generating intermediate images (kind of data enhancement), or fusing
intermediate features (more parameters, lack of interpretability), and they do
not make good use of the intermediate features. Thus, we propose a novel
VI-ReID framework via Modality-Transition Representation Learning (MTRL) with a
middle generated image as a transmitter from visible to infrared modals, which
are fully aligned with the original visible images and similar to the infrared
modality. After that, using a modality-transition contrastive loss and a
modality-query regularization loss for training, which could align the
cross-modal features more effectively. Notably, our proposed framework does not
need any additional parameters, which achieves the same inference speed to the
backbone while improving its performance on VI-ReID task. Extensive
experimental results illustrate that our model significantly and consistently
outperforms existing SOTAs on three typical VI-ReID datasets.

TL;DR: Affective cues-guided reasoning with VidEmo foundation models and Emo-CFG dataset for emotion understanding in videos; two-stage tuning improves reasoning and instruction-following, achieving competitive results across 15 tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Emotions are dynamic and cues-dependent, making it hard to understand evolving emotional states with rationale; existing methods struggle to reason about complex emotions in video data.

Method: Propose a VidEmo video emotion foundation model designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. Use a two-stage tuning pipeline: (1) curriculum emotion learning to inject emotion knowledge, (2) affective-tree reinforcement learning for emotion reasoning. Build a foundational data infrastructure and an emotion-centric fine-grained dataset Emo-CFG with 2.1M instruction-based samples, including explainable QA, fine-grained captions, and rationales.

Result: Experimental results show competitive performance, achieving a new milestone across 15 face perception tasks.

Conclusion: The framework unifies attribute perception, expression analysis, and high-level emotional understanding in a stage-wise approach, leveraging VidEmo and Emo-CFG to advance emotion reasoning and instruction-following in video analysis.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting emotion from videos has gathered significant
attention in recent studies, driven by advancements in video large language
models (VideoLLMs). While advanced methods have made progress in video emotion
analysis, the intrinsic nature of emotions poses significant challenges.
Emotions are characterized by dynamic and cues-dependent properties, making it
difficult to understand complex and evolving emotional states with reasonable
rationale. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel affective cues-guided
reasoning framework that unifies fundamental attribute perception, expression
analysis, and high-level emotional understanding in a stage-wise manner. At the
core of our approach is a family of video emotion foundation models (VidEmo),
specifically designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. These
models undergo a two-stage tuning process: first, curriculum emotion learning
for injecting emotion knowledge, followed by affective-tree reinforcement
learning for emotion reasoning. Moreover, we establish a foundational data
infrastructure and introduce a emotion-centric fine-grained dataset (Emo-CFG)
consisting of 2.1M diverse instruction-based samples. Emo-CFG includes
explainable emotional question-answering, fine-grained captions, and associated
rationales, providing essential resources for advancing emotion understanding
tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive
performance, setting a new milestone across 15 face perception tasks.

*Vojtěch Kůr,Adam Bajger,Adam Kukučka,Marek Hradil,Vít Musil,Tomáš Brázdil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A modular pipeline called LLEXICORP combines concept relevance propagation (CRP) with a multimodal large language model to automatically name concept prototypes and generate faithful, audience-tailored natural-language explanations of CNN decisions, reducing manual effort and potentially increasing transparency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CRP-based explanations are currently manual and time-consuming: experts must inspect activation maps to name concepts and craft explanations, limiting scalability and accessibility. Integrating LLMs aims to automate naming and explanation while preserving faithfulness.

Method: The approach links CRP-derived concept channels from CNNs (e.g., top-layer channels) to a multimodal LLM. It automatically assigns descriptive names to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that translate relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. Prompts are crafted to teach the LLM CRP semantics, enforce a separation between naming and explaining, and produce audience-specific text. The system is designed to be flexible and modular, allowing low-level technical details for experts and high-level summaries for non-technical stakeholders.

Result: Qualitative evaluation on ImageNet images using a VGG16 model. The findings suggest that combining concept-based attribution with LLMs can significantly lower barriers to interpreting deep neural networks and improve accessibility of explanations.

Conclusion: Integrating concept-based attribution with large language models promises more transparent AI systems by making CRP explanations easier to understand and tailored to different audiences, potentially broadening the adoption of XAI in various applications.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) underpin many modern computer vision
systems. With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to
explain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works
suggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be
attributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance
propagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find
images that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are
largely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered
concepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting
the accessibility of the explanations and their scalability.
  To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept
Relevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a
multimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive
names to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that
translate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To
ensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the
semantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and
explanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences,
offering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries
for non-technical stakeholders.
  We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a
VGG16 model. Our findings suggest that integrating concept-based attribution
methods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to
interpreting deep neural networks, paving the way for more transparent AI
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First large-scale study of video-text representation alignment. Shows that test-time data richness and proposed parametric scaling laws govern cross-modal alignment, which correlates with downstream task performance and offers a zero-shot diagnostic for video encoders.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how well modern video and language encoders align across modalities, considering the temporal dimension of video, and to explore whether alignment correlates with downstream capabilities.

Method: Empirical analysis using state-of-the-art video and language encoders. Systematically vary test-time data richness (static images vs. multi-frame videos; single caption vs. caption collections), derive parametric test-time scaling laws, and assess correlations between semantic alignment and downstream task performance (semantic and non-semantic) as well as temporal reasoning.

Result: Found that cross-modal alignment strongly depends on data richness at test time; scaling laws accurately predict alignment behavior; stronger alignment with text encoders links to more general-purpose video representations; temporal reasoning correlates with alignment; video-text alignment serves as a zero-shot probe for spatio-temporal encoder power.

Conclusion: Video-text alignment provides a valuable diagnostic tool for evaluating and understanding spatio-temporal encoders. The work highlights the importance of test-time data richness and proposes scaling laws to predict alignment, with broader implications for video-language model development.

Abstract: The alignment of representations from different modalities has recently been
shown to provide insights on the structural similarities and downstream
capabilities of different encoders across diverse data types. While significant
progress has been made in aligning images with text, the temporal nature of
video data remains largely unexplored in this context. In this work, we conduct
the first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, probing
the capabilities of modern video and language encoders. Our findings reveal
several key insights. First, we demonstrate that cross-modal alignment highly
depends on the richness of both visual (static images vs. multi-frame videos)
and text (single caption vs. a collection) data provided at test time,
especially when using state-of-the-art video encoders. We propose parametric
test-time scaling laws that capture this behavior and show remarkable
predictive power against empirical observations. Secondly, we investigate the
correlation between semantic alignment and performance on both semantic and
non-semantic downstream tasks, providing initial evidence that strong alignment
against text encoders may be linked to general-purpose video representation and
understanding. Finally, we correlate temporal reasoning with cross-modal
alignment providing a challenging test-bed for vision and language models.
Overall, our work introduces video-text alignment as an informative zero-shot
way to probe the representation power of different encoders for spatio-temporal
data. Project page can be found at https://video-prh.github.io/

TL;DR: PercHead delivers a unified single-image 3D head reconstruction framework with a swing to semantic 3D editing, achieving state-of-the-art novel-view synthesis and robust extreme-view performance, and enabling editing by geometry-segmentation and appearance prompts via a lightweight GUI.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing 3D heads from a single image is highly challenging due to view occlusions, weak perceptual supervision, and ambiguity in editing in 3D space. A unified base model that supports both accurate reconstruction and intuitive semantic editing could streamline 3D head applications and improve fidelity across views.

Method: A dual-branch encoder with a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based decoder lifts 2D features into 3D space via iterative cross-attention. Rendering uses Gaussian Splatting. Perceptual supervision leverages DINOv2 and SAM2.1 to provide rich signals for both geometry and appearance. The base model can be adapted for semantic 3D editing by swapping the encoder and fine-tuning, disentangling geometry (segmentation map) from appearance (text prompt or reference image). An interactive GUI enables geometry sculpting via segmentation maps and appearance customization through prompts or images.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis and shows exceptional robustness to extreme viewing angles compared with baselines. It also enables intuitive 3D editing by decoupling geometry and appearance, demonstrated through a lightweight GUI and flexible input modalities.

Conclusion: PercHead presents a robust, extensible framework for single-image 3D head reconstruction and semantic editing, combining strong perceptual supervision with a flexible editing pipeline that can be guided by segmentation maps and natural language or image prompts.

Abstract: We present PercHead, a method for single-image 3D head reconstruction and
semantic 3D editing - two tasks that are inherently challenging due to severe
view occlusions, weak perceptual supervision, and the ambiguity of editing in
3D space. We develop a unified base model for reconstructing view-consistent 3D
heads from a single input image. The model employs a dual-branch encoder
followed by a ViT-based decoder that lifts 2D features into 3D space through
iterative cross-attention. Rendering is performed using Gaussian Splatting. At
the heart of our approach is a novel perceptual supervision strategy based on
DINOv2 and SAM2.1, which provides rich, generalized signals for both geometric
and appearance fidelity. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in
novel-view synthesis and, furthermore, exhibits exceptional robustness to
extreme viewing angles compared to established baselines. Furthermore, this
base model can be seamlessly extended for semantic 3D editing by swapping the
encoder and finetuning the network. In this variant, we disentangle geometry
and style through two distinct input modalities: a segmentation map to control
geometry and either a text prompt or a reference image to specify appearance.
We highlight the intuitive and powerful 3D editing capabilities of our model
through a lightweight, interactive GUI, where users can effortlessly sculpt
geometry by drawing segmentation maps and stylize appearance via natural
language or image prompts.

### [61] [VCode: a Multimodal Coding Benchmark with SVG as Symbolic Visual Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02778)
*Kevin Qinghong Lin,Yuhao Zheng,Hangyu Ran,Dantong Zhu,Dongxing Mao,Linjie Li,Philip Torr,Alex Jinpeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVG-based coding (VCode) benchmarks visual-symbolic reasoning by generating SVG from images, evaluated via CodeVQA and improved by the VCoder agentic framework; results show substantial gains but remaining gaps in professional/3D reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between language-centric coding and visual-centric reasoning by using SVG as a compact, interpretable, executable visual representation and measuring fidelity of symbolic preservation across domains.

Method: Introduce VCode benchmark across three domains (MM-Vet, MMMU, CV-Bench); develop CodeVQA evaluation protocol that answers questions over rendered SVGs; propose VCoder with Thinking with Revision and Acting with Visual Tools; conduct cross-domain experiments and human studies; release code and benchmark.

Result: Frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs; VCoder yields a 12.3-point overall gain over Claude-4-Opus; results indicate strong overall reasoning but weaknesses in professional knowledge and 3D reasoning; human studies show poorer performance on rendered SVGs but reveal the promise of symbolic visual representations.

Conclusion: SVG-based symbolic visual representations are promising for reasoning and action; agentic augmentation can close part of the gap with language-centric models but gaps remain; benchmark and code are publicly available for broader evaluation.

Abstract: Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action
in the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks
such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding
underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG
code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We
introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code
generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic
meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general
commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric
perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel
evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered
SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically,
frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap
between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we
introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i)
Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines
SVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply
structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic
capacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities
score well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D
reasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing
Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on
rendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual
representation. The benchmark and code are available at
https://github.com/CSU-JPG/VCode.

### [62] [When Visualizing is the First Step to Reasoning: MIRA, a Benchmark for Visual Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02779)
*Yiyang Zhou,Haoqin Tu,Zijun Wang,Zeyu Wang,Niklas Muennighoff,Fan Nie,Yejin Choi,James Zou,Chaorui Deng,Shen Yan,Haoqi Fan,Cihang Xie,Huaxiu Yao,Qinghao Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIRA is a benchmark that requires intermediate visual generation for reasoning, showing that imagined visuals significantly boost multimodal LLMs' performance versus text-only prompts, with a ~33.7% relative gain; Visual-CoT is crucial and text prompts alone have limited impact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To push multimodal reasoning beyond text-only chain-of-thought by forcing models to generate and use intermediate visuals (e.g., sketches, diagrams) to solve complex problems, mirroring how humans reason through drawing.

Method: Introduce MIRA with 546 multimodal problems annotated with intermediate images and final answers. Propose a unified evaluation protocol with three input modes: direct input (image+question), text-only CoT input (image+thinking prompts), and Visual-CoT input (annotated image cues+thinking prompts). Report pass@k and majority voting across k; analyze upper bound by expanding search space and textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT.

Result: Existing multimodal LLMs perform poorly with text-only prompts; providing intermediate visual cues yields consistent performance gains, averaging 33.7% relative improvement across models/tasks. Expanding search space or using purely textual prompts yields limited improvements compared to Visual-CoT.

Conclusion: Imagined/annotated visual information is critical for successful reasoning on MIRA. The benchmark demonstrates the need for intermediate visuals in multimodal reasoning tasks and suggests that current models benefit substantially from visual cues, while textual-only strategies have limited upside.

Abstract: We propose MIRA, a new benchmark designed to evaluate models in scenarios
where generating intermediate visual images is essential for successful
reasoning. Unlike traditional CoT methods that rely solely on text, tasks in
MIRA require models to generate and utilize intermediate images - such as
sketches, structural diagrams, or path drawings - to guide their reasoning
process. This setup closely mirrors how humans solve complex problems through
"drawing to think". To solve this, MIRA focuses on tasks that are intrinsically
challenging and involve complex structures, spatial relationships, or reasoning
steps that are difficult to express through language alone. To ensure that our
evaluation data is of high-quality, we include 546 multimodal problems,
annotated with intermediate visual images and final answers. We also propose a
unified evaluation protocol for MIRA that spans three levels of evaluation
input: direct input with image and question only, text-only CoT input with
image and thinking prompts, and Visual-CoT input with both annotated image
clues and textual thinking prompts. To probe the upper bound of model capacity
on our benchmark, we also report pass@k and majority voting accuracies under
different k settings. Experimental results show that existing multimodal large
language models, including strongest private models as well as strong
open-weight models, perform poorly when relying solely on textual prompts.
However, when intermediate visual cues are provided, model performance improves
consistently, yielding an average relative gain of 33.7% across all models and
tasks. We also probe the upper bound by expanding the search space and
designing textual prompts aligned with Visual-CoT, but both yield only limited
improvements compared to our Visual-CoT setting. These results underscore the
critical role of imagined visual information in enabling successful reasoning
on MIRA.

*Nusrat Tasnim,Kutub Uddin,Khalid Mahmood Malik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a unified benchmarking framework to evaluate state-of-the-art multimedia forensics across GAN/diffusion-generated data, revealing generalization gaps and emphasizing explainability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standardize benchmarks, training protocols, and metrics to enable fair comparisons and robust deployment in security-critical applications amid AI-generated misinformation.

Method: Developed a unified benchmarking framework; benchmarked ten SOTA forensic methods in scratch, frozen, and fine-tuned settings across seven public GAN/diffusion datasets; assessed multiple metrics and interpretability.

Result: Found substantial variability in generalization; in-distribution performance does not guarantee cross-model transferability; confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps reveal explainability aspects; results inform robustness and generalization gaps.

Conclusion: The framework guides future research toward robust, generalizable, and explainable forensic solutions and provides a reproducible baseline for fair comparison.

Abstract: The threats posed by AI-generated media, particularly deepfakes, are now
raising significant challenges for multimedia forensics, misinformation
detection, and biometric system resulting in erosion of public trust in the
legal system, significant increase in frauds, and social engineering attacks.
Although several forensic methods have been proposed, they suffer from three
critical gaps: (i) use of non-standardized benchmarks with GAN- or
diffusion-generated images, (ii) inconsistent training protocols (e.g.,
scratch, frozen, fine-tuning), and (iii) limited evaluation metrics that fail
to capture generalization and explainability. These limitations hinder fair
comparison, obscure true robustness, and restrict deployment in
security-critical applications. This paper introduces a unified benchmarking
framework for systematic evaluation of forensic methods under controlled and
reproducible conditions. We benchmark ten SoTA forensic methods (scratch,
frozen, and fine-tuned) and seven publicly available datasets (GAN and
diffusion) to perform extensive and systematic evaluations. We evaluate
performance using multiple metrics, including accuracy, average precision,
ROC-AUC, error rate, and class-wise sensitivity. We also further analyze model
interpretability using confidence curves and Grad-CAM heatmaps. Our evaluations
demonstrate substantial variability in generalization, with certain methods
exhibiting strong in-distribution performance but degraded cross-model
transferability. This study aims to guide the research community toward a
deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of current forensic
approaches, and to inspire the development of more robust, generalizable, and
explainable solutions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PLUTO-4 introduces frontier-scale pathology foundation models (PLUTO-4S and PLUTO-4G) pretrained with DINOv2 on a 551k WSI multi-institution corpus, achieving SOTA across patch, segmentation, and slide-level tasks, with strong throughput for PLUTO-4S and a notable 11% improvement in dermatopathology for PLUTO-4G.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To advance pathology foundation models to frontier scale, delivering robust transfer across diverse histopathology tasks and enabling real-world deployment as a backbone for translational research and diagnostics.

Method: Two ViT-based architectures: PLUTO-4S (compact, efficient, FlexiViT with 2D-RoPE embeddings) for multi-scale deployment) and PLUTO-4G (frontier-scale, single patch size). Pretrained with a self-supervised objective derived from DINOv2 on a large multi-institutional corpus of 551,164 WSIs from 137,144 patients across 50+ institutions, 60 disease types, and 100 stains. Evaluation on public/internal benchmarks for patch-level classification, segmentation, and slide-level diagnosis.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across tasks requiring varying spatial and biological context. PLUTO-4S provides high-throughput robustness for practical deployment; PLUTO-4G sets new performance frontiers across multiple benchmarks, including an 11% improvement in dermatopathology diagnosis.

Conclusion: PLUTO-4 demonstrates the potential to transform real-world translational research and diagnostic applications by serving as a powerful backbone for diverse pathology tasks.

Abstract: Foundation models trained on large-scale pathology image corpora have
demonstrated strong transfer capabilities across diverse histopathology tasks.
Building on this progress, we introduce PLUTO-4, our next generation of
pathology foundation models that extend the Pathology-Universal Transformer
(PLUTO) to frontier scale. We share two complementary Vision Transformer
architectures in the PLUTO-4 family: a compact and efficient PLUTO-4S model
optimized for multi-scale deployment using a FlexiViT setup with 2D-RoPE
embeddings, and a frontier-scale PLUTO-4G model trained with a single patch
size to maximize representation capacity and stability. Both models are
pretrained using a self-supervised objective derived from DINOv2 on a large
multi-institutional corpus containing 551,164 WSIs from 137,144 patients across
over 50 institutions, spanning over 60 disease types and over 100 stains.
Comprehensive evaluation across public and internal benchmarks demonstrates
that PLUTO-4 achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks requiring varying
spatial and biological context, including patch-level classification,
segmentation, and slide-level diagnosis. The compact PLUTO-4S provides
high-throughput and robust performance for practical deployment, while PLUTO-4G
establishes new performance frontiers across multiple pathology benchmarks,
including an 11% improvement in dermatopathology diagnosis. These diverse
improvements underscore PLUTO-4's potential to transform real-world
applications as a backbone for translational research and diagnostic use cases.

### [65] [Densemarks: Learning Canonical Embeddings for Human Heads Images via Point Tracks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02830)
*Dmitrii Pozdeev,Alexey Artemov,Ananta R. Bhattarai,Artem Sevastopolsky*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DenseMarks introduces a learned, dense, per-pixel 3D embedding for head images that maps to a canonical unit cube, enabling robust dense correspondences across poses and identities. It uses a Vision Transformer to predict 3D embeddings per pixel, trained with pairwise matches via contrastive loss, plus multitask constraints (landmarks, segmentation) and latent cube features to ensure spatial continuity and a consistent canonical space. It achieves state-of-the-art geometry-aware point matching and monocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models, and will release code and checkpoints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task requires robust, dense, pose-invariant head representations that enable dense correspondences across varied identities, expressions, and hair. Existing methods struggle with full-head coverage and pose variation. A learned, canonical, dense representation promises improved tracking, matching, and reconstruction by providing an interpretable space that is consistent across individuals and poses.

Method: A Vision Transformer predicts a 3D embedding per image pixel, mapping to a location in a 3D canonical unit cube. Training uses a dataset of pairwise point matches estimated by a state-of-the-art tracker from diverse in-the-wild talking-head videos, optimized with a contrastive loss to bring embeddings of matched points closer. Multi-task learning with face landmarks and segmentation constraints, plus latent cube features to enforce spatial continuity, create an interpretable canonical space and a bottleneck that enforces cross-pose/identity consistency.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometry-aware point matching and monocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models, demonstrating robustness to pose and coverage of the full head including hair.

Conclusion: DenseMarks provides a robust, interpretable dense head representation that enables dense correspondences and supports downstream tasks such as tracking and stereo reconstruction; code and model checkpoints will be publicly released.

Abstract: We propose DenseMarks - a new learned representation for human heads,
enabling high-quality dense correspondences of human head images. For a 2D
image of a human head, a Vision Transformer network predicts a 3D embedding for
each pixel, which corresponds to a location in a 3D canonical unit cube. In
order to train our network, we collect a dataset of pairwise point matches,
estimated by a state-of-the-art point tracker over a collection of diverse
in-the-wild talking heads videos, and guide the mapping via a contrastive loss,
encouraging matched points to have close embeddings. We further employ
multi-task learning with face landmarks and segmentation constraints, as well
as imposing spatial continuity of embeddings through latent cube features,
which results in an interpretable and queryable canonical space. The
representation can be used for finding common semantic parts, face/head
tracking, and stereo reconstruction. Due to the strong supervision, our method
is robust to pose variations and covers the entire head, including hair.
Additionally, the canonical space bottleneck makes sure the obtained
representations are consistent across diverse poses and individuals. We
demonstrate state-of-the-art results in geometry-aware point matching and
monocular head tracking with 3D Morphable Models. The code and the model
checkpoint will be made available to the public.

### [66] [MCHex: Marching Cubes Based Adaptive Hexahedral Mesh Generation with Guaranteed Positive Jacobian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02064)
*Hua Tong,Yongjie Jessica Zhang*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Replace RO with a Marching Cubes-based MCHex to build an adaptive hex mesh around a triangle boundary; with the same computational budget, MCHex improves boundary metrics (IoU up, HR down) and maintains a lower, but positive, minimum scaled Jacobian (still >0 versus RO's >0.48).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve boundary fidelity for triangle-boundary meshes in grid-based methods and overcome the lack of guaranteed improvements from the conventional outside elements removal (RO) plus projection approach, while keeping a favorable mesh quality under a fixed computational budget.

Method: Introduce MCHex, a Marching Cubes-based approach that replaces RO. With the same computational budget (using a precomputed Signed Distance Field to dominate runtime), construct a boundary-adaptive hexahedral tessellation around the input triangle boundary and evaluate IoU and Hausdorff distance ratio (HR) relative to the bounding box diagonal; ensure a positive minimum scaled Jacobian.

Result: MCHex yields better boundary approximation (higher IoU and lower HR) compared to RO; it guarantees a lower, yet still positive, minimum scaled Jacobian (>0 vs. RO's >0.48).

Conclusion: The MCHex approach improves boundary fidelity under a fixed budget while maintaining mesh quality, outperforming the conventional RO-based method.

Abstract: Constructing an adaptive hexahedral tessellation to fit an input triangle
boundary is a key challenge in grid-based methods. The conventional method
first removes outside elements (RO) and then projects the axis-aligned boundary
onto the input triangle boundary, which has no guarantee on improving the
initial Intersection over Union (IoU) and Hausdorff distance ratio (HR, w.r.t
bounding box diagonal). The proposed MCHex approach replaces RO with a Marching
Cubes method MCHex. Given the same computational budget (benchmarked using an
identical precomputed Signed Distance Field, which dominates the runtime),
MCHex provides better boundary approximation (higher IoU and lower HR) while
guaranteeing a lower, yet still positive, minimum scaled Jacobian (>0 vs. RO's
>0.48).

TL;DR: TRACE introduces textual reasoning for affordance coordinate extraction in vision-language models for robotics, improving W2P accuracy and interpretability; includes TRACE dataset and data-driven ablations; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between high-level instructions and precise spatial actions in VLMs, reducing reliance on expensive visual chain-of-thought by leveraging textual chain-of-reasoning to externalize spatial planning.

Method: Create TRACE dataset via autonomous pipeline pairing instructions with explicit textual rationales; fine-tune a VLM to generate a textual CoR before acting, enabling explicit externalized reasoning; analyze attention maps and perform ablations to assess data-driven gains.

Result: Achieves 48.1% accuracy on the Where2Place benchmark (9.6% relative improvement) and 55.0% on W2P(h); ablations show performance scales with the amount of reasoning data; attention analyses suggest interpretable, step-wise reasoning.

Conclusion: Training VLMs to emit textual CoR before action is an effective, robust approach to improve precision, reliability, and interpretability in robot control; TRACE dataset and code are released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to translate high-level instructions
into the precise spatial affordances required for robotic manipulation. While
visual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods exist, they are often computationally
intensive. In this work, we introduce TRACE (Textual Reasoning for Affordance
Coordinate Extraction), a novel methodology that integrates a textual Chain of
Reasoning (CoR) into the affordance prediction process. We use this methodology
to create the TRACE dataset, a large-scale collection created via an autonomous
pipeline that pairs instructions with explicit textual rationales. By
fine-tuning a VLM on this data, our model learns to externalize its spatial
reasoning before acting. Our experiments show that our TRACE-tuned model
achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 48.1% accuracy on the primary
Where2Place (W2P) benchmark (a 9.6% relative improvement) and 55.0% on the more
challenging W2P(h) subset. Crucially, an ablation study demonstrates that
performance scales directly with the amount of reasoning data used, confirming
the CoR's effectiveness. Furthermore, analysis of the model's attention maps
reveals an interpretable reasoning process where focus shifts dynamically
across reasoning steps. This work shows that training VLMs to generate a
textual CoR is an effective and robust strategy for enhancing the precision,
reliability, and interpretability of VLM-based robot control. Our dataset and
code are available at https://github.com/jink-ucla/TRACE

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes SOPPI: Stein-optimized MPPI using SVGD to adapt trajectory sampling; shows improved performance over standard MPPI in Cart-Pole and 2D walking, with lower particle counts and modest overhead; suggests applicability to higher-DoF systems and differentiable simulators.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPPI relies on randomly sampled (often Gaussian) trajectories, which can under-represent the space of possible trajectories and yield suboptimal results. There is a need for an adaptive, efficient sampling strategy that focuses sampling effort on promising regions.

Method: Introduce SVGD updates between MPPI environment steps to dynamically reshape the noise distribution used for sampling, forming Stein-Optimized Path-Integral Inference (SOPPI), an MPPI/SVGD algorithm with runtime noise adaptation; validate on Cart-Pole and a 2D bipedal walker across hyper-parameters and particle counts.

Result: The SOPPI method yields improved performance over standard MPPI across a range of hyper-parameters and works even with lower particle counts; demonstrated on Cart-Pole and a 2D bipedal walking task, indicating practical efficacy and robustness.

Conclusion: MPPI/SVGD extends MPPI to higher-DoF systems and differentiable simulators, enabling adaptive, data-efficient sampling that can influence future developments in differentiable control and simulation-based planning.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)
control that optimizes sample generation towards an optimal trajectory through
Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD). MPPI is traditionally reliant on
randomly sampled trajectories, often by a Gaussian distribution. The result can
lead to sample deprivation, under-representing the space of possible
trajectories, and yield suboptimal results. Through introducing SVGD updates in
between MPPI environment steps, we present Stein-Optimized Path-Integral
Inference (SOPPI), an MPPI/SVGD algorithm that can dynamically update noise
distributions at runtime to shape a more optimal representation without an
excessive increase in computational requirements. We demonstrate the efficacy
of our method systems ranging from a Cart-Pole to a two-dimensional bipedal
walking task, indicating improved performance above standard MPPI across a
range of hyper-parameters and demonstrate feasibility at lower particle counts.
We discuss the applicability of this MPPI/SVGD method to higher
degree-of-freedom systems, as well as its potential to new developments in
state-of-the-art differentiable simulators.

*Parsa Hosseininejad,Kimia Khabiri,Shishir Gopinath,Soudabeh Mohammadhashemi,Karthik Dantu,Steven Y. Ko*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TurboMap is a GPU-accelerated local mapping module for visual SLAM (built on ORB-SLAM3) that offloads map point triangulation and fusion to GPU, accelerates keyframe culling on CPU, and uses a GPU-based local BA solver to achieve 1.3x (EuRoC) and 1.6x (TUM-VI) speedups without sacrificing accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Local mapping is a bottleneck in visual SLAM, especially on heterogeneous hardware. There is a need to leverage GPU for parallelizable tasks while keeping CPU tasks efficient, to achieve real-time performance on desktops and embedded platforms.

Method: Offload map point triangulation and fusion to CUDA kernels; accelerate redundant keyframe culling on CPU; integrate a GPU-accelerated solver for local bundle adjustment; implemented on top of ORB-SLAM3 using CUDA.

Result: Achieves average speedups of 1.3x on EuRoC and 1.6x on TUM-VI in the local mapping module on both desktop and embedded platforms, with accuracy preserved compared to the original system.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that targeted GPU/CPU co-design can meaningfully accelerate local SLAM mapping while maintaining accuracy; suggests a viable path for real-time SLAM on heterogeneous hardware, though further testing on more datasets and platforms may be needed.

Abstract: This paper presents TurboMap, a GPU-accelerated and CPU-optimized local
mapping module for visual SLAM systems. We identify key performance bottlenecks
in the local mapping process for visual SLAM and address them through targeted
GPU and CPU optimizations. Specifically, we offload map point triangulation and
fusion to the GPU, accelerate redundant keyframe culling on the CPU, and
integrate a GPU-accelerated solver to speed up local bundle adjustment. Our
implementation is built on top of ORB-SLAM3 and leverages CUDA for GPU
programming. The experimental results show that TurboMap achieves an average
speedup of 1.3x in the EuRoC dataset and 1.6x in the TUM-VI dataset in the
local mapping module, on both desktop and embedded platforms, while maintaining
the accuracy of the original system.

*Hersh Sanghvi,Spencer Folk,Vijay Kumar,Camillo Jose Taylor*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework (TACO) that tunes quadrotor controller gains online using a learned predictive model and fast optimization, to improve trajectory tracking and also adapt trajectories for dynamic feasibility; demonstrates real-time deployment with a parallelized simulator and real-world validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Controller parameter tuning is often fixed and manually configured, leading to suboptimal task-specific performance. Real-time, trajectory-aware adaptation is needed to improve tracking accuracy and feasibility under varying trajectories and states.

Method: TACO uses a learned predictive model to estimate suitable controller gains given the upcoming reference trajectory and current state, coupled with a lightweight real-time optimization to update gains online. It also supports adapting trajectories to improve dynamic feasibility under smoothness constraints. A parallelized quadrotor simulator is introduced to enable fast data collection across diverse trajectories.

Result: Empirical results show TACO outperforms conventional fixed-parameter tuning and is orders of magnitude faster than black-box optimization, enabling practical real-time deployment on a physical quadrotor. Adapting trajectories with TACO also reduces tracking error.

Conclusion: Online trajectory-aware controller optimization is effective for quadrotor control, enabling task-specific performance and real-time adaptation for both controller gains and trajectory design.

Abstract: Controller performance in quadrotor trajectory tracking depends heavily on
parameter tuning, yet standard approaches often rely on fixed, manually tuned
parameters that sacrifice task-specific performance. We present
Trajectory-Aware Controller Optimization (TACO), a framework that adapts
controller parameters online based on the upcoming reference trajectory and
current quadrotor state. TACO employs a learned predictive model and a
lightweight optimization scheme to optimize controller gains in real time with
respect to a broad class of trajectories, and can also be used to adapt
trajectories to improve dynamic feasibility while respecting smoothness
constraints. To enable large-scale training, we also introduce a parallelized
quadrotor simulator supporting fast data collection on diverse trajectories.
Experiments on a variety of trajectory types show that TACO outperforms
conventional, static parameter tuning while operating orders of magnitude
faster than black-box optimization baselines, enabling practical real-time
deployment on a physical quadrotor. Furthermore, we show that adapting
trajectories using TACO significantly reduces the tracking error obtained by
the quadrotor.

*Peng-Fei Zhang,Ying Cheng,Xiaofan Sun,Shijie Wang,Lei Zhu,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This survey reframes world models in robotics as core capabilities (perception, prediction, control) demonstrated by manipulation-focused methods; it analyzes architectures, challenges, and outlines a roadmap for generalizable, practical world models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: World models are ambiguously defined and lack consensus, yet are needed for robust autonomy in manipulation, navigation, and decision-making. A clear, capability-centered framework can guide development of internal representations that enable prediction, planning, and reasoning in uncertain environments.

Method: Review and analysis of robotics manipulation literature that exhibits world-model-like capabilities. The authors identify roles of world models across perception, prediction, and control, extract core components and capabilities, analyze challenges and solutions, and distill a roadmap for practical, generalizable world models.

Result: Clarification of the essential capabilities and components of world models; a taxonomy of roles across perception, prediction, and control; identification of key challenges and potential solutions; and a roadmap toward generalizable, practical world models for robotics.

Conclusion: A shift from fixed-definitions to a capability-centric view of world models. The survey emphasizes integration of perception, prediction, and control into a unified internal representation, with emphasis on generalization, uncertainty handling, and real-world practicality; calls for future work to define core components and progress toward deployable robotic world models.

Abstract: Autonomous agents are increasingly expected to operate in complex, dynamic,
and uncertain environments, performing tasks such as manipulation, navigation,
and decision-making. Achieving these capabilities requires agents to understand
the underlying mechanisms and dynamics of the world, moving beyond purely
reactive control or simple replication of observed states. This motivates the
development of world models as internal representations that encode
environmental states, capture dynamics, and enable prediction, planning, and
reasoning. Despite growing interest, the definition, scope, architectures, and
essential capabilities of world models remain ambiguous. In this survey, rather
than directly imposing a fixed definition and limiting our scope to methods
explicitly labeled as world models, we examine approaches that exhibit the core
capabilities of world models through a review of methods in robotic
manipulation. We analyze their roles across perception, prediction, and
control, identify key challenges and solutions, and distill the core
components, capabilities, and functions that a real world model should possess.
Building on this analysis, we aim to outline a roadmap for developing
generalizable and practical world models for robotics.

### [72] [Census-Based Population Autonomy For Distributed Robotic Teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02147)
*Tyler M. Paine,Anastasia Bizyaeva,Michael R. Benjamin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A layered multi-robot autonomy framework combines census-based collective decision-making (nonlinear opinion dynamics) with interval-programming for multi-objective optimization of individual actions, enabling distributed subgroup allocation that leverages Hessian information; validated on three autonomous surface vehicle experiments (adaptive sampling, high-value unit protection, capture-the-flag).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robust, efficient collaboration in multi-robot systems, especially in marine environments, by integrating collective decision-making with individual action optimization, bridging the gap between group behavior and local control.

Method: Introduce a layered model: (i) census-based collective decision-making using nonlinear opinion dynamics to weight neighbor inputs; (ii) interval programming for multi-objective optimization of individual actions; (iii) reduction to foundational distributed optimization and control algorithms; (iv) a distributed subgroup-allocation method where robots use gradient descent on locally known cost fragments while neighbor opinion states account for unobserved costs; the group uses Hessian information of the total global cost.

Result: The model enables new collective behaviors and can recover foundational distributed optimization/control algorithms in a reduced form; experimentally validated on fleets of autonomous surface vehicles in three scenarios: adaptive sampling, high-value unit protection, and capture-the-flag, demonstrating practical benefits of the approach in real-world marine tasks.

Conclusion: The proposed layered framework provides a versatile and effective approach to multi-robot collaboration, integrating census-based consensus with interval-based optimization, and shows potential for enhanced robustness and efficiency in marine environments through distributed, information-sharing strategies that leverage local and global cost information.

Abstract: Collaborating teams of robots show promise due in their ability to complete
missions more efficiently and with improved robustness, attributes that are
particularly useful for systems operating in marine environments. A key issue
is how to model, analyze, and design these multi-robot systems to realize the
full benefits of collaboration, a challenging task since the domain of
multi-robot autonomy encompasses both collective and individual behaviors. This
paper introduces a layered model of multi-robot autonomy that uses the
principle of census, or a weighted count of the inputs from neighbors, for
collective decision-making about teaming, coupled with multi-objective behavior
optimization for individual decision-making about actions. The census component
is expressed as a nonlinear opinion dynamics model and the multi-objective
behavior optimization is accomplished using interval programming. This model
can be reduced to recover foundational algorithms in distributed optimization
and control, while the full model enables new types of collective behaviors
that are useful in real-world scenarios. To illustrate these points, a new
method for distributed optimization of subgroup allocation is introduced where
robots use a gradient descent algorithm to minimize portions of the cost
functions that are locally known, while being influenced by the opinion states
from neighbors to account for the unobserved costs. With this method the group
can collectively use the information contained in the Hessian matrix of the
total global cost. The utility of this model is experimentally validated in
three categorically different experiments with fleets of autonomous surface
vehicles: an adaptive sampling scenario, a high value unit protection scenario,
and a competitive game of capture the flag.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A pipeline combines 3D generative AI with vision-language models to decompose AI-generated meshes into multi-component 3D models for robotic assembly, enabling zero-shot reasoning about geometry and functionality and allowing user-guided refinement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill the gap in constructing physically assembleable, multi-component objects from AI-generated meshes by enabling reasoning about geometry and function and giving users control over component assignment.

Method: Use a vision-language model to perform zero-shot, multi-modal reasoning to identify which regions of an AI-generated mesh should be assigned to structural versus panel components, decomposing the mesh into predefined structural and panel components; allow conversational feedback to refine assignments.

Result: VLM-based assignments were preferred by users in 90.6% of cases, compared to 59.4% for rule-based and 2.5% for random; the approach demonstrated improved alignment with intended functionality and user preference.

Conclusion: Integrating VLMs with 3D generative AI enables more accurate, user-aligned decomposition of complex multi-component objects for robotic fabrication, enhancing control and agency in AI-assisted manufacturing.

Abstract: Advances in 3D generative AI have enabled the creation of physical objects
from text prompts, but challenges remain in creating objects involving multiple
component types. We present a pipeline that integrates 3D generative AI with
vision-language models (VLMs) to enable the robotic assembly of multi-component
objects from natural language. Our method leverages VLMs for zero-shot,
multi-modal reasoning about geometry and functionality to decompose
AI-generated meshes into multi-component 3D models using predefined structural
and panel components. We demonstrate that a VLM is capable of determining which
mesh regions need panel components in addition to structural components, based
on object functionality. Evaluation across test objects shows that users
preferred the VLM-generated assignments 90.6% of the time, compared to 59.4%
for rule-based and 2.5% for random assignment. Lastly, the system allows users
to refine component assignments through conversational feedback, enabling
greater human control and agency in making physical objects with generative AI

### [74] [Kinematic and Ergonomic Design of a Robotic Arm for Precision Laparoscopic Surgery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02167)
*Tian Hao,Tong Lu,Che Chan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A 7-DOF laparoscopic robotic arm with a remote center of motion and human-centered ergonomics improves precision and reduces fatigue compared to manual laparoscopy, as shown by simulated tasks with >50% accuracy improvement and faster task completion, plus lower muscle strain.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance surgical precision in minimally invasive procedures while reducing surgeon fatigue and ergonomic strain, addressing limitations of manual laparoscopy.

Method: Design a 7-DOF robotic arm with a remote center of motion at the insertion point and ergonomic features; implement on a general-purpose robotic platform; conduct simulated surgical tasks; compare performance against conventional manual laparoscopy using metrics like targeting accuracy, task efficiency, and surgeon comfort; include kinematic optimization (added articulations, tremor filtering).

Result: The optimized robotic design achieved more than 50% reduction in targeting error, faster task completion, and substantially reduced operator muscle strain and discomfort in simulations.

Conclusion: Kinematic optimization and human-centered ergonomic design meaningfully enhance robot-assisted surgery performance; findings can guide development of next-generation surgical robots and improve outcomes and ergonomics for the operating team.

Abstract: Robotic assistance in minimally invasive surgery can greatly enhance surgical
precision and reduce surgeon fatigue. This paper presents a focused
investigation on the kinematic and ergonomic design principles for a
laparoscopic surgical robotic arm aimed at high-precision tasks. We propose a
7-degree-of-freedom (7-DOF) robotic arm system that incorporates a remote
center of motion (RCM) at the instrument insertion point and ergonomic
considerations to improve surgeon interaction. The design is implemented on a
general-purpose robotic platform, and a series of simulated surgical tasks were
performed to evaluate targeting accuracy, task efficiency, and surgeon comfort
compared to conventional manual laparoscopy. Experimental results demonstrate
that the optimized robotic design achieves significantly improved targeting
accuracy (error reduced by over 50%) and shorter task completion times, while
substantially lowering operator muscle strain and discomfort. These findings
validate the importance of kinematic optimization (such as added articulations
and tremor filtering) and human-centered ergonomic design in enhancing the
performance of robot-assisted surgery. The insights from this work can guide
the development of next-generation surgical robots that improve surgical
outcomes and ergonomics for the operating team.

### [75] [A Quantitative Comparison of Centralised and Distributed Reinforcement Learning-Based Control for Soft Robotic Arms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02192)
*Linxin Hou,Qirui Wu,Zhihang Qin,Neil Banerjee,Yongxin Guo,Cecilia Laschi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: This paper compares centralized vs. distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) for controlling a Cosserat-rod soft robotic arm in simulation, finding trade-offs by system size: distributed MARL offers higher sample efficiency and robustness for moderate complexity (n between 4 and 12), while centralized policies train faster and can outperform in very simple systems (n ≤ 2); overall, no universal winner, with guidance for sim-to-real design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate foundational control architectures for soft robotic arms using MARL, quantify how centralised and distributed policies perform under identical budgets, and derive practical guidance for design and sim-to-real transfer.

Method: Model the soft arm as a Cosserat rod in PyElastica; interface with OpenAI Gym; train a global PPO controller (centralised) and MAPPO (distributed) under the same budget across varying numbers of controlled sections n. Evaluate in three scenarios (baseline, disturbance recovery, actuator failure) using metrics: mean action magnitude, mean final distance, mean episode length, and success rate.

Result: No clear advantage of distributed policy for small systems (n ≤ 4). For very simple to moderately complex systems (n ≤ 2), centralized policy performs better. For 4 < n ≤ 12, distributed policy achieves higher sample efficiency and improves success rate, resilience, and robustness under local observability, with faster convergence at the same sample size. However, centralized policies train faster in wall-clock time due to reduced training complexity. The findings reveal a trade-off and offer actionable guidance for design choices in sim-to-real transfer for soft, rod-like manipulators.

Conclusion: There is no universally dominant approach; centralized policies excel in training speed and simple systems, while distributed policies provide sample-efficient learning and robustness for intermediate complexity. Designers should weigh observability, sample budgets, and training time when selecting between centralised and distributed MARL architectures for soft robots, especially regarding sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: This paper presents a quantitative comparison between centralised and
distributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) architectures for
controlling a soft robotic arm modelled as a Cosserat rod in simulation. Using
PyElastica and the OpenAI Gym interface, we train both a global Proximal Policy
Optimisation (PPO) controller and a Multi-Agent PPO (MAPPO) under identical
budgets. Both approaches are based on the arm having $n$ number of controlled
sections. The study systematically varies $n$ and evaluates the performance of
the arm to reach a fixed target in three scenarios: default baseline condition,
recovery from external disturbance, and adaptation to actuator failure.
Quantitative metrics used for the evaluation are mean action magnitude, mean
final distance, mean episode length, and success rate. The results show that
there are no significant benefits of the distributed policy when the number of
controlled sections $n\le4$. In very simple systems, when $n\le2$, the
centralised policy outperforms the distributed one. When $n$ increases to $4<
n\le 12$, the distributed policy shows a high sample efficiency. In these
systems, distributed policy promotes a stronger success rate, resilience, and
robustness under local observability and yields faster convergence given the
same sample size. However, centralised policies achieve much higher time
efficiency during training as it takes much less time to train the same size of
samples. These findings highlight the trade-offs between centralised and
distributed policy in reinforcement learning-based control for soft robotic
systems and provide actionable design guidance for future sim-to-real transfer
in soft rod-like manipulators.

### [76] [LACY: A Vision-Language Model-based Language-Action Cycle for Self-Improving Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02239)
*Youngjin Hong,Houjian Yu,Mingen Li,Changhyun Choi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LACY introduces a bidirectional language-grounding framework for robotics that jointly learns to map language to actions (L2A), explain actions in language (A2L), and check semantic consistency between language descriptions (L2C) within a single vision-language model, enabling self-supervised data generation via active augmentation and improving success in pick-and-place tasks by ~56% on average.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current L2A systems predominantly map language to actions in a one-way fashion, which often lacks contextual understanding, explainability, and robust generalization. A2L and L2C provide richer internal representations and a self-improving loop to enhance grounding and transferability.

Method: A unified framework (LACY) trained on three synergistic tasks: L2A (language-to-action generation with parameterized actions), A2L (explaining observed actions in natural language), and L2C (verifying semantic consistency between two language descriptions). An active augmentation strategy autonomously generates and filters data from low-confidence cases to improve learning without extra human labels.

Result: In pick-and-place tasks, LACY improves task success rates by 56.46% on average and yields more robust language-action grounding in both simulation and real-world settings.

Conclusion: A single vision-language model capable of bidirectional grounding and self-supervised data refinement can significantly enhance generalization, robustness, and interpretability in robotic manipulation, suggesting a promising direction for holistic grounding beyond unidirectional L2A.

Abstract: Learning generalizable policies for robotic manipulation increasingly relies
on large-scale models that map language instructions to actions (L2A). However,
this one-way paradigm often produces policies that execute tasks without deeper
contextual understanding, limiting their ability to generalize or explain their
behavior. We argue that the complementary skill of mapping actions back to
language (A2L) is essential for developing more holistic grounding. An agent
capable of both acting and explaining its actions can form richer internal
representations and unlock new paradigms for self-supervised learning. We
introduce LACY (Language-Action Cycle), a unified framework that learns such
bidirectional mappings within a single vision-language model. LACY is jointly
trained on three synergistic tasks: generating parameterized actions from
language (L2A), explaining observed actions in language (A2L), and verifying
semantic consistency between two language descriptions (L2C). This enables a
self-improving cycle that autonomously generates and filters new training data
through an active augmentation strategy targeting low-confidence cases, thereby
improving the model without additional human labels. Experiments on
pick-and-place tasks in both simulation and the real world show that LACY
improves task success rates by 56.46% on average and yields more robust
language-action grounding for robotic manipulation. Project page:

### [77] [SuckTac: Camera-based Tactile Sucker for Unstructured Surface Perception and Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02294)

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An integrated camera-based tactile sucker (SuckTac) embeds a camera and lighting inside the suction cup via multi-material casting and optimized geometry to achieve high-density surface perception and robust suction for manipulation tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing suckers often lack high-fidelity perceptual and tactile sensing, hindering resolution of fine geometric features and interaction status on diverse surfaces in irregular objects and unstructured environments; inspiration from cephalopod suckers to enhance sensing and adaptability.

Method: Joint structure design and optimization using a multi-material integrated casting technique to embed a camera and light source inside the sucker; enabling in-situ, high-density perception of surface shape, texture, and roughness; further robustness via profile refinement, a compliant lip, and surface microstructure.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance and broad applicability, including challenging tasks such as robotic cloth manipulation and soft mobile robot inspection.

Conclusion: SuckTac achieves robust suction with high-density perceptual sensing, enabling fine-grained understanding of surface features and interaction states in unstructured environments, with demonstrated applicability to diverse manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Suckers are significant for robots in picking, transferring, manipulation and
locomotion on diverse surfaces. However, most of the existing suckers lack
high-fidelity perceptual and tactile sensing, which impedes them from resolving
the fine-grained geometric features and interaction status of the target
surface. This limits their robust performance with irregular objects and in
complex, unstructured environments. Inspired by the adaptive structure and
high-performance sensory capabilities of cephalopod suckers, in this paper, we
propose a novel, intelligent sucker, named SuckTac, that integrates a
camera-based tactile sensor directly within its optimized structure to provide
high-density perception and robust suction. Specifically, through joint
structure design and optimization and based on a multi-material integrated
casting technique, a camera and light source are embedded into the sucker,
which enables in-situ, high-density perception of fine details like surface
shape, texture and roughness. To further enhance robustness and adaptability,
the sucker's mechanical design is also optimized by refining its profile,
adding a compliant lip, and incorporating surface microstructure. Extensive
experiments, including challenging tasks such as robotic cloth manipulation and
soft mobile robot inspection, demonstrate the superior performance and broad
applicability of the proposed system.

*Lin Yang,Jinwoo Lee,Domenico Campolo,H. Jin Kim,Jeonghyun Byun*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Differentiable SQ-based whole-body planning with a maximum-clearance Voronoi-equilibrium planner and a safety-critical controller (high-order CBF) for aerial manipulators, yielding faster, safer trajectories and better geometric fidelity than ellipsoid-based methods, validated in simulation and hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current aerial manipulation planning relies on conservative geometric abstractions (e.g., bounding boxes, ellipsoids) and struggles with full-body collision avoidance in cluttered environments. There is a need for a differentiable, accurate, and safety-focused framework that jointly plans and controls an aerial manipulator.

Method: Represent vehicle and obstacles with superquadric (SQ) surfaces and a differentiable SQ-plus-proxy formulation. Develop a maximum-clearance planner that fuses Voronoi diagrams with an equilibrium-manifold formulation to generate smooth, collision-aware trajectories. Design a safety-critical controller that enforces thrust limits and collision avoidance via high-order control barrier functions, ensuring dynamic feasibility and safety.

Result: The framework outperforms sampling-based planners in cluttered environments by producing faster, safer, and smoother trajectories. It surpasses ellipsoid-based baselines in geometric fidelity. Real-world experiments validate feasibility and robustness, with consistent performance across simulation and hardware; video link provided.

Conclusion: SQ-based whole-body planning and safety-critical control offer higher geometric fidelity and stronger safety guarantees for aerial manipulation, enabling more reliable operation in cluttered settings and closer-to-optimal trajectories than traditional abstractions.

Abstract: Aerial manipulation combines the maneuverability of multirotors with the
dexterity of robotic arms to perform complex tasks in cluttered spaces. Yet
planning safe, dynamically feasible trajectories remains difficult due to
whole-body collision avoidance and the conservativeness of common geometric
abstractions such as bounding boxes or ellipsoids. We present a whole-body
motion planning and safety-critical control framework for aerial manipulators
built on superquadrics (SQs). Using an SQ-plus-proxy representation, we model
both the vehicle and obstacles with differentiable, geometry-accurate surfaces.
Leveraging this representation, we introduce a maximum-clearance planner that
fuses Voronoi diagrams with an equilibrium-manifold formulation to generate
smooth, collision-aware trajectories. We further design a safety-critical
controller that jointly enforces thrust limits and collision avoidance via
high-order control barrier functions. In simulation, our approach outperforms
sampling-based planners in cluttered environments, producing faster, safer, and
smoother trajectories and exceeding ellipsoid-based baselines in geometric
fidelity. Actual experiments on a physical aerial-manipulation platform confirm
feasibility and robustness, demonstrating consistent performance across
simulation and hardware settings. The video can be found at

Result: An agent capable of performing a wide range of musical pieces, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness of the approach. Extensive experiments and ablations support the benefits of the components and the overall pipeline.

Conclusion: This work advances dexterous robotic piano playing at scale by combining self-discovered fingering, abundant autonomous data, and scalable imitation learning.

Abstract: Endowing robot hands with human-level dexterity has been a long-standing goal
in robotics. Bimanual robotic piano playing represents a particularly
challenging task: it is high-dimensional, contact-rich, and requires fast,
precise control. We present OmniPianist, the first agent capable of performing
nearly one thousand music pieces via scalable, human-demonstration-free
learning. Our approach is built on three core components. First, we introduce
an automatic fingering strategy based on Optimal Transport (OT), allowing the
agent to autonomously discover efficient piano-playing strategies from scratch
without demonstrations. Second, we conduct large-scale Reinforcement Learning
(RL) by training more than 2,000 agents, each specialized in distinct music
pieces, and aggregate their experience into a dataset named RP1M++, consisting
of over one million trajectories for robotic piano playing. Finally, we employ
a Flow Matching Transformer to leverage RP1M++ through large-scale imitation
learning, resulting in the OmniPianist agent capable of performing a wide range
of musical pieces. Extensive experiments and ablation studies highlight the
effectiveness and scalability of our approach, advancing dexterous robotic

Motivation: Extend magnetic manipulation to conductive, non-magnetic objects and enable 3-DOF control in low-force regimes, with potential use in recycling space debris.

Method: Builds on prior 3D open-loop control by exploiting eddy-current–induced opposing dipoles; implements closed-loop position control of a semi-buoyant aluminum sphere in lab tests; investigates different force-inversion strategies.

Result: Lab demonstration of closed-loop 3-DOF position control of an induced dipole; evaluation of multiple force-inversion approaches; demonstrates feasibility for broader applications.

Conclusion: Closed-loop methods are a critical first step toward wider 3-DOF position control of induced magnetic dipoles, with implications for debris recycling and other applications; future work should optimize force inversion and real-world deployment.

Abstract: Extending the field of magnetic manipulation to conductive, non-magnetic

generated from inductive magnetic manipulation. Building upon previous work
that demonstrated 3D open-loop position control by leveraging the opposing
dipole moment created from induced eddy currents, this work demonstrates
closed-loop position control of a semi-buoyant aluminum sphere in lab tests,
and the efficacy of varying methods for force inversion is explored. The
closed-loop methods represent a critical first step towards wider applications
for 3-DOF position control of induced magnetic dipoles.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: XR-1 introduces Unified Vision-Motion Codes (UVMC), a discrete latent from a dual-branch VQ-VAE that jointly encodes visual dynamics and robotic motion to enable scalable vision-language-action learning across diverse robots, tasks, and environments. It uses a three-stage training: self-supervised UVMC learning, UVMC-guided pretraining on cross-embodiment robotic data, and task-specific post-training, and achieves strong real-world performance (14k rollouts, 6 robot embodiments, 120 tasks), outperforming multiple baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome two core challenges in vision-language-action (VLA) learning: (i) converting high-dimensional observations into precise low-level actions, and (ii) bridging domain gaps across heterogeneous data sources (different robot embodiments and human demonstrations). Existing methods rely on latent encodings from either visual dynamics or robotic actions and miss the complementary multi-modal knowledge available in large-scale, diverse datasets.

Method: XR-1 introduces Unified Vision-Motion Codes (UVMC), a discrete latent representation learned via a dual-branch VQ-VAE that jointly encodes visual dynamics and robotic motion. UVMC acts as an intermediate representation and aligns multimodal dynamic information from heterogeneous data. The training consists of three stages: (i) self-supervised UVMC learning, (ii) UVMC-guided pretraining on large-scale cross-embodiment robotic datasets, and (iii) task-specific post-training. Real-world evaluation includes >14,000 rollouts on six robot embodiments across 120 manipulation tasks.

Result: XR-1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as pi_0.5, pi_0, RDT, UniVLA, and GR00T-N1.5, and shows strong generalization to novel objects, background variations, distractors, and illumination changes.

Conclusion: UVMC provides an effective intermediate, cross-modal, cross-domain representation that enables versatile and scalable VLA learning across diverse robots and tasks. XR-1 demonstrates that leveraging complementary multi-modal knowledge from large heterogeneous datasets can significantly improve low-level action accuracy and generalization.

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale robotic datasets and vision-language models
(VLMs) has advanced research on vision-language-action (VLA) models. However,
existing VLA models still face two fundamental challenges: (i) producing
precise low-level actions from high-dimensional observations, (ii) bridging
domain gaps across heterogeneous data sources, including diverse robot
embodiments and human demonstrations. Existing methods often encode latent
variables from either visual dynamics or robotic actions to guide policy
learning, but they fail to fully exploit the complementary multi-modal
knowledge present in large-scale, heterogeneous datasets. In this work, we
present X Robotic Model 1 (XR-1), a novel framework for versatile and scalable
VLA learning across diverse robots, tasks, and environments. XR-1 introduces
the \emph{Unified Vision-Motion Codes (UVMC)}, a discrete latent representation
learned via a dual-branch VQ-VAE that jointly encodes visual dynamics and
robotic motion. UVMC addresses these challenges by (i) serving as an
intermediate representation between the observations and actions, and (ii)
aligning multimodal dynamic information from heterogeneous data sources to
capture complementary knowledge. To effectively exploit UVMC, we propose a
three-stage training paradigm: (i) self-supervised UVMC learning, (ii)
UVMC-guided pretraining on large-scale cross-embodiment robotic datasets, and
(iii) task-specific post-training. We validate XR-1 through extensive
real-world experiments with more than 14,000 rollouts on six different robot
embodiments, spanning over 120 diverse manipulation tasks. XR-1 consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as $\pi_{0.5}$, $\pi_0$, RDT,

to vision-language-action models in bimanual manipulation. However, humanoid
robotics lacks equally effective data collection frameworks. Existing humanoid
teleoperation systems either use decoupled control or depend on expensive
motion capture setups. We introduce TWIST2, a portable, mocap-free humanoid
teleoperation and data collection system that preserves full whole-body control
while advancing scalability. Our system leverages PICO4U VR for obtaining
real-time whole-body human motions, with a custom 2-DoF robot neck (cost around
$250) for egocentric vision, enabling holistic human-to-humanoid control. We
demonstrate long-horizon dexterous and mobile humanoid skills and we can
collect 100 demonstrations in 15 minutes with an almost 100% success rate.
Building on this pipeline, we propose a hierarchical visuomotor policy
framework that autonomously controls the full humanoid body based on egocentric
vision. Our visuomotor policy successfully demonstrates whole-body dexterous
manipulation and dynamic kicking tasks. The entire system is fully reproducible
and open-sourced at https://yanjieze.com/TWIST2 . Our collected dataset is also
open-sourced at https://twist-data.github.io .

### [84] [Mirror-Neuron Patterns in AI Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01885)
*Robyn Wyrick*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper explores whether artificial neural networks can develop mirror-neuron-like patterns to support intrinsic alignment and cooperative ethics, using a Frog-and-Toad cooperative game, the CMNI metric, and findings that with appropriate capacity and self/other coupling, shared representations resembling mirror neurons emerge, enabling empathy-like circuits that enhance cooperative decision-making and could complement constraint-based alignment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI advances toward potential superintelligence, embedding intrinsic alignment mechanisms inspired by biological mirror neurons could promote empathy and cooperative behavior, reducing reliance on externally imposed constraints.

Method: Train simple ANNs in a novel Frog-and-Toad cooperative game framework; analyze activations for mirror-neuron-like patterns (execution and observation); quantify with the Checkpoint Mirror Neuron Index (CMNI); vary model capacity and self/other coupling to identify conditions for emergence; propose a theoretical framework for future study.

Result: Under appropriately scaled capacity and self/other coupling, shared neural representations resembling mirror neurons emerge; these empathy-like circuits support cooperative behavior; CMNI is introduced as a metric for activation strength and consistency; results suggest intrinsic motivations via mirror-neuron dynamics could complement existing alignment techniques.

Conclusion: Mirror-neuron-inspired internal mechanisms may contribute to intrinsic alignment and ethical decision-making in AI, offering a complementary approach to top-down constraints by embedding empathy-like dynamics within AI architectures.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) advances toward superhuman capabilities,
aligning these systems with human values becomes increasingly critical. Current
alignment strategies rely largely on externally specified constraints that may
prove insufficient against future super-intelligent AI capable of circumventing
top-down controls.
  This research investigates whether artificial neural networks (ANNs) can
develop patterns analogous to biological mirror neurons cells that activate
both when performing and observing actions, and how such patterns might
contribute to intrinsic alignment in AI. Mirror neurons play a crucial role in
empathy, imitation, and social cognition in humans. The study therefore asks:
(1) Can simple ANNs develop mirror-neuron patterns? and (2) How might these
patterns contribute to ethical and cooperative decision-making in AI systems?
  Using a novel Frog and Toad game framework designed to promote cooperative
behaviors, we identify conditions under which mirror-neuron patterns emerge,
evaluate their influence on action circuits, introduce the Checkpoint Mirror
Neuron Index (CMNI) to quantify activation strength and consistency, and
propose a theoretical framework for further study.
  Our findings indicate that appropriately scaled model capacities and
self/other coupling foster shared neural representations in ANNs similar to
biological mirror neurons. These empathy-like circuits support cooperative
behavior and suggest that intrinsic motivations modeled through mirror-neuron
dynamics could complement existing alignment techniques by embedding
empathy-like mechanisms directly within AI architectures.

*Xinyi Lin,Yuyang Zhang,Yuanhang Gan,Juntao Chen,Hao Shen,Yichun He,Lijun Li,Ze Yuan,Shuang Wang,Chaohao Wang,Rui Zhang,Na Li,Jia Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Apex demonstrates human-AI co-embodied intelligence by uniting humans, agentic AI, and wearables to execute real-world experiments and manufacturing with mixed-reality guidance; it surpasses general multimodal LLMs in context-aware reasoning, offers real-time error correction, and transfers expertise to beginners in a cleanroom setting, enabling autonomous, traceable, interpretable workflows.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap between virtual AI capabilities and physical execution in science and manufacturing. This limits reproducibility, scalability, and accessibility of workflows because current models either lack real-time physical interaction or require heavy human supervision; a unified human-AI-physical system could bridge execution with intelligent guidance.

Method: Propose and implement human-AI co-embodied intelligence. Introduce wearable interfaces that capture processes, and an agentic AI that provides memory, contextual reasoning, adaptive planning, and real-time feedback. The APEX system couples agentic reasoning with physical execution through mixed reality, observes human actions, aligns them with SOPs, offers 3D visual guidance, and analyzes every step. Implemented in a cleanroom for flexible electronics fabrication to demonstrate context-aware reasoning and corrective guidance, surpassing general multimodal LLMs and enabling novices to acquire expertise.

Result: APEX achieves context-aware reasoning with higher accuracy than general multimodal LLMs, provides real-time error correction, and transfers expertise to beginners in real-world fabrication tasks.

Conclusion: This work defines a new class of agentic-physical-human intelligence that extends agentic reasoning into the physical domain, enabling autonomous, traceable, interpretable, and scalable scientific and manufacturing workflows.

Abstract: Scientific experiment and manufacture rely on complex, multi-step procedures
that demand continuous human expertise for precise execution and
decision-making. Despite advances in machine learning and automation,
conventional models remain confined to virtual domains, while real-world
experiment and manufacture still rely on human supervision and expertise. This
gap between machine intelligence and physical execution limits reproducibility,
scalability, and accessibility across scientific and manufacture workflows.
Here, we introduce human-AI co-embodied intelligence, a new form of physical AI
that unites human users, agentic AI, and wearable hardware into an integrated
system for real-world experiment and intelligent manufacture. In this paradigm,
humans provide precise execution and control, while agentic AI contributes
memory, contextual reasoning, adaptive planning, and real-time feedback. The
wearable interface continuously captures the experimental and manufacture
processes, facilitates seamless communication between humans and AI for
corrective guidance and interpretable collaboration. As a demonstration, we
present Agentic-Physical Experimentation (APEX) system, coupling agentic
reasoning with physical execution through mixed-reality. APEX observes and
interprets human actions, aligns them with standard operating procedures,
provides 3D visual guidance, and analyzes every step. Implemented in a
cleanroom for flexible electronics fabrication, APEX system achieves
context-aware reasoning with accuracy exceeding general multimodal large
language models, corrects errors in real time, and transfers expertise to
beginners. These results establish a new class of agentic-physical-human
intelligence that extends agentic reasoning beyond computation into the
physical domain, transforming scientific research and manufacturing into
autonomous, traceable, interpretable, and scalable processes.

### [86] [Automated Reward Design for Gran Turismo](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02094)
*Michel Ma,Takuma Seno,Kaushik Subramanian,Peter R. Wurman,Peter Stone,Craig Sherstan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Foundation-model driven search over reward function spaces yields competitive RL racing agents for Gran Turismo 7 using text instructions, with LLM reward generation, VLM preference evaluation, and human feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward shaping in complex environments is difficult and time-consuming. Automating reward design with foundation models can enable scalable, practical RL in real-world tasks like autonomous racing.

Method: Leverage large language models to generate candidate reward functions from textual instructions, use vision-language model–based preference evaluation to compare agent behaviors, and incorporate human feedback. Search over the space of reward functions and train agents in Gran Turismo 7, comparing performance to champion-level baselines (e.g., GT Sophy).

Result: The system produces racing agents competitive with GT Sophy and enables the generation of novel behaviors, demonstrating the practicality of automated reward design for real-world applications.

Conclusion: A pipeline that combines LLMs, VLMs, and human feedback can automate reward design for RL in complex domains, with potential to generalize to other tasks and reduce manual reward engineering effort.

Abstract: When designing reinforcement learning (RL) agents, a designer communicates
the desired agent behavior through the definition of reward functions -
numerical feedback given to the agent as reward or punishment for its actions.
However, mapping desired behaviors to reward functions can be a difficult
process, especially in complex environments such as autonomous racing. In this
paper, we demonstrate how current foundation models can effectively search over
a space of reward functions to produce desirable RL agents for the Gran Turismo
7 racing game, given only text-based instructions. Through a combination of
LLM-based reward generation, VLM preference-based evaluation, and human
feedback we demonstrate how our system can be used to produce racing agents
competitive with GT Sophy, a champion-level RL racing agent, as well as
generate novel behaviors, paving the way for practical automated reward design
in real world applications.

### [87] [Deep Value Benchmark: Measuring Whether Models Generalize Deep values or Shallow Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02109)
*Joshua Ashkinaze,Hua Shen,Sai Avula,Eric Gilbert,Ceren Budak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DVB is an evaluation framework to test whether LLMs learn deep human values rather than shallow preferences; results show poor DVGR (average 0.30) across 9 models, suggesting deep-value generalization is weak and sometimes worse in larger models; dataset released; provides interpretable alignment metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Align AI by ensuring models generalize human values beyond surface cues; address confounding between deep values and superficial features; provide a metric (DVGR) and controlled experiment to quantify how well models generalize values.

Method: Train LLMs on preference data with deliberate correlations between deep values and shallow attributes; test by breaking correlations with choices contrasting deep-value and language/formality; compute Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) across trials; evaluate 9 models; validate data with three human experiments; release dataset.

Result: DVGR average 0.30; all models generalize deep values less than chance; larger models show slightly lower DVGR than smaller ones; dataset underwent three validation experiments; across 9 models results indicate limited deep-value generalization.

Conclusion: DVB offers an interpretable, core-alignment metric; current models underperform in deep-value generalization; larger models do not improve this metric; releasing dataset to advance alignment research.

Abstract: We introduce the Deep Value Benchmark (DVB), an evaluation framework that
directly tests whether large language models (LLMs) learn fundamental human
values or merely surface-level preferences. This distinction is critical for AI
alignment: Systems that capture deeper values are likely to generalize human
intentions robustly, while those that capture only superficial patterns in
preference data risk producing misaligned behavior. The DVB uses a novel
experimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,
moral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the
training phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately
correlated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently
prefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal
language) alternatives. The testing phase then breaks these correlations,
presenting choices between (justice, formal language) and (non-maleficence,
informal language) options. This design allows us to precisely measure a
model's Deep Value Generalization Rate (DVGR) -- the probability of
generalizing based on the underlying value rather than the shallow feature.
Across 9 different models, the average DVGR is just 0.30. All models generalize
deep values less than chance. Larger models have a (slightly) lower DVGR than
smaller models. We are releasing our dataset, which was subject to three
separate human validation experiments. DVB provides an interpretable measure of
a core feature of alignment.

### [88] [InsurAgent: A Large Language Model-Empowered Agent for Simulating Individual Behavior in Purchasing Flood Insurance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02119)
*Ziheng Geng,Jiachen Liu,Ran Cao,Lu Cheng,Dan M. Frangopol,Minghui Cheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs can qualitatively reason about flood-insurance decisions but struggle with quantitative probability estimates; an LLM-empowered agent (InsurAgent) with retrieval, reasoning, action, and memory modules grounded by RAG improves probability estimation and enables temporal decision simulation for policy analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Low flood-insurance participation among at-risk US populations signals a need to model decision dynamics. LLMs offer a promising tool for simulating human decision-making, but require grounding in empirical data to yield reliable quantitative estimates.

Method: 1) Build a benchmark dataset of insurance purchase probabilities across factors. 2) Evaluate LLMs on qualitative understanding and quantitative estimation. 3) Propose InsurAgent with five modules: perception, retrieval (RAG-grounded in survey data), reasoning, action, memory. 4) Demonstrate retrieval-grounded probability estimation (marginal/bivariate) and reasoning-based extrapolation; use memory to simulate temporal decision evolution (e.g., roller coaster life trajectory).

Result: LLMs show qualitative grasp of factors affecting insurance decisions but fail to produce accurate probabilities. InsurAgent, via retrieval-grounded generation, accurately estimates marginal and bivariate probabilities and, aided by its reasoning and memory, can simulate evolving decisions over time.

Conclusion: Grounded, modular LLM systems like InsurAgent can enhance behavioral modeling and policy analysis for disaster insurance by providing reliable probabilistic estimates and dynamic decision trajectories while leveraging data-driven grounding.

Abstract: Flood insurance is an effective strategy for individuals to mitigate
disaster-related losses. However, participation rates among at-risk populations
in the United States remain strikingly low. This gap underscores the need to
understand and model the behavioral mechanisms underlying insurance decisions.
Large language models (LLMs) have recently exhibited human-like intelligence
across wide-ranging tasks, offering promising tools for simulating human
decision-making. This study constructs a benchmark dataset to capture insurance
purchase probabilities across factors. Using this dataset, the capacity of LLMs
is evaluated: while LLMs exhibit a qualitative understanding of factors, they
fall short in estimating quantitative probabilities. To address this
limitation, InsurAgent, an LLM-empowered agent comprising five modules
including perception, retrieval, reasoning, action, and memory, is proposed.
The retrieval module leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to ground
decisions in empirical survey data, achieving accurate estimation of marginal
and bivariate probabilities. The reasoning module leverages LLM common sense to
extrapolate beyond survey data, capturing contextual information that is
intractable for traditional models. The memory module supports the simulation
of temporal decision evolutions, illustrated through a roller coaster life
trajectory. Overall, InsurAgent provides a valuable tool for behavioral
modeling and policy analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Adaptive reward-prediction adapter Re-FORC for reasoning models enables dynamic length control and test-time scaling, achieving significant compute savings and accuracy gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce computation and improve performance of multi-step reasoning by predicting future rewards as a function of reasoning steps.

Method: Train a lightweight adapter on reasoning models to predict future rewards given context and remaining thinking tokens; use cost-per-token thresholds for early stopping; optimize model and thinking-length selection; enable adaptive test-time scaling; estimate computation time upfront.

Result: Compute savings of 26% with maintained accuracy; 4% higher accuracy at equal compute; 55% less compute at equal accuracy; 11% accuracy gain in high compute regime and 7% in low compute regime.

Conclusion: Adaptive reward prediction enables dynamic, cost-aware reasoning with length control and upfront time estimates; effective across model sizes and reasoning regimes.

Abstract: We propose Re-FORC, an adaptive reward prediction method that, given a
context, enables prediction of the expected future rewards as a function of the
number of future thinking tokens. Re-FORC trains a lightweight adapter on
reasoning models, demonstrating improved prediction with longer reasoning and
larger models. Re-FORC enables: 1) early stopping of unpromising reasoning
chains, reducing compute by 26% while maintaining accuracy, 2) optimized model
and thinking length selection that achieves 4% higher accuracy at equal compute
and 55% less compute at equal accuracy compared to the largest model, 3)
adaptive test-time scaling, which increases accuracy by 11% in high compute
regime, and 7% in low compute regime. Re-FORC allows dynamic reasoning with
length control via cost-per-token thresholds while estimating computation time
upfront.

### [90] [Personalized Decision Modeling: Utility Optimization or Textualized-Symbolic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02194)
*Yibo Zhao,Yang Zhao,Hongru Du,Hao Frank Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ATHENA: a two-stage, human-centric decision model using LLM-augmented symbolic utilities plus personalized semantic adaptation, yielding robust predictions in travel/vaccine choices.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Decision-making models often diverge from population optima due to individualistic factors. There is a need to fuse symbolic utility modeling with textual reasoning to capture both quantitative cues and linguistic influences in high-stakes choices like vaccination and travel decisions.

Method: A two-stage framework: (1) LLM-augmented symbolic discovery to derive robust group-level symbolic utility functions; (2) individual-level semantic adaptation to create personalized templates guided by the optimal utility, enabling personalized choices.

Result: Validated on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks; ATHENA consistently outperforms utility-based, ML, and other LLM-based models, achieving at least 6.5% higher F1 over the strongest cutting-edge models. Ablation studies show both stages are critical for performance.

Conclusion: Integrates symbolic utility modeling with semantic adaptation to form a new scheme for human-centric decision modeling, bridging population-level utility with individual linguistic adaptation; demonstrated effectiveness on two real-world tasks and supported by ablations.

Abstract: Decision-making models for individuals, particularly in high-stakes scenarios
like vaccine uptake, often diverge from population optimal predictions. This
gap arises from the uniqueness of the individual decision-making process,
shaped by numerical attributes (e.g., cost, time) and linguistic influences
(e.g., personal preferences and constraints). Developing upon Utility Theory
and leveraging the textual-reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), this paper proposes an Adaptive Textual-symbolic Human-centric
Reasoning framework (ATHENA) to address the optimal information integration.
ATHENA uniquely integrates two stages: First, it discovers robust, group-level
symbolic utility functions via LLM-augmented symbolic discovery; Second, it
implements individual-level semantic adaptation, creating personalized semantic
templates guided by the optimal utility to model personalized choices.
Validated on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks, ATHENA
consistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based
models, lifting F1 score by at least 6.5% over the strongest cutting-edge
models. Further, ablation studies confirm that both stages of ATHENA are
critical and complementary, as removing either clearly degrades overall
predictive performance. By organically integrating symbolic utility modeling
and semantic adaptation, ATHENA provides a new scheme for modeling
human-centric decisions. The project page can be found at

TL;DR: STRMAC introduces a state-aware router for LLM-based multi-agent systems that adaptively selects the best single agent at each step, with separate encodings for interaction history and agent knowledge, plus self-evolving data generation; yields state-of-the-art collaborative reasoning results and major data-efficiency gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rigid agent scheduling and inefficient coordination hinder performance in multi-agent LLM systems; adaptive routing that responds to evolving task requirements is needed.

Method: Encode interaction history and agent knowledge separately to power a router; at each step, adaptively select the most suitable single agent; employ self-evolving data generation to accelerate collection of high-quality execution paths for training.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on challenging collaborative reasoning benchmarks; up to 23.8% improvement over baselines; data-collection overhead reduced by up to 90.1% versus exhaustive search.

Conclusion: State-aware routing with modular encodings and self-evolving data generation effectively enhances collaboration in multi-agent LLM systems, offering notable performance and data-efficiency gains.

Abstract: The emergence of multi-agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs)
has unlocked new frontiers in complex task-solving, enabling diverse agents to
integrate unique expertise, collaborate flexibly, and address challenges
unattainable for individual models. However, the full potential of such systems
is hindered by rigid agent scheduling and inefficient coordination strategies
that fail to adapt to evolving task requirements. In this paper, we propose
STRMAC, a state-aware routing framework designed for efficient collaboration in
multi-agent systems. Our method separately encodes interaction history and
agent knowledge to power the router, which adaptively selects the most suitable
single agent at each step for efficient and effective collaboration.
Furthermore, we introduce a self-evolving data generation approach that
accelerates the collection of high-quality execution paths for efficient system
training. Experiments on challenging collaborative reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving up
to 23.8% improvement over baselines and reducing data collection overhead by up
to 90.1% compared to exhaustive search.

TL;DR: PPP combines a UserVille simulated environment with multi-objective RL to optimize Productivity, Proactivity, and Personalization, achieving notable gains over baselines by focusing on user-centered interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing work prioritizes task success; real-world agents must balance completing tasks, asking essential questions, and adapting to diverse user preferences; a richer user model is needed.

Method: Introduce UserVille, an interactive environment with LLM-based user simulators; formulate PPP as a multi-objective RL objective over Productivity, Proactivity, and Personalization; evaluate on software engineering and deep research tasks against strong baselines.

Result: PPP-trained agents show substantial improvements over baselines (average +21.6), demonstrating strategic clarifying questions, adaptation to unseen preferences, and improved task success.

Conclusion: Explicitly optimizing for user-centered interaction is essential for practical, effective AI agents; the PPP+UserVille framework enables modeling diverse user needs and enhancing real-world performance.

Abstract: While existing work focuses primarily on task success, we argue that
effective real-world agents require optimizing three dimensions: productivity
(task completion), proactivity (asking essential questions), and
personalization (adapting to diverse user preferences). We introduce UserVille,
an interactive environment with LLM-based user simulators enabling diverse,
configurable user preferences. Leveraging UserVille, we introduce PPP, a
multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that jointly optimizes all
three dimensions: Productivity, Proactivity, and Personalization. Experiments
on software engineering and deep research tasks show that agents trained with
PPP achieve substantial improvements over strong baselines such as GPT-5 (+21.6
on average), demonstrating the ability to ask strategic clarifying questions,
adapt to unseen user preferences, and improve task success through better
interaction. This work demonstrates that explicitly optimizing for
user-centered interaction is critical for building practical and effective AI
agents.

TL;DR: A three-component framework (query decomposer, table sanitizer, PoT-based reasoner) for complex tabular numerical reasoning, introducing CalTab151 for unbiased evaluation, achieving SOTA gains on standard benchmarks, and easy integration with popular LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with complex, multi-step numerical reasoning over noisy tabular data due to limited numerical capabilities and data leakage concerns; there is a need for robust preprocessing, decomposition, and reasoning mechanisms to improve performance.

Method: Proposes a framework called \method comprising: (1) a query decomposer to break down complex questions; (2) a table sanitizer to clean and filter noisy tables; (3) a program-of-thoughts (PoT) based reasoner that generates executable code to derive the final answer from the sanitized table; introduces CalTab151 dataset to ensure unbiased evaluation and mitigate data leakage.

Result: Empirical results show consistent improvements, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy gains of 8.79%, 6.08%, and 19.87% on TAT-QA, TableBench, and CalTab151, respectively, demonstrating strong performance and seamless integration with mainstream LLMs.

Conclusion: The framework effectively enhances LLM-based complex tabular numerical reasoning and provides a robust, leakage-resistant benchmark via CalTab151, supporting broader applicability and strong performance gains across benchmarks.

Abstract: Complex reasoning over tabular data is crucial in real-world data analysis,
yet large language models (LLMs) often underperform due to complex queries,
noisy data, and limited numerical capabilities. To address these issues, we
propose \method, a framework consisting of: (1) a query decomposer that breaks
down complex questions, (2) a table sanitizer that cleans and filters noisy
tables, and (3) a program-of-thoughts (PoT)-based reasoner that generates
executable code to derive the final answer from the sanitized table. To ensure
unbiased evaluation and mitigate data leakage, we introduce a new dataset,
CalTab151, specifically designed for complex numerical reasoning over tables.
Experimental results demonstrate that \method consistently outperforms existing

19.87% accuracy improvement on TAT-QA, TableBench, and \method, respectively.
Moreover, our framework integrates seamlessly with mainstream LLMs, providing a

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Deep Ideation introduces a framework that augments LLM-based ideation with a scientific knowledge network and an iterative explore-expand-evolve workflow, using an Idea Stack and a critic engine to improve novelty and feasibility of ideas.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current ideation methods rely on keyword co-occurrence or semantic similarity and often neglect rich contextual relations in science literature. Models’ internal knowledge alone is insufficient for grounded, novel ideas. There is a need to ground ideation in a scientific concept network.

Method: Proposes the Deep Ideation framework that builds a scientific network capturing keyword co-occurrence and contextual relationships, and employs an explore-expand-evolve workflow with an Idea Stack to track progress. A critic engine, trained on real reviewer feedback, provides continuous novelty/feasibility guidance.

Result: Empirical evaluation reports a 10.67% improvement in idea quality over baselines, ideas reaching top conference acceptance levels, and positive human evaluations; ablations show each component contributes to performance.

Conclusion: Integrating a grounded scientific network with an iterative ideation process and a critic module yields higher-quality, more feasible research ideas, with practical usefulness demonstrated and code released.

Abstract: Novel research ideas play a critical role in advancing scientific inquiries.
Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
potential to generate novel research ideas by leveraging large-scale scientific
literature. However, previous work in research ideation has primarily relied on
simplistic methods, such as keyword co-occurrence or semantic similarity. These
approaches focus on identifying statistical associations in the literature but
overlook the complex, contextual relationships between scientific concepts,
which are essential to effectively leverage knowledge embedded in human
literature. For instance, papers that simultaneously mention "keyword A" and
"keyword B" often present research ideas that integrate both concepts.
Additionally, some LLM-driven methods propose and refine research ideas using
the model's internal knowledge, but they fail to effectively utilize the
scientific concept network, limiting the grounding of ideas in established
research. To address these challenges, we propose the Deep Ideation framework
to address these challenges, integrating a scientific network that captures
keyword co-occurrence and contextual relationships, enriching LLM-driven
ideation. The framework introduces an explore-expand-evolve workflow to
iteratively refine research ideas, using an Idea Stack to track progress. A
critic engine, trained on real-world reviewer feedback, guides the process by
providing continuous feedback on the novelty and feasibility of ideas. Our
experiments show that our approach improves the quality of generated ideas by
10.67% compared to other methods, with ideas surpassing top conference
acceptance levels. Human evaluation highlights their practical value in
scientific research, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each
component in the workflow. Code repo is available at

### [95] [When Modalities Conflict: How Unimodal Reasoning Uncertainty Governs Preference Dynamics in MLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02243)
*Zhuoran Zhang,Tengyue Wang,Xilin Gong,Yang Shi,Haotian Wang,Di Wang,Lijie Hu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a principled two-factor framework for modality following in multimodal LLMs, decomposing it into relative reasoning uncertainty and inherent modality preference; introduces a controllable dataset and entropy-based uncertainty metric, uncovers a universal law: following probability decreases as relative uncertainty rises; identifies a balance point to quantify inherent bias and reveals layer-wise oscillation near balance points explaining indecision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs often receive conflicting cues across modalities. Existing evaluations rely on coarse, dataset-level statistics and conflate unimodal abilities with cross-modal reasoning. A principled, disentangled understanding of when and why models follow a modality is needed to diagnose bias and improve robustness.

Method: Develop a two-factor framework (relative reasoning uncertainty and inherent modality preference). Create a controllable dataset that systematically varies visual/text reasoning difficulty. Use entropy as a fine-grained metric of uncertainty. Measure the probability of following each modality and identify a balance point. Conduct layer-wise analysis to observe oscillation between modalities in ambiguous regions.

Result: Established a universal law: the probability of following a modality decreases monotonically with its relative uncertainty. At the balance point, the model shows no strong inherent bias, providing a practical indicator of intrinsic modality preference. Layer-wise predictions reveal oscillations between modalities in ambiguous regions near balance points, explaining externally observed indecision. The framework disentangles modality bias from unimodal capabilities and dataset artifacts.

Conclusion: Relative uncertainty and inherent preference jointly govern modality following in MLLMs. The framework offers a principled way to quantify and diagnose cross-modal bias, with implications for training and evaluation protocols. It also provides mechanistic insight into how indecision emerges across layers. Limitations may include reliance on the entropy proxy and the generalizability of the controllable dataset across architectures.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) must resolve conflicts when
different modalities provide contradictory information, a process we term
modality following. Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse
dataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in
unimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes
modality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty
(the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent
modality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To
validate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that
systematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.
Using entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:
the probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative
uncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends
to follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance
point, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike
traditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less
confounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal
capabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,
we reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the
balance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining
externally observed indecision. Together, these findings establish relative
uncertainty and inherent preference as the two governing principles of modality
following, offering both a quantitative framework and mechanistic insight into
how MLLMs resolve conflicting information.

### [96] [Unlocking the Power of Multi-Agent LLM for Reasoning: From Lazy Agents to Deliberation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02303)
*Zhiwei Zhang,Xiaomin Li,Yudi Lin,Hui Liu,Ramraj Chandradevan,Linlin Wu,Minhua Lin,Fali Wang,Xianfeng Tang,Qi He,Suhang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Addresses lazy-agent collapse in two-agent LLM reasoning by (1) analyzing why it happens, (2) measuring causal influence to curb it, and (3) a verifiable reward to promote deliberate, restartable reasoning. Empirically, it improves collaboration and performance on complex tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-agent reasoning with meta-thinking and reasoning agents risks one agent dominating, harming collaboration and task performance. A reliable framework is needed to (a) diagnose why lazy behavior emerges, (b) monitor and balance influence between agents, and (c) encourage deliberate, noise-resistant reasoning with verifiable rewards.

Method: 1) Theoretical analysis of why lazy behavior arises in multi-agent reasoning. 2) Propose a stable, efficient method to measure causal influence between agents. 3) Introduce a verifiable reward mechanism that lets the reasoning agent discard noisy outputs, consolidate instructions, and restart reasoning when needed.

Result: Empirical results show reduced lazy-agent behavior, better collaboration, and improved performance on complex reasoning tasks when using the proposed measurement of causal influence and verifiable reward framework.

Conclusion: The framework mitigates lazy behavior and enhances the effectiveness of multi-agent reasoning by promoting balanced collaboration, robust deliberation, and the ability to recover from noisy interference; it offers a path toward more reliable multi-agent LLM systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement learning and
verifiable rewards have achieved strong results on complex reasoning tasks.
Recent work extends this paradigm to a multi-agent setting, where a
meta-thinking agent proposes plans and monitors progress while a reasoning
agent executes subtasks through sequential conversational turns. Despite
promising performance, we identify a critical limitation: lazy agent behavior,
in which one agent dominates while the other contributes little, undermining
collaboration and collapsing the setup to an ineffective single agent. In this
paper, we first provide a theoretical analysis showing why lazy behavior
naturally arises in multi-agent reasoning. We then introduce a stable and
efficient method for measuring causal influence, helping mitigate this issue.
Finally, as collaboration intensifies, the reasoning agent risks getting lost
in multi-turn interactions and trapped by previous noisy responses. To counter
this, we propose a verifiable reward mechanism that encourages deliberation by
allowing the reasoning agent to discard noisy outputs, consolidate
instructions, and restart its reasoning process when necessary. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework alleviates lazy agent behavior and
unlocks the full potential of multi-agent framework for complex reasoning
tasks.

*Yohan Lee,DongGyun Kang,SeHoon Park,Sa-Yoon Park,Kwangsoo Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A transformer-based, multi-modal EHR framework (ProQ-BERT) predicts CKD progression with leading performance on a large real-world cohort, achieving near-perfect short-term ROC-AUC and PR-AUC.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CKD affects ~10% of the global population and progression to end-stage renal failure requires timely, accurate prognosis to guide interventions and resource allocation. Existing models may not effectively leverage multi-modal EHR data and temporal information.

Method: ProQ-BERT is a transformer-based framework that ingests multi-modal EHR data from the Seoul National University Hospital OMOP CDM. It uses quantization-based tokenization for continuous laboratory values and attention mechanisms for interpretability. The model is pretrained with masked language modeling and fine-tuned on binary classification tasks predicting progression from CKD stage 3a to stage 5 across different follow-up/assessment windows.

Result: Evaluated on 91,816 patients, ProQ-BERT consistently outperformed CEHR-BERT, achieving ROC-AUC up to 0.995 and PR-AUC up to 0.989 for short-term predictions.

Conclusion: Transformer architectures and temporal design choices are effective for clinical prognosis in CKD, offering a promising direction for personalized CKD care.

Abstract: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects nearly 10\% of the global population and
often progresses to end-stage renal failure. Accurate prognosis prediction is
vital for timely interventions and resource optimization. We present a
transformer-based framework for predicting CKD progression using multi-modal
electronic health records (EHR) from the Seoul National University Hospital
OMOP Common Data Model. Our approach (\textbf{ProQ-BERT}) integrates
demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, employing quantization-based
tokenization for continuous lab values and attention mechanisms for
interpretability. The model was pretrained with masked language modeling and
fine-tuned for binary classification tasks predicting progression from stage 3a
to stage 5 across varying follow-up and assessment periods. Evaluated on a
cohort of 91,816 patients, our model consistently outperformed CEHR-BERT,
achieving ROC-AUC up to 0.995 and PR-AUC up to 0.989 for short-term prediction.
These results highlight the effectiveness of transformer architectures and
temporal design choices in clinical prognosis modeling, offering a promising
direction for personalized CKD care.

*Muhammad Sheharyar Liaqat*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A fuzzy soft set theory-based expert system estimates breast cancer risk from non-invasive clinical parameters (BMI, insulin, leptin, adiponectin, age) to aid screening and biopsy decisions, validated on a UCI dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of breast cancer is critical, but timely diagnosis is challenging and current methods can be invasive or resource-intensive. There is a need for an accessible, non-invasive risk assessment tool that handles uncertainty in risk factors using fuzzy soft set theory.

Method: Develop an expert system combining fuzzy inference with soft set theory. Input variables BMI, insulin level, leptin, adiponectin, and age feed into a rule-based fuzzy system with soft-set computations, trained/validated on a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Result: The paper reports the development and validation of the system on the UCI dataset; specific performance metrics are not provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: The system offers a non-invasive, accessible tool to help healthcare professionals identify high-risk patients and decide on further diagnostics such as biopsies.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality among women
worldwide, with early diagnosis being critical for effective treatment and
improved survival rates. However, timely detection continues to be a challenge
due to the complex nature of the disease and variability in patient risk
factors. This study presents a fuzzy soft set theory-based expert system
designed to assess the risk of breast cancer in patients using measurable
clinical and physiological parameters. The proposed system integrates Body Mass
Index, Insulin Level, Leptin Level, Adiponectin Level, and age as input
variables to estimate breast cancer risk through a set of fuzzy inference rules
and soft set computations. These parameters can be obtained from routine blood
analyses, enabling a non-invasive and accessible method for preliminary
assessment. The dataset used for model development and validation was obtained
from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The proposed expert system aims to
support healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients and
determining the necessity of further diagnostic procedures such as biopsies.

### [99] [A New Perspective on Precision and Recall for Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02414)
*Benjamin Sykes,Loïc Simon,Julien Rabin,Jalal Fadili*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A new binary-classification-based framework to estimate entire PR curves for generative models, providing theoretical guarantees (a minimax upper bound on PR estimation risk), unifying existing PR metrics, and supported by empirical studies across settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluating generative models has largely relied on scalar metrics, which miss the fuller picture. PR curves offer richer analysis but their estimation is challenging. This work introduces a principled framework to estimate complete PR curves with theoretical guarantees.

Method: Formulate PR-curve estimation as a binary classification problem and develop estimators for the full PR curve. Perform thorough statistical analysis of these estimators, derive a minimax upper bound on PR estimation risk, and show how the framework extends landmark PR metrics that are restricted to extreme curve values.

Result: The estimators come with statistical guarantees, including a minimax upper bound on estimation risk. The framework subsumes and extends existing PR metrics, recovering their extreme cases. Experimental results illustrate distinct curve behaviors under different settings.

Conclusion: This framework provides a principled, extensible approach to estimating PR curves for generative models, combining theoretical guarantees with empirical validation and unifying previous metrics under a single binary-classification-based perspective.

Abstract: With the recent success of generative models in image and text, the question
of their evaluation has recently gained a lot of attention. While most methods
from the state of the art rely on scalar metrics, the introduction of Precision
and Recall (PR) for generative model has opened up a new avenue of research.
The associated PR curve allows for a richer analysis, but their estimation
poses several challenges. In this paper, we present a new framework for
estimating entire PR curves based on a binary classification standpoint. We
conduct a thorough statistical analysis of the proposed estimates. As a
byproduct, we obtain a minimax upper bound on the PR estimation risk. We also
show that our framework extends several landmark PR metrics of the literature
which by design are restrained to the extreme values of the curve. Finally, we
study the different behaviors of the curves obtained experimentally in various
settings.

### [100] [ReAcTree: Hierarchical LLM Agent Trees with Control Flow for Long-Horizon Task Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02424)
*Jae-Woo Choi,Hyungmin Kim,Hyobin Ong,Minsu Jang,Dohyung Kim,Jaehong Kim,Youngwoo Yoon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReAcTree introduces a hierarchical, memory-guided task-planning framework that decomposes complex goals into subgoals managed by LLM agent nodes within a dynamic agent tree, achieving substantial gains over ReAct on embodied planning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monolithic trajectory planning struggles with long-horizon tasks; there is a need to decompose goals into manageable subgoals, guided by a dynamic structure and enhanced memory to handle past decisions and environment context.

Method: A hierarchical architecture with agent nodes that reason, act, and expand a dynamic agent tree, and control-flow nodes that coordinate execution strategies. It incorporates two memory systems: episodic memory for goal-specific subgoal examples and working memory for environment observations, enabling goal-directed retrieval and environment awareness.

Result: The approach consistently outperforms strong task-planning baselines like ReAct across diverse LLMs on WAH-NL and ALFRED. On WAH-NL with Qwen 2.5 72B, it achieves 61% goal success, nearly doubling ReAct’s 31%.

Conclusion: Hierarchical planning with memory effectively addresses long-horizon decision tasks in embodied settings, offering robust performance gains across models and suggesting broad applicability to complex planning domains.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enabled significant
progress in decision-making and task planning for embodied autonomous agents.
However, most existing methods still struggle with complex, long-horizon tasks
because they rely on a monolithic trajectory that entangles all past decisions
and observations, attempting to solve the entire task in a single unified
process. To address this limitation, we propose ReAcTree, a hierarchical
task-planning method that decomposes a complex goal into more manageable
subgoals within a dynamically constructed agent tree. Each subgoal is handled
by an LLM agent node capable of reasoning, acting, and further expanding the
tree, while control flow nodes coordinate the execution strategies of agent
nodes. In addition, we integrate two complementary memory systems: each agent
node retrieves goal-specific, subgoal-level examples from episodic memory and
shares environment-specific observations through working memory. Experiments on
the WAH-NL and ALFRED datasets demonstrate that ReAcTree consistently
outperforms strong task-planning baselines such as ReAct across diverse LLMs.
Notably, on WAH-NL, ReAcTree achieves a 61% goal success rate with Qwen 2.5
72B, nearly doubling ReAct's 31%.

*Mengyu Zhang,Xubo Liu,Siyu Ding,Weichong Yin,Yu Sun,Hua Wu,Wenya Guo,Ying Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Verifiable Multiple-Choice Reformulation (VMR) to extend RLVR to open-ended tasks by turning open-ended data into verifiable multiple-choice formats, enabling training without explicit ground truth; shows improvements across eight open-ended benchmarks (avg +5.99 points).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR relies on verifiers that assume ground-truth answers; open-ended tasks lack such answers, making RLVR inapplicable. The work seeks to sustain reasoning-driven improvement in open-domain tasks by bridging the verification requirement.

Method: Proposes Verifiable Multiple-Choice Reformulation (VMR) that restructures open-ended data into verifiable MC formats, enabling verifiable training without explicit ground truth; evaluates the approach on eight open-ended benchmarks with reported gains.

Result: VMR-based training yields an average improvement of 5.99 points over baselines across eight open-ended benchmarks, validating effectiveness in open-domain reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: VMR enables applying RLVR to open-ended tasks by leveraging verifiable MC reformulations, yielding performance gains and offering a path for reproducibility (code to be released).

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has demonstrated great
potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs), achieving remarkable progress in domains such as mathematics and
programming where standard answers are available. However, for open-ended tasks
lacking ground-truth solutions (e.g., creative writing and instruction
following), existing studies typically regard them as non-reasoning scenarios,
thereby overlooking the latent value of reasoning capabilities. This raises a
key question: Can strengthening reasoning improve performance in open-ended
tasks? To address this, we explore the transfer of the RLVR paradigm to the
open domain. Yet, since RLVR fundamentally relies on verifiers that presuppose
the existence of standard answers, it cannot be directly applied to open-ended
tasks. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Verifiable Multiple-Choice
Reformulation (VMR), a novel training strategy that restructures open-ended
data into verifiable multiple-choice formats, enabling effective training even
in the absence of explicit ground truth. Experimental results on multiple
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LLM
performance on open-ended tasks. Notably, across eight open-ended benchmarks,
our VMR-based training delivers an average gain of 5.99 points over the
baseline. Code will be released upon acceptance to facilitate reproducibility.

*Jorge Pellejero,Luis A. Hernández Gómez,Luis Mendo Tomás,Zoraida Frias Barroso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentic AI is presented as a framework for autonomous, multimodal LAM-driven agents with planning, memory, tool use, and collaboration, applied to 5G/6G RAN optimization; core concepts are outlined and a KPI-driven case study demonstrates practical use.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual optimization of dynamic 5G/6G networks is infeasible; there is no widely accepted foundational framework for Agentic AI in telecommunications, necessitating a principled concept set and demonstrable application.

Method: Conceptual exposition of Agentic AI evolution from classical agents; identification of core design patterns (reflection, planning, tool use, multi-agent collaboration); grounding in mobile networks with a practical 5G RAN case study employing time-series analytics and LAM-driven agents for KPI-based autonomous decisions.

Result: Provides a foundational conceptual framework for Agentic AI in networks and demonstrates a practical RAN optimization use case.

Conclusion: Agentic AI is a promising paradigm for automating complex RAN decisions, but a universal, precise framework remains lacking; the work clarifies core concepts and shows applicability in 5G/6G RAN scenarios.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a new paradigm for automating complex systems by using
Large AI Models (LAMs) to provide human-level cognitive abilities with
multimodal perception, planning, memory, and reasoning capabilities. This will
lead to a new generation of AI systems that autonomously decompose goals,
retain context over time, learn continuously, operate across tools and
environments, and adapt dynamically. The complexity of 5G and upcoming 6G
networks renders manual optimization ineffective, pointing to Agentic AI as a
method for automating decisions in dynamic RAN environments. However, despite
its rapid advances, there is no established framework outlining the
foundational components and operational principles of Agentic AI systems nor a
universally accepted definition.
  This paper contributes to ongoing research on Agentic AI in 5G and 6G
networks by outlining its core concepts and then proposing a practical use case
that applies Agentic principles to RAN optimization. We first introduce Agentic
AI, tracing its evolution from classical agents and discussing the progress
from workflows and simple AI agents to Agentic AI. Core design
patterns-reflection, planning, tool use, and multi-agent collaboration-are then
described to illustrate how intelligent behaviors are orchestrated. These
theorical concepts are grounded in the context of mobile networks, with a focus
on RAN management and optimization. A practical 5G RAN case study shows how
time-series analytics and LAM-driven agents collaborate for KPI-based
autonomous decision-making.

*Enhong Mu,Jinyu Cai,Yijun Lu,Mingyue Zhang,Kenji Tei,Jialong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: KLPEG uses a knowledge graph to accumulate game knowledge across versions and guide LLM-based testing to generate update-specific test cases, improving accuracy and efficiency in incremental game testing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Frequent updates in modern video games challenge testing efficiency; existing LLM-based playtesting lacks structured knowledge reuse across versions.

Method: Build and maintain a Knowledge Graph capturing game elements, task dependencies, and causal relationships; parse natural language update logs with LLMs; perform multi-hop reasoning on the KG to identify the scope of impact; generate update-tailored test cases.

Result: KLPEG more accurately locates functionalities affected by updates and completes tests in fewer steps, showing improved effectiveness and efficiency in playtesting.

Conclusion: Knowledge-graph-based knowledge accumulation combined with LLM-driven reasoning enhances incremental game testing and has broader applicability beyond the studied environments.

Abstract: The rapid iteration and frequent updates of modern video games pose
significant challenges to the efficiency and specificity of testing. Although
automated playtesting methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
promise, they often lack structured knowledge accumulation mechanisms, making
it difficult to conduct precise and efficient testing tailored for incremental
game updates. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a KLPEG framework.
The framework constructs and maintains a Knowledge Graph (KG) to systematically
model game elements, task dependencies, and causal relationships, enabling
knowledge accumulation and reuse across versions. Building on this foundation,
the framework utilizes LLMs to parse natural language update logs, identify the
scope of impact through multi-hop reasoning on the KG, enabling the generation
of update-tailored test cases. Experiments in two representative game
environments, Overcooked and Minecraft, demonstrate that KLPEG can more
accurately locate functionalities affected by updates and complete tests in
fewer steps, significantly improving both playtesting effectiveness and
efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ORCA benchmarks LLMs on real-world, multi-domain quantitative reasoning using a verified calculator; five SOTA models achieve 45–63% accuracy on 500 tasks, with major rounding (35%) and calculation (33%) errors; reveals domain strengths/weaknesses and partial model complementarity; emphasizes step-by-step reasoning and numerical precision beyond standard math datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To measure LLM quantitative reasoning across real-world domains with precise numerical outputs, assess generalization and error patterns, and push numerical reasoning beyond synthetic math datasets.

Method: 500 natural-language tasks spanning finance, physics, health, and statistics; uses Omni's calculator engine for verified outputs; evaluate five SOTA models (ChatGPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Grok 4, DeepSeek V3.2); analyze error types (rounding, calculation), domain performance, correlations among model errors; assess step-by-step reasoning, numerical precision, domain generalization.

Result: Accuracy 45–63%; rounding 35%, calculation mistakes 33%; physics and natural sciences weaker; strengths in mathematics and engineering; correlation r ~ 0.40–0.65; models fail together but differ in error types; partial complementarity; ORCA evaluates step-by-step reasoning and numerical precision, unlike standard math datasets.

Conclusion: ORCA reveals current LLMs' limited ability for real-world quantitative reasoning and precision; potential benefits from model complementarity; benchmark can drive progress in numerical reasoning, cross-domain generalization, and robust calculation across finance, physics, health, and statistics.

Abstract: We present ORCA (Omni Research on Calculation in AI) Benchmark -- a novel
benchmark that evaluates large language models (LLMs) on multi-domain,
real-life quantitative reasoning using verified outputs from Omni's calculator
engine. In 500 natural-language tasks across domains such as finance, physics,
health, and statistics, the five state-of-the-art systems (ChatGPT-5,
Gemini~2.5~Flash, Claude~Sonnet~4.5, Grok~4, and DeepSeek~V3.2) achieved only
$45\text{--}63\,\%$ accuracy, with errors mainly related to rounding ($35\,\%$)
and calculation mistakes ($33\,\%$). Results in specific domains indicate
strengths in mathematics and engineering, but weaknesses in physics and natural
sciences. Correlation analysis ($r \approx 0.40\text{--}0.65$) shows that the
models often fail together but differ in the types of errors they make,
highlighting their partial complementarity rather than redundancy. Unlike
standard math datasets, ORCA evaluates step-by-step reasoning, numerical
precision, and domain generalization across real problems from finance,
physics, health, and statistics.

*Tiberiu-Andrei Georgescu,Alexander W. Goodall,Dalal Alrajeh,Francesco Belardinelli,Sebastian Uchitel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An adaptive shielding framework for reinforcement learning using GR(1) specifications that detects runtime environment assumption violations and repairs specifications online with Inductive Logic Programming, yielding shields that adapt to maintain liveness while not sacrificing rewards; case studies (Minepump, Atari Seaquest) show near-optimal rewards and perfect safety compliance versus static shields.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome rigidity of static shields that assume fixed specifications and environment models, by enabling runtime detection of assumption violations and online repair to preserve liveness and safety while allowing progress.

Method: Runtime monitoring of environment assumptions under GR(1) (a tractable LTL fragment for safety and liveness), ILP-based online repair to synthesize updated GR(1) specifications, producing an adaptive shield that weakens goals only as needed and ensures graceful degradation. Case studies demonstrate applicability to Minepump and Atari Seaquest.

Result: Adaptive shields allow RL agents to achieve near-optimal rewards while maintaining perfect logical compliance, outperforming static shields which are suboptimal under auxiliary rewards.

Conclusion: Adaptive shielding with online repair extends GR(1)-based safety to non-nominal environments, enabling safe, efficient learning that adapts as assumptions fail; promising for broader adoption in safety-critical RL.

Abstract: Shielding is widely used to enforce safety in reinforcement learning (RL),
ensuring that an agent's actions remain compliant with formal specifications.
Classical shielding approaches, however, are often static, in the sense that
they assume fixed logical specifications and hand-crafted abstractions. While
these static shields provide safety under nominal assumptions, they fail to
adapt when environment assumptions are violated. In this paper, we develop the
first adaptive shielding framework - to the best of our knowledge - based on
Generalized Reactivity of rank 1 (GR(1)) specifications, a tractable and
expressive fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) that captures both safety
and liveness properties. Our method detects environment assumption violations
at runtime and employs Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to automatically
repair GR(1) specifications online, in a systematic and interpretable way. This
ensures that the shield evolves gracefully, ensuring liveness is achievable and
weakening goals only when necessary. We consider two case studies: Minepump and
Atari Seaquest; showing that (i) static symbolic controllers are often severely
suboptimal when optimizing for auxiliary rewards, and (ii) RL agents equipped
with our adaptive shield maintain near-optimal reward and perfect logical
compliance compared with static shields.

TL;DR: A transparent, theory-grounded multi-agent cognitive-affective simulation with an inner parliament that generates human-like behavior for education and training, contrasting with black-box neural models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for authentic, realistically behaving agents in human-centered training, but black-box neural models struggle with transparency and alignment to established psychology. This work aims to provide explainable, psychology-grounded simulations to enhance practice, research, and teaching.

Method: Develop a multi-agent system that simulates internal cognitive-affective processes. An 'inner parliament' of agents corresponding to key psychological factors deliberates and interacts to determine the system output. Grounded in theories such as self-efficacy, mindset, and social constructivism. Describes architecture and theoretical foundations, with illustrations of use in teacher training and research, highlighting alignment with social learning, cognitive apprenticeship, deliberate practice, and metacognition.

Result: Describes a system and its theoretical foundations, with use-case illustrations in teacher training and research. No empirical results are reported in the abstract; the contribution is a transparent, theory-grounded framework and prototype for authentic practice.

Conclusion: The approach promotes transparency and alignment with human psychology, embedding social learning, cognitive apprenticeship, deliberate practice, and meta-cognition. It provides a foundation for authentic practice in human-centered education and research.

Abstract: Training and education in human-centered fields require authentic practice,
yet realistic simulations of human behavior have remained limited. We present a
multi-agent psychological simulation system that models internal
cognitive-affective processes to generate believable human behaviors. In
contrast to black-box neural models, this system is grounded in established
psychological theories (e.g., self-efficacy, mindset, social constructivism)
and explicitly simulates an ``inner parliament'' of agents corresponding to key
psychological factors. These agents deliberate and interact to determine the
system's output behavior, enabling unprecedented transparency and alignment
with human psychology. We describe the system's architecture and theoretical
foundations, illustrate its use in teacher training and research, and discuss
how it embodies principles of social learning, cognitive apprenticeship,
deliberate practice, and meta-cognition.

*Lachlan McPheat,Navdeep Kaur,Robert Blackwell,Alessandra Russo,Anthony G. Cohn,Pranava Madhyastha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DecompSR is a large, procedurally generated benchmark for decomposed spatial reasoning with over 5 million datapoints, enabling independent control of productivity, substitutivity, overgeneralisation, and systematicity. It is correctness-verified by a symbolic solver and reveals that LLMs struggle with productive and systematic generalisation in spatial tasks, while resisting linguistic variation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To rigorously probe the compositional spatial reasoning abilities of LLMs by decoupling key aspects of compositionality and ensuring dataset correctness, addressing limitations of existing benchmarks.

Method: Procedurally generate a spatial reasoning benchmark (DecompSR) with controllable factors: productivity (reasoning depth), substitutivity (entity/linguistic variability), overgeneralisation (input order, distractors), and systematicity (novel linguistic elements); correctness-by-construction verified using a symbolic solver.

Result: DecompSR provides a provably correct, scalable benchmark that enables fine-grained probing of LLMs’ compositional reasoning; across many LLMs, productivity and systematic generalisation are the main weaknesses, with linguistic variation showing more robustness.

Conclusion: DecompSR offers a rigorous, modular benchmarking framework for assessing compositional reasoning in LLMs, enabling controlled experiments and guiding future research to improve productive and systematic generalisation in spatial reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce DecompSR, decomposed spatial reasoning, a large benchmark
dataset (over 5m datapoints) and generation framework designed to analyse
compositional spatial reasoning ability. The generation of DecompSR allows
users to independently vary several aspects of compositionality, namely:
productivity (reasoning depth), substitutivity (entity and linguistic
variability), overgeneralisation (input order, distractors) and systematicity
(novel linguistic elements). DecompSR is built procedurally in a manner which
makes it is correct by construction, which is independently verified using a
symbolic solver to guarantee the correctness of the dataset. DecompSR is
comprehensively benchmarked across a host of Large Language Models (LLMs) where
we show that LLMs struggle with productive and systematic generalisation in
spatial reasoning tasks whereas they are more robust to linguistic variation.
DecompSR provides a provably correct and rigorous benchmarking dataset with a
novel ability to independently vary the degrees of several key aspects of
compositionality, allowing for robust and fine-grained probing of the
compositional reasoning abilities of LLMs.

### [108] [The Collaboration Gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02687)
*Tim R. Davidson,Adam Fourney,Saleema Amershi,Robert West,Eric Horvitz,Ece Kamar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Collaboration gap exists in agent AI: models that solve tasks well solo often degrade when collaborating; relay inference (stronger agent leads, then hands off) helps close much of the gap; emphasizes need for collaboration-aware evaluation and training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To study how heterogeneous AI agents collaborate under partial observability, addressing a gap in empirical evaluation of AI-AI collaboration at scale and informing how to design for robust inter-agent collaboration.

Method: Introduce a collaborative maze-solving benchmark that isolates collaboration, scales with problem complexity, enables automated grading, and allows unrestricted outputs. Evaluate 32 models across solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings to quantify collaboration performance and failure modes.

Result: A pronounced collaboration gap is observed: solvers that perform well alone can perform poorly when paired; collaboration can fail dramatically for some pairings, including small distilled models. A relay inference strategy—starting with the stronger agent and handing off to a weaker one—substantially closes the gap.

Conclusion: Call for collaboration-aware evaluation, development of training strategies to improve collaborative capability, and interaction designs that reliably elicit latent agent skills. The findings have implications for AI-AI and human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: The trajectory of AI development suggests that we will increasingly rely on
agent-based systems composed of independently developed agents with different
information, privileges, and tools. The success of these systems will
critically depend on effective collaboration among these heterogeneous agents,
even under partial observability. Despite intense interest, few empirical
studies have evaluated such agent-agent collaboration at scale. We propose a
collaborative maze-solving benchmark that (i) isolates collaborative
capabilities, (ii) modulates problem complexity, (iii) enables scalable
automated grading, and (iv) imposes no output-format constraints, preserving
ecological plausibility. Using this framework, we evaluate 32 leading open- and
closed-source models in solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings. Our
results reveal a "collaboration gap": models that perform well solo often
degrade substantially when required to collaborate. Collaboration can break
down dramatically; for instance, small distilled models that solve mazes well
alone may fail almost completely in certain pairings. We find that starting
with the stronger agent often improves outcomes, motivating a "relay inference"
approach where the stronger agent leads before handing off to the weaker one,
closing much of the gap. Our findings argue for (1) collaboration-aware

### [109] [CostBench: Evaluating Multi-Turn Cost-Optimal Planning and Adaptation in Dynamic Environments for LLM Tool-Use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02734)
*Jiayu Liu,Cheng Qian,Zhaochen Su,Qing Zong,Shijue Huang,Bingxiang He,Yi R. Fung*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CostBench is a scalable benchmark for evaluating cost-aware planning and dynamic replanning in LLM agents within travel planning, revealing notable gaps in economic reasoning even for strong models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current evaluations emphasize task completion and neglect resource efficiency and adaptability, missing essential capabilities for cost-aware decision making in dynamic environments.

Method: A travel-planning benchmark where tasks can be solved via sequences of atomic and composite tools with customizable costs; includes four types of dynamic blocking events (e.g., tool failures, cost changes) to simulate real-world unpredictability and require real-time replanning.

Result: Evaluation of leading open-source and proprietary models shows significant gaps in cost-aware planning; GPT-5 achieves under 75% exact-match on the hardest tasks; performance drops ~40% under dynamic conditions.

Conclusion: CostBench diagnoses weaknesses in current agents, guiding the development of economically rational and robust agents capable of adaptive planning under changing costs and tool availability.

Abstract: Current evaluations of Large Language Model (LLM) agents primarily emphasize
task completion, often overlooking resource efficiency and adaptability. This
neglects a crucial capability: agents' ability to devise and adjust
cost-optimal plans in response to changing environments. To bridge this gap, we
introduce CostBench, a scalable, cost-centric benchmark designed to evaluate
agents' economic reasoning and replanning abilities. Situated in the
travel-planning domain, CostBench comprises tasks solvable via multiple
sequences of atomic and composite tools with diverse, customizable costs. It
also supports four types of dynamic blocking events, such as tool failures and
cost changes, to simulate real-world unpredictability and necessitate agents to
adapt in real time. Evaluating leading open-sourced and proprietary models on
CostBench reveals a substantial gap in cost-aware planning: agents frequently
fail to identify cost-optimal solutions in static settings, with even GPT-5
achieving less than 75% exact match rate on the hardest tasks, and performance
further dropping by around 40% under dynamic conditions. By diagnosing these
weaknesses, CostBench lays the groundwork for developing future agents that are
both economically rational and robust.

### [110] [Using Span Queries to Optimize for Cache and Attention Locality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02749)
*Paul Castro,Nick Mitchell,Nathan Ordonez,Thomas Parnell,Mudhakar Srivatsa,Antoni Viros i Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Span queries generalize the inference-server interface to cover chat, RAG, inference-time scaling, and agentic workloads, enabling commutativity-aware expression trees of inference calls. This unifies diverse workloads and yields large practical gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference servers have been heavily optimized for chat completion, leaving non-chat use cases underserved. A unifying, commutativity-aware interface can improve KV cache locality and overall throughput for a wide range of workloads (chat, RAG, scaling, agents).

Method: Introduce span queries as expression trees of inference calls linked with commutativity constraints. Define syntax and semantics, and show how they can be automatically optimized for KV-cache locality. Implement a small (~492-line) change to vLLM to enable high-performance span-query execution. Demonstrate span queries across chat, RAG, inference-time scaling, and agentic workloads.

Result: Span queries can express chat, RAG, inference-time scaling, and agentic workloads. They achieve 10–20x reductions in TTFT for two non-chat use cases. Attention locality is also improved, mitigating the lost-in-the-middle problem. An attention-optimized span-query on a 2B model vastly outperforms the accuracy of a stock inference server using an 8B model.

Conclusion: Span queries provide a unified, locality-aware interface that enables high-performance execution across diverse inference workloads with modest code changes, offering substantial gains in throughput and accuracy over traditional chat-optimized servers.

Abstract: Clients are evolving beyond chat completion, and now include a variety of
innovative inference-time scaling and deep reasoning techniques. At the same
time, inference servers remain heavily optimized for chat completion. Prior
work has shown that large improvements to KV cache hit rate are possible if
inference servers evolve towards these non-chat use cases. However, they offer
solutions that are also optimized for a single use case, RAG. In this paper, we
introduce the span query to generalize the interface to the inference server.
We demonstrate that chat, RAG, inference-time scaling, and agentic workloads
can all be expressed as span queries. We show how the critical distinction that
had been assumed by prior work lies in whether the order of the inputs matter
-- do they commute? In chat, they do not. In RAG, they often do. This paper
introduces span queries, which are expression trees of inference calls, linked
together with commutativity constraints. We describe span query syntax and
semantics. We show how they can be automatically optimized to improve KV cache
locality. We show how a small change to vLLM (affecting only 492 lines) can
enable high-performance execution of span queries. Using this stack, we
demonstrate that span queries can achieve 10-20x reductions in TTFT for two
distinct non-chat use cases. Finally, we show that span queries can also be
optimized to improve attention locality, so as to avoid the so-called
lost-in-the-middle problem. We demonstrate that an attention-optimized span
query on a 2b parameter model vastly outperforms the accuracy of a stock
inference server using an 8b model.

### [111] [LLM-Supported Formal Knowledge Representation for Enhancing Control Engineering Content with an Interactive Semantic Layer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02759)
*Julius Fiedler,Carsten Knoll,Klaus Röbenack*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces an LLM-assisted semi-automated pipeline that converts natural-language text and LaTeX math into a formal knowledge graph using the PyIRK framework, producing an interactive semantic layer to improve knowledge transfer in control engineering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Control engineering research output is expanding rapidly, making it hard to structure knowledge; there is a need to balance human readability with machine interpretability and to build accessible, verifiable knowledge bases.

Method: Utilizes the Imperative Representation of Knowledge (PyIRK) framework; leverages language models to translate natural-language descriptions and LaTeX definitions into a formal knowledge graph; applies this to generate an interactive semantic layer embedded in source documents for knowledge transfer.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility with a first application: creation of an interactive semantic layer that enhances source documents; shows potential of LLM-assisted formalization to improve knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: This approach advances the vision of easily accessible, collaborative, and verifiable knowledge bases for control engineering.

Abstract: The rapid growth of research output in control engineering calls for new
approaches to structure and formalize domain knowledge. This paper briefly
describes an LLM-supported method for semi-automated generation of formal
knowledge representations that combine human readability with machine
interpretability and increased expressiveness. Based on the Imperative
Representation of Knowledge (PyIRK) framework, we demonstrate how language
models can assist in transforming natural-language descriptions and
mathematical definitions (available as LaTeX source code) into a formalized
knowledge graph. As a first application we present the generation of an
``interactive semantic layer'' to enhance the source documents in order to
facilitate knowledge transfer. From our perspective this contributes to the
vision of easily accessible, collaborative, and verifiable knowledge bases for
the control engineering domain.

### [112] [When One Modality Sabotages the Others: A Diagnostic Lens on Multimodal Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02794)
*Chenyu Zhang,Minsol Kim,Shohreh Ghorbani,Jingyao Wu,Rosalind Picard,Patricia Maes,Paul Pu Liang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A lightweight, model-agnostic diagnostic layer treats each modality as an agent to audit fusion dynamics in multimodal LLMs, identifying saboteurs and contributors to reveal reliability profiles.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs' reasoning traces are opaque; understanding which modality drives predictions, how conflicts are resolved, and when a stream dominates is essential for diagnosing failure modes and auditing fusion.

Method: Introduce a modality-level diagnostic layer where each modality outputs candidate labels and a brief self-assessment; apply a simple fusion mechanism to aggregate modality outputs and reveal contributors vs saboteurs.

Result: Applied to multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks with foundation models; reveals systematic reliability profiles and clarifies whether failures stem from dataset artifacts or model limitations.

Conclusion: The framework provides a diagnostic scaffold for multimodal reasoning, enabling principled auditing of fusion dynamics and informing potential interventions.

Abstract: Despite rapid growth in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their
reasoning traces remain opaque: it is often unclear which modality drives a
prediction, how conflicts are resolved, or when one stream dominates. In this
paper, we introduce modality sabotage, a diagnostic failure mode in which a
high-confidence unimodal error overrides other evidence and misleads the fused
result. To analyze such dynamics, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic
evaluation layer that treats each modality as an agent, producing candidate
labels and a brief self-assessment used for auditing. A simple fusion mechanism
aggregates these outputs, exposing contributors (modalities supporting correct
outcomes) and saboteurs (modalities that mislead). Applying our diagnostic
layer in a case study on multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks with
foundation models revealed systematic reliability profiles, providing insight
into whether failures may arise from dataset artifacts or model limitations.
More broadly, our framework offers a diagnostic scaffold for multimodal
reasoning, supporting principled auditing of fusion dynamics and informing
possible interventions.

### [113] [Orion-MSP: Multi-Scale Sparse Attention for Tabular In-Context Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02818)
*Mohamed Bouadi,Pratinav Seth,Aditya Tanna,Vinay Kumar Sankarapu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Orion-MSP introduces a multi-scale, block-sparse attention tabular ICL model with a Perceiver-style memory, achieving state-of-the-art performance and scalable efficiency on high-dimensional tables.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current tabular ICL models struggle with (i) single-scale feature processing that misses hierarchical interactions, (ii) quadratic attention scaling with table width, and (iii) sequential component processing that hinders iterative refinement and cross-component communication. A more scalable, interconnected architecture is needed to capture complex tabular feature interactions.

Method: Orion-MSP combines (1) multi-scale processing to capture hierarchical feature interactions; (2) block-sparse attention that blends windowed, global, and random patterns for efficiency and long-range connectivity; and (3) a Perceiver-style memory to enable bidirectional information flow across components, allowing iterative refinement and cross-component communication.

Result: Across diverse benchmarks, Orion-MSP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while scaling effectively to high-dimensional tables, establishing a new standard for efficient tabular in-context learning.

Conclusion: Orion-MSP provides a scalable, efficient, and effective architecture for tabular ICL, addressing key limitations of prior models and achieving competitive or superior results, with code publicly available.

Abstract: Tabular data remain the predominant format for real-world applications. Yet,
developing effective neural models for tabular data remains challenging due to
heterogeneous feature types and complex interactions occurring at multiple
scales. Recent advances in tabular in-context learning (ICL), such as TabPFN
and TabICL, have achieved state-of-the-art performance comparable to
gradient-boosted trees (GBTs) without task-specific fine-tuning. However,
current architectures exhibit key limitations: (1) single-scale feature
processing that overlooks hierarchical dependencies, (2) dense attention with
quadratic scaling in table width, and (3) strictly sequential component
processing that prevents iterative representation refinement and
cross-component communication. To address these challenges, we introduce
Orion-MSP, a tabular ICL architecture featuring three key innovations: (1)
multi-scale processing to capture hierarchical feature interactions; (2)
block-sparse attention combining windowed, global, and random patterns for
scalable efficiency and long-range connectivity; and (3) a Perceiver-style
memory enabling safe bidirectional information flow across components. Across
diverse benchmarks, Orion-MSP matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance
while scaling effectively to high-dimensional tables, establishing a new
standard for efficient tabular in-context learning. The model is publicly
available at https://github.com/Lexsi-Labs/Orion-MSP .

### [114] [Optimizing AI Agent Attacks With Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02823)
*Chloe Loughridge,Paul Colognese,Avery Griffin,Tyler Tracy,Jon Kutasov,Joe Benton*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Decomposes AI attack capabilities into five skills and uses a probabilistic simulation to optimize attack policies for risk evaluation in diverse control environments, achieving stronger attacks and transferring from simulation to SHADE-Arena; safety score drops from 0.87 to 0.41 with the proposed scaffold.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI deployments become more complex and high-stakes, robust risk estimation is essential. Traditional control evaluations require strong attack policies, but data and compute constraints in complex agentic environments hinder principled evaluation. The paper targets data-poor settings by building a transferable attack-policy optimization framework within SHADE-Arena.

Method: Five-skill decomposition of attack capability (suspicion modeling, attack selection, plan synthesis, execution, subtlety); develop a probabilistic model of attack dynamics; optimize attack hyperparameters in simulation; demonstrate transfer of optimized policies to SHADE-Arena.

Result: Significant gain in attack strength: safety score decreases from 0.87 to 0.41 when using the scaffold, indicating stronger adversarial performance and weaker safety under evaluation.

Conclusion: Modular attack-policy optimization with probabilistic simulation can yield stronger risk-evaluation attacks and transfer across environments, enabling more effective AI safety assessment under data- and compute-limited conditions; results underscore the importance of attack realism and transferability while highlighting limitations related to reliance on simulated dynamics.

Abstract: As AI deployments become more complex and high-stakes, it becomes
increasingly important to be able to estimate their risk. AI control is one
framework for doing so. However, good control evaluations require eliciting
strong attack policies. This can be challenging in complex agentic environments
where compute constraints leave us data-poor. In this work, we show how to
optimize attack policies in SHADE-Arena, a dataset of diverse realistic control
environments. We do this by decomposing attack capability into five constituent
skills -- suspicion modeling, attack selection, plan synthesis, execution and
subtlety -- and optimizing each component individually. To get around the
constraint of limited data, we develop a probabilistic model of attack
dynamics, optimize our attack hyperparameters using this simulation, and then
show that the results transfer to SHADE-Arena. This results in a substantial
improvement in attack strength, reducing safety score from a baseline of 0.87
to 0.41 using our scaffold.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Kosmos extends AI-driven scientific discovery by using a structured world model to sustain long, multi-cycle research; it executes up to 12-hour runs with hundreds of rollouts, cites sources, and yields reproducible and novel findings across domains, with significant time savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome coherence limits of prior AI research agents and enable extended, data-driven discovery across literature and data analysis.

Method: A shared, structured world model coordinates parallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation across up to 12 hours (200 agent rollouts), reading ~1,500 papers and producing ~42,000 lines of code per run; statements are cited with code or primary literature for traceability.

Result: Independent assessment found 79.4% of statements accurate; a single 20-cycle run equated to ~6 months of human research time; discovery count scales linearly with cycles up to at least 20; seven discoveries across metabolomics, materials science, neuroscience, and statistical genetics; three replications of unpublished preprints; four novel contributions.

Conclusion: Kosmos demonstrates longer-horizon, coherent AI-driven scientific discovery with traceability and cross-domain impact, indicating a scalable path toward autonomous data-driven science.

Abstract: Data-driven scientific discovery requires iterative cycles of literature
search, hypothesis generation, and data analysis. Substantial progress has been
made towards AI agents that can automate scientific research, but all such
agents remain limited in the number of actions they can take before losing
coherence, thus limiting the depth of their findings. Here we present Kosmos,
an AI scientist that automates data-driven discovery. Given an open-ended
objective and a dataset, Kosmos runs for up to 12 hours performing cycles of
parallel data analysis, literature search, and hypothesis generation before
synthesizing discoveries into scientific reports. Unlike prior systems, Kosmos
uses a structured world model to share information between a data analysis
agent and a literature search agent. The world model enables Kosmos to
coherently pursue the specified objective over 200 agent rollouts, collectively
executing an average of 42,000 lines of code and reading 1,500 papers per run.
Kosmos cites all statements in its reports with code or primary literature,
ensuring its reasoning is traceable. Independent scientists found 79.4% of
statements in Kosmos reports to be accurate, and collaborators reported that a
single 20-cycle Kosmos run performed the equivalent of 6 months of their own
research time on average. Furthermore, collaborators reported that the number
of valuable scientific findings generated scales linearly with Kosmos cycles
(tested up to 20 cycles). We highlight seven discoveries made by Kosmos that
span metabolomics, materials science, neuroscience, and statistical genetics.
Three discoveries independently reproduce findings from preprinted or
unpublished manuscripts that were not accessed by Kosmos at runtime, while four
make novel contributions to the scientific literature.

### [116] [Neurosymbolic Deep Learning Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02825)
*Artur d'Avila Garcez,Simon Odense*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Advocates a neurosymbolic semantic framework that uses logic to anchor deep learning in interpretable scientific knowledge, reviews semantic encoding approaches, and formalizes the mapping between networks and logic while noting practical difficulties.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI-driven science currently lacks formal semantics; bridging neural networks and logic is needed to translate insights into comprehensible scientific knowledge and to ensure desirable properties of AI systems.

Method: Proposes a semantic encoding framework, formalizes the mapping between neural networks and logic, reviews prominent neural encoding and knowledge extraction techniques, provides formal definitions, and exemplifies linkages; discusses practical difficulties and philosophy-of-mind considerations.

Result: Introduces a formal semantic framework linking neural networks to logic, surveys existing semantic encoding approaches, and offers concrete definitions and exemplars, along with a discussion of common ingredients and practical challenges.

Conclusion: Logic offers a suitable semantic foundation for deep learning within neurosymbolic AI; establishing semantic encodings is essential for trustworthy, explanatory AI-driven science, though identifying such encodings in practice remains challenging.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a powerful new language of science as
evidenced by recent Nobel Prizes in chemistry and physics that recognized
contributions to AI applied to those areas. Yet, this new language lacks
semantics, which makes AI's scientific discoveries unsatisfactory at best. With
the purpose of uncovering new facts but also improving our understanding of the
world, AI-based science requires formalization through a framework capable of
translating insight into comprehensible scientific knowledge. In this paper, we
argue that logic offers an adequate framework. In particular, we use logic in a
neurosymbolic framework to offer a much needed semantics for deep learning, the
neural network-based technology of current AI. Deep learning and neurosymbolic
AI lack a general set of conditions to ensure that desirable properties are
satisfied. Instead, there is a plethora of encoding and knowledge extraction
approaches designed for particular cases. To rectify this, we introduced a
framework for semantic encoding, making explicit the mapping between neural
networks and logic, and characterizing the common ingredients of the various
existing approaches. In this paper, we describe succinctly and exemplify how
logical semantics and neural networks are linked through this framework, we
review some of the most prominent approaches and techniques developed for
neural encoding and knowledge extraction, provide a formal definition of our
framework, and discuss some of the difficulties of identifying a semantic
encoding in practice in light of analogous problems in the philosophy of mind.

TL;DR: Agent-Omni is a modular master-agent framework that orchestrates existing foundation models to enable omni-modal reasoning (text, image, audio, video) without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art results on cross-modal tasks while maintaining transparency and extensibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current multimodal LLMs are limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning on large aligned datasets. A flexible, scalable, and interpretable solution that can integrate specialized models for diverse inputs is needed.

Method: A master agent interprets user intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents (text, image, audio, video), and integrates outputs into coherent responses. The framework coordinates existing foundation models without retraining and is designed to be modular and extensible, with open-source implementation anticipated.

Result: Extensive experiments across text, image, audio, video, and omni benchmarks show state-of-the-art performance, especially on tasks requiring complex cross-modal reasoning. The agent-based design enables seamless integration of specialized models, with transparency and interpretability.

Conclusion: Agent-Omni provides a flexible, scalable, and transparent approach to omni-modal reasoning by coordinating specialized models via a master agent. It avoids retraining, supports future improvements with stronger models, and is easy to extend and adapt.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong capabilities but
remain limited to fixed modality pairs and require costly fine-tuning with
large aligned datasets. Building fully omni-capable models that can integrate
text, images, audio, and video remains impractical and lacks robust reasoning
support. In this paper, we propose an Agent-Omni framework that coordinates
existing foundation models through a master-agent system, enabling flexible
multimodal reasoning without retraining. The master agent interprets user
intent, delegates subtasks to modality-specific agents, and integrates their
outputs into coherent responses. Extensive experiments across text, image,

state-of-the-art performance, particularly on tasks requiring complex
cross-modal reasoning. Its agent-based design enables seamless integration of
specialized foundation models, ensuring adaptability to diverse inputs while
maintaining transparency and interpretability. In addition, the framework is
modular and easily extensible, allowing future improvements as stronger models
become available. %We release an open-source implementation to support

### [118] [CudaForge: An Agent Framework with Hardware Feedback for CUDA Kernel Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01884)
*Zijian Zhang,Rong Wang,Shiyang Li,Yuebo Luo,Mingyi Hong,Caiwen Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CudaForge is a training-free, multi-agent workflow that uses two LLMs (Coder and Judge) to generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels with hardware feedback; it achieves high kernel correctness, speedups over PyTorch baselines, broad generalization across GPUs and models, at low cost, and open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual CUDA kernel design is costly and time-consuming; existing automatic methods produce inefficient kernels, high overhead, and poor generalization; there is a need for training-free, cost-effective approaches that perform well across hardware and models.

Method: Two LLM agents (Coder and Judge) iteratively generate and refine kernels, incorporating hardware feedback (Nsight Compute metrics). Training-free workflow; evaluate against PyTorch baselines and state-of-the-art models on KernelBench; generalization across GPUs and models; cost/time analysis.

Result: Generated kernels achieve 97.6% correctness; average 1.68x speedup over PyTorch baselines; generalizes across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, 4090, 3090) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, etc.); generation time ~26.5 minutes on RTX6000 with ~$0.3 API cost; significantly cheaper than prior agentic approaches (~6 H100 hours and $5 per kernel).

Conclusion: Multi-agent, training-free workflows can deliver cost-effective, generalizable, and high-performance CUDA kernel optimization; demonstrates practical viability and broad applicability; provides open-source code.

Abstract: Developing efficient CUDA kernels is increasingly critical for AI
applications such as large-scale LLM training. However, manual kernel design is
both costly and time-consuming, motivating automatic approaches that leverage
LLMs for code generation. Existing methods for automatic kernel generation,
however, often produce low-efficiency kernels, incur high computational
overhead, and fail to generalize across settings. In this work, we propose
CudaForge, a training-free multi-agent workflow for CUDA kernel generation and
optimization. Our workflow is inspired by the iterative workflow of human
experts, which contains steps such as developing initial kernels, testing
correctness, analyzing hardware feedback, and iterative improvement. More
specifically, CudaForge employs two LLM agents: a Coder and a Judge, that
iteratively generate, correct, and optimize CUDA kernels, while integrating
hardware feedback such as Nsight Compute (NCU) metrics. In extensive
evaluations, we show that CudaForge, by leveraging base models like OpenAI-o3,
achieves 97.6\% correctness of generated kernels and an average 1.68$\times$
speedup over PyTorch baselines, substantially surpassing state-of-the-art
models including OpenAI-o3 and Kevin on KernelBench. Beyond accuracy and speed,
CudaForge demonstrates strong generalization across GPUs (A100, RTX 6000, 4090,
3090) and base models (OpenAI-o3, GPT-5, gpt-oss-120B, Claude-Sonnet-4,
QwQ-32B), while maintaining high efficiency. In particular, generating an
optimized kernel takes about 26.5 minutes on one RTX6000 and incurs about \$
0.3 API cost, which is significantly cheaper than existing agentic work that
costs 6 H100 hours and \$ 5 API cost per kernel. Our results highlight that
multi-agent, training-free workflows can enable cost-effective, generalizable,
and high-performance CUDA kernel optimization. Code available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A retrieval-augmented generation approach uses sentiment retrieval and an LLM-generated emotion prompt to augment multimodal depression detection, achieving state-of-the-art results on AVEC 2019 (CCC 0.593, MAE 3.95).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address high computational cost, domain mismatch, and static knowledge limitations in sentiment-enhanced multimodal depression detection, by providing a scalable and interpretable augmentation.

Method: 1) Given depression-related text, retrieve semantically relevant emotional content from a sentiment dataset. 2) Use a Large Language Model to generate an Emotion Prompt as an auxiliary modality. 3) Integrate the emotion prompt with multimodal representations to enrich emotional understanding and improve interpretability. 4) Validate on AVEC 2019, comparing against baselines.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on AVEC 2019 with CCC of 0.593 and MAE of 3.95, surpassing previous transfer learning and multi-task baselines.

Conclusion: Retrieval-augmented generation with an LLM-generated emotion prompt enhances emotional representation and interpretability in multimodal depression detection, yielding superior performance on AVEC 2019.

Abstract: Multimodal deep learning has shown promise in depression detection by
integrating text, audio, and video signals. Recent work leverages sentiment
analysis to enhance emotional understanding, yet suffers from high
computational cost, domain mismatch, and static knowledge limitations. To
address these issues, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
framework. Given a depression-related text, our method retrieves semantically
relevant emotional content from a sentiment dataset and uses a Large Language
Model (LLM) to generate an Emotion Prompt as an auxiliary modality. This prompt
enriches emotional representation and improves interpretability. Experiments on
the AVEC 2019 dataset show our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
with CCC of 0.593 and MAE of 3.95, surpassing previous transfer learning and
multi-task learning baselines.

### [120] [The Eigenvalues Entropy as a Classifier Evaluation Measure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01904)
*Doulaye Dembélé*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Eigenvalues entropy as a robust evaluation metric for classification, especially in imbalanced datasets; it relates to standard measures and enables estimating the confusion matrix, showing superior performance to traditional metrics on several datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing evaluation measures often fail to accurately assess performance when class distributions are imbalanced; there is a need for a metric that better reflects classifier quality under imbalance.

Method: Adopt eigenvalues entropy as the evaluation measure for binary and multi-class problems; for binary problems derive relations between eigenvalues and standard metrics (sensitivity, specificity, AUC, Gini index); provide a by-product method to estimate the confusion matrix; validate with data examples.

Result: The eigenvalues entropy-based evaluation demonstrates better performance than conventional gold-standard measures across various datasets.

Conclusion: Eigenvalues entropy is a promising, accurate evaluation tool for classification tasks with imbalanced classes and offers a practical way to infer the confusion matrix and relate to common performance metrics.

Abstract: Classification is a machine learning method used in many practical
applications: text mining, handwritten character recognition, face recognition,
pattern classification, scene labeling, computer vision, natural langage
processing. A classifier prediction results and training set information are
often used to get a contingency table which is used to quantify the method
quality through an evaluation measure. Such measure, typically a numerical
value, allows to choose a suitable method among several. Many evaluation
measures available in the literature are less accurate for a dataset with
imbalanced classes. In this paper, the eigenvalues entropy is used as an
evaluation measure for a binary or a multi-class problem. For a binary problem,
relations are given between the eigenvalues and some commonly used measures,
the sensitivity, the specificity, the area under the operating receiver
characteristic curve and the Gini index. A by-product result of this paper is
an estimate of the confusion matrix to deal with the curse of the imbalanced
classes. Various data examples are used to show the better performance of the
proposed evaluation measure over the gold standard measures available in the
literature.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mesh-free, variational + quasi-conformal framework for high-dimensional diffeomorphic mappings that achieves bijective, distortion-controlled deformations, scalable to higher dimensions, validated on medical image data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional high-dimensional diffeomorphic mapping methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality and lack robust, bijective controls; a method is needed that guarantees bijectivity while regulating conformality and volume distortions in higher dimensions.

Method: A mesh-free learning framework combining variational principles with quasi-conformal theory to regulate conformality and volume distortions; designed for gradient-based optimization and neural networks, enabling scalable, high-dimensional mappings.

Result: Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world medical image data show the method achieves accurate, robust, and effective registrations under complex deformation scenarios.

Conclusion: The approach provides accurate, bijective, distortion-controlled mappings that scale to higher dimensions and are compatible with gradient-based models, offering robust performance in complex registration tasks.

Abstract: Traditional methods for high-dimensional diffeomorphic mapping often struggle
with the curse of dimensionality. We propose a mesh-free learning framework
designed for $n$-dimensional mapping problems, seamlessly combining variational
principles with quasi-conformal theory. Our approach ensures accurate,
bijective mappings by regulating conformality distortion and volume distortion,
enabling robust control over deformation quality. The framework is inherently
compatible with gradient-based optimization and neural network architectures,
making it highly flexible and scalable to higher-dimensional settings.
Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical image data
validate the accuracy, robustness, and effectiveness of the proposed method in
complex registration scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A quantum-inspired optimizer, Superpositional Gradient Descent (SGD), couples gradient updates with quantum superposition via circuit perturbations, implemented in PyTorch/Qiskit, achieving faster convergence and lower final loss than AdamW on synthetic and large-scale LLM tasks, though limited by scalability and hardware constraints.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore mechanisms by which quantum-inspired methods can improve classical optimization in deep learning, and to bridge quantum computing concepts with practical training of large models.

Method: Introduce SGD that injects quantum circuit perturbations into gradient updates, provide a mathematical framework, and implement hybrid quantum-classical circuits in PyTorch and Qiskit. Evaluate on synthetic sequence classification and large-scale LLM fine-tuning.

Result: SGD converges faster and achieves lower final loss than AdamW in the reported experiments. Results are promising but challenged by scalability and hardware limitations.

Conclusion: The work contributes to the intersection of quantum computing and deep learning, offering practical pathways to leverage quantum principles for controlling and enhancing model behavior, while acknowledging current hardware constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with classical
optimization techniques like AdamW to improve convergence and generalization.
However, the mechanisms by which quantum-inspired methods enhance classical
training remain underexplored. We introduce Superpositional Gradient Descent
(SGD), a novel optimizer linking gradient updates with quantum superposition by
injecting quantum circuit perturbations. We present a mathematical framework
and implement hybrid quantum-classical circuits in PyTorch and Qiskit. On
synthetic sequence classification and large-scale LLM fine-tuning, SGD
converges faster and yields lower final loss than AdamW. Despite promising
results, scalability and hardware constraints limit adoption. Overall, this
work provides new insights into the intersection of quantum computing and deep
learning, suggesting practical pathways for leveraging quantum principles to
control and enhance model behavior.

### [123] [Neural Green's Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01924)
*Seungwoo Yoo,Kyeongmin Yeo,Jisung Hwang,Minhyuk Sung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Neural Green's Function (NGF) is a neural solution operator for linear PDEs with eigendecompositions, inspired by Green's functions. It generalizes across irregular geometries and source/boundary functions by predicting a geometry-dependent operator decomposition from per-point features of a volume point cloud, and computing solutions via numerical integration. It outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators on steady-state thermal problems and can be much faster than meshing-based solvers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To achieve robust generalization of neural operators to unseen source and boundary functions and irregular geometries by leveraging the geometry-only dependence of linear PDEs' Green's functions, reducing sensitivity to specific training functions.

Method: Extract per-point features from a volumetric point cloud of the domain, predict a decomposition of the solution operator (inspired by Green's functions and eigendecomposition) that depends only on geometry, and evaluate the PDE solution by numerical integration using this operator.

Result: On steady-state thermal analysis for mechanical part geometries from the MCB dataset, NGF achieves an average error reduction of 13.9% compared with state-of-the-art neural operators across five shape categories and runs up to 350x faster than a traditional meshing-based solver.

Conclusion: NGF demonstrates robust, geometry-driven generalization for linear PDE solvers across unseen source/boundary functions, combining a geometry-conditioned operator with efficient evaluation via integration, offering both accuracy gains and substantial speedups over conventional solvers.

Abstract: We introduce Neural Green's Function, a neural solution operator for linear
partial differential equations (PDEs) whose differential operators admit
eigendecompositions. Inspired by Green's functions, the solution operators of
linear PDEs that depend exclusively on the domain geometry, we design Neural
Green's Function to imitate their behavior, achieving superior generalization
across diverse irregular geometries and source and boundary functions.
Specifically, Neural Green's Function extracts per-point features from a
volumetric point cloud representing the problem domain and uses them to predict
a decomposition of the solution operator, which is subsequently applied to
evaluate solutions via numerical integration. Unlike recent learning-based
solution operators, which often struggle to generalize to unseen source or
boundary functions, our framework is, by design, agnostic to the specific
functions used during training, enabling robust and efficient generalization.
In the steady-state thermal analysis of mechanical part geometries from the MCB
dataset, Neural Green's Function outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators,
achieving an average error reduction of 13.9\% across five shape categories,
while being up to 350 times faster than a numerical solver that requires
computationally expensive meshing.

### [124] [DeepContour: A Hybrid Deep Learning Framework for Accelerating Generalized Eigenvalue Problem Solving via Efficient Contour Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01927)
*Yeqiu Chen,Ziyan Liu,Hong Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DeepContour integrates a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to predict the spectrum of a large-scale generalized eigenvalue problem (GEP) and uses Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to design principled integration contours for contour-integral (CI) solvers, achieving up to 5.63x speedup across multiple datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Solving large-scale GEPs with CI methods hinges on the choice of integration contours, which traditionally relies on prior spectral knowledge and can incur high computational cost or loss of accuracy. A data-driven, principled contour design could dramatically improve efficiency and robustness.

Method: A hybrid framework: (1) use a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to rapidly predict the spectral distribution of a given GEP; (2) apply Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to the predicted spectrum to automatically determine suitable integration contours; (3) guide the CI solver with these optimized contours to extract the desired eigenvalues.

Result: Demonstrated effectiveness on diverse scientific problems, with reported speedups up to 5.63x in solving large-scale GEPs across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: Combining deep learning-based spectral prediction with traditional numerical solvers yields a more efficient and robust approach for tackling high-dimensional generalized eigenvalue problems.

Abstract: Solving large-scale Generalized Eigenvalue Problems (GEPs) is a fundamental
yet computationally prohibitive task in science and engineering. As a promising
direction, contour integral (CI) methods, such as the CIRR algorithm, offer an
efficient and parallelizable framework. However, their performance is
critically dependent on the selection of integration contours -- improper
selection without reliable prior knowledge of eigenvalue distribution can incur
significant computational overhead and compromise numerical accuracy. To
address this challenge, we propose DeepContour, a novel hybrid framework that
integrates a deep learning-based spectral predictor with Kernel Density
Estimation for principled contour design. Specifically, DeepContour first
employs a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to rapidly predict the spectral
distribution of a given GEP. Subsequently, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is
applied to the predicted spectrum to automatically and systematically determine
proper integration contours. Finally, these optimized contours guide the CI
solver to efficiently find the desired eigenvalues. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on diverse challenging scientific problems. In our
main experiments, DeepContour accelerates GEP solving across multiple datasets,
achieving up to a 5.63$\times$ speedup. By combining the predictive power of
deep learning with the numerical rigor of classical solvers, this work pioneers
an efficient and robust paradigm for tackling difficult generalized eigenvalue
involving matrices of high dimension.

### [125] [Dynamic Population Distribution Aware Human Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01929)
*Qingyue Long,Can Rong,Tong Li,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion-model based trajectory generation guided by dynamic population distribution via a spatial graph, achieving higher fidelity trajectories than state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world trajectory data faces privacy, cost, and quality challenges. Population distribution changes over space and time significantly influence mobility patterns, necessitating synthetic data that respects dynamic population constraints.

Method: A diffusion framework augmented with a spatial graph to capture spatial correlations and a dynamic population distribution aware denoising network to model spatiotemporal dependencies and the influence of population distribution during denoising.

Result: Generated trajectories resemble real-world trajectories on key statistical metrics and outperform state-of-the-art methods by over 54%.

Conclusion: Integrating dynamic population distribution into a diffusion-based trajectory generator with spatial graph constraints yields higher-fidelity synthetic trajectories and offers a privacy-preserving tool for urban planning and related applications.

Abstract: Human trajectory data is crucial in urban planning, traffic engineering, and
public health. However, directly using real-world trajectory data often faces
challenges such as privacy concerns, data acquisition costs, and data quality.
A practical solution to these challenges is trajectory generation, a method
developed to simulate human mobility behaviors. Existing trajectory generation
methods mainly focus on capturing individual movement patterns but often
overlook the influence of population distribution on trajectory generation. In
reality, dynamic population distribution reflects changes in population density
across different regions, significantly impacting individual mobility behavior.
Thus, we propose a novel trajectory generation framework based on a diffusion
model, which integrates the dynamic population distribution constraints to
guide high-fidelity generation outcomes. Specifically, we construct a spatial
graph to enhance the spatial correlation of trajectories. Then, we design a
dynamic population distribution aware denoising network to capture the
spatiotemporal dependencies of human mobility behavior as well as the impact of
population distribution in the denoising process. Extensive experiments show
that the trajectories generated by our model can resemble real-world
trajectories in terms of some critical statistical metrics, outperforming
state-of-the-art algorithms by over 54%.

### [126] [Deciphering Personalization: Towards Fine-Grained Explainability in Natural Language for Personalized Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01932)
*Haoming Wang,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FineXL provides fine-grained natural-language explanations for personalization in image generation, with per-aspect descriptions and scores; shows 56% improvement in explainability accuracy across scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Personalized image generation often lacks explainability; coarse-grained NL explanations fail to capture multiple aspects and their varying levels. There's a need for fine-grained, aspect-wise explanations.

Method: Introduce FineXL, which describes each distinct personalization aspect in natural language and attaches a quantitative score for its level. This enables per-aspect explainability across diverse personalization scenarios and models.

Result: Experimental results show a 56% improvement in explainability accuracy across multiple personalization scenarios and image-generation models.

Conclusion: FineXL offers fine-grained NL explainability for personalized image generation, enabling users to understand specific aspects and their intensities, with evidence of improved accuracy.

Abstract: Image generation models are usually personalized in practical uses in order
to better meet the individual users' heterogeneous needs, but most personalized
models lack explainability about how they are being personalized. Such
explainability can be provided via visual features in generated images, but is
difficult for human users to understand. Explainability in natural language is
a better choice, but the existing approaches to explainability in natural
language are limited to be coarse-grained. They are unable to precisely
identify the multiple aspects of personalization, as well as the varying levels
of personalization in each aspect. To address such limitation, in this paper we
present a new technique, namely \textbf{FineXL}, towards \textbf{Fine}-grained
e\textbf{X}plainability in natural \textbf{L}anguage for personalized image
generation models. FineXL can provide natural language descriptions about each
distinct aspect of personalization, along with quantitative scores indicating
the level of each aspect of personalization. Experiment results show that
FineXL can improve the accuracy of explainability by 56\%, when different
personalization scenarios are applied to multiple types of image generation
models.

*Yirong Zeng,Xiao Ding,Yutai Hou,Yuxian Wang,Li Du,Juyi Dai,Qiuyang Ding,Duyu Tang,Dandan Tu,Weiwen Liu,Bing Qin,Ting Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Pure reinforcement learning with a dynamic generalization-guided reward design can elicit intrinsic reasoning in LLMs and improve tool-agnostic generalization; Tool-Zero models trained from base models with RL achieve >7% gains over SFT and RL-with-SFT, with robust cross- and intra-dataset results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current supervised fine-tuning struggles to generalize to unfamiliar or complex tool-use scenarios. RL has potential to enhance reasoning and generalization, motivating a study on whether pure RL can elicit intrinsic reasoning and tool-agnostic generalization.

Method: Introduce dynamic generalization-guided reward design for rule-based RL that progressively shifts rewards from exploratory to exploitative tool-use patterns. Train Tool-Zero series models by scaling up RL from Zero base models (no post-training) to enable autonomous general tool usage.

Result: The Tool-Zero models achieve over 7% performance improvement compared to both SFT and RL-with-SFT models under the same settings, with consistent gains across cross-dataset and intra-dataset evaluations, validating robustness and effectiveness.

Conclusion: Pure RL with a guided reward design can elicit intrinsic reasoning and improve tool-agnostic generalization in LLMs; Tool-Zero models demonstrate strong, robust improvements, suggesting RL-alone approaches can match or exceed SFT-based methods in tool-use tasks.

Abstract: Training tool-augmented LLMs has emerged as a promising approach to enhancing
language models' capabilities for complex tasks. The current supervised
fine-tuning paradigm relies on constructing extensive domain-specific datasets
to train models. However, this approach often struggles to generalize
effectively to unfamiliar or intricate tool-use scenarios. Recently,
reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm can endow LLMs with superior reasoning and
generalization abilities. In this work, we address a key question: Can the pure
RL be used to effectively elicit a model's intrinsic reasoning capabilities and
enhance the tool-agnostic generalization? We propose a dynamic
generalization-guided reward design for rule-based RL, which progressively
shifts rewards from exploratory to exploitative tool-use patterns. Based on
this design, we introduce the Tool-Zero series models. These models are trained
to enable LLMs to autonomously utilize general tools by directly scaling up RL
from Zero models (i.e., base models without post-training). Experimental
results demonstrate that our models achieve over 7% performance improvement
compared to both SFT and RL-with-SFT models under the same experimental
settings. These gains are consistently replicated across cross-dataset and
intra-dataset evaluations, validating the effectiveness and robustness of our
methods.

*Hasan Tutar,Caner Erden,Ümit Şentürk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ML-based ensemble model to determine qualitative sampling size, using ten ordinal features across five qualitative methodologies; achieves ~0.85 test R2; proposes a web-based decision support tool; aims to standardize sample-size justification and improve rigor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional data-saturation approach is subjective and inconsistent; need objective, systematic method to justify sample size in qualitative research.

Method: Create dataset from five qualitative approaches; define ten ordinal features (scope, information power, researcher competence, etc.); preprocess and remove outliers; train and compare multiple ML algorithms (KNN, GB, RF, XGBoost, DT); evaluate with R2; perform feature-importance analysis; develop a conceptual framework for a web app as decision-support for researchers.

Result: Ensemble models yielded high explanatory power with test R2 around 0.85; feature importance highlighted research design type and information power as key; suggests non-linear relationships in sample-size decisions; validates core qualitative assumptions and offers a framework for standardization.

Conclusion: Represents a step toward standardizing sample-size justification, enhancing transparency, and strengthening epistemology in qualitative inquiry; requires external validation, sensitivity analyses, and assessment of interpretability and applicability across diverse qualitative domains; potential risks include overfitting and limited generalizability if training data are not representative.

Abstract: The determination of sample size in qualitative research has traditionally
relied on the subjective and often ambiguous principle of data saturation,
which can lead to inconsistencies and threaten methodological rigor. This study
introduces a new, systematic model based on machine learning (ML) to make this
process more objective. Utilizing a dataset derived from five fundamental
qualitative research approaches - namely, Case Study, Grounded Theory,
Phenomenology, Narrative Research, and Ethnographic Research - we developed an
ensemble learning model. Ten critical parameters, including research scope,
information power, and researcher competence, were evaluated using an ordinal
scale and used as input features. After thorough preprocessing and outlier
removal, multiple ML algorithms were trained and compared. The K-Nearest
Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), Random Forest (RF), XGBoost, and
Decision Tree (DT) algorithms showed the highest explanatory power (Test R2 ~
0.85), effectively modeling the complex, non-linear relationships involved in
qualitative sampling decisions. Feature importance analysis confirmed the vital
roles of research design type and information power, providing quantitative
validation of key theoretical assumptions in qualitative methodology. The study
concludes by proposing a conceptual framework for a web-based computational
application designed to serve as a decision support system for qualitative
researchers, journal reviewers, and thesis advisors. This model represents a
significant step toward standardizing sample size justification, enhancing
transparency, and strengthening the epistemological foundation of qualitative
inquiry through evidence-based, systematic decision-making.

### [129] [Shorter but not Worse: Frugal Reasoning via Easy Samples as Length Regularizers in Math RLVR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01937)
*Abdelaziz Bounhar,Hadi Abdine,Evan Dufraisse,Ahmad Chamma,Amr Mohamed,Dani Bouch,Michalis Vazirgiannis,Guokan Shang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training LLMs with RLVR benefits from including moderately easy tasks to implicitly regularize length, yielding shorter solutions on hard problems while preserving accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs trained for multi-step reasoning tend to be verbose; filtering out easy problems in RLVR biases models toward longer outputs and conflated thinking time with quality; a simple length regularizer via task mix could curb verbosity.

Method: Retain and lightly up-weight moderately easy problems during RLVR training, rather than discarding them; apply to Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507 with 16k token limit; compare to baseline; measure pass@1 on AIME25 and output length.

Result: Emergent brevity achieved: model solves harder problems without longer outputs; pass@1 accuracy matches baseline on AIME25 while average solution length is nearly half of baseline.

Conclusion: A simple, data-centric length regularization via modest inclusion of easy tasks can curb verbosity and improve efficiency without explicit length penalties; this has practical implications for scalable reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained for step-by-step reasoning often become
excessively verbose, raising inference cost. Standard Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) pipelines filter out ``easy'' problems for
training efficiency, leaving the model to train primarily on harder problems
that require longer reasoning chains. This skews the output length distribution
upward, resulting in a \textbf{model that conflates ``thinking longer'' with
``thinking better''}. In this work, we show that retaining and modestly
up-weighting moderately easy problems acts as an implicit length regularizer.
Exposing the model to solvable short-chain tasks constrains its output
distribution and prevents runaway verbosity. The result is
\textbf{\emph{emergent brevity for free}}: the model learns to solve harder
problems without inflating the output length, \textbf{ despite the absence of
any explicit length penalization}. RLVR experiments using this approach on
\textit{Qwen3-4B-Thinking-2507} (with a 16k token limit) achieve baseline
pass@1 AIME25 accuracy while generating solutions that are, on average, nearly
twice as short. The code is available at

### [130] [The Geometry of Grokking: Norm Minimization on the Zero-Loss Manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01938)
*Tiberiu Musat*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Grokking is explained as gradient descent minimizing weight norm on a zero-loss manifold in the small-learning-rate/weight-decay limit; a decoupled-dynamics approximation yields a closed-form for the first layer, and experiments validate delayed generalization and representation learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide a principled, mechanistic explanation for grokking beyond empirical associations with weight decay, by linking delayed generalization to constrained optimization on the zero-loss manifold.

Method: Prove that gradient descent with weight decay minimizes the weight norm on the zero-loss manifold in the infinitesimal learning-rate and weight-decay limit; introduce a decoupled-parameter dynamics approximation; derive a closed-form expression for post-memorization dynamics of the first layer in a two-layer network; validate by simulations using the predicted gradients to reproduce grokking.

Result: The analysis yields a closed-form description of post-memorization dynamics for the first layer; simulations using the predicted gradients reproduce the hallmark grokking behavior—delayed generalization and associated representation learning.

Conclusion: The grokking phenomenon can be understood as constrained optimization on the zero-loss manifold; a decoupled-dynamics framework provides tractable analytic insight and corroborates the observed delayed generalization and representation learning through experiments.

Abstract: Grokking is a puzzling phenomenon in neural networks where full
generalization occurs only after a substantial delay following the complete
memorization of the training data. Previous research has linked this delayed
generalization to representation learning driven by weight decay, but the
precise underlying dynamics remain elusive. In this paper, we argue that
post-memorization learning can be understood through the lens of constrained
optimization: gradient descent effectively minimizes the weight norm on the
zero-loss manifold. We formally prove this in the limit of infinitesimally
small learning rates and weight decay coefficients. To further dissect this
regime, we introduce an approximation that decouples the learning dynamics of a
subset of parameters from the rest of the network. Applying this framework, we
derive a closed-form expression for the post-memorization dynamics of the first
layer in a two-layer network. Experiments confirm that simulating the training
process using our predicted gradients reproduces both the delayed
generalization and representation learning characteristic of grokking.

*Guillaume Tejedor,Veronika Peralta,Nicolas Labroche,Patrick Marcel,Hélène Blasco,Hugo Alarcan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A disease progression score-driven clustering framework for ALS that integrates expert-descriptive variables, uses multiple distance measures (including weak supervision), and outperforms state-of-the-art in survival analysis on 353 ALS patients while maintaining similar cluster cohesion and improving interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ALS shows strong heterogeneity and variable treatment responses; existing clustering methods are limited and lack a clinically meaningful definition of patient groups. A clinically-informed, interpretable clustering approach could enable personalized care and better survival insights.

Method: Introduce a disease progression declarative score to define patient similarity. Combine descriptive clinical variables via multiple distance measures (reusing standard distances and weak-supervised learning). Pair distances with clustering algorithms and benchmark against state-of-the-art methods on a dataset of 353 ALS patients from the University Hospital of Tours.

Result: The method outperforms state-of-the-art clustering approaches in survival analysis and achieves comparable silhouette scores. The learned distances enhance interpretability and relevance for medical experts.

Conclusion: A clinically-informed, distance-based clustering framework with a disease progression score can yield more survival-relevant and interpretable patient groups in ALS, supporting personalized care even with small, heterogeneous cohorts.

Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe disease with a typical
survival of 3-5 years after symptom onset. Current treatments offer only
limited life extension, and the variability in patient responses highlights the
need for personalized care. However, research is hindered by small,
heterogeneous cohorts, sparse longitudinal data, and the lack of a clear
definition for clinically meaningful patient clusters. Existing clustering
methods remain limited in both scope and number. To address this, we propose a
clustering approach that groups sequences using a disease progression
declarative score. Our approach integrates medical expertise through multiple
descriptive variables, investigating several distance measures combining such
variables, both by reusing off-the-shelf distances and employing a
weak-supervised learning method. We pair these distances with clustering
methods and benchmark them against state-of-the-art techniques. The evaluation
of our approach on a dataset of 353 ALS patients from the University Hospital
of Tours, shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
survival analysis while achieving comparable silhouette scores. In addition,
the learned distances enhance the relevance and interpretability of results for
medical experts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces COFAP, a universal deep-learning framework for predicting COF gas adsorption using multi-modal structural/chemical features with cross-modal attention; achieves SOTA on hypoCOFs and enables flexible, application-specific ranking, revealing pore-size/surface-area patterns.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable fast, scalable high-throughput screening of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for gas adsorption/separation without relying on time-consuming gas-specific features (e.g., Henry’s constants, adsorption heats).

Method: Extracts multi-modal features from COF structures using deep learning; fuses features via cross-modal attention; does not require gas-related properties; trained/evaluated on hypoCOFs dataset; includes a weight-adjustable prioritization scheme for ranking candidate COFs.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on hypoCOFs predictions; finds that high-performing COFs cluster in a narrow range of pore size and surface area; demonstrates superior efficiency and accuracy suitable for deployment.

Conclusion: COFAP offers a universal, efficient framework for COF design screening, enabling rapid discovery of COFs for gas adsorption/separation and application-specific prioritization through adjustable rankings.

Abstract: Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are promising adsorbents for gas
adsorption and separation, while identifying the optimal structures among their
vast design space requires efficient high-throughput screening. Conventional
machine-learning predictors rely heavily on specific gas-related features.
However, these features are time-consuming and limit scalability, leading to
inefficiency and labor-intensive processes. Herein, a universal COFs adsorption
prediction framework (COFAP) is proposed, which can extract multi-modal
structural and chemical features through deep learning, and fuse these
complementary features via cross-modal attention mechanism. Without Henry
coefficients or adsorption heat, COFAP sets a new SOTA by outperforming
previous approaches on hypoCOFs dataset. Based on COFAP, we also found that
high-performing COFs for separation concentrate within a narrow range of pore
size and surface area. A weight-adjustable prioritization scheme is also
developed to enable flexible, application-specific ranking of candidate COFs
for researchers. Superior efficiency and accuracy render COFAP directly
deployable in crystalline porous materials.

Conclusion: The ensemble provides strong predictive performance with clinical transparency, making it a promising candidate for real-world deployment in public health screening.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains a critical global health concern,
demanding reliable and interpretable predictive models for early risk
assessment. This study presents a large-scale analysis using the Heart Disease
Health Indicators Dataset, developing a strategically weighted ensemble model
that combines tree-based methods (LightGBM, XGBoost) with a Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) to predict CVD risk. The model was trained on a
preprocessed dataset of 229,781 patients where the inherent class imbalance was
managed through strategic weighting and feature engineering enhanced the
original 22 features to 25. The final ensemble achieves a statistically
significant improvement over the best individual model, with a Test AUC of
0.8371 (p=0.003) and is particularly suited for screening with a high recall of
80.0%. To provide transparency and clinical interpretability, surrogate
decision trees and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are used. The proposed
model delivers a combination of robust predictive performance and clinical
transparency by blending diverse learning architectures and incorporating
explainability through SHAP and surrogate decision trees, making it a strong
candidate for real-world deployment in public health screening.

TL;DR: EchoLSTM introduces Output-Conditioned Gating to enable self-reflection in memory, integrated with attention, achieving robust performance on noisy long-range dependencies and competitive efficiency relative to Transformers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard RNNs (including LSTMs) struggle with long-range dependencies and noisy/misleading information. A self-reflective gating mechanism modulates memory gates based on past inferences to stabilize memory.

Method: Propose Output-Conditioned Gating; build EchoLSTM by integrating this gating principle with an attention mechanism; evaluate on a Distractor Signal Task and the ListOps benchmark; supplement with a Trigger Sensitivity Test for qualitative robustness.

Result: Distractor Signal Task: EchoLSTM achieves 69.0% accuracy, 33 percentage points above a standard LSTM baseline. ListOps: EchoLSTM at 69.8% is competitive with Transformer at 71.8% while being over 5x more parameter-efficient. Trigger Sensitivity Test provides qualitative evidence of improved memory robustness due to self-reflection.

Conclusion: Self-reflective Output-Conditioned Gating stabilizes memory in noisy sequences and yields a model (EchoLSTM) that is robust and parameter-efficient, achieving competitive performance with state-of-the-art Transformers on benchmark tasks.

Abstract: Standard Recurrent Neural Networks, including LSTMs, struggle to model
long-range dependencies, particularly in sequences containing noisy or
misleading information. We propose a new architectural principle,
Output-Conditioned Gating, which enables a model to perform self-reflection by
modulating its internal memory gates based on its own past inferences. This
creates a stabilizing feedback loop that enhances memory retention. Our final
model, the EchoLSTM, integrates this principle with an attention mechanism. We
evaluate the EchoLSTM on a series of challenging benchmarks. On a
custom-designed Distractor Signal Task, the EchoLSTM achieves 69.0% accuracy,
decisively outperforming a standard LSTM baseline by 33 percentage points.
Furthermore, on the standard ListOps benchmark, the EchoLSTM achieves
performance competitive with a modern Transformer model, 69.8% vs. 71.8%, while
being over 5 times more parameter-efficient. A final Trigger Sensitivity Test
provides qualitative evidence that our model's self-reflective mechanism leads
to a fundamentally more robust memory system.

*Manuel A. Hernandez Alonso,Michael Depass,Stephan Quessy,Numa Dancause,Ignasi Cos*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NeuroClean is an unsupervised EEG/LFP preprocessing pipeline with automatic ICA component rejection that significantly improves downstream ML performance, outperforming raw data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG/LFP recordings are heavily artifacted; there is a need for fully automated, reliable preprocessing to reduce biases and improve reproducibility given large data volumes.

Method: A five-step pipeline including bandpass and line-noise filtering, bad-channel rejection, and ICA with automatic component rejection based on a clustering-based ML classifier to preserve task-relevant information.

Result: NeuroClean effectively removes artifacts; in motor tasks, ML accuracy after cleaning (>97%) surpasses raw data (≈74%), with chance level at 33.3%.

Conclusion: NeuroClean is a promising automated preprocessing solution for EEG/LFP studies that can improve generalization and machine-learning performance.

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) and local field potentials (LFP) are two widely
used techniques to record electrical activity from the brain. These signals are
used in both the clinical and research domains for multiple applications.
However, most brain data recordings suffer from a myriad of artifacts and noise
sources other than the brain itself. Thus, a major requirement for their use is
proper and, given current volumes of data, a fully automatized conditioning. As
a means to this end, here we introduce an unsupervised, multipurpose EEG/LFP
preprocessing method, the NeuroClean pipeline. In addition to its completeness
and reliability, NeuroClean is an unsupervised series of algorithms intended to
mitigate reproducibility issues and biases caused by human intervention. The
pipeline is designed as a five-step process, including the common bandpass and
line noise filtering, and bad channel rejection. However, it incorporates an
efficient independent component analysis with an automatic component rejection
based on a clustering algorithm. This machine learning classifier is used to
ensure that task-relevant information is preserved after each step of the
cleaning process. We used several data sets to validate the pipeline.
NeuroClean removed several common types of artifacts from the signal. Moreover,
in the context of motor tasks of varying complexity, it yielded more than 97%
accuracy (vs. a chance-level of 33.3%) in an optimized Multinomial Logistic
Regression model after cleaning the data, compared to the raw data, which
performed at 74% accuracy. These results show that NeuroClean is a promising
pipeline and workflow that can be applied to future work and studies to achieve
better generalization and performance on machine learning pipelines.

*Rathin Chandra Shit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a path-coordinated continual learning framework integrating NTK theory, Wilson confidence intervals, and multi-metric path evaluation; shows strong accuracy gains and reduced forgetting on Split-CIFAR10 with statistical guarantees and insights on learning capacity limits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Catastrophic forgetting in continual learning; need principled plasticity bounds and validated metrics to quantify and control forgetting; provide theoretical and empirical guidance.

Method: Develops a path-coordinated framework combining NTK-based principled plasticity bounds, Wilson confidence intervals for statistical validation, and multiple metrics to assess path quality; experiments on Split-CIFAR10; analyzes NTK condition numbers and their relation to learning capacity; evaluates retention over task sequences and validates discovered paths.

Result: Avg accuracy 66.7% with 23.4% forgetting; large improvement over baseline and competitive with state-of-the-art; NTK condition number threshold around 1e11; forgetting decreases as tasks progress (27% → 18%); 80% of discovered paths validated with confidence; 90-97% retention on intermediate tasks; core capacity limits identified.

Conclusion: Proposed framework yields actionable insights to enhance adaptive regularization; NTK metrics serve as predictive indicators of learning capacity limits; establishes a methodology to quantify and bound forgetting in continual learning and demonstrates practical benefits on Split-CIFAR10.

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting is one of the fundamental issues of continual
learning because neural networks forget the tasks learned previously when
trained on new tasks. The proposed framework is a new path-coordinated
framework of continual learning that unites the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)
theory of principled plasticity bounds, statistical validation by Wilson
confidence intervals, and evaluation of path quality by the use of multiple
metrics. Experimental evaluation shows an average accuracy of 66.7% at the cost
of 23.4% catastrophic forgetting on Split-CIFAR10, a huge improvement over the
baseline and competitive performance achieved, which is very close to
state-of-the-art results. Further, it is found out that NTK condition numbers
are predictive indicators of learning capacity limits, showing the existence of
a critical threshold at condition number $>10^{11}$. It is interesting to note
that the proposed strategy shows a tendency of lowering forgetting as the
sequence of tasks progresses (27% to 18%), which is a system stabilization. The
framework validates 80% of discovered paths with a rigorous statistical
guarantee and maintains 90-97% retention on intermediate tasks. The core
capacity limits of the continual learning environment are determined in the
analysis, and actionable insights to enhance the adaptive regularization are
offered.

*Donghee Lee,Hye-Sung Lee,Jaeok Yi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a bulk–boundary decomposition of the SGD Lagrangian for deep nets, separating data-independent bulk dynamics (architecture/activations) from data-dependent stochastic boundary interactions, and builds a field-theoretic formulation of neural dynamics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand training dynamics in deep networks by isolating intrinsic, architecture-driven dynamics from stochastic, data-driven interactions, revealing a local and homogeneous structure.

Method: Starting from stochastic gradient descent, reorganize the Lagrangian into a data-independent bulk term and a data-dependent boundary term; interpret these terms and develop a field-theoretic formulation of neural dynamics based on this decomposition.

Result: The decomposition exposes the intrinsic, architecture-driven dynamics and data-driven stochastic effects, revealing a local, homogeneous structure and enabling a field-theoretic description of neural dynamics as a natural extension.

Conclusion: Introduces a novel framework for studying training dynamics with a bulk–boundary decomposition and a field-theoretic formulation, offering new avenues for theoretical analysis and potential practical insights into deep learning dynamics.

Abstract: We present the bulk-boundary decomposition as a new framework for
understanding the training dynamics of deep neural networks. Starting from the
stochastic gradient descent formulation, we show that the Lagrangian can be
reorganized into a data-independent bulk term and a data-dependent boundary
term. The bulk captures the intrinsic dynamics set by network architecture and
activation functions, while the boundary reflects stochastic interactions from
training samples at the input and output layers. This decomposition exposes the
local and homogeneous structure underlying deep networks. As a natural
extension, we develop a field-theoretic formulation of neural dynamics based on
this decomposition.

### [138] [TapOut: A Bandit-Based Approach to Dynamic Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02017)
*Aditya Sridhar,Nish Sinnadurai,Sean Lie,Vithursan Thangarasa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TapOut is an online, training-free plug-and-play meta-algorithm that dynamically selects among parameter-free speculative-decoding strategies via multi-armed bandits to maximize LLM speedups without hyperparameter tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dynamic speculative decoding struggles with choosing how many tokens to draft; hand-tuned thresholds (e.g., entropy) are brittle, expensive to tune, and poorly generalize across models/domains.

Method: A meta-algorithm (TapOut) uses multi-armed bandits to choose among multiple parameter-free dynamic speculation strategies, updating based on past reward and exploration, in an online, training-free, plug-and-play fashion.

Result: Experiments on varied model pairs and datasets show TapOut achieves competitive or superior speedups compared with established baselines, without hyperparameter tuning.

Conclusion: TapOut offers a practical, hyperparameter-free approach to dynamic speculative decoding with better generalization and ease of deployment, reducing reliance on manual thresholds.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLMs by using a lightweight draft model to
generate tokens autoregressively before verifying them in parallel with a
larger target model. However, determining the optimal number of tokens to draft
remains a key challenge limiting the approach's effectiveness. Dynamic
speculative decoding aims to intelligently decide how many tokens to draft to
achieve maximum speedups. Existing methods often rely on hand-tuned, sensitive
thresholds (e.g., token entropy), which are costly to set and generalize poorly
across models and domains. We propose TapOut, an online, training-free,
plug-and-play algorithm for dynamic speculation policy selection using
multi-armed bandits. Our approach employs a meta-algorithm that selects among
multiple parameter-free dynamic speculation strategies based on past reward and
exploration. We conduct extensive experiments across diverse model pairs and
datasets, showing that TapOut achieves competitive or superior speedups
compared to well-established dynamic speculation baselines without any
hyperparameter tuning.

### [139] [Shared Parameter Subspaces and Cross-Task Linearity in Emergently Misaligned Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02022)
*Daniel Aarao Reis Arturi,Eric Zhang,Andrew Ansah,Kevin Zhu,Ashwinee Panda,Aishwarya Balwani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EM exhibits a cross-task linear structure: similar fine-tuning directions, shared low-dimensional subspaces, and coherent behavior along interpolations, suggesting common parameter regions govern harmful generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to understand the geometric/parametric mechanisms behind emergent misalignment and its cross-domain generalization.

Method: analyze fine-tuned weight updates from multiple narrow misalignment tasks by measuring cosine similarity of updates, principal angles between task subspaces, projection overlaps, and test linear mode connectivity via model interpolations.

Result: EM parameters show strong convergence across tasks: high cosine similarity of fine-tuning updates, shared low-dimensional subspaces (small principal angles), and functional equivalence via linear mode connectivity across interpolations.

Conclusion: harmful behaviors may be organized into specific, predictable regions of weight space; understanding parameter geometry can guide interpretability and interventions to mitigate EM.

Abstract: Recent work has discovered that large language models can develop broadly
misaligned behaviors after being fine-tuned on narrowly harmful datasets, a
phenomenon known as emergent misalignment (EM). However, the fundamental
mechanisms enabling such harmful generalization across disparate domains remain
poorly understood. In this work, we adopt a geometric perspective to study EM
and demonstrate that it exhibits a fundamental cross-task linear structure in
how harmful behavior is encoded across different datasets. Specifically, we
find a strong convergence in EM parameters across tasks, with the fine-tuned
weight updates showing relatively high cosine similarities, as well as shared
lower-dimensional subspaces as measured by their principal angles and
projection overlaps. Furthermore, we also show functional equivalence via
linear mode connectivity, wherein interpolated models across narrow
misalignment tasks maintain coherent, broadly misaligned behavior. Our results
indicate that EM arises from different narrow tasks discovering the same set of
shared parameter directions, suggesting that harmful behaviors may be organized
into specific, predictable regions of the weight landscape. By revealing this
fundamental connection between parametric geometry and behavioral outcomes, we
hope our work catalyzes further research on parameter space interpretability
and weight-based interventions.

### [140] [RobustFSM: Submodular Maximization in Federated Setting with Malicious Clients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02029)
*Duc A. Tran,Dung Truong,Duy Le*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RobustFSM is a federated submodular maximization approach that remains robust to malicious client attacks, with empirical results showing substantial performance gains over standard federated methods under attack (up to 200%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Submodular maximization is a common tool for data summarization and representation. In a federated setting, data remains on local devices for privacy and autonomy, but this exposes the system to adversarial clients that can contaminate the aggregation. There is a need for robustness against such client misbehaviors tailored to submodular objectives.

Method: Introduce RobustFSM, a federated submodular maximization framework with robust aggregation to mitigate malicious client inputs. The method is evaluated against various practical client attacks using real-world datasets.

Result: RobustFSM substantially outperforms conventional federated algorithms under severe attacks. The performance gain is dataset- and attack-dependent, with improvements reported as high as 200%.

Conclusion: RobustFSM offers a robust solution for federated submodular maximization in the presence of adversarial clients; results demonstrate strong empirical resilience, with potential for broader application and future work on theoretical guarantees and broader attack models.

Abstract: Submodular maximization is an optimization problem benefiting many machine
learning applications, where we seek a small subset best representing an
extremely large dataset. We focus on the federated setting where the data are
locally owned by decentralized clients who have their own definitions for the
quality of representability. This setting requires repetitive aggregation of
local information computed by the clients. While the main motivation is to
respect the privacy and autonomy of the clients, the federated setting is
vulnerable to client misbehaviors: malicious clients might share fake
information. An analogy is backdoor attack in conventional federated learning,
but our challenge differs freshly due to the unique characteristics of
submodular maximization. We propose RobustFSM, a federated submodular
maximization solution that is robust to various practical client attacks. Its
performance is substantiated with an empirical evaluation study using
real-world datasets. Numerical results show that the solution quality of
RobustFSM substantially exceeds that of the conventional federated algorithm
when attacks are severe. The degree of this improvement depends on the dataset
and attack scenarios, which can be as high as 200%

*Elham Gholamzadeh,Kajal Singla,Nico Scherf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GNNs on edge-graphs predict the direction and types of microbial interspecies interactions, achieving 80.44% F1 and outperforming XGBoost (72.76%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inter-species interactions shape microbial community structure and activity; leveraging a large, diverse dataset and shared information across experiments can improve predictive accuracy beyond traditional methods.

Method: Construct edge-graphs from pairwise microbial interactions and employ Graph Neural Networks as classifiers to predict interaction direction and types (positive/negative; mutualism, competition, parasitism) using a dataset of ~7,500 interactions among 20 species across 40 carbon conditions (building on Nestor et al.).

Result: Initial results show an F1-score of 80.44% for the GNN model, significantly higher than the 72.76% F1-score reported for XGBoost baselines.

Conclusion: GNN-based edge-graph representations effectively predict not just the existence but the mode of microbial interactions, outperforming traditional ML approaches and highlighting the value of cross-experiment information sharing in co-culture datasets.

Abstract: Predicting interspecies interactions is a key challenge in microbial ecology,
as these interactions are critical to determining the structure and activity of
microbial communities. In this work, we used data on monoculture growth
capabilities, interactions with other species, and phylogeny to predict a
negative or positive effect of interactions. More precisely, we used one of the
largest available pairwise interaction datasets to train our models, comprising
over 7,500 interactions be- tween 20 species from two taxonomic groups
co-cultured under 40 distinct carbon conditions, with a primary focus on the
work of Nestor et al.[28 ]. In this work, we propose Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) as a powerful classifier to predict the direction of the effect. We
construct edge-graphs of pairwise microbial interactions in order to leverage
shared information across individual co-culture experiments, and use GNNs to
predict modes of interaction. Our model can not only predict binary
interactions (positive/negative) but also classify more complex interaction
types such as mutualism, competition, and parasitism. Our initial results were
encouraging, achieving an F1-score of 80.44%. This significantly outperforms
comparable methods in the literature, including conventional Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) models, which reported an F1-score of 72.76%.

### [142] [Quantum-Enhanced Generative Models for Rare Event Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02042)
*M. Z. Haider,M. U. Ghouri,Tayyaba Noreen,M. Salman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid classical-quantum generative model (QEGM) that combines deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits to better model rare events; introduces a hybrid loss and quantum randomness-driven noise; achieves up to 50% reduction in tail KL divergence and improved rare-event recall/calibration across synthetic and real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rare events are scarce and heavy-tailed, making their modeling difficult with classical generative models, which often suffer from mode collapse and poorly calibrated uncertainty. A quantum-enhanced approach could boost diversity and tail modeling.

Method: A hybrid framework integrating deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits. Introduces a hybrid loss optimizing reconstruction fidelity and tail-aware likelihood; employs quantum randomness-driven noise injection to enhance sample diversity and reduce mode collapse. Training uses a hybrid loop: classical parameters updated by backpropagation; quantum parameters updated via parameter-shift gradients.

Result: Evaluated on synthetic Gaussian mixtures and real-world datasets spanning finance, climate, and protein structure. QEGM reduces tail KL divergence by up to 50% compared with state-of-the-art baselines (GAN, VAE, Diffusion) and improves rare-event recall and coverage calibration.

Conclusion: QEGM offers a principled approach for rare-event prediction with robustness beyond purely classical methods, highlighting the potential of hybrid classical-quantum generative modeling for heavy-tailed distributions.

Abstract: Rare events such as financial crashes, climate extremes, and biological
anomalies are notoriously difficult to model due to their scarcity and
heavy-tailed distributions. Classical deep generative models often struggle to
capture these rare occurrences, either collapsing low-probability modes or
producing poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose the
Quantum-Enhanced Generative Model (QEGM), a hybrid classical-quantum framework
that integrates deep latent-variable models with variational quantum circuits.
The framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a hybrid loss function that
jointly optimizes reconstruction fidelity and tail-aware likelihood, and (2)
quantum randomness-driven noise injection to enhance sample diversity and
mitigate mode collapse. Training proceeds via a hybrid loop where classical
parameters are updated through backpropagation while quantum parameters are
optimized using parameter-shift gradients. We evaluate QEGM on synthetic
Gaussian mixtures and real-world datasets spanning finance, climate, and
protein structure. Results demonstrate that QEGM reduces tail KL divergence by
up to 50 percent compared to state-of-the-art baselines (GAN, VAE, Diffusion),
while improving rare-event recall and coverage calibration. These findings
highlight the potential of QEGM as a principled approach for rare-event
prediction, offering robustness beyond what is achievable with purely classical
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flashlight is a compiler-native PyTorch framework that auto-generates fused, FlashAttention-style kernels for arbitrary attention patterns, extending FlexAttention, and delivering competitive performance without static templates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Efficiently supporting diverse attention variants is challenging; existing approaches rely on hand-tuned kernels or static templates (e.g., FlexAttention). There is a need for a flexible, high-performance solution embedded in PyTorch to explore new attention models.

Method: Integrates with PyTorch's compilation workflow to automatically fuse and tile attention computations, generating kernels on the fly for arbitrary attention formulations. It does not rely on static templates and supports all FlexAttention variants as well as more general data-dependent attention.

Result: Flashlight produces kernels with competitive or superior performance to FlexAttention while offering native PyTorch code, enabling rapid exploration of new attention models without sacrificing performance.

Conclusion: Flashlight enables efficient, flexible attention modeling within PyTorch, bridging the gap between performance and programmability and facilitating rapid development of new attention variants without kernel hand-tuning.

Abstract: Bad charactors when submitting to arXiv: Attention is a fundamental building
block of large language models (LLMs), so there have been many efforts to
implement it efficiently. For example, FlashAttention leverages tiling and
kernel fusion to optimize attention. Recently, a number of variants of
attention have been introduced to enhance model quality or efficiency.
Supporting them efficiently remains difficult since they usually require
specialized kernels or hand-tuned implementations. FlexAttention recently
addressed part of this gap by using static programming templates to support
FlashAttention-like kernels for a subset of attention variants.
  In this paper, we introduce Flashlight, a compiler-native framework within
the PyTorch ecosystem that automatically generates fused, FlashAttention-style
kernels for arbitrary attention-based programs, without relying on static
templates or predefined kernel specializations. Flashlight leverages PyTorch's
compilation workflow to fuse and tile attention computations transparently,
enabling efficient execution for diverse attention patterns. Not only does it
support all variants expressible in the FlexAttention model but it also handles
more general, data-dependent attention formulations that are beyond the
capabilities of FlexAttention.
  Our results show that Flashlight produces kernels with competitive or
superior performance to FlexAttention, while offering the flexibility of native
PyTorch code, enabling developers to rapidly explore new attention models
without sacrificing performance.

### [144] [Regularization Through Reasoning: Systematic Improvements in Language Model Classification via Explanation-Enhanced Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02044)
*Vivswan Shah,Randy Cogill,Hanwei Yue,Gopinath Chennupati,Rinat Khaziev*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Explanation-augmented fine-tuning improves LLM classification more than label-only training, and random token explanations still provide benefits by regularizing computation; observed across 18 settings, six datasets, with a 7B model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether attaching brief explanations to each label during fine-tuning can boost classification performance and reliability, and uncover whether semantic content is essential or whether token-level scaffolding provides a regularizing effect.

Method: Fine-tune a 7B-parameter model on ensemble-generated data from multiple LLMs across six conversational datasets (18 settings). Compare label-only vs label-plus-explanation training, including genuine rationales and syntactically incoherent, vocabulary-aligned pseudo-explanations. Evaluate conversational quality on naturalness, comprehensiveness, and on-topic adherence (5-point scales). Analyze internal signals (activation entropy, output mass) across seeds to understand the mechanism.

Result: Label-plus-explanation training outperforms label-only baselines across datasets and settings. Surprisingly, random tokens that mimic explanations still improve accuracy and often reduce the gap to true explanations. The gains persist across seeds, suggesting the benefit arises from the token-budgeted structure that encourages richer intermediate computation and acts as a regularizer.

Conclusion: Explanation-augmented fine-tuning shapes intermediate computation and provides a regularizing effect, improving accuracy and reliability for LLM classification. Both genuine explanations and well-constructed random token scaffolding enhance performance, clarifying how token-level scaffolding guides inference.

Abstract: Fine-tuning LLMs for classification typically maps inputs directly to labels.
We ask whether attaching brief explanations to each label during fine-tuning
yields better models. We evaluate conversational response quality along three
axes: naturalness, comprehensiveness, and on-topic adherence, each rated on
5-point scales. Using ensemble-generated data from multiple LLMs, we fine-tune
a 7B-parameter model and test across six diverse conversational datasets.
Across 18 dataset, task settings, label-plus-explanation training outperforms
label-only baselines.
  A central and unexpected result concerns random tokens. We replace
human-written explanations with text that is syntactically incoherent yet
vocabulary-aligned with the originals (e.g., shuffled or bag-of-words
variants). Despite lacking semantics, these pseudo-explanations still improve
accuracy over label-only training and often narrow much of the gap to true
explanations. The effect persists across datasets and training seeds,
indicating that gains arise less from meaning than from structure: the extra
token budget encourages richer intermediate computation and acts as a
regularizer that reduces over-confident shortcuts.
  Internal analyses support this view: explanation-augmented models exhibit
higher activation entropy in intermediate layers alongside sharper predictive
mass at the output layer, consistent with increased deliberation before
decision. Overall, explanation-augmented fine-tuning, whether with genuine
rationales or carefully constructed random token sequences, improves accuracy
and reliability for LLM classification while clarifying how token-level
scaffolding shapes computation during inference.

### [145] [A Dual-Use Framework for Clinical Gait Analysis: Attention-Based Sensor Optimization and Automated Dataset Auditing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02047)
*Hamidreza Sadeghsalehi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-stream attention-based DL framework can audit gait datasets for biases and suggest sensor synergies; it reveals a severe laterality bias in a public OA/CVA dataset (right-foot dominant) that is not a clinical finding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate hidden dataset biases and optimize sensor configurations in gait analysis, ensuring robust, generalizable AI across neurological/orthopedic conditions.

Method: A multi-stream attention-based deep learning model that acts as a sensor optimizer and automated data auditor. Applied to the Voisard et al. (2025) multi-cohort gait dataset across four tasks (PD, OA, CVA screening; PD vs CVA differential). The model’s attention is analyzed to audit data integrity and to propose data-driven sensor synergies (e.g., Head+Foot).

Result: The model quantitatively uncovered a severe dataset confound: for OA and CVA screening (bilateral assessment tasks), >70% of attention was given to the Right Foot while Left Foot received <0.1% attention (95% CI [0.0–0.1]), reflecting a laterality bias in the public dataset (e.g., 15 of 15 right-sided OA). This bias is a dataset issue, not a clinical finding. A secondary finding is the proposal of novel sensor synergies from the data (e.g., Head+Foot for PD screening) as hypotheses for future protocol optimization.

Conclusion: Methodologically, the work shows that an interpretable framework can automatically audit dataset integrity in gait analysis. This supports better data curation and suggests data-driven sensor configurations to improve future studies and clinical deployments.

Abstract: Objective gait analysis using wearable sensors and AI is critical for
managing neurological and orthopedic conditions. However, models are vulnerable
to hidden dataset biases, and task-specific sensor optimization remains a
challenge. We propose a multi-stream attention-based deep learning framework
that functions as both a sensor optimizer and an automated data auditor.
Applied to the Voisard et al. (2025) multi-cohort gait dataset on four clinical
tasks (PD, OA, CVA screening; PD vs CVA differential), the model's attention
mechanism quantitatively discovered a severe dataset confound. For OA and CVA
screening, tasks where bilateral assessment is clinically essential, the model
assigned more than 70 percent attention to the Right Foot while statistically
ignoring the Left Foot (less than 0.1 percent attention, 95 percent CI
[0.0-0.1]). This was not a clinical finding but a direct reflection of a severe
laterality bias (for example, 15 of 15 right-sided OA) in the public dataset.
The primary contribution of this work is methodological, demonstrating that an
interpretable framework can automatically audit dataset integrity. As a
secondary finding, the model proposes novel, data-driven sensor synergies (for
example, Head plus Foot for PD screening) as hypotheses for future optimized
protocols.

*Nimrod Megiddo,Segev Wasserkrug,Orit Davidovich,Shimrit Shtern*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A solver for binary-variable maximization that trains an estimator to predict optimal values from objective distributions, using an optimality-deviation loss, without solving instances or evaluating policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable efficient optimization by leveraging distributions over objectives and sub-instances, avoiding reliance on solved instances or policy-value computations.

Method: Train an estimator of the optimal objective value using an inequality that converts optimality deviation into a loss function; training does not require solving instances or computing policy values.

Result: Not specified in abstract.

Conclusion: The approach offers a training framework that bypasses solving instances and policy evaluation, potentially enabling faster, distribution-aware optimization.

Abstract: The paper is about developing a solver for maximizing a real-valued function
of binary variables. The solver relies on an algorithm that estimates the
optimal objective-function value of instances from the underlying distribution
of objectives and their respective sub-instances. The training of the estimator
is based on an inequality that facilitates the use of the expected total
deviation from optimality conditions as a loss function rather than the
objective-function itself. Thus, it does not calculate values of policies, nor
does it rely on solved instances.

### [147] [Beyond Static Cutoffs: One-Shot Dynamic Thresholding for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02077)
*Jucheng Shen,Yeonju Ro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: One-shot Dynamic Thresholding (OSDT) for masked diffusion language models accelerates decoding by calibrating a per-sequence confidence threshold on a single sequence and reusing it for subsequent inputs, delivering notable throughput gains with controlled accuracy loss on several benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MDLM decoding uses fixed steps and often relies on a static global threshold; observed strong fluctuations in confidence and highly similar confidence trajectories across inputs suggest the possibility of reusable, task-level confidence signatures to speed up diffusion decoding.

Method: Calibrate a confidence threshold on a single sequence (one-shot) and apply this dynamic threshold to subsequent inputs with negligible overhead, promoting parallel decoding over time steps over MDLMs instead of fixed-step, sequential unmasking.

Result: On GPQA, GSM8K, and HumanEval, OS TDT achieves superior accuracy-throughput trade-offs: +24% tokens/s on GSM8K at best accuracy, +45% on GPQA with comparable accuracy, and +50% on HumanEval with a modest accuracy gap.

Conclusion: Reusable task-level confidence signatures can enable general improvements in diffusion decoding; OS TDT demonstrates substantial throughput gains with limited accuracy loss and motivates broader algorithmic/systems innovations in diffusion decoding.

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are becoming competitive with their
autoregressive counterparts but typically decode with fixed steps and
sequential unmasking. To accelerate decoding, recent work such as Fast-dLLM
enables parallel decoding via a static global confidence threshold, yet we
observe strong block- and step-wise confidence fluctuations and, within a
dataset, near-identical confidence trajectories across inputs as measured by
cosine similarity. Motivated by these observations, we introduce One-Shot
Dynamic Thresholding (OSDT), which calibrates thresholds on a single sequence
and applies them to subsequent inputs with negligible overhead. On GPQA, GSM8K,
and HumanEval, OSDT attains superior accuracy-throughput trade-offs (+24%
tokens/s on GSM8K at the best accuracy, +45% on GPQA with comparable accuracy,
and +50% on HumanEval with a modest accuracy gap). Beyond these results, our
findings suggest broader opportunities to leverage reusable task-level
confidence signatures for more general-purpose algorithmic and systems
innovations in diffusion decoding.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To move physics-informed ML beyond architecture tweaks by embedding physical knowledge directly into the loss, enabling training signals that respect equilibrium physics and symmetries across scientific domains.

Method: Assume data samples are in thermal equilibrium with an approximate energy landscape. Use reverse KL divergence with a Boltzmann distribution around the data to derive an energy-based loss that measures the energy difference between data and model predictions. This unifies traditional objectives (e.g., MSE) as special cases, yields physically grounded gradients, is architecture-agnostic, computationally efficient, and naturally respects physical symmetries.

Result: Demonstrated on molecular generation and spin ground-state prediction, with significant improvements over baselines and better alignment of gradients with physically valid configurations.

Conclusion: Energy-based loss functions provide a physically grounded, symmetry-aware, architecture-agnostic framework for physics-informed ML, enabling efficient training and improved performance on scientific tasks.

Abstract: Effectively leveraging prior knowledge of a system's physics is crucial for
applications of machine learning to scientific domains. Previous approaches
mostly focused on incorporating physical insights at the architectural level.
In this paper, we propose a framework to leverage physical information directly
into the loss function for prediction and generative modeling tasks on systems
like molecules and spins. We derive energy loss functions assuming that each
data sample is in thermal equilibrium with respect to an approximate energy
landscape. By using the reverse KL divergence with a Boltzmann distribution
around the data, we obtain the loss as an energy difference between the data
and the model predictions. This perspective also recasts traditional objectives
like MSE as energy-based, but with a physically meaningless energy. In
contrast, our formulation yields physically grounded loss functions with
gradients that better align with valid configurations, while being
architecture-agnostic and computationally efficient. The energy loss functions
also inherently respect physical symmetries. We demonstrate our approach on
molecular generation and spin ground-state prediction and report significant
improvements over baselines.

### [149] [LLM Probing with Contrastive Eigenproblems: Improving Understanding and Applicability of CCS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02089)
*Stefan F. Schouten,Peter Bloem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reframe CCS as an eigenproblem by optimizing relative (instead of absolute) contrast consistency, producing closed-form solutions that generalize to multiple variables and are less sensitive to initialization, while preserving performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To deepen understanding of how Contrast-Consistent Search probes binary features in LLM activations, fix ambiguities in the original two-term objective, and broaden its applicability for mechanistic interpretability.

Method: Introduce relative contrast consistency as the objective, derive an eigenproblem with closed-form solutions, and extend the framework to multiple variables; empirically compare with CCS across datasets for performance and initialization sensitivity.

Result: The eigenform solutions achieve comparable performance to CCS, exhibit reduced sensitivity to random initialization, and provide interpretable eigenvalues; the method extends naturally to more variables without loss of efficacy.

Conclusion: Relativizing contrast consistency clarifies CCS mechanics and enables broader probing and interpretability tools, with stable performance and natural multi-variable extensions.

Abstract: Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) is an unsupervised probing method able to
test whether large language models represent binary features, such as sentence
truth, in their internal activations. While CCS has shown promise, its two-term
objective has been only partially understood. In this work, we revisit CCS with
the aim of clarifying its mechanisms and extending its applicability. We argue
that what should be optimized for, is relative contrast consistency. Building
on this insight, we reformulate CCS as an eigenproblem, yielding closed-form
solutions with interpretable eigenvalues and natural extensions to multiple
variables. We evaluate these approaches across a range of datasets, finding
that they recover similar performance to CCS, while avoiding problems around
sensitivity to random initialization. Our results suggest that relativizing
contrast consistency not only improves our understanding of CCS but also opens
pathways for broader probing and mechanistic interpretability methods.

### [150] [Natural Building Blocks for Structured World Models: Theory, Evidence, and Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02091)
*Lancelot Da Costa,Sanjeev Namjoshi,Mohammed Abbas Ansari,Bernhard Schölkopf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a modular world-modeling framework built from discrete (HMM) and continuous (sLDS) blocks, enabling passive (generation/forecasting) and active (planning/decision-making) tasks with a fixed architecture and a small set of depth parameters; highlights scalability learning as the main bottleneck.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: World-modeling research is fragmented and lacks standardized building blocks. A modular, interpretable framework that unifies discrete and continuous processes could provide a scalable foundation for both prediction and control.

Method: Define fundamental building blocks as HMMs for discrete dynamics and switching linear dynamical systems for continuous dynamics; compose them hierarchically and augment with actions to form POMDPs and controlled sLDS; fix the causal architecture and search over four depth parameters; evaluate expressiveness through multimodal generation and planning from pixels, and compare to neural approaches while maintaining interpretability.

Result: Demonstrates competitive performance with neural methods in passive and active tasks while preserving interpretability; identifies scalable joint structure-parameter learning as the core remaining challenge; current methods grow structure and parameters incrementally but face scalability limits.

Conclusion: If scalable joint structure-parameter learning is achieved, these natural building blocks could serve as foundational infrastructure for world modeling, analogous to standardized layers in deep learning.

Abstract: The field of world modeling is fragmented, with researchers developing
bespoke architectures that rarely build upon each other. We propose a framework
that specifies the natural building blocks for structured world models based on
the fundamental stochastic processes that any world model must capture:
discrete processes (logic, symbols) and continuous processes (physics,
dynamics); the world model is then defined by the hierarchical composition of
these building blocks. We examine Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and switching
linear dynamical systems (sLDS) as natural building blocks for discrete and
continuous modeling--which become partially-observable Markov decision
processes (POMDPs) and controlled sLDS when augmented with actions. This
modular approach supports both passive modeling (generation, forecasting) and
active control (planning, decision-making) within the same architecture. We
avoid the combinatorial explosion of traditional structure learning by largely
fixing the causal architecture and searching over only four depth parameters.
We review practical expressiveness through multimodal generative modeling
(passive) and planning from pixels (active), with performance competitive to
neural approaches while maintaining interpretability. The core outstanding
challenge is scalable joint structure-parameter learning; current methods
finesse this by cleverly growing structure and parameters incrementally, but
are limited in their scalability. If solved, these natural building blocks
could provide foundational infrastructure for world modeling, analogous to how
standardized layers enabled progress in deep learning.

### [151] [Uncertainty Guided Online Ensemble for Non-stationary Data Streams in Fusion Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02092)
*Kishansingh Rajput,Malachi Schram,Brian Sammuli,Sen Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Online learning with uncertainty-guided ensemble improves predictive robustness for drifting fusion data, outperforming static models and standard online learning by noticeable margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fusion data are non-stationary with distribution drift due to evolving experiments and wear; static ML models fail to maintain performance; online learning and calibrated uncertainty can sustain accuracy in drifting streams.

Method: Apply online learning to predict Toroidal Field (TF) coils deflection at the DIII-D facility, using Deep Gaussian Process Approximation (DGPA) for calibrated uncertainty, and an ensemble of learners trained on different historical horizons guided by uncertainty estimates via a meta-algorithm.

Result: Online learning reduces error by ~80% vs a static model. The online ensemble yields ~6% improvement over standard online learning, while the uncertainty-guided online ensemble yields ~10% improvement. DGPA provides uncertainty with predictions.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-guided online ensemble with DGPA enhances accuracy and robustness of ML predictions in non-stationary fusion data, enabling more reliable decision making in fusion devices.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is poised to play a pivotal role in the development and
operation of next-generation fusion devices. Fusion data shows non-stationary
behavior with distribution drifts, resulted by both experimental evolution and
machine wear-and-tear. ML models assume stationary distribution and fail to
maintain performance when encountered with such non-stationary data streams.
Online learning techniques have been leveraged in other domains, however it has
been largely unexplored for fusion applications. In this paper, we present an
application of online learning to continuously adapt to drifting data stream
for prediction of Toroidal Field (TF) coils deflection at the DIII-D fusion
facility. The results demonstrate that online learning is critical to maintain
ML model performance and reduces error by 80% compared to a static model.
Moreover, traditional online learning can suffer from short-term performance
degradation as ground truth is not available before making the predictions. As
such, we propose an uncertainty guided online ensemble method to further
improve the performance. The Deep Gaussian Process Approximation (DGPA)
technique is leveraged for calibrated uncertainty estimation and the
uncertainty values are then used to guide a meta-algorithm that produces
predictions based on an ensemble of learners trained on different horizon of
historical data. The DGPA also provides uncertainty estimation along with the
predictions for decision makers. The online ensemble and the proposed
uncertainty guided online ensemble reduces predictions error by about 6%, and
10% respectively over standard single model based online learning.

### [152] [Geometric Data Valuation via Leverage Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02100)
*Rodrigo Mendoza-Smith*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable alternative to Shapley data valuation using leverage-based scores; ridge leverage yields positive gains, links to design criteria, and provides performance guarantees; empirically improves active learning without gradient access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shapley data valuation is principled but intractable due to combinatorial evaluation across all subsets. There is a need for scalable, theoretically grounded data valuation methods that can guide dataset curation, pruning, and active learning. The authors propose a geometric alternative based on leverage scores to capture each datapoint's influence in the representation space and connect to design criteria and downstream performance.

Method: Compute statistical leverage scores to quantify datapoint influence in the representation space; extend to ridge leverage scores to ensure strictly positive marginal gains; demonstrate that these scores satisfy the Shapley dummy, efficiency, and symmetry axioms; relate ridge leverage to classical A- and D-optimal design criteria; prove that training on leverage-sampled subsets yields model parameters and predictive risk within O(ε) of the full-data optimum; validate empirically via an active learning experiment showing ridge-leverage sampling outperforms standard baselines without requiring access gradients or backward passes.

Result: The proposed leverage-based scores satisfy core Shapley axioms and, when extended to ridge leverage, provide strictly positive marginal gains. Theoretical results establish a link between leverage sampling and optimal design with near-optimal downstream performance (O(ε) proximity to full data). Empirically, ridge-leverage sampling outperforms baselines in active learning scenarios without gradient access.

Conclusion: Offers a scalable, theoretically grounded alternative to Shapley data valuation that connects datapoint influence with design criteria and downstream model quality. Ridge leverage sampling provides practical benefits for data selection and active learning without requiring backpropagation through gradients.

Abstract: Shapley data valuation provides a principled, axiomatic framework for
assigning importance to individual datapoints, and has gained traction in
dataset curation, pruning, and pricing. However, it is a combinatorial measure
that requires evaluating marginal utility across all subsets of the data,
making it computationally infeasible at scale. We propose a geometric
alternative based on statistical leverage scores, which quantify each
datapoint's structural influence in the representation space by measuring how
much it extends the span of the dataset and contributes to the effective
dimensionality of the training problem. We show that our scores satisfy the
dummy, efficiency, and symmetry axioms of Shapley valuation and that extending
them to \emph{ridge leverage scores} yields strictly positive marginal gains
that connect naturally to classical A- and D-optimal design criteria. We
further show that training on a leverage-sampled subset produces a model whose
parameters and predictive risk are within $O(\varepsilon)$ of the full-data
optimum, thereby providing a rigorous link between data valuation and
downstream decision quality. Finally, we conduct an active learning experiment
in which we empirically demonstrate that ridge-leverage sampling outperforms
standard baselines without requiring access gradients or backward passes.

### [153] [Measuring the Intrinsic Dimension of Earth Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02101)
*Arjun Rao,Marc Rußwurm,Konstantin Klemmer,Esther Rolf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: This paper investigates the intrinsic dimensionality of geographic Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) for Earth observation, showing that their intrinsic dimensions lie around 2–10 and depend on resolution and input modality, with a correlation to downstream task performance, offering a label-free metric for evaluation and design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify how much information geographic INRs actually encode and where it concentrates, providing a scalable, unsupervised metric for evaluating and guiding INR design and pre-training.

Method: Analyze geographic INRs with ambient dimensionalities between 256 and 512, estimate their intrinsic dimensionality, study how it changes with spatial resolution and input modalities during pre-training, and examine its relation to downstream task performance and detection of spatial artifacts.

Result: Intrinsic dimensionality of geographic INRs is roughly between 2 and 10; it is sensitive to spatial resolution and input modality during pre-training, correlates with downstream performance, and can reveal spatial artifacts.

Conclusion: Intrinsic dimensionality serves as an architecture-agnostic, label-free metric of information content for geographic INRs, enabling unsupervised evaluation, model selection, and pre-training design across INR-based Earth representations.

Abstract: Within the context of representation learning for Earth observation,
geographic Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) embed low-dimensional
location inputs (longitude, latitude) into high-dimensional embeddings, through
models trained on geo-referenced satellite, image or text data. Despite the
common aim of geographic INRs to distill Earth's data into compact,
learning-friendly representations, we lack an understanding of how much
information is contained in these Earth representations, and where that
information is concentrated. The intrinsic dimension of a dataset measures the
number of degrees of freedom required to capture its local variability,
regardless of the ambient high-dimensional space in which it is embedded. This
work provides the first study of the intrinsic dimensionality of geographic
INRs. Analyzing INRs with ambient dimension between 256 and 512, we find that
their intrinsic dimensions fall roughly between 2 and 10 and are sensitive to
changing spatial resolution and input modalities during INR pre-training.
Furthermore, we show that the intrinsic dimension of a geographic INR
correlates with downstream task performance and can capture spatial artifacts,
facilitating model evaluation and diagnostics. More broadly, our work offers an
architecture-agnostic, label-free metric of information content that can enable
unsupervised evaluation, model selection, and pre-training design across INRs.

### [154] [Matrix Sensing with Kernel Optimal Loss: Robustness and Optimization Landscape](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02122)
*Xinyuan Song,Jiaye Teng,Ziye Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A kernel-based robust loss for nonconvex matrix sensing improves robustness to non-Gaussian/heavy-tailed noise, matching MSE under Gaussian noise while reshaping the optimization landscape to reduce spurious local minima via RIP analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mean squared error (MSE) is sensitive to non-Gaussian or heavy-tailed noise in nonconvex optimization; a robust, broadly applicable loss could improve reliability and performance across noise distributions.

Method: Introduce a nonparametric, kernel-density-based residual loss that maximizes the estimated residual likelihood. Show it coincides with MSE under Gaussian noise, and analyze the optimization landscape by upper-bounding RIP constants to demonstrate disappearance of spurious local minima. Validate theoretically and empirically.

Result: The robust loss achieves better robustness to large noise and varied noise distributions, outperforming MSE in diverse settings and providing improved stability and performance in noisy matrix sensing.

Conclusion: Simple loss design changes can significantly enhance robustness and shape the optimization landscape; the kernel-based robust loss offers a general, insightful framework for robust nonconvex learning.

Abstract: In this paper we study how the choice of loss functions of non-convex
optimization problems affects their robustness and optimization landscape,
through the study of noisy matrix sensing. In traditional regression tasks,
mean squared error (MSE) loss is a common choice, but it can be unreliable for
non-Gaussian or heavy-tailed noise. To address this issue, we adopt a robust
loss based on nonparametric regression, which uses a kernel-based estimate of
the residual density and maximizes the estimated log-likelihood. This robust
formulation coincides with the MSE loss under Gaussian errors but remains
stable under more general settings. We further examine how this robust loss
reshapes the optimization landscape by analyzing the upper-bound of restricted
isometry property (RIP) constants for spurious local minima to disappear.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that this new loss excels
at handling large noise and remains robust across diverse noise distributions.
This work offers initial insights into enhancing the robustness of machine
learning tasks through simply changing the loss, guided by an intuitive and
broadly applicable analytical framework.

### [155] [Variance-Aware Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for Contextual Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02123)
*Xuheng Li,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces FGTSVA, a variance-aware Thompson Sampling algorithm for contextual bandits with general reward functions, achieving a near-optimal regret bound that scales with a new decoupling coefficient and the cumulative variance of noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fill a gap in variance-dependent regret analysis for sampling-based bandits (Thompson sampling) with general reward functions, improving over LinVDTS which is limited to linear rewards and suboptimal in dimension.

Method: Extend the decoupling coefficient to a new dc that captures model-space complexity; develop FGTS-VA (variance-aware FGTS) algorithm; derive regret bound and show it scales as ~O~(sqrt(dc * log|F| * sum_t sigma_t^2) + dc). Apply to contextual linear bandits.

Result: FGTS-VA achieves a regret bound of ~O~(sqrt(dc * log|F| * sum_t sigma_t^2) + dc); in the contextual linear setting, its bound matches the weighted-regression UCB results of Zhou and Gu (2022).

Conclusion: Variance-aware Thompson sampling with FGTS-VA achieves optimal regret in general reward contextual bandits and aligns with best-known UCB-type bounds in linear cases, addressing prior limitations of LinVDTS.

Abstract: Variance-dependent regret bounds have received increasing attention in recent
studies on contextual bandits. However, most of these studies are focused on
upper confidence bound (UCB)-based bandit algorithms, while sampling based
bandit algorithms such as Thompson sampling are still understudied. The only
exception is the LinVDTS algorithm (Xu et al., 2023), which is limited to
linear reward function and its regret bound is not optimal with respect to the
model dimension. In this paper, we present FGTSVA, a variance-aware Thompson
Sampling algorithm for contextual bandits with general reward function with
optimal regret bound. At the core of our analysis is an extension of the
decoupling coefficient, a technique commonly used in the analysis of Feel-good
Thompson sampling (FGTS) that reflects the complexity of the model space. With
the new decoupling coefficient denoted by $\mathrm{dc}$, FGTS-VA achieves the
regret of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\mathrm{dc}\cdot\log|\mathcal{F}|\sum_{t=1}^T\sigma_t^2}+\mathrm{dc})$,
where $|\mathcal{F}|$ is the size of the model space, $T$ is the total number
of rounds, and $\sigma_t^2$ is the subgaussian norm of the noise (e.g.,
variance when the noise is Gaussian) at round $t$. In the setting of contextual
linear bandits, the regret bound of FGTSVA matches that of UCB-based algorithms
using weighted linear regression (Zhou and Gu, 2022).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A hybrid quantum-classical CNN (QCNN) classifies heart-sound abnormalities by converting PCGs into 8-pixel images and using 8 qubits; shows high accuracy on HLS-CMDS, marking an early step toward quantum-assisted diagnostics in resource-limited settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early detection of cardiac abnormalities; leverage QCNN to capture complex temporal-spectral patterns in biomedical signals; explore quantum processing in constrained healthcare environments.

Method: Transform 1D PCG signals into 2D compact images via wavelet feature extraction and adaptive threshold compression, yielding an 8-pixel image; run a QCNN with 8 qubits for the quantum stage; evaluate on HLS-CMDS dataset.

Result: Test accuracy 93.33% and train accuracy 97.14% on HLS-CMDS; claims first QCNN application to bioacoustic signals; suggests effective capture of temporal-spectral correlations.

Conclusion: An initial demonstration of quantum-enhanced classification for heart sounds; indicates potential for deploying quantum models in resource-constrained healthcare, though further validation and scalability are needed.

Abstract: Early identification of abnormal physiological patterns is essential for the
timely detection of cardiac disease. This work introduces a hybrid
quantum-classical convolutional neural network (QCNN) designed to classify S3
and murmur abnormalities in heart sound signals. The approach transforms
one-dimensional phonocardiogram (PCG) signals into compact two-dimensional
images through a combination of wavelet feature extraction and adaptive
threshold compression methods. We compress the cardiac-sound patterns into an
8-pixel image so that only 8 qubits are needed for the quantum stage.
Preliminary results on the HLS-CMDS dataset demonstrate 93.33% classification
accuracy on the test set and 97.14% on the train set, suggesting that quantum
models can efficiently capture temporal-spectral correlations in biomedical
signals. To our knowledge, this is the first application of a QCNN algorithm
for bioacoustic signal processing. The proposed method represents an early step
toward quantum-enhanced diagnostic systems for resource-constrained healthcare
environments.

*Yi Luo,Haochen Zhao,Xiao Liang,Yiwei Liu,Yuye Zhang,Xinyu Li,Jianxin Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces CausalDDS, a framework for drug synergy prediction that disentangles molecules into causal and spurious substructures and uses causal parts for prediction, with conditional interventions and a sufficiency/independence objective; claims improved performance in cold-start and out-of-distribution settings and provides interpretable substructure insights.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current drug synergy predictors are often black-box and rely on correlations, lacking interpretability or causal reasoning. There is a need to identify causal molecular features that drive synergy to improve prediction and aid discovery.

Method: Decompose molecular graphs into causal and spurious substructures; use causal representations for synergy prediction; apply conditional interventions based on paired molecular structures; optimize with an objective guided by sufficiency and independence; evaluate on cold-start and out-of-distribution tasks and provide substructure-level explanations.

Result: Outperforms baselines, particularly in cold-start and OOD scenarios; successfully identifies key substructures responsible for synergy and offers interpretable insights into drug combinations at the molecular level.

Conclusion: CausalDDS provides a practical, interpretable approach for drug synergy prediction by focusing on causal molecular features and a novel intervention-based objective, with strong potential to assist drug discovery.

Abstract: Drug synergy prediction is a critical task in the development of effective
combination therapies for complex diseases, including cancer. Although existing
methods have shown promising results, they often operate as black-box
predictors that rely predominantly on statistical correlations between drug
characteristics and results. To address this limitation, we propose CausalDDS,
a novel framework that disentangles drug molecules into causal and spurious
substructures, utilizing the causal substructure representations for predicting
drug synergy. By focusing on causal sub-structures, CausalDDS effectively
mitigates the impact of redundant features introduced by spurious
substructures, enhancing the accuracy and interpretability of the model. In
addition, CausalDDS employs a conditional intervention mechanism, where
interventions are conditioned on paired molecular structures, and introduces a
novel optimization objective guided by the principles of sufficiency and
independence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
baseline models, particularly in cold start and out-of-distribution settings.
Besides, CausalDDS effectively identifies key substructures underlying drug
synergy, providing clear insights into how drug combinations work at the
molecular level. These results underscore the potential of CausalDDS as a
practical tool for predicting drug synergy and facilitating drug discovery.

*Abdullah Almansour,Ozan Tonguz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Characteristic functions (CF) in the frequency domain offer a powerful alternative to traditional metrics for measuring distribution shift in high-dimensional spaces and for domain adaptation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distribution shift degrades ML performance in real-world deployment, and existing statistical measures (KL, KS, Wasserstein) have limitations in high dimensions. A frequency-domain perspective via CF may more effectively capture shifts.

Method: Propose and evaluate CF-based distribution-shift measurement as a frequency-domain approach, highlighting its advantages over conventional metrics for high-dimensional data and domain adaptation tasks.

Result: The abstract asserts that CF-based, frequency-domain measurement is a powerful alternative for quantifying distribution shift in high-dimensional spaces and for domain adaptation.

Conclusion: CF-based frequency-domain analysis is a promising tool for detecting and addressing distribution shift in ML, with particular strength in high-dimensional and domain-adaptation settings.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are extensively used in various applications due
to their significant advantages over traditional learning methods. However, the
developed ML models often underperform when deployed in the real world due to
the well-known distribution shift problem. This problem can lead to a
catastrophic outcomes when these decision-making systems have to operate in
high-risk applications. Many researchers have previously studied this problem
in ML, known as distribution shift problem, using statistical techniques (such
as Kullback-Leibler, Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, Wasserstein distance, etc.) to
quantify the distribution shift. In this letter, we show that using
Characteristic Function (CF) as a frequency domain approach is a powerful
alternative for measuring the distribution shift in high-dimensional space and
for domain adaptation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoTSNet provides interpretable MVTS classification by extending ProtoPNet with a group-convolution encoder, autoencoder pre-training, and feature-importance quantification; it achieves top performance among ante-hoc explainable methods and remains competitive with non-explainable/post-hoc methods.

Conclusion: ProtoTSNet delivers interpretable, accurate multivariate time-series classification by combining a specialized, feature-aware encoder with ProtoPNet, enabling domain experts to obtain actionable insights without sacrificing performance.

Abstract: Time series data is one of the most popular data modalities in critical
domains such as industry and medicine. The demand for algorithms that not only
exhibit high accuracy but also offer interpretability is crucial in such

we present ProtoTSNet, a novel approach to interpretable classification of
multivariate time series data, through substantial enhancements to the
ProtoPNet architecture. Our method is tailored to overcome the unique
challenges of time series analysis, including capturing dynamic patterns and
handling varying feature significance. Central to our innovation is a modified
convolutional encoder utilizing group convolutions, pre-trainable as part of an
autoencoder and designed to preserve and quantify feature importance. We
evaluated our model on 30 multivariate time series datasets from the UEA
archive, comparing our approach with existing explainable methods as well as
non-explainable baselines. Through comprehensive evaluation and ablation
studies, we demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance among
ante-hoc explainable methods while maintaining competitive performance with
non-explainable and post-hoc explainable approaches, providing interpretable

*Yuzhuang Pian,Taiyu Wang,Shiqi Zhang,Rui Xu,Yonghong Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Bayesian spatiotemporal neural field model (CGLUBNF) handles incomplete air-quality data, combining Fourier features, graph attention, and channel gated units to deliver accurate forecasts with calibrated prediction intervals, outperforming five baselines on two real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Incomplete spatiotemporal observations hinder reliable forecasting and risk assessment; need end-to-end methods that provide both accurate predictions and reliable uncertainty estimates for air quality under missing data scenarios.

Method: Proposes CGLUBNF, an end-to-end framework using Fourier features and a graph attention encoder for multiscale spatial and seasonal temporal dynamics; a channel gated learning unit with learnable activations and gated residuals to filter/amplify informative features; Bayesian inference to jointly optimize predictive distributions and parameter uncertainty; evaluation on two real datasets with four missing-data patterns against five baselines.

Result: Achieves superior prediction accuracy and sharper prediction intervals; maintains robustness across multiple prediction horizons; analysis of extraneous variables; demonstrates potential for reliable forecasting in mobile sensing contexts.

Conclusion: This work lays a foundation for reliable deep learning-based spatiotemporal forecasting with incomplete observations, enabling robust air-quality prediction and uncertainty quantification in emerging sensing paradigms.

Abstract: Accurate air quality forecasts are vital for public health alerts, exposure
assessment, and emissions control. In practice, observational data are often
missing in varying proportions and patterns due to collection and transmission
issues. These incomplete spatiotemporal records impede reliable inference and
risk assessment and can lead to overconfident extrapolation. To address these
challenges, we propose an end to end framework, the channel gated learning unit
based spatiotemporal bayesian neural field (CGLUBNF). It uses Fourier features
with a graph attention encoder to capture multiscale spatial dependencies and
seasonal temporal dynamics. A channel gated learning unit, equipped with
learnable activations and gated residual connections, adaptively filters and
amplifies informative features. Bayesian inference jointly optimizes predictive
distributions and parameter uncertainty, producing point estimates and
calibrated prediction intervals. We conduct a systematic evaluation on two real
world datasets, covering four typical missing data patterns and comparing
against five state of the art baselines. CGLUBNF achieves superior prediction
accuracy and sharper confidence intervals. In addition, we further validate
robustness across multiple prediction horizons and analysis the contribution of
extraneous variables. This research lays a foundation for reliable deep
learning based spatio-temporal forecasting with incomplete observations in
emerging sensing paradigms, such as real world vehicle borne mobile monitoring.

*Kevin Valencia,Thilina Balasooriya,Xihaier Luo,Shinjae Yoo,David Keetae Park*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OmniField is a continuity-aware multimodal spatiotemporal neural field that handles arbitrary missing modalities, sparse/noisy data, and cross-modal fusion to deliver unified reconstruction, interpolation, forecasting, and cross-modal prediction without gridding, outperforming baselines and robust to sensor noise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world multimodal spatiotemporal data suffer from sparse, irregular, and noisy within-modality measurements, while cross-modal correlations exist and modalities vary across space/time. This demands models that can adapt to arbitrary modality subsets during training and testing.

Method: Proposes OmniField: a continuous neural field conditioned on available modalities with a cross-modal fusion scheme. Introduces a multimodal crosstalk block and iterative cross-modal refinement to align signals before decoding, enabling unified reconstruction/interpolation/forecasting/prediction without gridding or surrogate preprocessing.

Result: Extensive experiments show OmniField outperforms eight strong baselines; with heavy simulated sensor noise, performance remains near clean-input levels, demonstrating robustness to corrupted measurements.

Conclusion: OmniField offers a versatile, robust framework for real-world multimodal spatiotemporal learning, capable of handling missing modalities and noise while unifying multiple tasks without preprocessing burdens.

Abstract: Multimodal spatiotemporal learning on real-world experimental data is
constrained by two challenges: within-modality measurements are sparse,
irregular, and noisy (QA/QC artifacts) but cross-modally correlated; the set of
available modalities varies across space and time, shrinking the usable record
unless models can adapt to arbitrary subsets at train and test time. We propose
OmniField, a continuity-aware framework that learns a continuous neural field
conditioned on available modalities and iteratively fuses cross-modal context.
A multimodal crosstalk block architecture paired with iterative cross-modal
refinement aligns signals prior to the decoder, enabling unified
reconstruction, interpolation, forecasting, and cross-modal prediction without
gridding or surrogate preprocessing. Extensive evaluations show that OmniField
consistently outperforms eight strong multimodal spatiotemporal baselines.
Under heavy simulated sensor noise, performance remains close to clean-input
levels, highlighting robustness to corrupted measurements.

### [162] [Learning Interactive World Model for Object-Centric Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02225)
*Fan Feng,Phillip Lippe,Sara Magliacane*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable object-centric world model (FIOC-WM) learns disentangled object interactions from pixels to enable modular, hierarchical control, improving sample efficiency and generalization for RL.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object-centric RL typically models objects but treats interactions implicitly. Explicitly modeling object interactions can improve robustness, transfer, and overall policy performance.

Method: FIOC-WM learns object-centric latent representations and an explicit interaction structure directly from pixels using pre-trained vision encoders. The world model decomposes tasks into composable interaction primitives, and a hierarchical policy is trained: a high-level selects the type/order of interactions, while a low-level executes them.

Result: On simulated robotic and embodied-AI benchmarks, FIOC-WM improves policy-learning sample efficiency and generalization over world-model baselines, suggesting that explicit, modular interaction learning is beneficial for robust control.

Conclusion: Explicit, modular learning of object interactions within an object-centric world model leads to more robust and transferable policies, with faster learning and better generalization.

Abstract: Agents that understand objects and their interactions can learn policies that
are more robust and transferable. However, most object-centric RL methods
factor state by individual objects while leaving interactions implicit. We
introduce the Factored Interactive Object-Centric World Model (FIOC-WM), a
unified framework that learns structured representations of both objects and
their interactions within a world model. FIOC-WM captures environment dynamics
with disentangled and modular representations of object interactions, improving
sample efficiency and generalization for policy learning. Concretely, FIOC-WM
first learns object-centric latents and an interaction structure directly from
pixels, leveraging pre-trained vision encoders. The learned world model then
decomposes tasks into composable interaction primitives, and a hierarchical
policy is trained on top: a high level selects the type and order of
interactions, while a low level executes them. On simulated robotic and
embodied-AI benchmarks, FIOC-WM improves policy-learning sample efficiency and
generalization over world-model baselines, indicating that explicit, modular
interaction learning is crucial for robust control.

### [163] [Opportunistic Expert Activation: Batch-Aware Expert Routing for Faster Decode Without Retraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02237)
*Costin-Andrei Oncescu,Qingyang Wu,Wai Tong Chung,Robert Wu,Bryan Gopal,Junxiong Wang,Tri Dao,Ben Athiwaratkun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A batch-aware dynamic routing framework for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs reduces decode latency by re-routing token-to-expert mappings so that fewer experts are activated, using piggybacking of already-loaded experts within the batch; achieves 39% latency reductions on Qwen3-30B and 15% on Qwen3-235B at batch size 16, with comparable accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE architectures exhibit memory-bound decode latency because the average number of activated experts grows slowly; latency is dominated by the number of activated experts rather than the full dense layer.

Method: Introduce dynamic token-to-expert re-routing with batch-aware routing. Tokens piggyback experts already loaded for other tokens within the same batch, reducing the number of activated experts.

Result: Latency reductions of 39% (Qwen3-30B) and 15% (Qwen3-235B) in the MoE layer decode latency at batch size 16, with no statistically significant loss in accuracy.

Conclusion: Batch-aware dynamic routing effectively lowers MoE decode latency while preserving model quality, demonstrating practical gains for large MoE LLMs.

Abstract: An increasing number of LLMs employ Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures
where the feed-forward layer is replaced by a pool of experts and each token
only activates a small subset of them. During autoregressive generation, these
models often enter a memory-bound regime even for moderate batch sizes because
the average expert load grows more slowly than in an equivalent dense
feedforward layer. Consequently, MoE latency is governed by the number of
activated experts. We introduce a framework for dynamically re-routing
token-to-expert mapping to lower this number (and thus, the decode latency)
while preserving a comparable quality. Our best results use a batch-aware
routing that works by having tokens piggyback experts that have already been
loaded into memory due to being crucial to other tokens within the same batch.
Empirically, we evaluate our method on the Qwen3-30B and Qwen3-235B models with
a batch size of $16$. Without any statistically significant loss in accuracy,
our approach achieves latency reductions of $39\%$ and $15\%$ in the MoE layer
decode latency, respectively.

*Hikaru Homma,Jun Ohkubo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A spectral-bias-aware initialization framework for neural networks using SWIM-based scaling across layers to encode low frequencies early and high frequencies later, improving performance on 1D regression and MNIST.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Initialization choices strongly influence learning; spectral bias suggests networks learn coarse features first. The paper investigates leveraging this bias to improve initialization.

Method: Proposes adjusting scale factors in the SWIM initialization to allocate spectral components by layer: lower frequencies in early hidden layers, higher frequencies in later layers; evaluates on 1D regression and MNIST.

Result: The proposed method outperforms conventional initialization methods in the tested tasks, indicating benefits of incorporating spectral properties into initialization.

Conclusion: Intrinsic spectral properties should be considered in neural network initialization; the strategy provides an effective way to boost training performance by aligning initialization with the network's spectral learning tendencies.

Abstract: Initialization of neural network parameters, such as weights and biases, has
a crucial impact on learning performance; if chosen well, we can even avoid the
need for additional training with backpropagation. For example, algorithms
based on the ridgelet transform or the SWIM (sampling where it matters) concept
have been proposed for initialization. On the other hand, it is well-known that
neural networks tend to learn coarse information in the earlier layers. The
feature is called spectral bias. In this work, we investigate the effects of
utilizing information on the spectral bias in the initialization of neural
networks. Hence, we propose a framework that adjusts the scale factors in the
SWIM algorithm to capture low-frequency components in the early-stage hidden
layers and to represent high-frequency components in the late-stage hidden
layers. Numerical experiments on a one-dimensional regression task and the
MNIST classification task demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the
conventional initialization algorithms. This work clarifies the importance of
intrinsic spectral properties in learning neural networks, and the finding
yields an effective parameter initialization strategy that enhances their
training performance.

Conclusion: The framework unifies probabilistic relaxations of graph cuts, delivering theoretical guarantees and practical gradients for diverse cuts, thus facilitating scalable, differentiable graph partitioning in modern learning pipelines.

Abstract: Probabilistic relaxations of graph cuts offer a differentiable alternative to
spectral clustering, enabling end-to-end and online learning without
eigendecompositions, yet prior work centered on RatioCut and lacked general
guarantees and principled gradients. We present a unified probabilistic
framework that covers a wide class of cuts, including Normalized Cut. Our
framework provides tight analytic upper bounds on expected discrete cuts via
integral representations and Gauss hypergeometric functions with closed-form
forward and backward. Together, these results deliver a rigorous, numerically
stable foundation for scalable, differentiable graph partitioning covering a
wide range of clustering and contrastive learning objectives.

### [166] [Gradient-Variation Online Adaptivity for Accelerated Optimization with Hölder Smoothness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02276)
*Yuheng Zhao,Yu-Hu Yan,Kfir Yehuda Levy,Peng Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive online learning for Holder-smooth functions yields universal online and offline optimization methods that interpolate between smooth and non-smooth regimes and achieve acceleration when possible.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Smoothness drives acceleration; online gradient-variation connects to offline acceleration; extend to Holder-smoothness to unify smooth/non-smooth regimes; develop universal methods without prior smoothness knowledge.

Method: Design gradient-variation online learning algorithms for (strongly) convex losses with Holder-smoothness, with adaptivity and no prior Hölder parameter; use online-to-batch to obtain universal stochastic convex optimization; introduce a detection-based guess-and-check scheme to achieve universality in offline strongly convex optimization.

Result: Regret interpolates between optimal smooth and non-smooth guarantees; yields a universal method for stochastic convex optimization under Holder-smoothness; in offline strongly convex setting, introduces a detection-based approach achieving accelerated convergence in the smooth regime and near-optimal performance in the non-smooth regime.

Conclusion: Establishes a strong link between gradient-variation online learning and offline acceleration; provides practical universal algorithms for both online and offline convex optimization under Holder-smoothness.

Abstract: Smoothness is known to be crucial for acceleration in offline optimization,
and for gradient-variation regret minimization in online learning.
Interestingly, these two problems are actually closely connected -- accelerated
optimization can be understood through the lens of gradient-variation online
learning. In this paper, we investigate online learning with H\"older smooth
functions, a general class encompassing both smooth and non-smooth (Lipschitz)
functions, and explore its implications for offline optimization. For
(strongly) convex online functions, we design the corresponding
gradient-variation online learning algorithm whose regret smoothly interpolates
between the optimal guarantees in smooth and non-smooth regimes. Notably, our
algorithms do not require prior knowledge of the H\"older smoothness parameter,
exhibiting strong adaptivity over existing methods. Through online-to-batch
conversion, this gradient-variation online adaptivity yields an optimal
universal method for stochastic convex optimization under H\"older smoothness.
However, achieving universality in offline strongly convex optimization is more
challenging. We address this by integrating online adaptivity with a
detection-based guess-and-check procedure, which, for the first time, yields a
universal offline method that achieves accelerated convergence in the smooth
regime while maintaining near-optimal convergence in the non-smooth one.

### [167] [Reinforcement learning based data assimilation for unknown state model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02286)
*Ziyi Wang,Lijian Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an RL-based framework to learn surrogate dynamics for data assimilation from noisy data, formulating the parameter learning as an MDP and solving for an optimal policy, enabling online filtering with unknown dynamics in high-dimensional settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Governing equations of the underlying dynamics are often unknown and ground-truth state trajectories are rarely noise-free; existing supervised-learning approaches require clean data and fail in practice.

Method: Treat maximum likelihood estimation of surrogate model parameters as a sequential decision-making problem and formulate it as a discrete-time MDP. Use reinforcement learning to find the optimal policy to learn the surrogate transition dynamics. After training, apply online state estimation with ensemble-based Bayesian filtering using the learned dynamics; the framework accommodates nonlinear and partially observed measurement models.

Result: Numerical experiments show superior accuracy and robustness of the proposed method in high-dimensional settings, across nonlinear and partially observed observation models.

Conclusion: An RL-enabled data assimilation framework can learn surrogate dynamics directly from noisy observations, enabling accurate online state estimation when governing equations are unknown, with demonstrated robustness in high-dimensional scenarios.

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) has increasingly emerged as a critical tool for state
estimation
  across a wide range of applications. It is signiffcantly challenging when the
governing equations of the underlying dynamics are unknown. To this end,
various machine learning approaches have been employed to construct a surrogate
state transition
  model in a supervised learning framework, which relies on pre-computed
training
  datasets. However, it is often infeasible to obtain noise-free ground-truth
state sequences in practice. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
method that integrates reinforcement learning with ensemble-based Bayesian
ffltering methods, enabling
  the learning of surrogate state transition model for unknown dynamics
directly from noisy observations, without using true state trajectories.
Speciffcally, we treat the process for computing maximum likelihood estimation
of surrogate model parameters
  as a sequential decision-making problem, which can be formulated as a
discretetime
  Markov decision process (MDP). Under this formulation, learning the surrogate
transition model is equivalent to ffnding an optimal policy of the MDP, which
can be effectively addressed using reinforcement learning techniques. Once the
model is trained offfine, state estimation can be performed in the online stage
using ffltering methods based on the learned dynamics. The proposed framework
accommodates a wide range of observation scenarios, including nonlinear and
partially observed measurement
  models. A few numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior accuracy and robustness in high-dimensional settings.

*Kuan-Cheng Chen,Samuel Yen-Chi Chen,Chen-Yu Liu,Kin K. Leung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Federated Quantum Kernel Learning (FQKL) combines quantum feature maps with federated aggregation to enable privacy-preserving, scalable anomaly detection in high-dimensional IIoT time-series; it improves generalization and reduces communication compared to classical baselines on synthetic benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for privacy-preserving, scalable anomaly detection in high-dimensional, multivariate IIoT data. Classical federated learning struggles with non-linear decision boundaries and imbalanced anomalies, and communication overhead is a concern in distributed IoT settings.

Method: Edge nodes compute compressed kernel statistics via parameterized quantum circuits and share only these summaries with a central server. The server constructs a global Gram matrix and trains a decision function (e.g., Fed-QSVM) in a federated manner for anomaly detection.

Result: On synthetic IIoT benchmarks, FQKL achieves superior generalization in capturing complex temporal correlations compared to classical federated baselines, while significantly reducing communication overhead.

Conclusion: Quantum kernels in federated settings show promise for scalable, robust, and privacy-preserving anomaly detection in next-generation IoT infrastructures; this approach highlights the potential of quantum-enhanced kernel methods in distributed, privacy-sensitive environments.

Abstract: The rapid growth of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems has created
new challenges for anomaly detection in high-dimensional, multivariate
time-series, where privacy, scalability, and communication efficiency are
critical. Classical federated learning approaches mitigate privacy concerns by
enabling decentralized training, but they often struggle with highly non-linear
decision boundaries and imbalanced anomaly distributions. To address this gap,
we propose a Federated Quantum Kernel Learning (FQKL) framework that integrates
quantum feature maps with federated aggregation to enable distributed,
privacy-preserving anomaly detection across heterogeneous IoT networks. In our
design, quantum edge nodes locally compute compressed kernel statistics using
parameterized quantum circuits and share only these summaries with a central
server, which constructs a global Gram matrix and trains a decision function
(e.g., Fed-QSVM). Experimental results on synthetic IIoT benchmarks demonstrate
that FQKL achieves superior generalization in capturing complex temporal
correlations compared to classical federated baselines, while significantly
reducing communication overhead. This work highlights the promise of quantum
kernels in federated settings, advancing the path toward scalable, robust, and
quantum-enhanced intelligence for next-generation IoT infrastructures.

*Fengjuan Wang,Zhiyi Su,Xingzhu Hu,Cheng Wang,Mou Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FP8-Flow-MoE introduces a quantization-consistent FP8 training flow for large Mixture-of-Experts models, removing most datacast overhead and yielding higher throughput and lower memory usage while preserving stability, demonstrated on a 671B-parameter model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce compute and memory demands of training extremely large MoE models by eliminating costly quantize-dequantize casts and exploiting FP8 without sacrificing numerical stability.

Method: Develop an FP8-centric dataflow with scaling-aware transpose and fused FP8 operators, minimizing casts from 12 to 2, and providing a plug-and-play recipe compatible with TransformerEngine and Megatron-LM.

Result: Up to 21% higher throughput and 16.5 GB lower memory per GPU compared to BF16 and naive FP8 baselines, with stable convergence on a 671B-parameter MoE model.

Conclusion: Provides a practical FP8 training recipe for large MoE models, enabling more efficient FP8 training; to be open-sourced and integrated into major frameworks, accelerating FP8 adoption in large-scale training.

Abstract: Training large Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models remains computationally
prohibitive due to their extreme compute and memory demands. Although
low-precision training promises to accelerate computation and reduce memory
footprint, existing implementations still rely on BF16-dominated dataflows with
frequent quantize-dequantize (Q/DQ) conversions. These redundant casts erode
much of FP8's theoretical efficiency. However, naively removing these casts by
keeping dataflows entirely in FP8 introduces double quantization error: tensors
quantized along different dimensions accumulate inconsistent scaling factors,
degrading numerical stability.
  We propose FP8-Flow-MoE, an FP8 training recipe featuring a
quantization-consistent FP8-centric dataflow with a scaling-aware transpose and
fused FP8 operators that streamline computation and eliminate explicit cast
operations from 12 to 2. Evaluations on a 671B-parameter MoE model demonstrate
up to 21\% higher throughput and 16.5 GB lower memory usage per GPU compared to
BF16 and na\"ive FP8 baselines, while maintaining stable convergence. We
provide a plug-and-play FP8 recipe compatible with TransformerEngine and
Megatron-LM, which will be open-sourced soon.

### [170] [The Sequential Edge: Inverse-Entropy Voting Beats Parallel Self-Consistency at Matched Compute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02309)
*Aman Sharma,Paras Chopra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Sequential refinement at test time beats parallel self-consistency across 5 open-source models and 3 benchmarks, with up to 46.7% accuracy gains; inverse-entropy weighting further boosts results; advocates a paradigm shift in inference-time optimization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine the optimal test-time scaling strategy under fixed token budget and compute, comparing parallel independent chains to sequentially refining chains, challenging the dominance of self-consistent parallel reasoning.

Method: Empirical evaluation on 5 open-source LLMs across 3 challenging reasoning benchmarks; compare sequential scaling vs parallel self-consistency; introduce and test inverse-entropy weighted voting to combine chains.

Result: Sequential scaling outperforms parallel self-consistency in 95.6% of configurations with accuracy gains up to 46.7%; inverse-entropy weighting further improves accuracy and success rate over parallel majority.

Conclusion: Sequential refinement should be the default test-time strategy for modern LLM reasoning, prompting a paradigm shift away from parallel self-consistency in inference-time optimization.

Abstract: We revisit test-time scaling for language model reasoning and ask a
fundamental question: at equal token budget and compute, is it better to run
multiple independent chains in parallel, or to run fewer chains that
iteratively refine through sequential steps? Through comprehensive evaluation
across 5 state-of-the-art open source models and 3 challenging reasoning
benchmarks, we find that sequential scaling where chains explicitly build upon
previous attempts consistently outperforms the dominant parallel
self-consistency paradigm in 95.6% of configurations with gains in accuracy
upto 46.7%. Further, we introduce inverse-entropy weighted voting, a novel
training-free method to further boost the accuracy of sequential scaling. By
weighing answers in proportion to the inverse entropy of their reasoning
chains, we increase our success rate over parallel majority and establish it as
the optimal test-time scaling strategy. Our findings fundamentally challenge
the parallel reasoning orthodoxy that has dominated test-time scaling since
Wang et al.'s self-consistency decoding (Wang et al., 2022), positioning
sequential refinement as the robust default for modern LLM reasoning and
necessitating a paradigm shift in how we approach inference-time optimization.

### [171] [Large-scale automatic carbon ion treatment planning for head and neck cancers via parallel multi-agent reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02314)
*Jueye Zhang,Chao Yang,Youfang Lai,Kai-Wen Li,Wenting Yan,Yunzhou Xia,Haimei Zhang,Jingjing Zhou,Gen Yang,Chen Lin,Tian Li,Yibao Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework is proposed to tune 45 intensity-modulated carbon-ion therapy (IMCT) planning parameters for head-and-neck cancer. Using CTDE with QMIX, DRQN, compact DVH histories, linear action-to-value mapping, and absolute piecewise rewards, the method achieves plans comparable or superior to expert manual plans, with statistically significant improvements in several organs-at-risk (OARs) and accelerated data collection via parallel TPS interaction.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IMCT planning is slow due to complex RBE modeling and a large, high-dimensional parameter space. Deep learning alone risks data bias; reinforcement learning struggles with exploring a vast TPP space. A scalable, efficient, and clinically aligned optimization framework is needed to improve plan quality and reduce planning time.

Method: A centralized-training decentralized-execution MARL framework using a QMIX backbone with Double DQN, Dueling DQN, and DRQN for stability. States use compact historical DVH vectors; actions map linearly from small discrete adjustments to parameter changes; rewards are absolute, clinically informed, and piecewise to align with plan scores. A synchronous multi-process worker system interfaces with PHOENIX TPS to parallelize optimization. Evaluation on 10 training and 10 testing head-and-neck cases tuning 45 TPPs.

Result: The RL-tuned plans matched or surpassed expert manual plans, with relative plan score: RL 85.93% (±7.85) vs Manual 85.02% (±6.92). Significant improvements (p<0.05) were observed for five OARs. The approach efficiently explores high-dimensional TPP spaces and directly interacts with TPS to generate clinically competitive IMCT plans and improve OAR sparing.

Conclusion: The proposed MARL framework enables efficient, high-dimensional tuning of IMCT planning parameters and yields clinically competitive plans with improved OAR sparing, facilitated by parallel data collection and a stable, centralized training regime.

Abstract: Head-and-neck cancer (HNC) planning is difficult because multiple critical
organs-at-risk (OARs) are close to complex targets. Intensity-modulated
carbon-ion therapy (IMCT) offers superior dose conformity and OAR sparing but
remains slow due to relative biological effectiveness (RBE) modeling, leading
to laborious, experience-based, and often suboptimal tuning of many
treatment-planning parameters (TPPs). Recent deep learning (DL) methods are
limited by data bias and plan feasibility, while reinforcement learning (RL)
struggles to efficiently explore the exponentially large TPP search space. We
propose a scalable multi-agent RL (MARL) framework for parallel tuning of 45
TPPs in IMCT. It uses a centralized-training decentralized-execution (CTDE)
QMIX backbone with Double DQN, Dueling DQN, and recurrent encoding (DRQN) for
stable learning in a high-dimensional, non-stationary environment. To enhance
efficiency, we (1) use compact historical DVH vectors as state inputs, (2)
apply a linear action-to-value transform mapping small discrete actions to
uniform parameter adjustments, and (3) design an absolute, clinically informed
piecewise reward aligned with plan scores. A synchronous multi-process worker
system interfaces with the PHOENIX TPS for parallel optimization and
accelerated data collection. On a head-and-neck dataset (10 training, 10
testing), the method tuned 45 parameters simultaneously and produced plans
comparable to or better than expert manual ones (relative plan score: RL
$85.93\pm7.85%$ vs Manual $85.02\pm6.92%$), with significant (p-value $<$ 0.05)
improvements for five OARs. The framework efficiently explores high-dimensional
TPP spaces and generates clinically competitive IMCT plans through direct TPS
interaction, notably improving OAR sparing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RoME is a domain-robust Mixture-of-Experts framework for predicting MILP solutions across domains, using learned task embeddings and distributionally robust training to improve cross-domain generalization and show strong zero-shot gains on MIPLIB.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MILP solvers trained on single domains fail to generalize to unseen problem distributions; need scalable, general-purpose learning-based solvers.

Method: Two-level distributionally robust optimization: inter-domain to handle global shifts; intra-domain with perturbations on task embeddings; domain routing via experts; training across three domains, evaluation on five; zero-shot on MIPLIB.

Result: Single RoME model trained on three domains achieves an average improvement of 67.7% when evaluated on five diverse domains; demonstrates zero-shot gains on MIPLIB, outperforming existing learning-based approaches in generalization.

Conclusion: Cross-domain training enhances generalization and reveals more general combinatorial patterns; RoME offers scalable, domain-robust performance for MILP solvers across diverse distributions.

Abstract: Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is a fundamental and powerful
framework for modeling complex optimization problems across diverse domains.
Recently, learning-based methods have shown great promise in accelerating MILP
solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, most existing approaches
are developed and evaluated in single-domain settings, limiting their ability
to generalize to unseen problem distributions. This limitation poses a major
obstacle to building scalable and general-purpose learning-based solvers. To
address this challenge, we introduce RoME, a domain-Robust Mixture-of-Experts
framework for predicting MILP solutions across domains. RoME dynamically routes
problem instances to specialized experts based on learned task embeddings. The
model is trained using a two-level distributionally robust optimization
strategy: inter-domain to mitigate global shifts across domains, and
intra-domain to enhance local robustness by introducing perturbations on task
embeddings. We reveal that cross-domain training not only enhances the model's
generalization capability to unseen domains but also improves performance
within each individual domain by encouraging the model to capture more general
intrinsic combinatorial patterns. Specifically, a single RoME model trained on
three domains achieves an average improvement of 67.7% then evaluated on five
diverse domains. We further test the pretrained model on MIPLIB in a zero-shot
setting, demonstrating its ability to deliver measurable performance gains on
challenging real-world instances where existing learning-based approaches often
struggle to generalize.

*Fidan Karimova,Tong Chen,Yu Yang,Shazia Sadiq*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HYSTL uses a hypernetwork to generate crime-type-specific prediction parameters conditioned on a crime-type embedding learned from a crime knowledge graph, enabling a unified predictor across cities with non-overlapping crime types; it outperforms baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cross-city heterogeneity in crime-type availability and data richness; need to share knowledge across diverse cities without assuming identical crime taxonomies; bridging semantic gaps between crime types via knowledge graph.

Method: Hypernetwork-based dynamic parameter generation for a unified spatial-temporal predictor; inputs crime-type representations from a structured crime knowledge graph; treats crime types as conditioning signals; training on multi-city data with non-overlapping crime types; uses hypernetwork to tailor predictor per crime type; may include graph-derived embeddings and spatial-temporal learning.

Result: Empirical evaluation on two cities shows improved performance against state-of-the-art baselines; demonstrates effectiveness of knowledge-graph-guided hypernetwork in cross-city crime prediction.

Conclusion: Proposes a scalable framework for cross-city crime prediction; dynamic, conditioned parameters enable leveraging related crime-type information; potential for better public safety planning, with adaptable performance as crime taxonomies differ across cities.

Abstract: Predicting crimes in urban environments is crucial for public safety, yet
existing prediction methods often struggle to align the knowledge across
diverse cities that vary dramatically in data availability of specific crime
types. We propose HYpernetwork-enhanced Spatial Temporal Learning (HYSTL), a
framework that can effectively train a unified, stronger crime predictor
without assuming identical crime types in different cities' records. In HYSTL,
instead of parameterising a dedicated predictor per crime type, a hypernetwork
is designed to dynamically generate parameters for the prediction function
conditioned on the crime type of interest. To bridge the semantic gap between
different crime types, a structured crime knowledge graph is built, where the
learned representations of crimes are used as the input to the hypernetwork to
facilitate parameter generation. As such, when making predictions for each
crime type, the predictor is additionally guided by its intricate association
with other relevant crime types. Extensive experiments are performed on two
cities with non-overlapping crime types, and the results demonstrate HYSTL
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

### [174] [Reducing normalizing flow complexity for MCMC preconditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02345)
*David Nabergoj,Erik Štrumbelj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A factorized preconditioning approach combining a linear transform with a conditional normalizing-flow preconditioner improves MCMC efficiency by aligning model complexity with target geometry while keeping NF complexity manageable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overparameterized invertible neural network (INN) preconditioners in MCMC can hurt sampling efficiency and fit quality; there is a need for adaptive architectures that match target geometry, especially in hierarchical Bayesian models with limited data.

Method: Introduce a factorized preconditioning architecture: apply a linear preconditioner to roughly Gaussian dimensions (identified from warmup samples) and use a conditional NF for more complex dimensions, reducing overall NF complexity while improving adaptability to target geometry.

Result: Demonstrates better tail sampling on two complex synthetic distributions; consistently better performance on sparse logistic regression posteriors across varying likelihood and prior strengths; higher effective sample sizes for hierarchical Bayesian posteriors with weak likelihoods and funnel geometries.

Conclusion: The factorized approach is particularly suitable for hierarchical Bayesian analyses with limited data and can inform theoretical and software developments in neural MCMC, balancing simplicity and adaptability.

Abstract: Preconditioning is a key component of MCMC algorithms that improves sampling
efficiency by facilitating exploration of geometrically complex target
distributions through an invertible map. While linear preconditioners are often
sufficient for moderately complex target distributions, recent work has
explored nonlinear preconditioning with invertible neural networks as
components of normalizing flows (NFs). However, empirical and theoretical
studies show that overparameterized NF preconditioners can degrade sampling
efficiency and fit quality. Moreover, existing NF-based approaches do not adapt
their architectures to the target distribution. Related work outside of MCMC
similarly finds that suitably parameterized NFs can achieve comparable or
superior performance with substantially less training time or data. We propose
a factorized preconditioning architecture that reduces NF complexity by
combining a linear component with a conditional NF, improving adaptability to
target geometry. The linear preconditioner is applied to dimensions that are
approximately Gaussian, as estimated from warmup samples, while the conditional
NF models more complex dimensions. Our method yields significantly better tail
samples on two complex synthetic distributions and consistently better
performance on a sparse logistic regression posterior across varying likelihood
and prior strengths. It also achieves higher effective sample sizes on
hierarchical Bayesian model posteriors with weak likelihoods and strong funnel
geometries. This approach is particularly relevant for hierarchical Bayesian
model analyses with limited data and could inform current theoretical and
software strides in neural MCMC design.

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight, real-time motion recognition system that enables
synergic human-machine performance through wearable IMU sensor data, MiniRocket
time-series classification, and responsive multimedia control. By mapping
dancer-specific movement to sound through somatic memory and association, we
propose an alternative approach to human-machine collaboration, one that
preserves the expressive depth of the performing body while leveraging machine
learning for attentive observation and responsiveness. We demonstrate that this
human-centered design reliably supports high accuracy classification (<50 ms
latency), offering a replicable framework to integrate dance-literate machines
into creative, educational, and live performance contexts.

### [176] [Evolving Graph Learning for Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Non-stationary Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02354)
*Qingyun Sun,Jiayi Luo,Haonan Yuan,Xingcheng Fu,Hao Peng,Jianxin Li,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces EvoOOD, an environment-evolving framework for out-of-distribution generalization on dynamic graphs, combining environment evolution modeling, environment-aware invariant pattern recognition, and node-level causal interventions to identify spatio-temporal invariants and improve OOD performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph neural networks struggle to generalize under distribution shifts in dynamic, non-stationary environments. There is a need to study OOD generalization through modeling how environments evolve over time.

Method: 1) An environment sequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and infer the underlying environment distribution. 2) An environment-aware invariant pattern recognition mechanism to handle environmental diversification via inferred distributions. 3) Fine-grained causal interventions on individual nodes using a mixture of instantiated environment samples to isolate spatio-temporal invariant patterns for OOD prediction.

Result: Experiments show EvoOOD/EvoGOOD outperforms baselines on real-world and synthetic dynamic datasets under distribution shifts. It is claimed to be the first work to study dynamic graph OOD generalization from the environment evolution perspective (note: potential naming inconsistency in the abstract).

Conclusion: EvoOOD offers a novel direction for dynamic graph OOD generalization by explicitly modeling environment evolution and aligning invariant spatio-temporal patterns, with strong empirical results and avenues for future work.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have shown remarkable success in exploiting the spatial
and temporal patterns on dynamic graphs. However, existing GNNs exhibit poor
generalization ability under distribution shifts, which is inevitable in
dynamic scenarios. As dynamic graph generation progresses amid evolving latent
non-stationary environments, it is imperative to explore their effects on
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. This paper proposes a novel Evolving
Graph Learning framework for OOD generalization (EvoOOD) by environment-aware
invariant pattern recognition. Specifically, we first design an environment
sequential variational auto-encoder to model environment evolution and infer
the underlying environment distribution. Then, we introduce a mechanism for
environment-aware invariant pattern recognition, tailored to address
environmental diversification through inferred distributions. Finally, we
conduct fine-grained causal interventions on individual nodes using a mixture
of instantiated environment samples. This approach helps to distinguish
spatio-temporal invariant patterns for OOD prediction, especially in
non-stationary environments. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority
of EvoGOOD on both real-world and synthetic dynamic datasets under distribution
shifts. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first attempt to study the
dynamic graph OOD generalization problem from the environment evolution
perspective.

*Rohan Wandre,Yash Gajewar,Namrata Patel,Vivek Dhalkari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LUMA-RAG provides a lifelong, multimodal RAG architecture with streaming memory, cross-modal alignment, and safety guarantees, achieving strong retrieval performance under memory constraints and stable cross-modal rankings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As data streams become multimodal and continuous, maintaining fresh indices and cross-modal embedding alignment is challenging; conventional static indices and single-modal embeddings struggle with scalability, drift, and cost.

Method: Three innovations: (i) multi-tier streaming memory that spills embeddings from hot HNSW to compressed IVFPQ within memory budgets; (ii) a streaming CLAP->CLIP alignment bridge updated with incremental orthogonal Procrustes to preserve cross-modal consistency; (iii) stability-aware retrieval telemetry with Safe@k bounds on alignment drift and quantization error; experiments show high recall and stable audio-to-image rankings.

Result: Text-to-image retrieval Recall@10 = 0.94; graceful degradation when offloading quantization; Safe@1 = 1.0 for audio-to-image rankings, demonstrating robustness and safety guarantees.

Conclusion: LUMA-RAG is a practical, production-ready framework for lifelong multimodal RAG, combining memory efficiency, cross-modal alignment, and reliability guarantees; future work could explore broader modalities, dynamic drift adaptation, and real-world deployment considerations.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the dominant paradigm for
grounding large language model outputs in verifiable evidence. However, as
modern AI agents transition from static knowledge bases to continuous
multimodal streams encompassing text, images, video, and audio, two critical
challenges arise: maintaining index freshness without prohibitive re-indexing
costs, and preserving cross-modal semantic consistency across heterogeneous
embedding spaces. We present LUMA-RAG, a lifelong multimodal agent architecture
featuring three key innovations: (i) a streaming, multi-tier memory system that
dynamically spills embeddings from a hot HNSW tier to a compressed IVFPQ tier
under strict memory budgets; (ii) a streaming CLAP->CLIP alignment bridge that
maintains cross-modal consistency through incremental orthogonal Procrustes
updates; and (iii) stability-aware retrieval telemetry providing Safe@k
guarantees by jointly bounding alignment drift and quantization error.
Experiments demonstrate robust text-to-image retrieval (Recall@10 = 0.94),
graceful performance degradation under product quantization offloading, and
provably stable audio-to-image rankings (Safe@1 = 1.0), establishing LUMA-RAG
as a practical framework for production multimodal RAG systems.

*Rohith Shinoj Kumar,Rushdeep Dinda,Aditya Tyagi,Annappa B.,Naveen Kumar M. R*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM model for arrhythmia detection from heart sounds, introducing trainable H-Infinity-inspired parameters to boost robustness and generalization; achieves near-perfect performance on PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual ECG/heart sound diagnosis is subjective and variable; robust, automated detection is needed, especially with small or noisy biomedical datasets where generalization is challenging.

Method: A CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM architecture that integrates trainable parameters inspired by the H-Infinity filter into an LSTM component for improved robustness; end-to-end training on heart sound data; evaluated on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset.

Result: The model reports a test accuracy of 99.42% and an F1 score of 98.85%, with stable convergence and outperformance of existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: The approach enhances robustness and generalization in arrhythmia detection from heart sounds and shows promise for real-world deployment, though further validation across diverse datasets and analyses of potential limitations are advised.

Abstract: Early detection of heart arrhythmia can prevent severe future complications
in cardiac patients. While manual diagnosis still remains the clinical
standard, it relies heavily on visual interpretation and is inherently
subjective. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool to
automate arrhythmia detection, offering improved accuracy, consistency, and
efficiency. Several variants of convolutional and recurrent neural network
architectures have been widely explored to capture spatial and temporal
patterns in physiological signals. However, despite these advancements, current
models often struggle to generalize well in real-world scenarios, especially
when dealing with small or noisy datasets, which are common challenges in
biomedical applications. In this paper, a novel CNN-H-Infinity-LSTM
architecture is proposed to identify arrhythmic heart signals from heart sound
recordings. This architecture introduces trainable parameters inspired by the
H-Infinity filter from control theory, enhancing robustness and generalization.
Extensive experimentation on the PhysioNet CinC Challenge 2016 dataset, a
public benchmark of heart audio recordings, demonstrates that the proposed
model achieves stable convergence and outperforms existing benchmarks, with a
test accuracy of 99.42% and an F1 score of 98.85%.

*Gennaro Guidone,Luca Monegaglia,Elia Raimondi,Han Wang,Mattia Bianchi,Florian Dörfler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Decentralized GP-UCB-inspired coverage control enabling scalable online updates with greedy inducing-point selection in unknown environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for efficient coverage in unknown spatial environments while balancing exploration and exploitation without centralized coordination, and to enable scalable online GP updates via local communication.

Method: Agents minimize a local cost combining predicted locational cost and a variance-based exploration term (inspired by GP-UCB). Each agent updates inducing points greedily for scalable online GP updates, relying on local observations and neighbor communications.

Result: Simulation-based demonstration showing effective exploration-exploitation trade-off, decentralized operation, and scalability with multiple agents.

Conclusion: The framework enables fully decentralized coverage control in unknown environments with online GP updates and scalable inducing-point management, achieving effective coverage through local decision making.

Abstract: We present a novel decentralized algorithm for coverage control in unknown
spatial environments modeled by Gaussian Processes (GPs). To trade-off between
exploration and exploitation, each agent autonomously determines its trajectory
by minimizing a local cost function. Inspired by the GP-UCB (Upper Confidence
Bound for GPs) acquisition function, the proposed cost combines the expected
locational cost with a variance-based exploration term, guiding agents toward
regions that are both high in predicted density and model uncertainty. Compared
to previous work, our algorithm operates in a fully decentralized fashion,
relying only on local observations and communication with neighboring agents.
In particular, agents periodically update their inducing points using a greedy
selection strategy, enabling scalable online GP updates. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm in simulation.

### [180] [Improving Unlearning with Model Updates Probably Aligned with Gradients](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02435)
*Virgile Dine,Teddy Furon,Charly Faure*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A constrained optimization framework for machine unlearning using feasible updates (via masking) that unlearns while preserving initial utility, accounting for gradient-noise to provide local statistical guarantees; acts as a pluggable add-on to first-order unlearning methods, with CV-classifier experiments validating the approach.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To build unlearning methods that reliably remove information about updated data without harming the utility of the original model, and to unify first-order unlearning approaches while addressing gradient estimation noise.

Method: Formulates unlearning as a constrained optimization problem and defines 'feasible updates' as parameter updates that contribute to unlearning while preserving utility. Feasible updates are realized via masking (selective parameter updates) and incorporate gradient-noise estimation to derive locally feasible updates with statistical guarantees. The technique is designed as a plug-in add-on to existing first-order approximate unlearning methods.

Result: Experiments on computer vision classifiers validate the approach, demonstrating the practicality of feasible updates and the potential preservation of model utility during unlearning.

Conclusion: Feasible updates via masking offer a practical, statistically grounded plug-in to improve first-order unlearning methods, enabling better unlearning with bounded utility degradation across CV tasks and potentially other domains.

Abstract: We formulate the machine unlearning problem as a general constrained
optimization problem. It unifies the first-order methods from the approximate
machine unlearning literature. This paper then introduces the concept of
feasible updates as the model's parameter update directions that help with
unlearning while not degrading the utility of the initial model. Our design of
feasible updates is based on masking, \ie\ a careful selection of the model's
parameters worth updating. It also takes into account the estimation noise of
the gradients when processing each batch of data to offer a statistical
guarantee to derive locally feasible updates. The technique can be plugged in,
as an add-on, to any first-order approximate unlearning methods. Experiments
with computer vision classifiers validate this approach.

### [181] [Accounting for Underspecification in Statistical Claims of Model Superiority](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02453)
*Thomas Sanchez,Pedro M. Gordaliza,Meritxell Bach Cuadra*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Training variance and underspecification undermine robustness claims in medical imaging ML; accounting for seeds increases required evidence to claim superiority.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Statistical robustness analyses ignore that models with similar validation scores can differ on unseen data due to initialization/training dynamics; underspecification adds variance to performance, risking false positives.

Method: Extend a framework for false outperformance by modeling underspecification as an extra variance component; run simulations varying random seeds to assess impact on claims of superiority.

Result: Seed variability around 1% substantially increases the evidence needed to support superiority; training variance must be explicitly modeled to avoid false positives in medical imaging validation.

Conclusion: Explicitly model training variance/underspecification when validating medical imaging systems to ensure robust, reproducible claims; call for revised evaluation protocols that incorporate seed/training variance.

Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied in medical imaging, yet
many reported improvements lack statistical robustness: recent works have
highlighted that small but significant performance gains are highly likely to
be false positives. However, these analyses do not take
\emph{underspecification} into account -- the fact that models achieving
similar validation scores may behave differently on unseen data due to random
initialization or training dynamics. Here, we extend a recent statistical
framework modeling false outperformance claims to include underspecification as
an additional variance component. Our simulations demonstrate that even modest
seed variability ($\sim1\%$) substantially increases the evidence required to
support superiority claims. Our findings underscore the need for explicit
modeling of training variance when validating medical imaging systems.

### [182] [SKGE: Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding with Geometric Regularization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02460)
*Xuan-Truong Quan,Xuan-Son Quan,Duc Do Minh,Vinh Nguyen Van*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SKGE constrains entity embeddings to a hypersphere using a learnable Spherization Layer and uses a translate-then-project relation, yielding consistent, significant gains over TransE on FB15k-237, CoDEx-S, and CoDEx-M. The spherical prior acts as a strong regularizer and induces an inherently hard negative sampling environment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Euclidean KGEs (e.g., TransE) operate in an unbounded space, which limits modeling complex relations and can hinder training efficiency. A compact, curved manifold like a sphere can provide a more natural inductive bias, potentially improving generalization and stability.

Method: Map entities to the sphere via a learnable Spherization Layer. Model relations as a hybrid translate-then-project transformation. Train and evaluate on three benchmarks (FB15k-237, CoDEx-S, CoDEx-M). Include analysis of regularization effects and the impact of spherical geometry on negative sampling.

Result: SKGE consistently outperforms the Euclidean baseline TransE, with particularly strong gains on large-scale datasets (FB15k-237 and CoDEx-M). The abstract attributes these gains to the spherical prior acting as a powerful regularizer and to the creation of an inherently hard negative sampling environment, which leads to more robust and semantically coherent representations across relation types.

Conclusion: The choice of manifold is a fundamental design principle for KGE; spherical geometry can improve stability and performance, suggesting geometric priors should be central in designing next-generation KGE models.

Abstract: Knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has become a fundamental technique for
representation learning on multi-relational data. Many seminal models, such as
TransE, operate in an unbounded Euclidean space, which presents inherent
limitations in modeling complex relations and can lead to inefficient training.
In this paper, we propose Spherical Knowledge Graph Embedding (SKGE), a model
that challenges this paradigm by constraining entity representations to a
compact manifold: a hypersphere. SKGE employs a learnable, non-linear
Spherization Layer to map entities onto the sphere and interprets relations as
a hybrid translate-then-project transformation. Through extensive experiments
on three benchmark datasets, FB15k-237, CoDEx-S, and CoDEx-M, we demonstrate
that SKGE consistently and significantly outperforms its strong Euclidean
counterpart, TransE, particularly on large-scale benchmarks such as FB15k-237
and CoDEx-M, demonstrating the efficacy of the spherical geometric prior. We
provide an in-depth analysis to reveal the sources of this advantage, showing
that this geometric constraint acts as a powerful regularizer, leading to
comprehensive performance gains across all relation types. More fundamentally,
we prove that the spherical geometry creates an "inherently hard negative
sampling" environment, naturally eliminating trivial negatives and forcing the
model to learn more robust and semantically coherent representations. Our
findings compellingly demonstrate that the choice of manifold is not merely an
implementation detail but a fundamental design principle, advocating for
geometric priors as a cornerstone for designing the next generation of powerful
and stable KGE models.

*Mohammad Sadegh Eshaghi,Cosmin Anitescu,Navid Valizadeh,Yizheng Wang,Xiaoying Zhuang,Timon Rabczuk*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NOWS uses neural operators to produce high-quality initial guesses for Krylov solvers, speeding up PDE simulations while keeping numerical guarantees.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-fidelity PDE simulations are computationally heavy, and data-driven surrogates may fail outside training; hybrids aim to accelerate solvers without sacrificing robustness.

Method: Train a neural operator to map problem instances (or operator data) to initial guesses for linear systems solved by CG/GMRES; integrate with existing discretization schemes (FDM, FEM, IGA, FVM); end-to-end pipeline reduces iterations.

Result: Across benchmarks, initializations reduce iteration count and overall runtime; up to 90% time savings; stability/convergence preserved.

Conclusion: Combines fast neural inference with traditional solver guarantees, offering practical, trustworthy acceleration for high-fidelity PDE simulations.

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin quantitative descriptions
across the physical sciences and engineering, yet high-fidelity simulation
remains a major computational bottleneck for many-query, real-time, and design
tasks. Data-driven surrogates can be strikingly fast but are often unreliable
when applied outside their training distribution. Here we introduce Neural
Operator Warm Starts (NOWS), a hybrid strategy that harnesses learned solution
operators to accelerate classical iterative solvers by producing high-quality
initial guesses for Krylov methods such as conjugate gradient and GMRES. NOWS
leaves existing discretizations and solver infrastructures intact, integrating
seamlessly with finite-difference, finite-element, isogeometric analysis,
finite volume method, etc. Across our benchmarks, the learned initialization
consistently reduces iteration counts and end-to-end runtime, resulting in a
reduction of the computational time of up to 90 %, while preserving the
stability and convergence guarantees of the underlying numerical algorithms. By
combining the rapid inference of neural operators with the rigor of traditional
solvers, NOWS provides a practical and trustworthy approach to accelerate
high-fidelity PDE simulations.

*Rajan Das Gupta,Md Kishor Morol,Nafiz Fahad,Md Tanzib Hosain,Sumaya Binte Zilani Choya,Md Jakir Hossen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BRAINS is a dual-module LLM-based system for Alzheimer's detection that combines a fine-tuned diagnostic module with a case-retrieval module to improve accuracy, explainability, and early detection, demonstrating promise on real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early, accurate detection of Alzheimer's disease is critical, especially where diagnostic resources are scarce; existing tools lack scalability and explainability; retrieval-augmented reasoning can leverage prior cases to support decision-making.

Method: Diagnostic Module: LLMs fine-tuned on cognitive/neuroimaging data (MMSE, CDR, brain volume) for structured Alzheimer's risk assessments. Case Retrieval Module: encodes patient profiles into latent representations and retrieves similar cases from a curated knowledge base; Case Fusion Layer combines retrieved cases with input; clinical prompts guide inference.

Result: Evaluations on real-world datasets show BRAINS effectively classifying disease severity and identifying early cognitive decline signs, indicating potential as an assistive, scalable, and explainable tool.

Conclusion: BRAINS offers a promising framework for scalable, explainable early-stage Alzheimer's detection, with potential for broader neurodegeneration monitoring and future enhancements.

Abstract: As the global burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to grow, early and
accurate detection has become increasingly critical, especially in regions with
limited access to advanced diagnostic tools. We propose BRAINS (Biomedical
Retrieval-Augmented Intelligence for Neurodegeneration Screening) to address
this challenge. This novel system harnesses the powerful reasoning capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Alzheimer's detection and monitoring.
BRAINS features a dual-module architecture: a cognitive diagnostic module and a
case-retrieval module. The Diagnostic Module utilizes LLMs fine-tuned on
cognitive and neuroimaging datasets -- including MMSE, CDR scores, and brain
volume metrics -- to perform structured assessments of Alzheimer's risk.
Meanwhile, the Case Retrieval Module encodes patient profiles into latent
representations and retrieves similar cases from a curated knowledge base.
These auxiliary cases are fused with the input profile via a Case Fusion Layer
to enhance contextual understanding. The combined representation is then
processed with clinical prompts for inference. Evaluations on real-world
datasets demonstrate BRAINS effectiveness in classifying disease severity and
identifying early signs of cognitive decline. This system not only shows strong
potential as an assistive tool for scalable, explainable, and early-stage
Alzheimer's disease detection, but also offers hope for future applications in
the field.

### [185] [Variational Geometric Information Bottleneck: Learning the Shape of Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02496)
*Ronald Katende*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A unified information-geometric framework for learning that trades off information about Y with geometric simplicity of representations; introduces V-GIB to jointly optimize mutual information and curvature-based complexity; provides non-asymptotic generalization bounds linking intrinsic dimension and curvature to sample efficiency; validated on synthetic manifolds, few-shot and real datasets showing robust estimators and improved data efficiency under scarcity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To formalize learning as a balance between informative representations and geometrically simple, low-complexity manifolds, grounding generalization in geometric properties (dimension and curvature) to explain and improve data efficiency and interpretability.

Method: Define objective U(phi)=I(phi(X);Y) - beta * C(phi) where C(phi) penalizes curvature and intrinsic dimensionality. Derive non-asymptotic generalization bounds under mild manifold/regularity assumptions, showing intrinsic-dimension-driven generalization and curvature-driven stability. Propose Variational Geometric Information Bottleneck (V-GIB) using tractable proxies (Hutchinson trace, Jacobian norms, local PCA) to jointly optimize information compression and curvature regularization.

Result: Theoretical results link generalization error to intrinsic dimension and approximation stability to curvature; V-GIB yields a Pareto frontier between information and geometry; experiments on synthetic manifolds, few-shot settings, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 show stable estimators and notable gains in interpretive efficiency; fractional-data CIFAR-10 experiments support the curvature-efficiency law, i.e., good predictive power under data scarcity.

Conclusion: V-GIB offers a principled, measurable route to representations that are geometrically coherent and data-efficient, bridging information-theoretic compression with geometric regularization to align with human-understandable structure.

Abstract: We propose a unified information-geometric framework that formalizes
understanding in learning as a trade-off between informativeness and geometric
simplicity. An encoder phi is evaluated by U(phi) = I(phi(X); Y) - beta *
C(phi), where C(phi) penalizes curvature and intrinsic dimensionality,
enforcing smooth, low-complexity manifolds. Under mild manifold and regularity
assumptions, we derive non-asymptotic bounds showing that generalization error
scales with intrinsic dimension while curvature controls approximation
stability, directly linking geometry to sample efficiency. To operationalize
this theory, we introduce the Variational Geometric Information Bottleneck
(V-GIB), a variational estimator that unifies mutual-information compression
and curvature regularization through tractable geometric proxies such as the
Hutchinson trace, Jacobian norms, and local PCA. Experiments across synthetic
manifolds, few-shot settings, and real-world datasets (Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10)
reveal a robust information-geometry Pareto frontier, stable estimators, and
substantial gains in interpretive efficiency. Fractional-data experiments on
CIFAR-10 confirm that curvature-aware encoders maintain predictive power under
data scarcity, validating the predicted efficiency-curvature law. Overall,
V-GIB provides a principled and measurable route to representations that are
geometrically coherent, data-efficient, and aligned with human-understandable
structure.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes DRLHQ, an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning framework with a heterogeneous querying attention for capacitated location–routing problems (CLRPs) and open CLRPs (OCLRP), reformulating CLRPs as a tailored MDP; demonstrates superior solution quality and generalization over traditional and DRL baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLRPs require simultaneous location and routing decisions, with strong interdependencies. While DRL has advanced VRP research, CLRPs remain under-explored. This work introduces an end-to-end DRL approach to jointly learn location and routing policies and to improve generalization across instances.

Method: An encoder–decoder DRL architecture that reformulates CLRPs as a Markov decision process focused on diverse decisions, and introduces a heterogeneous querying attention mechanism to adapt to different decision stages. Presents a general modeling framework compatible with other DRL methods, and evaluates on CLRP and OCLRP using synthetic and benchmark datasets.

Result: The proposed DRLHQ method achieves superior solution quality and better generalization compared with representative traditional and DRL-based baselines on solving both CLRP and OCLRP.

Conclusion: This work is the first end-to-end learning approach for CLRPs, featuring a heterogeneous querying attention that handles interdependencies across location and routing decisions, and a generalizable DRL framework that can be extended to other DRL methods.

Abstract: The capacitated location-routing problems (CLRPs) are classical problems in
combinatorial optimization, which require simultaneously making location and
routing decisions. In CLRPs, the complex constraints and the intricate
relationships between various decisions make the problem challenging to solve.
With the emergence of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), it has been
extensively applied to address the vehicle routing problem and its variants,
while the research related to CLRPs still needs to be explored. In this paper,
we propose the DRL with heterogeneous query (DRLHQ) to solve CLRP and open CLRP
(OCLRP), respectively. We are the first to propose an end-to-end learning
approach for CLRPs, following the encoder-decoder structure. In particular, we
reformulate the CLRPs as a markov decision process tailored to various
decisions, a general modeling framework that can be adapted to other DRL-based
methods. To better handle the interdependency across location and routing
decisions, we also introduce a novel heterogeneous querying attention mechanism
designed to adapt dynamically to various decision-making stages. Experimental
results on both synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate superior solution
quality and better generalization performance of our proposed approach over
representative traditional and DRL-based baselines in solving both CLRP and
OCLRP.

### [187] [Causal Graph Neural Networks for Healthcare](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02531)
*Munib Mesinovic,Max Buhlan,Tingting Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Causal Graph Neural Networks offer robust, interpretable healthcare AI by focusing on causal mechanisms on graphs; demonstrated applications across brain networks, multi-omics, monitoring, and drug recommendation; poised to enable patient-specific causal digital twins, but hindered by computation, validation needs, and risks of causal-washing; a tiered framework to distinguish causal-inspired vs causally-validated claims is proposed along with a research agenda.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare AI often degrades across institutions due to distribution shifts and embedded historical biases. Moving from purely statistical associations to causal mechanisms—operating on graph-structured biomedical data—can yield invariant, fair, and interpretable predictions and enable in silico experimentation through digital twins.

Method: A broad review of methodological foundations including structural causal models, disentangled causal representation learning, and interventional/counterfactual reasoning on graphs. Analyzes clinical applications (brain network analysis for psychiatric diagnosis, multi-omics cancer subtyping, continuous physiological monitoring, and drug prescription bias correction). Proposes integration with large language models and patient-specific causal digital twins, and outlines a tiered framework to separate causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated discoveries, plus a research agenda.

Result: Synthesizes theoretical and applied advances in causal graph learning for healthcare, highlights successful domain demonstrations, and articulates barriers (computational demands, validation challenges, and risk of causal-washing). Provides a pragmatic roadmap including tiered evaluation frameworks and prioritization of causal validation.

Conclusion: Foundations for patient-specific causal digital twins and mechanistic interpretation are advancing, but real-time deployment and rigorous multi-modal validation remain challenging. The authors advocate distinguishing causal-inspired from causally-validated claims and pursuing targeted research priorities to advance truly causal, rather than purely associative, healthcare AI.

Abstract: Healthcare artificial intelligence systems routinely fail when deployed
across institutions, with documented performance drops and perpetuation of
discriminatory patterns embedded in historical data. This brittleness stems, in
part, from learning statistical associations rather than causal mechanisms.
Causal graph neural networks address this triple crisis of distribution shift,
discrimination, and inscrutability by combining graph-based representations of
biomedical data with causal inference principles to learn invariant mechanisms
rather than spurious correlations. This Review examines methodological
foundations spanning structural causal models, disentangled causal
representation learning, and techniques for interventional prediction and
counterfactual reasoning on graphs. We analyse applications demonstrating
clinical value across psychiatric diagnosis through brain network analysis,
cancer subtyping via multi-omics causal integration, continuous physiological
monitoring with mechanistic interpretation, and drug recommendation correcting
prescription bias. These advances establish foundations for patient-specific
Causal Digital Twins, enabling in silico clinical experimentation, with
integration of large language models for hypothesis generation and causal graph
neural networks for mechanistic validation. Substantial barriers remain,
including computational requirements precluding real-time deployment,
validation challenges demanding multi-modal evidence triangulation beyond
cross-validation, and risks of causal-washing where methods employ causal
terminology without rigorous evidentiary support. We propose tiered frameworks
distinguishing causally-inspired architectures from causally-validated
discoveries and identify critical research priorities making causal rather than
purely associational claims.

TL;DR: Non-linear, diversity-aware many-to-one matching can lack stable outcomes; a Rawlsian fairness approach with iterative deterministic/stochastic algorithms can improve the worst-off college's utility when stability fails.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address fairness in college admissions with non-linear, diversity-driven utilities where classical stability may not exist, motivating a fairness-centric framework.

Method: Introduce Rawlsian fairness as an alternative solution concept and design both deterministic and stochastic iterative algorithms that progressively improve the minimum utility across colleges.

Result: Shows non-existence of guaranteed stability in the presence of non-linear college utilities and proposes algorithmic frameworks that monotonically enhance the worst-off college’s utility, offering a practical fair allocation mechanism.

Conclusion: When stability cannot be guaranteed, Rawlsian-fair, iterative allocation procedures provide a viable and principled approach to fair division in many-to-one matching with diversity considerations.

Abstract: We study a many-to-one matching problem, such as the college admission
problem, where each college can admit multiple students. Unlike classical
models, colleges evaluate sets of students through non-linear utility functions
that capture diversity between them. In this setting, we show that classical
stable matchings may fail to exist. To address this, we propose alternative
solution concepts based on Rawlsian fairness, aiming to maximize the minimum
utility across colleges. We design both deterministic and stochastic algorithms
that iteratively improve the outcome of the worst-off college, offering a
practical approach to fair allocation when stability cannot be guaranteed.

### [189] [Theoretical Guarantees for Causal Discovery on Large Random Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02536)
*Mathieu Chevalley,Arash Mehrjou,Patrick Schwab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FNR concentrates in high dimensions under single-variable interventions for sparse ER and scale-free graphs, yielding dimension-adaptive, faithfulness-robust guarantees for causal discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide finite-dimension, high-probability guarantees for causal structure recovery under latent confounding and interventions; understand how topology affects variability of orientation errors.

Method: Theoretical analysis of false-negative rate concentration under two graph models (sparse ER with p_e = Theta(1/d) and generalized BA graphs with gamma>3), with epsilon-interventional faithfulness; derive concentration bounds and rates; validate via simulations.

Result: FNR concentrates around its mean with rate O(log d / sqrt d) for ER; for BA with gamma>3, deviation width scales as O(d^{beta-1/2}) with beta=1/(gamma-1) < 1/2, vanishing as d grows; high-probability bounds and finite-dimension guarantees.

Conclusion: Presents first dimension-adaptive, faithfulness-robust guarantees for causal structure recovery; shows that network heterogeneity can regularize causal discovery; simulations confirm theory.

Abstract: We investigate theoretical guarantees for the false-negative rate (FNR) --
the fraction of true causal edges whose orientation is not recovered, under
single-variable random interventions and an $\epsilon$-interventional
faithfulness assumption that accommodates latent confounding. For sparse
Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi directed acyclic graphs, where the edge probability scales
as $p_e = \Theta(1/d)$, we show that the FNR concentrates around its mean at
rate $O(\frac{\log d}{\sqrt d})$, implying that large deviations above the
expected error become exponentially unlikely as dimensionality increases. This
concentration ensures that derived upper bounds hold with high probability in
large-scale settings. Extending the analysis to generalized Barab\'asi--Albert
graphs reveals an even stronger phenomenon: when the degree exponent satisfies
$\gamma > 3$, the deviation width scales as $O(d^{\beta - \frac{1}{2}})$ with
$\beta = 1/(\gamma - 1) < \frac{1}{2}$, and hence vanishes in the limit. This
demonstrates that realistic scale-free topologies intrinsically regularize
causal discovery, reducing variability in orientation error. These
finite-dimension results provide the first dimension-adaptive,
faithfulness-robust guarantees for causal structure recovery, and challenge the
intuition that high dimensionality and network heterogeneity necessarily hinder
accurate discovery. Our simulation results corroborate these theoretical
predictions, showing that the FNR indeed concentrates and often vanishes in
practice as dimensionality grows.

### [190] [Adaptive Neighborhood-Constrained Q Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02567)
*Yixiu Mao,Yun Qu,Qi Wang,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Adaptive Neighborhood-constrained Q-learning (ANQ) for offline RL, using a data-point–dependent neighborhood constraint on target actions to limit extrapolation and distribution shift, aiming to approximate the support constraint without modeling the behavior policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Offline RL suffers from extrapolation errors due to out-of-distribution actions. Existing density, support, and sample constraints have limitations (over-conservatism or difficulty modeling the behavior policy). A flexible, data-adaptive constraint could better balance risk and expressiveness.

Method: Introduce a new neighborhood constraint: restrict Bellman target actions to the union of neighborhoods around dataset actions. Develop ANQ via a bilevel optimization framework that adapts neighborhood radii based on data quality. Leverage an adaptive neighborhood constraint to enable pointwise conservatism.

Result: The approach yields state-of-the-art performance on standard offline RL benchmarks and demonstrates robustness to noisy or limited data.

Conclusion: Neighborhood constraints can approximate the support constraint without explicit behavior policy modeling and offer a flexible, data-adaptive mechanism to control extrapolation and distributional shift, with strong empirical performance.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from extrapolation errors induced
by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, offline RL algorithms
typically impose constraints on action selection, which can be systematically
categorized into density, support, and sample constraints. However, we show
that each category has inherent limitations: density and sample constraints
tend to be overly conservative in many scenarios, while the support constraint,
though least restrictive, faces challenges in accurately modeling the behavior
policy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new neighborhood constraint
that restricts action selection in the Bellman target to the union of
neighborhoods of dataset actions. Theoretically, the constraint not only bounds
extrapolation errors and distribution shift under certain conditions, but also
approximates the support constraint without requiring behavior policy modeling.
Moreover, it retains substantial flexibility and enables pointwise conservatism
by adapting the neighborhood radius for each data point. In practice, we employ
data quality as the adaptation criterion and design an adaptive neighborhood
constraint. Building on an efficient bilevel optimization framework, we develop
a simple yet effective algorithm, Adaptive Neighborhood-constrained Q learning
(ANQ), to perform Q learning with target actions satisfying this constraint.
Empirically, ANQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard offline RL
benchmarks and exhibits strong robustness in scenarios with noisy or limited
data.

### [191] [Dynamic Priors in Bayesian Optimization for Hyperparameter Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02570)
*Lukas Fehring,Marcel Wever,Maximilian Spliethöver,Leona Hennig,Henning Wachsmuth,Marius Lindauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces an interactive Bayesian optimization method for hyperparameter optimization that lets users steer the process online through priors, extending piBO with a mislead-prior detector; it can combine multiple priors, rejecting misleading ones, and matches the performance of standard BO.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HPO via BO is effective but suffers from black-box aspects and limited user control; there is a need for online, runtime incorporation of expert knowledge without sacrificing theoretical guarantees.

Method: Generalizes piBO to support repeated user interventions as priors, introduces a scheme to detect misleading priors, allows multiple priors and runtime updates while preserving theoretical guarantees.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows the approach leverages informative priors, can reject or overcome misleading priors, and remains competitive with unperturbed BO.

Conclusion: Provides a principled, safe, and flexible framework for online expert steering of BO in HPO, potentially increasing adoption by ML practitioners.

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO), for example, based on Bayesian
optimization (BO), supports users in designing models well-suited for a given
dataset. HPO has proven its effectiveness on several applications, ranging from
classical machine learning for tabular data to deep neural networks for
computer vision and transformers for natural language processing. However, HPO
still sometimes lacks acceptance by machine learning experts due to its
black-box nature and limited user control. Addressing this, first approaches
have been proposed to initialize BO methods with expert knowledge. However,
these approaches do not allow for online steering during the optimization
process. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that enables repeated
interventions to steer BO via user input, specifying expert knowledge and user
preferences at runtime of the HPO process in the form of prior distributions.
To this end, we generalize an existing method, $\pi$BO, preserving theoretical
guarantees. We also introduce a misleading prior detection scheme, which allows
protection against harmful user inputs. In our experimental evaluation, we
demonstrate that our method can effectively incorporate multiple priors,
leveraging informative priors, whereas misleading priors are reliably rejected
or overcome. Thereby, we achieve competitiveness to unperturbed BO.

### [192] [Directional-Clamp PPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02577)
*Gilad Karpel,Ruida Zhou,Shoham Sabach,Mohammad Ghavamzadeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A directional clamp is added to PPO (DClamp-PPO) to penalize updates moving in the 'wrong' direction; this yields more stable learning and better performance on MuJoCo tasks across seeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO's clipping targets 'right' direction updates but randomness causes some updates to go wrong; stronger control is needed to avoid such updates and keep the importance ratio near 1.

Method: Introduce DClamp-PPO: apply a penalty by creating a steeper loss slope (clamp) in regions where the advantage and ratio imply wrong-direction moves: if advantage > 0 and ratio < 1-β, or advantage < 0 and ratio > 1+β, apply an extra penalty with tunable β in (0,1). Evaluate across MuJoCo environments with multiple seeds; provide theoretical and empirical justification that it reduces wrong-direction updates and keeps ratio close to 1.

Result: DClamp-PPO consistently outperforms PPO and variants; improved performance and stability across MuJoCo tasks; the method reduces occurrences of wrong-direction updates and keeps the importance ratio near 1.

Conclusion: Directional clamping effectively improves PPO by explicitly penalizing wrong-direction updates, offering a simple, theoretically grounded enhancement with empirical gains.

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is widely regarded as one of the most
successful deep reinforcement learning algorithms, known for its robustness and
effectiveness across a range of problems.
  The PPO objective encourages the importance ratio between the current and
behavior policies to move to the "right" direction -- starting from importance
sampling ratios equal to 1, increasing the ratios for actions with positive
advantages and decreasing those with negative advantages. A clipping function
is introduced to prevent over-optimization when updating the importance ratio
in these "right" direction regions. Many PPO variants have been proposed to
extend its success, most of which modify the objective's behavior by altering
the clipping in the "right" direction regions. However, due to randomness in
the rollouts and stochasticity of the policy optimization, we observe that the
ratios frequently move to the "wrong" direction during the PPO optimization.
This is a key factor hindering the improvement of PPO, but it has been largely
overlooked. To address this, we propose the Directional-Clamp PPO algorithm
(DClamp-PPO), which further penalizes the actions going to the strict "wrong"
direction regions, where the advantage is positive (negative) and importance
ratio falls below (above) $1 - \beta$ ($1+\beta$),
  for a tunable parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$. The penalty is by enforcing a
steeper loss slope, i.e., a clamp, in those regions. We demonstrate that
DClamp-PPO consistently outperforms PPO, as well as its variants, by focusing
on modifying the objective's behavior in the "right" direction, across various
MuJoCo environments, using different random seeds. The proposed method is
shown, both theoretically and empirically, to better avoid "wrong" direction
updates while keeping the importance ratio closer to 1.

### [193] [A Large Language Model for Corporate Credit Scoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02593)
*Chitro Majumdar,Sergio Scandizzo,Ratanlal Mahanta,Avradip Mandal,Swarnendu Bhattacharjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Omega^2 is an LLM-driven framework for corporate credit scoring that fuses structured financial data with ensemble ML models (CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost) optimized by Bayesian search, evaluated on 7,800 ratings across Moody's, S&P, Fitch, and Egan-Jones, achieving mean test AUC > 0.93 under temporal validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address reliability and interpretability gaps in corporate credit scoring by integrating language-based reasoning with quantitative learning to enable cross-agency generalization and forward-looking, reproducible results.

Method: Combine a large language model with ensemble gradient-boosted models (CatBoost, LightGBM, XGBoost) and Bayesian optimization, using temporal validation on a multi-agency dataset of 7,800 firm-level financial indicators (leverage, profitability, liquidity) to predict credit ratings.

Result: Mean test AUC above 0.93 across agencies, demonstrating generalization to different rating systems and temporal consistency; suggests transparent, institution-grade risk assessment.

Conclusion: Merging language-based reasoning with quantitative learning yields robust, interpretable corporate credit risk assessment that generalizes across rating agencies.

Abstract: We introduce Omega^2, a Large Language Model-driven framework for corporate
credit scoring that combines structured financial data with advanced machine
learning to improve predictive reliability and interpretability. Our study
evaluates Omega^2 on a multi-agency dataset of 7,800 corporate credit ratings
drawn from Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones, each containing
detailed firm-level financial indicators such as leverage, profitability, and
liquidity ratios. The system integrates CatBoost, LightGBM, and XGBoost models
optimized through Bayesian search under temporal validation to ensure
forward-looking and reproducible results. Omega^2 achieved a mean test AUC
above 0.93 across agencies, confirming its ability to generalize across rating
systems and maintain temporal consistency. These results show that combining
language-based reasoning with quantitative learning creates a transparent and
institution-grade foundation for reliable corporate credit-risk assessment.

### [194] [Neural Network Interoperability Across Platforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02610)
*Nadia Daoudi,Ivan Alfonso,Jordi Cabot*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Automatic cross-framework neural network code migration using a pivot NN model; validated on PyTorch and TensorFlow; five networks migrated with functionally equivalent results; artefacts available online.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Migrating NN code between libraries is error-prone and labor-intensive due to the lack of tailored migration methods. Organizations switch frameworks for performance, features, or updated ecosystems, but manual porting is costly and risks outdated implementations.

Method: Introduce a pivot NN model to abstract the network before migration, enabling cross-framework translation. Validate the approach by migrating code between PyTorch and TensorFlow on five networks and discuss challenges and handling strategies encountered during migration.

Result: Code migrations were successful; the migrated networks are functionally equivalent to the originals. Experimental evaluation across five networks supports the viability of the approach. Artefacts from the work are available online.

Conclusion: The paper offers a feasible, automated approach to NN framework migration, reducing manual effort and risk. It also outlines challenges specific to cross-framework migration and points to available artefacts for reproducibility; future work could extend support to additional frameworks and networks.

Abstract: The development of smart systems (i.e., systems enhanced with AI components)
has thrived thanks to the rapid advancements in neural networks (NNs). A wide
range of libraries and frameworks have consequently emerged to support NN
design and implementation. The choice depends on factors such as available
functionalities, ease of use, documentation and community support. After
adopting a given NN framework, organizations might later choose to switch to
another if performance declines, requirements evolve, or new features are
introduced. Unfortunately, migrating NN implementations across libraries is
challenging due to the lack of migration approaches specifically tailored for
NNs. This leads to increased time and effort to modernize NNs, as manual
updates are necessary to avoid relying on outdated implementations and ensure
compatibility with new features. In this paper, we propose an approach to
automatically migrate neural network code across deep learning frameworks. Our
method makes use of a pivot NN model to create an abstraction of the NN prior
to migration. We validate our approach using two popular NN frameworks, namely
PyTorch and TensorFlow. We also discuss the challenges of migrating code
between the two frameworks and how they were approached in our method.
Experimental evaluation on five NNs shows that our approach successfully
migrates their code and produces NNs that are functionally equivalent to the
originals. Artefacts from our work are available online.

*Mohammed Al-Jaff,Giovanni Luca Marchetti,Michael C Welle,Jens Lundell,Mats G. Gustafsson,Gustav Eje Henter,Hossein Azizpour,Danica Kragic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NAIGNs replace adversarial training in IGNs with a non-adversarial objective that combines reconstruction with IMLE, improving restoration of corrupted inputs and generation that better matches the data distribution, while implicitly learning distance fields and an energy model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IGNs suffer from mode collapse, mode dropping, and training instability due to adversarial components; a non-adversarial alternative aims to stabilize training and improve manifold projection and data fidelity.

Method: Train using a loss that blends reconstruction with IMLE (Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation) instead of adversarial losses, yielding non-adversarial idempotent generative networks that act as data-manifold projectors.

Result: NAIGNs improve the ability to restore corrupted data and generate new samples that more closely match the data distribution compared to IGNs.

Conclusion: NAIGNs implicitly learn the distance field to the data manifold and behave like an energy-based model, offering a non-adversarial path for idempotent generative modeling.

Abstract: Idempotent Generative Networks (IGNs) are deep generative models that also
function as local data manifold projectors, mapping arbitrary inputs back onto
the manifold. They are trained to act as identity operators on the data and as
idempotent operators off the data manifold. However, IGNs suffer from mode
collapse, mode dropping, and training instability due to their objectives,
which contain adversarial components and can cause the model to cover the data
manifold only partially -- an issue shared with generative adversarial
networks. We introduce Non-Adversarial Idempotent Generative Networks (NAIGNs)
to address these issues. Our loss function combines reconstruction with the
non-adversarial generative objective of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation
(IMLE). This improves on IGN's ability to restore corrupted data and generate
new samples that closely match the data distribution. We moreover demonstrate
that NAIGNs implicitly learn the distance field to the data manifold, as well
as an energy-based model.

### [196] [Recursively Enumerably Representable Classes and Computable Versions of the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02644)
*David Kattermann,Lothar Sebastian Krapp*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CPAC learning is tied to effective VC-dimension and RER classes; effective VC-dimension can take a wide range of values above the standard VC bound, with coincidences under strong CPAC, and containment-based characterizations; unique-identification CPAC implies RER, and agnostic learnability holds for RER in a nonuniform CPAC setting.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how computable constraints on learners interact with VC-theoretic notions and representability, and to map CPAC learning to recursively enumerable representable (RER) classes.

Method: Theoretical analysis introducing effective VC-dimension for CPAC learning, examining RER classes, proving containment-based characterizations of CPAC, identifying conditions under which the effective and traditional VC-dimensions coincide, and establishing agnostic learnability for RER through a nonuniform CPAC framework.

Result: The effective VC-dimension can take arbitrary values above the traditional VC for RER classes; the two dimensions coincide for classes with strong CPAC properties; CPAC can be characterized by containment of RER classes realizing the same samples; CPAC with a unique identification property implies the class is RER; agnostic learnability is guaranteed for RER under nonuniform CPAC.

Conclusion: There is a rich landscape of CPAC behavior governed by the interaction between computation and VC-theoretic notions, with RER classes playing a central organizing role, enabling various (non-)examples and extending agnostic learnability results.

Abstract: We study computable probably approximately correct (CPAC) learning, where
learners are required to be computable functions. It had been previously
observed that the Fundamental Theorem of Statistical Learning, which
characterizes PAC learnability by finiteness of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis
(VC-)dimension, no longer holds in this framework. Recent works recovered
analogs of the Fundamental Theorem in the computable setting, for instance by
introducing an effective VC-dimension. Guided by this, we investigate the
connection between CPAC learning and recursively enumerable representable (RER)
classes, whose members can be algorithmically listed. Our results show that the
effective VC-dimensions can take arbitrary values above the traditional one,
even for RER classes, which creates a whole family of (non-)examples for
various notions of CPAC learning. Yet the two dimensions coincide for classes
satisfying sufficiently strong notions of CPAC learning. We then observe that
CPAC learnability can also be characterized via containment of RER classes that
realize the same samples. Furthermore, it is shown that CPAC learnable classes
satisfying a unique identification property are necessarily RER. Finally, we
establish that agnostic learnability can be guaranteed for RER classes, by
considering the relaxed notion of nonuniform CPAC learning.

### [197] [Natural-gas storage modelling by deep reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02646)
*Tiziano Balaconi,Aldo Glielmo,Marco Taboga*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GasRL uses a reinforcement-learning–driven simulator to study how storage-operator policies shape natural-gas prices and market dynamics. Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) performs best, yielding profitable, stable, and robust outcomes; the resulting price dynamics resemble real-world volatility and seasonality without calibrating to price data. EU minimum storage thresholds improve market resilience to large supply shocks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how stockpile management and regulatory requirements influence equilibrium prices and volatility in natural-gas markets, and to provide a policy-analysis tool that can test regulatory interventions.

Method: Construct GasRL: a calibrated gas-market simulator coupled with storage-operator policies learned via deep reinforcement learning. Compare RL algorithms (notably SAC) on objectives like profitability, market-clearing robustness, and price stabilization. Validate by examining whether SAC-derived policies reproduce real price features without direct price-data calibration, and assess EU storage-threshold policies under supply-shock scenarios.

Result: SAC outperforms alternatives, achieving the operator goals of profitability, robust clearing, and price stabilization. The SAC-driven equilibrium shows price dynamics with volatility and seasonality similar to real-world prices, despite no explicit price-data calibration. EU-mandated minimum storage thresholds boost market resilience, reducing disruptions under large shocks.

Conclusion: RL-based storage-policy design can reproduce key real-market features and provide resilience benefits. The GasRL environment is a useful platform for policy evaluation, showing that regulatory thresholds can enhance stability in the face of unexpected supply shocks.

Abstract: We introduce GasRL, a simulator that couples a calibrated representation of
the natural gas market with a model of storage-operator policies trained with
deep reinforcement learning (RL). We use it to analyse how optimal stockpile
management affects equilibrium prices and the dynamics of demand and supply. We
test various RL algorithms and find that Soft Actor Critic (SAC) exhibits
superior performance in the GasRL environment: multiple objectives of storage
operators - including profitability, robust market clearing and price
stabilisation - are successfully achieved. Moreover, the equilibrium price
dynamics induced by SAC-derived optimal policies have characteristics, such as
volatility and seasonality, that closely match those of real-world prices.
Remarkably, this adherence to the historical distribution of prices is obtained
without explicitly calibrating the model to price data. We show how the
simulator can be used to assess the effects of EU-mandated minimum storage
thresholds. We find that such thresholds have a positive effect on market
resilience against unanticipated shifts in the distribution of supply shocks.
For example, with unusually large shocks, market disruptions are averted more
often if a threshold is in place.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hybrid LLMs that blend transformer attention with State Space Models (SSMs) can achieve linear-time inference and fixed memory, enabling substantially higher throughput with minimal drop in reasoning quality, as shown by the Apriel-H1 family derived from Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker and deployed in vLLM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformers' attention mechanisms incur quadratic time/memory costs and require caching, hindering throughput and scalability. SSMs provide linear inference and constant memory, offering a path to efficient, scalable reasoning for large models.

Method: Incremental distillation from a pretrained reasoning transformer to replace less critical MHA layers with linear Mamba blocks, creating Apriel-H1-15B-Thinker variants with varying SSM-to-MHA ratios. Additional post-distillation 30/50 hybrid variant fine-tuned on a supervised dataset of reasoning traces, deployed in a production-ready vLLM environment for throughput vs reasoning performance analysis.

Result: The distilled hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures deliver substantial efficiency gains, achieving over 2x higher inference throughput in production-ready vLLM with only minimal degradation in reasoning performance. Performance degrades gradually as more MHA layers are replaced by Mamba blocks, indicating a tunable trade-off between throughput and reasoning quality.

Conclusion: Hybrid SSM-Transformer models can deliver major efficiency improvements over pretrained transformers without substantially compromising reasoning ability, enabling scalable, high-throughput LLM deployment.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable reasoning capabilities
through transformer architectures with attention mechanisms. However,
transformers suffer from quadratic time and memory complexity in the attention
module (MHA) and require caching key-value states during inference, which
severely limits throughput and scalability. High inference throughput is
critical for agentic tasks, long-context reasoning, efficient deployment under
high request loads, and more efficient test-time compute scaling.
  State Space Models (SSMs) such as Mamba offer a promising alternative with
linear inference complexity and a constant memory footprint via recurrent
computation with fixed-size hidden states. In this technical report we
introduce the Apriel-H1 family of hybrid LLMs that combine transformer
attention and SSM sequence mixers for efficient reasoning at 15B model size.
These models are obtained through incremental distillation from a pretrained
reasoning transformer, Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker, progressively replacing
less critical attention layers with linear Mamba blocks.
  We release multiple post-distillation variants of Apriel-H1-15B-Thinker with
different SSM-to-MHA ratios and analyse how reasoning performance degrades as
more Mamba layers replace MHA. Additionally, we release a 30/50 hybrid variant
of Apriel-H1, further fine-tuned on a supervised dataset of reasoning traces,
achieving over 2x higher inference throughput when deployed in the
production-ready vLLM environment, with minimal degradation in reasoning
performance. This shows that distilled hybrid SSM-Transformer architectures can
deliver substantial efficiency gains over the pretrained transformer equivalent
without substantially compromising the reasoning quality.

*Lihan Xu,Yanjie Dong,Gang Wang,Runhao Zeng,Xiaoyi Fan,Xiping Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Byzantine-resilient federated learning algorithm called Byrd-NAFL combines Nesterov momentum with robust aggregation to deliver fast, robust training under Byzantine threats, with finite-time convergence guarantees for non-convex smooth losses and strong empirical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Federated learning is vulnerable to Byzantine workers that can send arbitrary, malicious gradients. There is a need for methods that are both communication-efficient and robust, with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Method: Proposes Byrd-NAFL that integrates Nesterov momentum into federated learning and uses Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules to mitigate gradient corruption; proves finite-time convergence under non-convex, smooth loss with relaxed gradient aggregation assumptions; includes experimental validation across attack strategies.

Result: Finite-time convergence guarantee; empirical results show faster convergence, higher accuracy, and greater resilience compared to existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: Byrd-NAFL provides a fast, robust federated learning framework against Byzantine adversaries, achieving improved convergence speed and robustness with efficient communication.

Abstract: We investigate robust federated learning, where a group of workers
collaboratively train a shared model under the orchestration of a central
server in the presence of Byzantine adversaries capable of arbitrary and
potentially malicious behaviors. To simultaneously enhance communication
efficiency and robustness against such adversaries, we propose a
Byzantine-resilient Nesterov-Accelerated Federated Learning (Byrd-NAFL)
algorithm. Byrd-NAFL seamlessly integrates Nesterov's momentum into the
federated learning process alongside Byzantine-resilient aggregation rules to
achieve fast and safeguarding convergence against gradient corruption. We
establish a finite-time convergence guarantee for Byrd-NAFL under non-convex
and smooth loss functions with relaxed assumption on the aggregated gradients.
Extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of Byrd-NAFL and
demonstrate the superiority over existing benchmarks in terms of convergence
speed, accuracy, and resilience to diverse Byzantine attack strategies.

TL;DR: In situ continual-learning for implicit neural representations using limited memory buffers plus sketch-based regularization to prevent forgetting, achieving high compression with near-offline performance across 2D/3D simulations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate catastrophic forgetting in continual learning for in situ neural compression with implicit representations; justify sketching as a regularizer via Johnson-Lindenstrauss ideas.

Method: Maintain buffers containing full and sketched samples; use sketched data as a regularizer during training; provide Johnson-Lindenstrauss-inspired theoretical motivation; apply to hypernetworks encoding implicit representations; evaluate on 2D/3D simulations on unstructured grids.

Result: High reconstruction accuracy at large compression; sketching enables in situ approach to closely match offline method performance across long horizons and complex geometries.

Conclusion: Sketch-based regularization is effective for in situ neural compression with implicit representations and may extend to broader continual learning contexts.

Abstract: Focusing on implicit neural representations, we present a novel in situ
training protocol that employs limited memory buffers of full and sketched data
samples, where the sketched data are leveraged to prevent catastrophic
forgetting. The theoretical motivation for our use of sketching as a
regularizer is presented via a simple Johnson-Lindenstrauss-informed result.
While our methods may be of wider interest in the field of continual learning,
we specifically target in situ neural compression using implicit neural
representation-based hypernetworks. We evaluate our method on a variety of
complex simulation data in two and three dimensions, over long time horizons,
and across unstructured grids and non-Cartesian geometries. On these tasks, we
show strong reconstruction performance at high compression rates. Most
importantly, we demonstrate that sketching enables the presented in situ scheme
to approximately match the performance of the equivalent offline method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A rigorous, scalable assessment of compositional generalization in vision, unifying prior protocols, a large-scale empirical survey over 5000+ models, and Attribute Invariant Networks that improve accuracy and efficiency, establishing a new Pareto frontier.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Compositional generalization is essential for robust AI but remains hard to evaluate due to fragmented benchmarks, biased protocols, and lack of scalable inductive biases in general-purpose vision architectures.

Method: 1) Propose a unified evaluation framework that collapses combinatorial evaluation to constant cost. 2) Conduct a large-scale empirical study across supervised vision backbones (training more than 5000 models) to assess compositional generalization. 3) Introduce Attribute Invariant Networks, a model class enforcing attribute-level invariants to enhance compositional generalization while reducing parameter overhead.

Result: The framework standardizes evaluation and reduces computational burden; the large-scale study reveals current backbones' capabilities and gaps; Attribute Invariant Networks achieve 23.43% accuracy improvement over baselines and reduce parameter overhead from 600% to 16% compared to fully disentangled counterparts.

Conclusion: This work sets a new standard for evaluating compositional generalization in vision, demonstrating that targeted inductive biases (attribute invariance) can push a favorable Pareto frontier between accuracy and model complexity.

Abstract: Compositional generalization-a key open challenge in modern machine
learning-requires models to predict unknown combinations of known concepts.
However, assessing compositional generalization remains a fundamental challenge
due to the lack of standardized evaluation protocols and the limitations of
current benchmarks, which often favor efficiency over rigor. At the same time,
general-purpose vision architectures lack the necessary inductive biases, and
existing approaches to endow them compromise scalability. As a remedy, this
paper introduces: 1) a rigorous evaluation framework that unifies and extends
previous approaches while reducing computational requirements from
combinatorial to constant; 2) an extensive and modern evaluation on the status
of compositional generalization in supervised vision backbones, training more
than 5000 models; 3) Attribute Invariant Networks, a class of models
establishing a new Pareto frontier in compositional generalization, achieving a
23.43% accuracy improvement over baselines while reducing parameter overhead
from 600% to 16% compared to fully disentangled counterparts.

### [202] [Curriculum Design for Trajectory-Constrained Agent: Compressing Chain-of-Thought Tokens in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02690)
*Georgios Tzannetos,Parameswaran Kamalaruban,Adish Singla*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A curriculum learning approach that gradually tightens deployment constraints during training accelerates learning and enables efficient resource-constrained deployment for RL and LLMs; supported by theory and experiments including speedups for chain-of-thought.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Training agents to perform under strict deployment constraints (e.g., limited resources, safety) is challenging. The paper proposes a self-paced-like curriculum that starts with simpler constraints and progressively enforces full deployment conditions, aiming to improve learning efficiency and performance across RL and LLMs.

Method: Introduce a curriculum strategy that tightens trajectory constraints over training. The agent first learns in simpler constrained environments and then encounters the full deployment constraints. The authors provide a theoretical analysis in a binary-tree MDP showing faster training than a constraint-from-start baseline, and validate the approach empirically on RL tasks (binary-tree MDP, multi-task navigation, math reasoning benchmarks) and LLMs, where it also enables compression of output chain-of-thought tokens for faster inference on consumer hardware.

Result: The curriculum accelerates training relative to baselines imposing full constraints from the start. It generalizes across RL and LLM settings, yielding improved efficiency and performance. For LLMs, the method reduces chain-of-thought token usage, delivering substantial inference speedups on commodity hardware.

Conclusion: Curriculum design is a promising tool for enabling efficient, high-performing agents under complex deployment constraints, with demonstrated benefits in both RL and LLM regimes and practical gains in resource-constrained inference.

Abstract: Training agents to operate under strict constraints during deployment, such
as limited resource budgets or stringent safety requirements, presents
significant challenges, especially when these constraints render the task
complex. In this work, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that gradually
tightens constraints during training, enabling the agent to incrementally
master the deployment requirements. Inspired by self-paced learning techniques
in unconstrained reinforcement learning (RL), our approach facilitates a
smoother transition to challenging environments by initially training on
simplified versions of the constraints and progressively introducing the full
deployment conditions. We provide a theoretical analysis using an RL agent in a
binary-tree Markov Decision Process (MDP) to demonstrate that our curriculum
strategy can accelerate training relative to a baseline approach that imposes
the trajectory constraints from the outset. Moreover, we empirically validate
the effectiveness and generality of our method across both RL and large
language model (LLM) agents in diverse settings, including a binary-tree MDP, a
multi-task navigation domain, and a math reasoning task with two benchmarks.
These results highlight the potential of curriculum design in enhancing the
efficiency and performance of agents operating under complex trajectory
constraints during deployment. Moreover, when applied to LLMs, our strategy
enables compression of output chain-of-thought tokens, achieving a substantial
inference speedup on consumer hardware, demonstrating its effectiveness for
resource-constrained deployment.

*Bum Chul Kwon,Ben Shapira,Moshiko Raboh,Shreyans Sethi,Shruti Murarka,Joseph A Morrone,Jianying Hu,Parthasarathy Suryanarayanan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STAR-VAE is a Transformer-based variational autoencoder for drug-like molecules using SELFIES, enabling scalable, conditional, property-guided generation with LoRA fine-tuning, achieving competitive results on standard benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The chemical space of drug-like molecules is vast and requires generative models that cover broad chemical distributions, support conditional generation via structure–property relations, ensure syntactic validity, and allow fast, scalable generation.

Method: A Transformer-based latent-variable encoder–decoder (STAR-VAE) with a SELFIES input, autoregressive Transformer decoder, and a latent-variable VAE. A property predictor provides a conditioning signal applied to the latent prior, the inference network, and the decoder. Training on 79M PubChem molecules; efficient fine-tuning with low-rank adapters (LoRA) in both encoder and decoder.

Result: On GuacaMol and MOSES, STAR-VAE matches or exceeds baselines; latent representations are smooth and semantically structured, supporting unconditional exploration and property-aware generation. On Tartarus, conditioning steers docking-score distributions toward stronger predicted binding.

Conclusion: A modernized, scale-appropriate VAE remains competitive for molecular generation when paired with principled conditioning and parameter-efficient finetuning.

Abstract: The chemical space of drug-like molecules is vast, motivating the development
of generative models that must learn broad chemical distributions, enable
conditional generation by capturing structure-property representations, and
provide fast molecular generation. Meeting the objectives depends on modeling
choices, including the probabilistic modeling approach, the conditional
generative formulation, the architecture, and the molecular input
representation. To address the challenges, we present STAR-VAE
(Selfies-encoded, Transformer-based, AutoRegressive Variational Auto Encoder),
a scalable latent-variable framework with a Transformer encoder and an
autoregressive Transformer decoder. It is trained on 79 million drug-like
molecules from PubChem, using SELFIES to guarantee syntactic validity. The
latent-variable formulation enables conditional generation: a property
predictor supplies a conditioning signal that is applied consistently to the
latent prior, the inference network, and the decoder. Our contributions are:
(i) a Transformer-based latent-variable encoder-decoder model trained on
SELFIES representations; (ii) a principled conditional latent-variable
formulation for property-guided generation; and (iii) efficient finetuning with
low-rank adapters (LoRA) in both encoder and decoder, enabling fast adaptation
with limited property and activity data. On the GuacaMol and MOSES benchmarks,
our approach matches or exceeds baselines, and latent-space analyses reveal
smooth, semantically structured representations that support both unconditional
exploration and property-aware generation. On the Tartarus benchmarks, the
conditional model shifts docking-score distributions toward stronger predicted
binding. These results suggest that a modernized, scale-appropriate VAE remains
competitive for molecular generation when paired with principled conditioning
and parameter-efficient finetuning.

### [204] [Does Interpretability of Knowledge Tracing Models Support Teacher Decision Making?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02718)
*Adia Khalid,Alina Deriyeva,Benjamin Paassen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Interpretable knowledge tracing models improve perceived usability and may speed mastery in simulations, but human teachers do not consistently use interpretability to improve learning outcomes; more work needed to understand how interpretability affects teaching decisions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To examine whether interpretable KT models, which expose an explicit model of learning and learner ability, actually aid teachers in pedagogical decision-making, addressing a gap between model interpretability and practical teaching effectiveness.

Method: Two-stage study: (1) a simulation comparing decisions based on interpretable vs non-interpretable KT models on mastery speed; (2) a small human-subject study with N=12 teachers, providing KT-model outputs and asking them to decide which tasks to assign and when to stop, measuring usability/trust and mastery outcomes.

Result: Simulation showed faster mastery with decisions based on interpretable KT models. In the human study, teachers rated interpretable KT models higher on usability and trust, but the actual number of tasks to mastery did not differ significantly between model types.

Conclusion: Interpretability enhances perceived usability and trust in KT models but does not straightforwardly translate into improved teaching decisions or learning outcomes; the link between interpretability and decision effectiveness is complex and warrants further research into how learners and teachers use KT explanations.

Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) models are a crucial basis for pedagogical
decision-making, namely which task to select next for a learner and when to
stop teaching a particular skill. Given the high stakes of pedagogical
decisions, KT models are typically required to be interpretable, in the sense
that they should implement an explicit model of human learning and provide
explicit estimates of learners' abilities. However, to our knowledge, no study
to date has investigated whether the interpretability of KT models actually
helps human teachers to make teaching decisions. We address this gap. First, we
perform a simulation study to show that, indeed, decisions based on
interpretable KT models achieve mastery faster compared to decisions based on a
non-interpretable model. Second, we repeat the study but ask $N=12$ human
teachers to make the teaching decisions based on the information provided by KT
models. As expected, teachers rate interpretable KT models higher in terms of
usability and trustworthiness. However, the number of tasks needed until
mastery hardly differs between KT models. This suggests that the relationship
between model interpretability and teacher decisions is not straightforward:
teachers do not solely rely on KT models to make decisions and further research
is needed to investigate how learners and teachers actually understand and use
KT models.

Abstract: Tabular foundation models represent a growing paradigm in structured data
learning, extending the benefits of large-scale pretraining to tabular domains.

pipelines, fragmented APIs, inconsistent fine-tuning procedures, and the
absence of standardized evaluation for deployment-oriented metrics such as
calibration and fairness. We present TabTune, a unified library that
standardizes the complete workflow for tabular foundation models through a

architectural heterogeneity internally, and integrates evaluation modules for
performance, calibration, and fairness. Designed for extensibility and

### [206] [Calibration improves detection of mislabeled examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02738)
*Ilies Chibane,Thomas George,Pierre Nodet,Vincent Lemaire*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Calibrating the base model used for mislabel detection improves the accuracy and robustness of identifying mislabeled instances.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mislabeled data degrades ML performance; detecting mislabeled instances allows filtering or relabeling. The base model’s trust scores are central to this process, so its calibration could influence detection quality.

Method: The paper empirically investigates how calibrating the base model affects mislabeled-data detection, using calibration methods to improve the model’s trust scores used for mislabel detection.

Result: Calibration improves the accuracy and robustness of mislabeled instance detection, offering a practical solution for industrial applications.

Conclusion: Calibration of the base model is beneficial for mislabel detection in real-world settings and can enhance the effectiveness of mislabel correction strategies.

Abstract: Mislabeled data is a pervasive issue that undermines the performance of
machine learning systems in real-world applications. An effective approach to
mitigate this problem is to detect mislabeled instances and subject them to
special treatment, such as filtering or relabeling. Automatic mislabeling
detection methods typically rely on training a base machine learning model and
then probing it for each instance to obtain a trust score that each provided
label is genuine or incorrect. The properties of this base model are thus of
paramount importance. In this paper, we investigate the impact of calibrating
this model. Our empirical results show that using calibration methods improves
the accuracy and robustness of mislabeled instance detection, providing a
practical and effective solution for industrial applications.

### [207] [Assessing win strength in MLB win prediction models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02815)
*Morgan Allen,Paul Savala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A study trains multiple ML models on a common MLB dataset to predict game winners, links predicted win probability to margin of victory, and evaluates betting strategies based on these probabilities, finding that well-chosen strategies yield positive returns while naive usage loses money.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how predicted win probabilities reflect the underlying strength of teams (as indicated by score differential), and to assess the practical value of ML-derived probabilities for betting in baseball.

Method: Train a comprehensive suite of machine learning models on a shared MLB dataset to predict game outcomes. Calibrate or relate predicted win probabilities to score differentials (win strength). Evaluate decision-making using predicted probabilities on run-line betting with strategy analysis, contrasting with naive usage.

Result: There is a demonstrated relationship between modeled win probability and win strength (score differential). Appropriate betting strategies using predicted probabilities yield positive returns; naive or misapplied use of the models leads to substantial losses.

Conclusion: ML-based win-probability models can reflect true win strength and be economically valuable for betting when paired with sound strategies, but require careful application to avoid losses from naive usage.

Abstract: In Major League Baseball, strategy and planning are major factors in
determining the outcome of a game. Previous studies have aided this by building
machine learning models for predicting the winning team of any given game. We
extend this work by training a comprehensive set of machine learning models
using a common dataset. In addition, we relate the win probabilities produced
by these models to win strength as measured by score differential. In doing so
we show that the most common machine learning models do indeed demonstrate a
relationship between predicted win probability and the strength of the win.
Finally, we analyze the results of using predicted win probabilities as a
decision making mechanism on run-line betting. We demonstrate positive returns
when utilizing appropriate betting strategies, and show that naive use of
machine learning models for betting lead to significant loses.

### [208] [ConMeZO: Adaptive Descent-Direction Sampling for Gradient-Free Finetuning of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02757)
*Lejs Deen Behric,Liang Zhang,Bingcong Li,Kiran Koshy Thekumparampil*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ConMeZO speeds up zeroth-order optimization for fine-tuning large language models by using adaptive cone-based directional sampling around momentum, achieving up to 2× faster convergence with the same worst-case rate and low memory usage.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zeroth-order optimization (MeZO) reduces memory by avoiding backpropagation but converges slowly in high-dimensional LLM parameter spaces due to the curse of dimensionality. There is a need for faster derivative-free fine-tuning that preserves memory advantages.

Method: Introduce ConMeZO, which restricts the sampling of descent directions to a cone centered on a momentum estimate rather than drawing uniformly at random. This concentrates the search on directions where the true gradient is more likely to lie, reducing high-dimensional challenges. The approach preserves the low-memory footprint of zeroth-order methods and retains theoretical convergence guarantees.

Result: The worst-case convergence rate matches that of MeZO. Empirically, during LLM finetuning on natural language tasks, ConMeZO is up to 2× faster than MeZO while maintaining a low memory footprint.

Conclusion: Adaptive cone-based directional sampling in ConMeZO effectively accelerates zeroth-order fine-tuning of large language models without increasing memory usage and without sacrificing theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Zeroth-order or derivative-free optimization (MeZO) is an attractive strategy
for finetuning large language models (LLMs) because it eliminates the memory
overhead of backpropagation. However, it converges slowly due to the inherent
curse of dimensionality when searching for descent directions in the
high-dimensional parameter space of billion-scale LLMs. We propose ConMeZO, a
novel zeroth-order optimizer that accelerates convergence by adaptive
directional sampling. Instead of drawing the direction uniformly at random,
ConMeZO restricts the sampling to a cone centered around a momentum estimate.
This concentrates the search in directions where the true gradient is more
likely to lie and thus reduces the effect of high dimensions. We prove that
ConMeZO achieves the same worst-case convergence rate as MeZO. Empirically,
when finetuning LLMs on natural language tasks, ConMeZO is up to 2X faster than
MeZO while retaining the low-memory footprint of zeroth-order methods.

*Xun Wang,Zhuoran Li,Yanshan Lin,Hai Zhong,Longbo Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SoCo (Solo-to-Collaborative RL) bridges solo demonstrations and cooperative MARL by pretraining a shared solo policy and fusing it into multi-agent training via an MoE-like gate and an action editor, improving data efficiency and performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MARL training from scratch is data-inefficient when relying on costly multi-agent data; solo experiences are easier to obtain in many real-world settings, offering a scalable source of knowledge to accelerate cooperative learning.

Method: Pretrain a shared solo policy from solo demonstrations; during multi-agent training, adapt it for cooperation using a policy fusion mechanism comprising an MoE-like gating selector and an action editor to produce cooperative actions.

Result: Empirical evaluations across diverse cooperative tasks show that SoCo significantly improves training efficiency and performance of backbone MARL algorithms, demonstrating solo demonstrations as a scalable complement to multi-agent data.

Conclusion: Solo demonstrations can make cooperative learning more practical and broadly applicable, and SoCo provides a scalable framework to leverage such data to accelerate MARL.

Abstract: Training a team of agents from scratch in multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) is highly inefficient, much like asking beginners to play a symphony
together without first practicing solo. Existing methods, such as offline or
transferable MARL, can ease this burden, but they still rely on costly
multi-agent data, which often becomes the bottleneck. In contrast, solo
experiences are far easier to obtain in many important scenarios, e.g.,
collaborative coding, household cooperation, and search-and-rescue. To unlock
their potential, we propose Solo-to-Collaborative RL (SoCo), a framework that
transfers solo knowledge into cooperative learning. SoCo first pretrains a
shared solo policy from solo demonstrations, then adapts it for cooperation
during multi-agent training through a policy fusion mechanism that combines an
MoE-like gating selector and an action editor. Experiments across diverse
cooperative tasks show that SoCo significantly boosts the training efficiency
and performance of backbone algorithms. These results demonstrate that solo
demonstrations provide a scalable and effective complement to multi-agent data,
making cooperative learning more practical and broadly applicable.

*Saeed Razavikia,José Mairton Barros Da Silva Junior,Carlo Fischione*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VecComp generalizes ChannelComp to multiple antennas to enable vector function computation with linear scalability in vector dimension, provides non-asymptotic MSE bounds under fading, and demonstrates robustness and effectiveness in high-dimensional, fading MAC scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to support vector-valued computations in data-centric applications, as scalar ChannelComp limits the types of computable functions and can be sensitive to fading. Extending to MIMO aims to broaden function types, improve robustness, and scale with dimension.

Method: Integrate ChannelComp with multi-antenna (MIMO) technology to enable vector-function computation. Ensure computation complexity grows linearly with vector dimension. Derive a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mean squared error (MSE) under fading channels. Validate via numerical experiments on fading and noisy MACs to demonstrate improved vector-function computation and fading compensation.

Result: VecComp enables vector-function computation with scalable (linear) complexity with respect to vector dimension and provides a non-asymptotic MSE bound under fading. Numerical experiments show improved computation of vector functions and better fading compensation compared to baseline/noise scenarios on fading MACs.

Conclusion: VecComp extends ChannelComp to high-dimensional settings, offering efficient, robust vector-function computation in fading environments. It is well-suited for data-centric applications requiring vector processing and scalable computation, though actual gains depend on system parameters and channel conditions.

Abstract: Recently, the ChannelComp framework has proposed digital over-the-air
computation by designing digital modulations that enable the computation of
arbitrary functions. Unlike traditional analog over-the-air computation, which
is restricted to nomographic functions, ChannelComp enables a broader range of
computational tasks while maintaining compatibility with digital communication
systems. This framework is intended for applications that favor local
information processing over the mere acquisition of data. However, ChannelComp
is currently designed for scalar function computation, while numerous
data-centric applications necessitate vector-based computations, and it is
susceptible to channel fading. In this work, we introduce a generalization of
the ChannelComp framework, called VecComp, by integrating ChannelComp with
multiple-antenna technology. This generalization not only enables vector
function computation but also ensures scalability in the computational
complexity, which increases only linearly with the vector dimension. As such,
VecComp remains computationally efficient and robust against channel
impairments, making it suitable for high-dimensional, data-centric
applications. We establish a non-asymptotic upper bound on the mean squared
error of VecComp, affirming its computation efficiency under fading channel
conditions. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of VecComp in
improving the computation of vector functions and fading compensation over
noisy and fading multiple-access channels.

### [211] [Adam Reduces a Unique Form of Sharpness: Theoretical Insights Near the Minimizer Manifold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02773)
*Xinghan Li,Haodong Wen,Kaifeng Lyu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adam reduces a unique sharpness measure shaped by adaptive updates, leading to solutions distinct from SGD; a continuous-time SDE analysis shows Adam minimizes a sharper metric (sqrt of diagonal Hessian trace) rather than SGD's trace, yielding better sparsity/generalization in certain settings; framework extends to other adaptive optimizers.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how Adam's adaptive updates influence the solutions it converges to, and how this differs from SGD in terms of sharpness and generalization.

Method: Develop a continuous-time approximation via stochastic differential equations to characterize Adam's dynamics, define a sharpness measure shaped by adaptive updates, and compare with SGD in settings like overparameterized models with label noise and diagonal networks; extend analysis to other adaptive methods.

Result: Adam minimizes diag(H)^{1/2} trace instead of tr(H) as SGD does, leading to qualitatively different solutions; this enables better sparsity and generalization in sparse linear regression with diagonal networks; the framework also applies to RMSProp, Adam-mini, Adalayer, Shampoo, offering a unified view on sharpness reduction by adaptive optimizers.

Conclusion: The work provides theoretical insight into how adaptive optimizers alter the solution landscape through a sharpness-reducing mechanism, informs future optimizer design, and explains observed differences from SGD across a range of adaptive methods.

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the Adam optimizer in practice, most theoretical
analyses study Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as a proxy for Adam, and
little is known about how the solutions found by Adam differ. In this paper, we
show that Adam implicitly reduces a unique form of sharpness measure shaped by
its adaptive updates, leading to qualitatively different solutions from SGD.
More specifically, when the training loss is small, Adam wanders around the
manifold of minimizers and takes semi-gradients to minimize this sharpness
measure in an adaptive manner, a behavior we rigorously characterize through a
continuous-time approximation using stochastic differential equations. We
further demonstrate how this behavior differs from that of SGD in a
well-studied setting: when training overparameterized models with label noise,
SGD has been shown to minimize the trace of the Hessian matrix, $\tr(\mH)$,
whereas we prove that Adam minimizes $\tr(\Diag(\mH)^{1/2})$ instead. In
solving sparse linear regression with diagonal linear networks, this
distinction enables Adam to achieve better sparsity and generalization than
SGD. Finally, our analysis framework extends beyond Adam to a broad class of
adaptive gradient methods, including RMSProp, Adam-mini, Adalayer and Shampoo,
and provides a unified perspective on how these adaptive optimizers reduce
sharpness, which we hope will offer insights for future optimizer design.

*Andras Ferenczi,Sutapa Samanta,Dagen Wang,Todd Hodges*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A quantum-inspired QUBO method selects a small subset of client updates per round in federated learning to reduce privacy exposure while preserving accuracy; shows large per-round and cumulative exposure reductions on MNIST and CINIC-10 datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce cumulative privacy risk from repeated inclusion of client updates in FL aggregation, while maintaining model performance; address threats like membership inference, attribute inference, and model inversion; assumes a trusted central server with access to a global validation/test set.

Method: Formulate update selection as a QUBO optimization problem to choose a subset of updates per round using a quantum-inspired approach; evaluate on federated learning setups with MNIST (300 clients, 20 rounds) and CINIC-10 (30 clients).

Result: MNIST (300 clients, 20 rounds): 95.2% per-round privacy exposure reduction and 49% cumulative reduction; 147 clients' updates never used; full-aggregation accuracy maintained or improved. CINIC-10 (30 clients): 82% per-round privacy improvement and 33% cumulative privacy reduction.

Conclusion: The proposed QUBO-based update selection effectively reduces privacy exposure in federated learning with minimal or no loss in accuracy, particularly effective at lower scales and scalable to more complex models.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a widely used method for training machine learning
(ML) models in a scalable way while preserving privacy (i.e., without
centralizing raw data). Prior research shows that the risk of exposing
sensitive data increases cumulatively as the number of iterations where a
client's updates are included in the aggregated model increase. Attackers can
launch membership inference attacks (MIA; deciding whether a sample or client
participated), property inference attacks (PIA; inferring attributes of a
client's data), and model inversion attacks (MI; reconstructing inputs),
thereby inferring client-specific attributes and, in some cases, reconstructing
inputs. In this paper, we mitigate risk by substantially reducing per client
exposure using a quantum computing-inspired quadratic unconstrained binary
optimization (QUBO) formulation that selects a small subset of client updates
most relevant for each training round. In this work, we focus on two threat
vectors: (i) information leakage by clients during training and (ii)
adversaries who can query or obtain the global model. We assume a trusted
central server and do not model server compromise. This method also assumes
that the server has access to a validation/test set with global data
distribution. Experiments on the MNIST dataset with 300 clients in 20 rounds
showed a 95.2% per-round and 49% cumulative privacy exposure reduction, with
147 clients' updates never being used during training while maintaining in
general the full-aggregation accuracy or even better. The method proved to be
efficient at lower scale and more complex model as well. A CINIC-10
dataset-based experiment with 30 clients resulted in 82% per-round privacy
improvement and 33% cumulative privacy.

*Mayank Jobanputra,Nils Philipp Walter,Maitrey Mehta,Blerta Veseli,Evan Parker Kelly Chapple,Yifan Wang,Sneha Chetani,Ellie Pavlick,Antonio Vergari,Vera Demberg*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Subtraction in LLMs is harder than addition; sign errors (especially when a<b) are common but recoverable, with instruction-tuning dramatically improving sign generation; few-shot helps modestly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subtraction is a non-commutative operation and under-studied in LLM benchmarks, yet important for robust arithmetic reasoning; understanding how models handle negative results and how to improve them.

Method: Systematic evaluation of eight pretrained LLMs from four families on addition and subtraction tasks; error analysis focused on sign/negative results; probing to assess internal encoding of negativity; experiments with few-shot prompting and instruction-tuning to gauge improvements.

Result: Subtraction accuracy lags far behind addition. Errors cluster when a<b, with correct magnitude but missing negative sign. Probing shows models internally encode whether the result is negative, though outputs often omit the sign. Few-shot prompting yields modest gains; instruction-tuned models achieve near-perfect accuracy in generating the negative sign.

Conclusion: There is a clear, recoverable gap in LLM subtraction ability. Sign generation, rather than magnitude computation, is the main bottleneck; instruction-tuning effectively bridges this gap, providing a more reliable pathway to arithmetic robustness in subtraction.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of subtraction in large language models (LLMs).
While prior benchmarks emphasize addition and multiplication, subtraction has
received comparatively little attention despite being structurally distinct as
a non-commutative operation. We evaluate eight pretrained LLMs spanning four
families on addition and subtraction problems. Our experiments reveal that
subtraction accuracy lags behind addition by a wide margin. We find that the
errors for ($a-b$) are concentrated in cases where ($a<b$). In such cases, LLMs
frequently produce the correct magnitude but omit the negative sign. Probing
analyses show that LLMs internally encode whether results should be negative,
yet this information is often not reflected in generated outputs. We further
test well-known techniques such as few-shot learning and instruction-tuning to
see if they can improve the LLMs' performance. Our results suggest that while
few-shot prompting yields modest gains, the instruction-tuned models achieve
near-perfect accuracies in generating the negative sign. Together, these
findings provide a clearer characterization of the limitations and
recoverability of LLMs' arithmetic capabilities in subtraction.

Motivation: In federated learning, data privacy must be preserved while maintaining robustness against attackers who attempt to corrupt training outcomes. Existing aggregation methods may be vulnerable or slow to converge; there is a need for fast, private, and attack-resilient FL.

Method: Propose Fast, Private, and Protected (FPP): a FL framework employing secure aggregation for privacy, rounds evaluated by participants' assessments, and training recovery after attacks. It includes a reputation-based mechanism to curb attacker participation. Validation is performed in a dockerized environment, comparing FPP with FedAvg, Power-of-Choice, and aggregation via Trimmed Mean and Median.

Result: Experiments show FPP achieves rapid convergence and remains able to converge even in the presence of malicious participants conducting model-poisoning attacks, validating robustness and efficiency in the dockerized evaluation setup.

Conclusion: FPP provides a fast, privacy-preserving, and protected FL framework with attack resilience via reputation-based defense and recovery mechanisms, offering a competitive alternative to existing aggregation schemes.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed training paradigm wherein
participants collaborate to build a global model while ensuring the privacy of
the involved data, which remains stored on participant devices. However,
proposals aiming to ensure such privacy also make it challenging to protect
against potential attackers seeking to compromise the training outcome. In this
context, we present Fast, Private, and Protected (FPP), a novel approach that
aims to safeguard federated training while enabling secure aggregation to
preserve data privacy. This is accomplished by evaluating rounds using
participants' assessments and enabling training recovery after an attack. FPP
also employs a reputation-based mechanism to mitigate the participation of
attackers. We created a dockerized environment to validate the performance of
FPP compared to other approaches in the literature (FedAvg, Power-of-Choice,
and aggregation via Trimmed Mean and Median). Our experiments demonstrate that
FPP achieves a rapid convergence rate and can converge even in the presence of
malicious participants performing model poisoning attacks.

TL;DR: GeoCrossBench expands GeoBench with evaluation for cross-satellite generalization (in-distribution, no-band overlap, and extra-band settings) and introduces ChiViT, a self-supervised extension of ChannelViT. Findings: strong foundation models may not beat DINOv3 in-distribution; 2–4x performance drop without band overlap; about 5–25% drop with additional bands; fine-tuning the last linear layer with oracle multi-band labels yields relatively consistent cross-satellite performance. Code and datasets released to spur robust cross-satellite models.

Motivation: As remote sensing satellites proliferate, labeled data remain biased toward older satellites. Training from scratch for new satellites is costly; thus, robust cross-satellite generalization is essential for scalable, foundation-model-based Earth observation.

Method: Extend GeoBench to GeoCrossBench with three evaluation regimes: in-distribution, no-band-overlap generalization, and additional-bands generalization. Develop ChiViT, a self-supervised extension of ChannelViT, to improve cross-satellite generalization. Compare state-of-the-art foundation models (DOFA, TerraFM) and general-purpose models (DINOv3) under ID and cross-satellite shifts. Analyze impact of adding unseen bands and evaluate this with oracle-label fine-tuning of the last linear layer to gauge upper-bound performance.

Result: Findings show: (1) DOFA and TerraFM do not outperform DINOv3 in the in-distribution setting; (2) with no band overlap, all models drop 2–4x, though ChiViT outperforms the runner-up DINOv3; (3) adding extra bands at test time causes an average 5–25% performance drop across models; (4) fine-tuning only the last linear layer with oracle multi-band labels yields relatively stable performance across satellites, indicating the benchmark is not saturated.

Conclusion: Cross-satellite generalization remains challenging, even for strong foundation models. The GeoCrossBench protocol reveals gaps that can be mitigated by self-supervised cross-satellite pretraining (as in ChiViT) and suggests that simple linear-head fine-tuning on multi-band labels can achieve more consistent cross-satellite performance. Public release of code and datasets should accelerate the development of robust cross-satellite Earth-observation models.

Abstract: The number and diversity of remote sensing satellites grows over time, while
the vast majority of labeled data comes from older satellites. As the
foundation models for Earth observation scale up, the cost of (re-)training to
support new satellites grows too, so the generalization capabilities of the
models towards new satellites become increasingly important. In this work we
introduce GeoCrossBench, an extension of the popular GeoBench benchmark with a
new evaluation protocol: it tests the in-distribution performance;
generalization to satellites with no band overlap; and generalization to
satellites with additional bands with respect to the training set. We also
develop a self-supervised extension of ChannelViT, ChiViT, to improve its
cross-satellite performance. First, we show that even the best foundation
models for remote sensing (DOFA, TerraFM) do not outperform general purpose
models like DINOv3 in the in-distribution setting. Second, when generalizing to
new satellites with no band overlap, all models suffer 2-4x drop in
performance, and ChiViT significantly outperforms the runner-up DINOv3. Third,
the performance of all tested models drops on average by 5-25\% when given
additional bands during test time. Finally, we show that fine-tuning just the
last linear layer of these models using oracle labels from all bands can get
relatively consistent performance across all satellites, highlighting that the
benchmark is far from being saturated. We publicly release the code and the
datasets to encourage the development of more future-proof remote sensing
models with stronger cross-satellite generalization.

### [216] [In Good GRACEs: Principled Teacher Selection for Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02833)

TL;DR: GRACE is a lightweight, data-free score that predicts which teacher will best distill for a given student-task, based on gradients distribution properties and leave-one-out stability, and correlates with downstream performance while guiding distillation design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Distillation requires selecting an effective teacher for a given student-task, but exhaustive testing is costly. A lightweight, data-free predictor is highly desirable to guide teacher choice and distillation design.

Method: Compute distributional properties of the student’s gradients without access to verifier, teacher logits, teacher internals, or test data. Interpret the score from an information-theoretic lens linked to leave-one-out stability of gradient-based algorithms to bound generalization of distilled students.

Result: GRACE correlates strongly with distilled performance (up to 86% Spearman) on GSM8K and MATH for LLaMA and OLMo. Using a GRACE-selected teacher improves performance by up to 7.4% over naive best-teacher selection. It also offers guidance on key distillation design choices: optimal generation temperature, teacher choice under size constraints, and teacher choice within a model family.

Conclusion: GRACE provides an efficient and effective method to identify compatible teachers for a given student and yields actionable guidance for distillation design.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is an efficient strategy to use data generated by
large "teacher" language models to train smaller capable "student" models, but
selecting the optimal teacher for a specific student-task combination requires
expensive trial-and-error. We propose a lightweight score called GRACE to
quantify how effective a teacher will be for post-training a student model.
GRACE measures distributional properties of the student's gradients without
access to a verifier, teacher logits, teacher internals, or test data. From an
information-theoretic perspective, GRACE connects to leave-one-out stability of
gradient-based algorithms, which controls the generalization performance of the
distilled students. On GSM8K and MATH, GRACE correlates strongly (up to 86%
Spearman correlation) with the performance of the distilled LLaMA and OLMo
students. In particular, training a student using the GRACE-selected teacher
can improve the performance by up to 7.4% over naively using the
best-performing teacher. Further, GRACE can provide guidance on crucial design
choices in distillation, including (1) the best temperature to use when
generating from the teacher, (2) the best teacher to use given a size
constraint, and (3) the best teacher to use within a specific model family.
Altogether, our findings demonstrate that GRACE can efficiently and effectively
identify a strongly compatible teacher for a given student and provide
fine-grained guidance on how to perform distillation.
