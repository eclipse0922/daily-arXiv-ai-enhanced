In this work, we compare the performance of 10\ndifferent optimizers in training a simple Multi-layer Perceptron model using a\nheart disease dataset from Kaggle. We set up a consistent training paradigm and\nevaluate the optimizers based on metrics such as convergence speed and\nstability. We also include some other Machine Learning Evaluation metrics such\nas AUC, Precision, and Recall, which are central metrics to classification\nproblems. Our results show that there are trade-offs between convergence speed\nand stability, as optimizers like Adagrad and Adadelta, which are more stable,\ntook longer time to converge. Across all our metrics, we chose RMSProp to be\nthe most effective optimizer for this heart disease prediction task because it\noffered a balanced performance across key metrics. It achieved a precision of\n0.765, a recall of 0.827, and an AUC of 0.841, along with faster training time.\nHowever, it was not the most stable.
