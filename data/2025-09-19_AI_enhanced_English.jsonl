A\nsubset of these techniques predict the remaining sequence of activities of an\nongoing case (case suffix prediction). Existing approaches for case suffix\nprediction generate sequences of activities with a single timestamp (e.g. the\nend timestamp). This output is insufficient for resource capacity planning,\nwhere we need to reason about the periods of time when resources will be busy\nperforming work. This paper introduces a technique for predicting case suffixes\nconsisting of activities with start and end timestamps. In other words, the\nproposed technique predicts both the waiting time and the processing time of\neach activity. Since the waiting time of an activity in a case depends on how\nbusy resources are in other cases, the technique adopts a sweep-line approach,\nwherein the suffixes of all ongoing cases in the process are predicted in\nlockstep, rather than predictions being made for each case in isolation. An\nevaluation on real-life and synthetic datasets compares the accuracy of\ndifferent instantiations of this approach, demonstrating the advantages of a\nmulti-model approach to case suffix prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Introduces a sweep-line, multi-model technique to predict case suffixes with start and end timestamps for each activity, enabling resource-aware planning.", "motivation": "Current case suffix predictions typically output a single end timestamp, which is insufficient for resource capacity planning.
