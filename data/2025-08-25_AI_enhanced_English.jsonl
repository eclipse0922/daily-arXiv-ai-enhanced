Traditionally,\n3D models of real animals are obtained using 3D scanners. These, however, are\nintrusive, often prohibitively expensive, and difficult to deploy in the\nnatural environment of the animals. In recent years, we have seen a significant\nsurge in deep learning-based techniques that enable the 3D reconstruction, in a\nnon-intrusive manner, of the shape and motion of dynamic objects just from\ntheir RGB image and/or video observations. Several papers have explored their\napplication and extension to various types of animals. This paper surveys the\nlatest developments in this emerging and growing field of research. It\ncategorizes and discusses the state-of-the-art methods based on their input\nmodalities, the way the 3D geometry and motion of animals are represented, the\ntype of reconstruction techniques they use, and the training mechanisms they\nadopt.

In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but\nthese will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically\nincorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a\nmisalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the\nreal-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with\nthis misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a\nproblem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with\nzero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that\nperform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results\nare to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that\ndoing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data\nquality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the\nobservability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are\noften only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a\npriori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of\nmethods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of\nempirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our\ntechniques for remedying them.
