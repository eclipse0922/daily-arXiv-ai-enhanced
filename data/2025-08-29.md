### [1] [Mitigating Hallucinations in Multimodal LLMs via Object-aware Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20181)
*Alberto Compagnoni,Davide Caffagni,Nicholas Moratelli,Lorenzo Baraldi,Marcella Cornia,Rita Cucchiara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CHAIR-DPO uses the CHAIR hallucination metric as a reward to fine-tune multimodal LLMs via Direct Preference Optimization, reducing hallucinations without complex synthetic data pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hallucinations are a major issue in multimodal LLMs. Existing alignment approaches often rely on heavy synthetic data pipelines or proprietary models. A simple, data-efficient way to steer MLLMs toward non-hallucinated outputs is needed.

Method: Compute CHAIR scores to compare two generated answers per prompt and label non-hallucinated as winners. Use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune off-the-shelf MLLMs with CHAIR-based preferences as the training signal. Release code and models.

Result: CHAIR-DPO reduces the amount of hallucinated responses on multiple hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating effective alignment via a CHAIR-based reward.

Conclusion: A straightforward, data-efficient alignment strategy—fine-tuning with CHAIR-based preferences—can significantly mitigate hallucinations in MLLMs, avoiding complex synthetic data pipelines. Public code and models are provided.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

### [2] [SDiFL: Stable Diffusion-Driven Framework for Image Forgery Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20182)
*Yang Su,Shunquan Tan,Jiwu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel SD3-based multi-modal forgery localization framework that fuses forged residuals as an explicit modality in SD3's latent space, achieving significant gains and generalization to unseen data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address rapidly evolving image manipulation with limited annotated data, by leveraging the generative and perceptual capabilities of Stable Diffusion 3 to improve forgery localization.

Method: Theoretical conditioning of SD's multi-modal architecture on forgery information; treat high-frequency residuals from high-pass filters as a modality; fuse this into SD3 latent space during training; preserve latent features; evaluate on benchmarks including unseen real-world forgeries.

Result: Up to 12% performance improvement over state-of-the-art on standard datasets; strong generalization to real-world document forgeries and natural scenes, even when data were unseen during training.

Conclusion: SD3-based multi-modal fusion is effective for forensic localization, enabling efficient, accurate detection of forgeries and showing potential to counter emerging manipulation technologies with broader applicability.

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

### [3] [Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models with Quantitative Skin Attributes: A Retrieval Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20188)
*Max Torop,Masih Eskandar,Nicholas Kurtansky,Jinyang Liu,Jochen Weber,Octavia Camps,Veronica Rotemberg,Jennifer Dy,Kivanc Kose*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: This work investigates grounding multimodal language model embeddings in quantitative lesion attributes to improve interpretability in skin-disease diagnosis, via fine-tuning to predict attributes and evaluating with a content-based image retrieval case study on SLICE-3D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The interpretability gap in AI for dermatology; combining Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) with attribute-based reasoning could yield natural-language explanations grounded in measurable concepts (e.g., lesion area) that are predictive of malignancy.

Method: Fine-tune MLLMs to predict quantitative lesion attributes from images and ground the embedding space to these attributes. Evaluate grounding via an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

Result: Evidence is reported that MLLM embedding spaces can be grounded in the chosen attributes, demonstrated through a content-based image retrieval case study that leverages attribute predictions.

Conclusion: Grounding MLLM embeddings in quantitative lesion attributes is feasible and can enhance interpretability, making the combination of MLLMs with attribute-grounded reasoning a promising direction for clinically meaningful explanations in dermatology.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

### [4] [Enhancing Automatic Modulation Recognition With a Reconstruction-Driven Vision Transformer Under Limited Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20193)
*Hossein Ahmadi,Banafsheh Saffari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A unified ViT-based framework for AMR that jointly trains with supervised, self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives, achieving strong label-efficient performance on RML2018.01A and robustness across SNR.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AMR tasks suffer from reliance on large labeled datasets and multi-stage pipelines, limiting scalability and generalization. A unified, label-efficient approach that leverages rich learning signals could improve robustness and practicality.

Method: A Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder with a lightweight convolutional decoder and a linear classifier. A reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to originals to preserve fine-grained I/Q structure. Pretraining combines supervised, self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives; fine-tuning uses partial label supervision.

Result: On RML2018.01A, the approach surpasses supervised CNN and ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only 15–20% labeled data, and remains robust across varying SNR levels.

Conclusion: The framework offers a simple, generalizable, and label-efficient solution for AMR, with potential applicability to broader wireless signal understanding tasks.

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

### [5] [InfinityHuman: Towards Long-Term Audio-Driven Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20210)
*Xiaodi Li,Pan Xie,Yi Ren,Qijun Gan,Chen Zhang,Fangyuan Kong,Xiang Yin,Bingyue Peng,Zehuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfinityHuman presents a coarse-to-fine, audio-driven framework for high-resolution, long-duration, identity-preserving animations with improved hand motion and lip-sync by decoupling pose from appearance and introducing a pose-guided refiner and a hand-specific reward.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address error accumulation, identity drift, color shifts, and poor hand modeling that plague existing audio-driven animation methods, especially for long videos.

Method: A two-stage pipeline: (1) generate audio-synchronized representations (coarse) and (2) refine to high resolution with a pose-guided refiner that uses stable poses and the initial frame as an anchor; introduces a hand-specific reward trained on high-quality hand data to improve gesture realism.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync on EMTD and HDTF datasets; ablations validate each module; code will be released.

Conclusion: A robust, long-duration, high-fidelity audio-driven animation system that decouples pose from appearance, stabilizes temporal drift, and improves hand gesture realism, with public release of the code.

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

### [6] [Spherical Vision Transformers for Audio-Visual Saliency Prediction in 360-Degree Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20221)
*Mert Cokelek,Halit Ozsoy,Nevrez Imamoglu,Cagri Ozcinar,Inci Ayhan,Erkut Erdem,Aykut Erdem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV for 360-degree saliency prediction in omnidirectional videos, presenting a new YT360-EyeTracking dataset and showing audio-augmented, spherical-geometry-aware transformers outperform baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the gap in comprehensive 360-degree audiovisual saliency data and the challenge of spherical distortion, aiming to leverage spatial audio to improve gaze prediction in VR/360° content.

Method: Proposes SalViT360, a vision-transformer model with spherical geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention; introduces SalViT360-AV, an audio-conditioned variant using transformer adapters guided by audio input; curates YT360-EyeTracking dataset with 81 omnidirectional videos under varied audio-visual conditions.

Result: Empirically outperforms existing saliency prediction methods on multiple benchmarks, including the new YT360-EyeTracking dataset, indicating the benefit of integrating spatial audio cues.

Conclusion: Integrating spatial audio cues is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in 360-degree videos; code and dataset will be released to support future research.

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at
https://cyberiada.github.io/SalViT360.

### [7] [A Novel Framework for Automated Explain Vision Model Using Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20227)
*Phu-Vinh Nguyen,Tan-Hanh Pham,Chris Ngo,Truong Son Hy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a Vision-Language Model–driven pipeline to explain vision models at both sample- and dataset-levels, addressing explainability gaps and enabling discovery of failure cases with minimal effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current xAI work mostly explains model behavior on a per-sample basis and emphasizes performance metrics like accuracy, IoU, and mAP. There is a need to understand general model behavior across diverse images to prevent biased judgments and to guide development, particularly as Vision-Language Models become more prevalent.

Method: Introduce a pipeline that leverages Vision-Language Models to produce explanations at both the sample level and the dataset level. The approach aims to uncover failure cases and summarize model behavior across datasets with minimal manual effort, integrating xAI analysis into the vision-model development workflow.

Result: A pipeline that can reveal general model behavior, identify failure modes, and provide dataset-wide insights with minimal effort, enabling closer integration between vision-model development and xAI analysis.

Conclusion: The approach extends xAI for vision models by combining sample- and dataset-level explanations through Vision-Language Models, aiding bias detection, trend analysis, and more informed development of image analysis systems.

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

*Mohamed Ohamouddou,Said Ohamouddou,Abdellatif El Afia,Rafik Lasri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ATMS-KD combines adaptive temperature scheduling and mixed-sample augmentation to distill knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher into lightweight CNNs for Damascena rose maturity classification. It achieves 97.11% on the compact model (vs 95-96% with direct training; ~1.6 percentage points better than the second-best baseline) with 72.19 ms latency and >99% knowledge retention, outperforming 11 known KD methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable high-accuracy, low-latency plant maturity classification on devices in resource-constrained agricultural environments by transferring knowledge from a strong teacher to lightweight student CNNs.

Method: Proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge Distillation), which uses adaptive temperature scheduling and mixed-sample augmentation to distill knowledge from MobileNetV3 Large into three lightweight students (Compact 1.3M, Standard 2.4M, Enhanced 3.8M) evaluated on the Rosa damascena maturity dataset collected from farms in Morocco, and compared against direct training and 11 KD baselines.

Result: All student models achieved validation accuracies >96.7% with ATMS-KD (vs 95–96% with direct training). The compact model reached 97.11% accuracy, the highest among baselines, with the lowest inference latency of 72.19 ms. Knowledge retention rates exceeded 99% for all configurations.

Conclusion: ATMS-KD effectively transfers knowledge to lightweight CNNs in agricultural CV, delivering high accuracy, robustness to field conditions, and computational efficiency, and outperforming multiple KD baselines.

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

### [9] [Linking heterogeneous microstructure informatics with expert characterization knowledge through customized and hybrid vision-language representations for industrial qualification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20243)
*Mutahar Safdar,Gentry Wood,Max Zimmermann,Guy Lamouche,Priti Wanjara,Yaoyao Fiona Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A framework that fuses microstructure imagery with expert textual knowledge through customized vision-language representations (FLAVA/CLIP) to perform zero-shot qualification of additively manufactured metal matrix composites, using a hybrid similarity score and z-score normalization to enable human-in-the-loop decisions without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Qualification of advanced materials (especially heterogeneous, non-conventional AM structures) is slow and brittle, needing rapid, reliable, and interpretable methods that bridge raw microstructure data with expert knowledge. The work targets semantic interoperability between visuals and textual assessments to enable scalable, domain-adaptable classification.

Method: Combine deep semantic segmentation with pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP, FLAVA) to encode visual microstructure data and textual expert assessments into shared representations. Build a customized similarity-based representation that uses both positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and texts. Use net similarity scoring for zero-shot classification on unseen microstructures. Apply z-score normalization to unimodal and cross-modal similarities to align local distributions. Evaluate on an additive-manufactured metal matrix composite dataset, comparing FLAVA vs CLIP and demonstrating human-in-the-loop decision support without retraining.

Result: The approach distinguishes acceptable vs defective samples across criteria, with FLAVA showing higher visual sensitivity and CLIP providing consistent alignment with textual criteria. Normalized similarity improves alignment and classification in the hybrid framework. The method enhances traceability and interpretability, enabling human-in-the-loop decisions without task-specific retraining, and contributes to domain-adaptive qualification strategies.

Conclusion: Hybrid vision-language representations, augmented by customized similarity scoring and dataset-driven normalization, can bridge raw microstructure data and expert knowledge to support scalable, interpretable material qualification without extensive model retraining.

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

### [10] [MedNet-PVS: A MedNeXt-Based Deep Learning Model for Automated Segmentation of Perivascular Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20256)
*Zhen Xuen Brandon Low,Rory Zhang,Hang Min,William Pham,Lucy Vivash,Jasmine Moses,Miranda Lynch,Karina Dorfman,Cassandra Marotta,Shaun Koh,Jacob Bunyamin,Ella Rowsthorn,Alex Jarema,Himashi Peiris,Zhaolin Chen,Sandy R. Shultz,David K. Wright,Dexiao Kong,Sharon L. Naismith,Terence J. O'Brien,Ying Xia,Meng Law,Benjamin Sinclair*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transformer-based MedNeXt-L-k5 adapted for automated PVS segmentation; strong performance on homogeneous T2w data but limited generalization to heterogeneous T1w data; did not surpass nnU-Net.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual PVS segmentation is time-consuming and unreliable; need robust automated methods that generalize across MRI datasets.

Method: Two experiments with MedNeXt-L-k5: (1) 200 T2w scans from HCP-Aging; 5-fold CV; LOSOCV. (2) 40 heterogeneous T1w scans from seven studies across six scanners.

Result: T2w: voxel Dice 0.88 ±0.06 (WM), comparable to inter-rater reliability; highest reported. T1w: 0.58 ±0.09. LOSOCV voxel Dice: 0.38 ±0.16 (WM), 0.35 ±0.12 (BG); cluster Dice: 0.61 ±0.19 (WM), 0.62 ±0.21 (BG). MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform nnU-Net.

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5 offers an efficient automated PVS segmentation across diverse datasets but attention-based transformers may not be necessary; cross-dataset heterogeneity challenges persist; potential utility as an alternative to nnU-Net.

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

### [11] [Plug-in Feedback Self-adaptive Attention in CLIP for Training-free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20265)
*Zhixiang Chi,Yanan Wu,Li Gu,Huan Liu,Ziqiang Wang,Yang Zhang,Yang Wang,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-free, plug-in framework enhances open-vocabulary segmentation by feeding output-level semantic cues back to intermediate attention, achieving better localization and cross-modal coherence across backbones and attention types.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP yields strong visual-textual alignment but struggles with open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization and semantic gaps between intermediate attention and final predictions; current coherence in intermediate layers does not translate to outputs.

Method: A feedback-driven self-adaptive framework that transfers output-based patch-level correspondences back to intermediate attention without training. Key modules: attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and adaptation ensemble. It acts as a plug-in that integrates into multiple SOTA approaches (ViT-B/L/H) and supports various attention types (Q-K, self-self, Proxy) with MAE, SAM, and DINO.

Result: Consistent performance gains across eight benchmarks when integrated as a plug-in into four SOTA methods, under different backbones and attention types.

Conclusion: The proposed training-free feedback mechanism bridges the gap between final predictions and internal representations, improving semantic consistency and localization in CLIP-based open-vocabulary segmentation without extra training.

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

### [12] [How Multimodal LLMs Solve Image Tasks: A Lens on Visual Grounding, Task Reasoning, and Answer Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20279)
*Zhuoran Yu,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Probes reveal a consistent stage-wise layer organization in MLLMs: early layers ground visuals, middle layers handle lexical/semantic processing, and late layers tailor outputs; this structure is robust to several prompt- and data-variations but layer allocation shifts with different base architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To uncover internal processing dynamics of multimodal LLMs by mapping layer-specific functions and how they adapt across prompts and models.

Method: Train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories from per-layer token embeddings using a fixed anchor question; evaluate robustness with three prompt variations (lexical, semantic negation, output format); analyze across LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL.

Result: A consistent stage-wise structure emerges: early layers perform visual grounding, middle layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers prepare task-specific outputs. This organization remains stable across variations in visual tokenization, instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, but the exact layer-to-stage allocation shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture.

Conclusion: Offers a lightweight, model-agnostic framework for analyzing multimodal representation dynamics and provides a unified perspective on how MLLMs layer-organization maps to function.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

### [13] [Disentangling Latent Embeddings with Sparse Linear Concept Subspaces (SLiCS)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20322)
*Zhi Li,Hau Phan,Matthew Emigh,Austin J. Brockmeier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: We propose SLiCS, a supervised dictionary learning framework that decomposes CLIP-like embeddings into concept-specific, non-negative subspaces via a group-structured dictionary. This allows sparse, interpretable combinations of atoms per label, enabling precise concept-filtered retrieval, zero-shot labeling, and even guided generation across multiple embedding spaces (including TiTok and DINOv2). The method guarantees convergence through alternating optimization and demonstrates superior retrieval precision both quantitatively and qualitatively.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-language embeddings (e.g., CLIP) encode semantic content but are entangled and hard to interpret in terms of individual concepts. A disentangled, concept-wise decomposition could improve downstream tasks such as targeted retrieval and conditional generation, and enable zero-shot leveraging text embeddings for labels.

Method: Learn a linear synthesis model with a group-structured dictionary where concept-specific components are sparse, non-negative combinations of atoms belonging to a label group. Optimize via an alternating procedure with convergence guarantees. Use text co-embeddings to identify semantically meaningful descriptions by matching to a concept's atom group, and perform unsupervised dictionary learning to enable zero-shot, instance-wise multi-labels. Apply SLiCS to various embeddings, including highly-compressed autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the DINOv2 latent space. Evaluate concept-filtered image retrieval and qualitative generation.

Result: Disentangled embeddings (SLiCS) yield more precise concept-filtered image retrieval across embeddings, with both quantitative and qualitative gains. The approach supports zero-shot labeling and improves interpretability of the latent space by aligning concept subspaces with labels.

Conclusion: SLiCS provides a principled, convergent framework to learn concept-specific subspaces within vision-language embeddings, enabling precise, semantically-driven retrieval and generation. Its applicability across diverse embedding spaces and its alignment with text embeddings make it a versatile tool for interpretable multimodal representation learning.

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

*Xiao Li,Yanfan Zhu,Ruining Deng,Wei-Qi Wei,Yu Wang,Shilin Zhao,Yaohong Wang,Haichun Yang,Yuankai Huo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedFoundationHub offers an offline, privacy-preserving GUI platform to deploy medical VLMs with plug-and-play Hugging Face models, evaluated by clinicians; shows promise for accessible deployment but current models have recurring issues (off-target responses, vague reasoning, inconsistent pathology terminology).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address security/privacy risks and accessibility barriers of medical vision-language models in clinical and research settings; enable non-programmer clinicians to select/use models and support engineers in deployment.

Method: Develop MedFoundationHub GUI; Docker-based, OS-agnostic; offline local workstation with a single NVIDIA A6000; supports Hugging Face models; evaluation by board-certified pathologists on colon and renal cases; 1015 clinician-model scoring events; five models tested: Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B.

Result: Expert evaluation revealed recurring limitations: off-target answers, vague reasoning, and inconsistent pathology terminology.

Conclusion: MedFoundationHub demonstrates a secure, accessible deployment pathway for medical VLMs; however significant model limitations persist, highlighting the need for improved model reliability and additional safeguards for clinical use.

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

### [15] [Enhancing Mamba Decoder with Bidirectional Interaction in Multi-Task Dense Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20376)
*Mang Cao,Sanping Zhou,Yizhe Li,Ye Deng,Wenli Huang,Le Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BIM introduces Bidirectional Interaction Scan (BI-Scan) and Multi-Scale Scan (MS-Scan) to enable efficient, bidirectional cross-task interaction for multi-task dense prediction, achieving state-of-the-art performance with linear-complexity architecture on NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sufficient cross-task interaction is essential for dense prediction quality, but existing methods suffer from high computational cost when maximizing interaction. The work aims to preserve critical cross-task information while maintaining computational efficiency.

Method: Propose Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM) framework with two mechanisms: (1) BI-Scan that constructs task-specific representations as bidirectional sequences using task-first and position-first scanning modes within a unified linear-complexity architecture; (2) MS-Scan that enables multi-granularity scene modeling to capture diverse task granularity. The approach extends the Mamba modeling paradigm to multi-task dense prediction.

Result: Extensive experiments on NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context demonstrate BIM's superiority versus state-of-the-art competitors.

Conclusion: BI-Scan and MS-Scan together deliver an efficient, effective cross-task interaction framework for multi-task dense prediction, achieving high performance with linear complexity and broad granu-larity coverage across tasks; promising for generalization to other multi-task dense prediction settings.

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

### [16] [Audio-Guided Visual Editing with Complex Multi-Modal Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20379)
*Hyeonyu Kim,Seokhoon Jeong,Seonghee Han,Chanhyuk Choi,Taehwan Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An audio-guided diffusion-based visual editing framework enabling complex multi-prompts edits without extra training by aligning a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with the diffusion prompt space and using separate noise branching plus adaptive patch selection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-only guidance struggles with complex edits and existing audio-guided methods require task-specific training, hindering real-world generalization. The work aims for zero-shot, multi-modal editing without additional training.

Method: Leverages a pre-trained multi-modal encoder to inject audio into the visual edit process and aligns its space with the diffusion model's prompt encoder. Introduces separate noise branching and adaptive patch selection to manage multiple, multimodal prompts.

Result: Extensive experiments show improved handling of complex editing scenarios by incorporating audio information, outperforming text-only approaches and demonstrating strong generalization across diverse tasks.

Conclusion: Audio-guided visual editing with diffusion models can effectively address complex edits using multi-modal prompts in a zero-shot setting, offering robust improvements over text-only methods and broad real-world applicability.

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

### [17] [More Reliable Pseudo-labels, Better Performance: A Generalized Approach to Single Positive Multi-label Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20381)
*Luong Tran,Thieu Vo,Anh Nguyen,Sang Dinh,Van Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes GPR Loss and DAMP within the AEVLP framework to robustly learn from partially annotated multi-label images, achieving state-of-the-art results on four benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-label learning with partial annotations is costly; in Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), only one positive label is provided per image. Treating missing labels as unknown or negative leads to inaccuracies and false negatives, and pseudo-labeling can introduce noise. There is a need for a robust learning strategy that can leverage diverse pseudo-labels while mitigating noise.

Method: Introduce Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss) to handle diverse pseudo-labels and suppress noise, and a Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) scheme. These are integrated into the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling (AEVLP) framework.

Result: Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate significant improvements in multi-label classification, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: GPR Loss and DAMP within the AEVLP framework provide effective, noise-robust learning from partially annotated data, enabling high-performance multi-label classification with reduced labeling effort.

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

*Chengjun Zhang,Yuhao Zhang,Jie Yang,Mohamad Sawan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a delay-spike mechanism and a temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron to improve ANN-SNN conversion for visual detection at ultra-low latency (≤5 time-steps), achieving state-of-the-art results on object detection and lane line detection while preserving energy efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address residual membrane potential and temporal heterogeneity in spike patterns that arise during ANN-SNN conversion, which harms detection performance and requires more time steps.

Method: Introduce a delay-spike mechanism to mitigate residual membrane potential from heterogeneous spiking patterns. Propose tdIF neurons that adjust accumulation/firing based on the temporal order of time-steps, enabling temporal property diversity beyond frequency-based coding while maintaining energy efficiency.

Result: Outperforms existing ANN-SNN conversion methods on visual detection tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low latency, within 5 time-steps.

Conclusion: tdIF enables more precise feature representation at very low time-steps, delivering high performance and ultra-low latency for detection tasks without increasing energy consumption.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

*Yuqi Xiong,Wuzhen Shi,Yang Wen,Ruhan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dynamic uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network (DUP-MCRNet) for salient object detection improves edge clarity and robustness by dynamic uncertainty graph convolution and cross-modal fusion across RGB, depth, and edge features, with uncertainty-guided supervision; achieves strong performance on benchmarks; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing SOD methods tend to lose fine details, blur edges, and fail to fuse multi-modal information effectively in complex scenes. There is a need for dynamic uncertainty propagation and cross-modal collaboration to enhance edge preservation and robust saliency in challenging conditions (occlusion, weak textures, clutter).

Method: 1) Dynamic uncertainty graph convolution (DUGC): propagates uncertainty across layers via a sparse graph built from spatial semantic distance, combined with channel-adaptive interaction to boost small structure and edge detection. 2) Multimodal collaborative fusion (MCF): learnable modality gating weights fuse RGB, depth, and edge attention maps, dynamically adjusting modality importance per scene to suppress noise and enhance cross-modal consistency. 3) Training with multi-scale BCE and IoU losses, cross-scale consistency constraints, and uncertainty-guided supervision to optimize pixel- and region-level performance.

Result: Extensive experiments show DUP-MCRNet outperforms competing SOD methods on common benchmarks, notably in edge clarity and robustness against complex backgrounds.

Conclusion: The proposed framework effectively enhances saliency detection by advancing edge preservation and cross-modal reasoning, delivering strong performance gains and demonstrating robustness; code is publicly available.

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSMVD uses multi-scale BEV features and a feature pyramid network to handle scale variations across views in MVPD, achieving higher MODA on GMVD.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current MVPD methods struggle with pedestrians at varying scales across views due to insufficient multi-scale BEV feature representations.

Method: Generate multi-scale BEV features by projecting scale-specific image features from each view into BEV space, scale-by-scale, then fuse these features across scales and views with a feature pyramid network.

Result: Experiments show significant performance gains; MSMVD outperforms the previous highest MODA by 4.5 points on the GMVD dataset.

Conclusion: Exploiting multi-scale image features via scale-aware BEV representations improves MVPD performance and robustness to inter-view scale variations.

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

TL;DR: A lightweight real-time deepfake detector (SFMFNet) that integrates spatial-frequency hybrid aware module, token-selective cross-attention, and blur pooling to achieve high accuracy with low latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time deepfake detection is hampered by heavy detector computations; there is a need for efficient, accurate solutions for real-world applications like video conferencing and social media.

Method: Introduce SFMFNet, featuring a spatial-frequency hybrid aware module with a gated mechanism, token-selective cross-attention for efficient multi-level feature interaction, and a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure to preserve semantic cues during downsampling.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency, with strong generalization and practical value for real-time deployment.

Conclusion: SFMFNet provides a practical, efficient solution for real-time deepfake detection, maintaining accuracy and generalization while enabling real-time deployment; suitable for real-world systems.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

*Ayaka Tsutsumi,Guang Li,Ren Togo,Takahiro Ogawa,Satoshi Kondo,Miki Haseyama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight dual-model weight selection framework with self-knowledge distillation improves medical image classification under resource constraints, using weights from a large pretrained model and SKD for robust fine-tuning across X-ray, CT, and MRI datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical deployments are constrained by computational resources; there is a need for compact models that retain high performance. Conventional lightweight methods often lose critical information; combining dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation could preserve accuracy while remaining efficient.

Method: Two lightweight models are initialized with weights derived from a large pretrained model (dual-model weight selection). Self-knowledge distillation is applied to these models to exploit diverse initial weight configurations with low additional cost, followed by task-specific fine-tuning for chest X-ray, lung CT, and brain MRI classification.

Result: Experiments on publicly available datasets show superior performance and robustness of the proposed approach compared to existing methods, indicating effective preservation of information in compact models and suitability for resource-constrained clinical settings.

Conclusion: The combination of dual-model weight selection and SKD provides a viable path to deploy accurate, efficient medical image classifiers in practice, addressing the performance-efficiency trade-off in compact models.

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: A two-module LiDAR compression framework that re-densifies sparse geometry and propagates features across scales, achieving state-of-the-art compression and real-time performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-precision LiDAR scans incur heavy storage/transmission costs; extreme sparsity impedes context modeling; prior octree/voxel-based methods struggle to capture details efficiently.

Method: Geometry Re-Densification Module re-densifies sparse geometry to extract features at a denser scale and re-sparsify for predictive coding; Cross-scale Feature Propagation Module uses occupancy cues across resolutions to guide hierarchical feature propagation and sharing, reducing redundant feature extraction.

Result: On KITTI, achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios and real-time performance, 26 FPS for encoding/decoding at 12-bit quantization; code available.

Conclusion: The two-module framework delivers efficient predictive coding with compact features, boosting compression and speed for LiDAR point-cloud coding, enabling real-time applications.

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

Motivation: To enhance pixel-level context and preserve information across network stages, thereby improving perception and decision-making in complex, adversarial driving scenarios.

Method: Introduce SKGE-Swin architecture with Swin Transformer SW-MSA and skip-stage connections to maintain multi-level features; evaluate on CARLA under adversarial scenarios; perform ablation studies to assess contributions of skip connections and the Swin Transformer.

Conclusion: SKGE-Swin effectively leverages global and multi-level features through skip-stage connections and Swin Transformer to improve end-to-end driving performance; planned ablation will further quantify component contributions.

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip
connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model
performance.

*Xiaochuan Li,Guoguang Du,Runze Zhang,Liang Jin,Qi Jia,Lihua Lu,Zhenhua Guo,Yaqian Zhao,Haiyang Liu,Tianqi Wang,Changsheng Li,Xiaoli Gong,Rengang Li,Baoyu Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video dataset with multi-view annotations, to train Droplet3D—a generative model that supports image and dense text input for 3D asset creation. The approach leverages video priors to achieve spatially consistent and semantically plausible 3D content, with potential scene-level extension; resources released open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D data scarcity on the web hampers scalable, data-driven 3D generation. Videos naturally provide commonsense priors—spatial consistency across viewpoints and rich semantic cues—that can supervise and guide 3D asset creation, enabling improvements in fidelity and generalization.

Method: Create Droplet3D-4M, a large-scale video dataset with multi-view annotations; train Droplet3D to generate 3D assets conditioned on both images and dense text prompts; enforce view-consistency and semantic alignment through learning from videos; evaluate spatial coherence and semantic fidelity; discuss extension to scene-level generation; release dataset, code, and model weights.

Result: Experiments demonstrate spatially consistent across-view generation and semantic plausibility aligned with prompts; improved 3D fidelity compared to baseline approaches; dataset and model show potential for extending from object-level to scene-level generation; resources publicly released.

Conclusion: Video priors from large-scale videos effectively mitigate data scarcity in 3D generation, enabling scalable, text- and image-guided 3D asset creation. The Droplet framework and Droplet3D-4M dataset present a promising direction with public resources to accelerate community research and development, including future scene-level applications.

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,
and model weights: https://dropletx.github.io/.

Conclusion: Unified perception holds promise for more robust and efficient autonomous perception; the survey outlines a clear research agenda and framework to advance the field.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,

*Jiusi Li,Jackson Jiang,Jinyu Miao,Miao Long,Tuopu Wen,Peijin Jia,Shengxiang Liu,Chunlei Yu,Maolin Liu,Yuzhan Cai,Kun Jiang,Mengmeng Yang,Diange Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: G^2Editor enables photorealistic, pose-precise editing of driving scene objects by injecting a 3D Gaussian prior into a diffusion-based denoising process, coupled with scene-level occlusion handling and hierarchical appearance guidance, outperforming prior methods on Waymo data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Generate diverse, realistic corner-case driving scenarios without risky real-world data collection; existing approaches (3D Gaussian Splatting, image generators) struggle with visual fidelity and precise pose control.

Method: Represent the edited object as a 3D Gaussian prior; inject into the denoising process to enforce pose accuracy and spatial consistency; use a scene-level 3D bounding box layout to reconstruct occluded non-targets; provide hierarchical fine-grained features as conditioning to guide appearance details during generation.

Result: On Waymo Open Dataset, G^2Editor supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a unified framework; superior pose controllability and visual quality compared to baselines; shows benefits to downstream data-driven tasks.

Conclusion: G^2Editor delivers photorealistic, pose-precise object edits in driving videos with robust occlusion handling and detailed appearance control, enabling effective data augmentation and scenario generation for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

### [28] [COMETH: Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and Tracking of Humans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20920)
*Enrico Martini,Ho Jin Choi,Nadia Figueroa,Nicola Bombieri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COMETH is a lightweight, real-time multi-view human pose fusion algorithm that uses convex optimization, kinematic/biomechanical constraints, inverse kinematics for spatial fusion, and a state observer for temporal consistency, enabling scalable edge-based tracking with improved localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. Code is publicly available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In Industry 5.0 contexts, monitoring human activity is crucial for ergonomic safety and well-being. While multi-camera setups improve pose accuracy, they incur high computational and bandwidth costs, hindering scalability and real-time use. Edge-based distribution can help, but resource constraints degrade accuracy and create temporal/spatial inconsistencies.

Method: COMETH integrates three concepts: (1) convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion, (2) incorporation of kinematic and biomechanical constraints to improve joint positioning, and (3) a state observer to enhance temporal consistency. The approach aims for real-time performance on distributed edge devices and reduced bandwidth.

Result: Evaluations on public and industrial datasets show COMETH outperforms state-of-the-art methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy, while remaining lightweight and suitable for real-time, scalable human motion tracking. The approach is demonstrated as practical for industrial and safety-critical applications.

Conclusion: COMETH provides an accurate, scalable fusion pipeline for multi-view human motion tracking, suitable for Industry 5.0 safety-critical contexts, with publicly available code for reproducibility.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/PARCO-LAB/COMETH.

*Marina Grifell i Plana,Vladyslav Zalevskyi,Léa Schmidt,Yvan Gomez,Thomas Sanchez,Vincent Dunet,Mériam Koob,Vanessa Siffredi,Meritxell Bach Cuadra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pathology-informed domain randomization with synthetic CCD-like brain alterations improves fetal brain segmentation in rare CCD cases, enabling accurate biomarkers with limited annotated pathologies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CCD is rare, leading to scarce annotated data and poor generalization of segmentation models. The work aims to improve segmentation robustness for CCD while preserving performance on healthy and other pathologies.

Method: A pathology-informed domain randomization pipeline generates synthetic pathological brain variations from healthy fetal data by embedding prior knowledge of CCD manifestations. This data augmentation enables robust segmentation without requiring pathological annotations. The model is evaluated on a cohort of 248 healthy fetuses, 26 CCD cases, and 47 with other pathologies.

Result: The proposed approach yields substantial improvements on CCD cases while maintaining performance on healthy and other pathologies. LCC error drops from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in healthy cases, and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Biomarkers such as corpus callosum length and volume are accurately derived, aiding CCD subtype discrimination. The method also improves topological consistency of segmentations.

Conclusion: Incorporating domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant brain malformations.

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

### [30] [Towards Inclusive Communication: A Unified LLM-Based Framework for Sign Language, Lip Movements, and Audio Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20476)
*Jeong Hun Yeo,Hyeongseop Rha,Sungjune Park,Junil Won,Yong Man Ro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a unified, modality-agnostic framework to process sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation, achieving state-of-the-art or on-par performance across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR; lip modeling as a separate modality notably boosts SLT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the accessibility gap in ASR for deaf/hard-of-hearing individuals and the need to unify heterogeneous inputs (sign language, lip movements, audio) within a single framework to exploit cross-modal synergies.

Method: Develops a unified architecture capable of handling diverse input modalities (sign language, lip movements, audio) in a modality-agnostic way, treating lip movements as a separate modality to study their contribution, and evaluating on SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR tasks to compare with task-specific models.

Result: The framework achieves performance on par with, or better than, state-of-the-art models specialized for each task (SLT, VSR, ASR, AVSR); explicit modeling of lip movements as a distinct modality significantly improves SLT performance.

Conclusion: A unified multimodal framework can effectively integrate sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation, with lip movements providing notable benefits for SLT; this supports cross-modal synergy and motivates further unified architectures.

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

*Wei Li,Renshan Zhang,Rui Shao,Jie He,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CogVLA introduces a cognition-aligned VLA framework with a 3-stage architecture (EFA-Routing, LFP-Routing, CAttn) that uses instruction-driven routing and token sparsification to improve efficiency and performance. It achieves state-of-the-art results on LIBERO and real-world robotics with lower training cost and latency, and is open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce the heavy post-training and computational overhead of existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained VLMs, enabling scalable deployment and real-time use by aligning cognition and enabling sparsity.

Method: A 3-stage progressive architecture: (1) Encoder-FiLM based Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instructions into the vision encoder to create an instruction-aware latent by selectively aggregating/compressing dual-stream visual tokens; (2) LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing) prunes instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens in the LLM using action intent to achieve token-level sparsity; (3) V-L-A Coupled Attention (CAttn) combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional action parallel decoding to ensure coherent action generation from compressed inputs.

Result: Empirical results show state-of-the-art performance on LIBERO (unspecified metrics here in abstract, but cited as 97.4% success) and real-world robotic tasks (70.0% success); training costs reduced by 2.5x and inference latency reduced by 2.8x relative to OpenVLA.

Conclusion: CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available, demonstrating efficiency and performance gains with a scalable, cognition-aligned approach to VLA.

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold
compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at

*Yuan Xie,Tianshui Chen,Zheng Ge,Lionel Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-MTR introduces a multi-turn reinforced reasoning framework for long-form video understanding that iteratively selects video segments and comprehends questions, trained end-to-end with a gated bi-level reward to outperform static models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-form videos contain long-range dependencies and multiple events; existing approaches rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs) and are not end-to-end trainable.

Method: Propose Video-MTR: reinforced multi-turn reasoning that iteratively selects video segments based on evolving understanding and the current question. Introduces a gated bi-level reward (trajectory-level: answer correctness; turn-level: frame-query relevance) for end-to-end optimization without external VLMs.

Result: Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, and EgoSchema show Video-MTR achieves higher accuracy and efficiency than existing methods, advancing the state-of-the-art in long-form video understanding.

Conclusion: Video-MTR enables end-to-end, iterative video reasoning with a bi-level reward, effectively handling long-range dependencies and improving performance on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

*Zixuan Hu,Dongxiao Li,Xinzhu Ma,Shixiang Tang,Xiaotong Li,Wenhan Yang,Ling-Yu Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A test-time adaptation framework (DUO) for monocular 3D object detection that jointly minimizes semantic and geometric uncertainties via a convex-structured focal loss and a semantic-aware normal field constraint, improving robustness under domain shift.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Monocular 3D object detection suffers from reliability drops under real-world domain shifts due to environmental and sensor variations. Existing TTA methods link uncertainty to generalization but fail to address both semantic ambiguity and unstable geometry, which jointly degrade detection performance.

Method: Introduce Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO) with a dual-branch design: (1) a convex-structured focal loss with an unsupervised, label-agnostic uncertainty weighting to prioritize high-uncertainty objects; (2) a semantic-aware normal field constraint that enforces geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues. The two branches form a complementary loop where improved spatial perception aids semantic classification and robust semantics refine spatial understanding, enabling test-time adaptation without extra labels.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate that DUO outperforms existing TTA methods across multiple datasets and domain shift types for monocular 3D object detection.

Conclusion: DUO is the first TTA framework to jointly minimize semantic and geometric uncertainties in M3OD, offering robust performance under real-world domain shifts through a dual-branch, complementary optimization strategy.

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces CaddieSet, a dataset linking golf swing joints and ball trajectories. It segments a single swing into eight phases, defines 15 expert-driven swing metrics, and shows feasibility of trajectory prediction with interpretable models, enabling domain-consistent swing feedback.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantitatively linking swing posture to ball trajectory and providing actionable, interpretable feedback, addressing the lack of quantitative relationships in prior deep-learning golf swing studies.

Method: Create CaddieSet, extract joint information from a single swing video by CV-based segmentation into eight swing phases, define 15 swing-related metrics from golf-domain knowledge, and evaluate using benchmarks with a focus on interpretable models.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility of predicting ball trajectories with CaddieSet across benchmarks; interpretable models using the proposed features yield swing feedback consistent with established domain knowledge.

Conclusion: CaddieSet offers a new resource and methodology for golf swing analysis, with potential impact for academia and the sports industry.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

*Xuanming Cao,Chengyu Tao,Yifeng Cheng,Juan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAENet proposes an importance-aware ensemble of 2D and 3D experts for 3D surface anomaly detection, with a dynamic IAF module and specialized losses, achieving state-of-the-art on MVTec 3D-AD with lower false positives.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D point-cloud anomaly detection lacks strong pretrained backbones compared to 2D, hindering performance. Combining 2D and 3D experts could boost accuracy, but naive fusion risks degraded performance if a modality underperforms.

Method: IAENet ensembles a 2D pretrained expert and a 3D expert. The core is the Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically weighs each source's anomaly scores. Custom loss functions guide IAF optimization to preserve each source's strengths while leveraging their complementary information.

Result: On MVTec 3D-AD, IAENet achieves state-of-the-art performance with a markedly lower false positive rate, demonstrating practical value for industrial deployment.

Conclusion: Dynamic, importance-aware fusion of cross-modal 2D/3D experts effectively improves 3D surface anomaly detection, offering a robust, deployable solution for manufacturing QA.

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

TL;DR: DescriptiveEdit is a descriptive-prompt-based editing framework that reframes instruction-based image editing as reference-image-based text-to-image generation, using a Cross-Attentive UNet to inject reference image features, achieving better editing accuracy and scalability on Emu Edit.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inversion-based editing introduces reconstruction errors, while instruction-based editing suffers from limited dataset quality and scale. A scalable, architecture-free approach that leverages well-trained T2I models is desirable.

Method: Input: a reference image and a prompt. The model uses a Cross-Attentive UNet with attention bridges to inject reference-image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process, effectively performing text-to-image editing. It is compatible with and can integrate with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other extensions, without requiring architectural changes or inversions.

Result: On the Emu Edit benchmark, DescriptiveEdit improves editing accuracy and consistency compared with prior methods.

Conclusion: DescriptiveEdit overcomes key limitations of inversion- and instruction-based editing, offering a scalable, plug-and-play solution that preserves the generative power of T2I models and integrates with existing extensions.

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

### [37] [DCFS: Continual Test-Time Adaptation via Dual Consistency of Feature and Sample](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20516)
*Wenting Yin,Han Sun,Xinru Meng,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCFS proposes a continual test-time adaptation framework that uses dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning to reduce pseudo-label noise without source data access.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In CTTA, models adapt to a stream of target-domain data without source data, but relying solely on target features can cause confusion and bias. Pseudo-labels from predictions can be noisy and lead to error accumulation.

Method: DCFS disentangles target features into semantic-related and domain-related components via dual classifiers, enforcing consistency between sub-features and the full feature. It also introduces an adaptive threshold to compute a confidence score per sample and uses loss-weighted self-supervised learning to mitigate pseudo-label noise.

Result: Validated on CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C with consistent performance improvements across continual test-time adaptation scenarios (experimental results reported, though specific numbers are not provided in the abstract).

Conclusion: DCFS effectively reduces pseudo-label noise and error accumulation in CTTA by feature disentanglement and confidence-aware learning, yielding robust continual adaptation across multiple corrupted-domain benchmarks.

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

### [38] [Adam SLAM - the last mile of camera calibration with 3DGS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20526)
*Matthieu Gendrin,Stéphane Pateux,Xiaoran Jiang,Théo Ladune,Luce Morin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Differentiable calibration refinement using a 3DGS-based backprop of novel-view color loss yields ≈0.4 dB PSNR gain on a reference dataset, at the cost of longer training time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calibration accuracy is crucial for evaluating progress in novel view synthesis; 1-pixel calibration error can severely degrade reconstruction quality. With no ground-truth for real scenes, calibration quality is judged by the quality of the synthesized views, motivating end-to-end optimization of camera parameters.

Method: Use a 3DGS model to backpropagate the color loss of novel views with respect to camera parameters, effectively fine-tuning the calibration in a differentiable end-to-end manner, evaluated on reference scenes such as Mip-NeRF 360.

Result: The calibrated cameras achieved an average improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the reference dataset used by 3DGS.

Conclusion: Differentiable calibration refinement via novel-view loss can meaningfully improve synthesis quality, though the process can be time-consuming; it is particularly valuable for calibrating reference scenes where view quality is paramount.

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

*Jingyun Yang,Guoqing Zhang,Jingge Wang,Yang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An active, sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection improves GTV segmentation with fewer labels, outperforming existing ADA methods; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical image labeling is time-consuming; ADA often picks samples far from source causing negative transfer; access to source data is often limited; multi-modal query strategies remain underexplored.

Method: An active and sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection in ADA, deriving a query strategy that prioritizes labeling and training on the most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.

Result: Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks shows favorable segmentation performance and significant improvement over state-of-the-art ADA methods.

Conclusion: Dynamic, informative, and representative sampling in ADA for multi-modal medical data reduces annotation burden and yields better segmentation, with code available.

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

### [40] [Enhancing Pseudo-Boxes via Data-Level LiDAR-Camera Fusion for Unsupervised 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20530)
*Mingqian Ji,Jian Yang,Shanshan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A data-level fusion framework for unsupervised 3D object detection that fuses RGB-derived cues with LiDAR at an early stage, using bi-directional fusion, targeted filtering, and dynamic self-evolution to refine pseudo-boxes, achieving strong nuScenes mAP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeling 3D data is labor-intensive; existing unsupervised methods rely on late fusion of pseudo-boxes and underutilize complementary LiDAR-RGB data. A data-level, early fusion approach can better leverage 2D cues (segmentation/depth) to improve 3D pseudo-labels and localization.

Method: Early fusion of RGB and LiDAR: apply vision foundation models to obtain 2D instance segmentation and depth; bi-directional fusion where real LiDAR points receive 2D category labels, and 2D pixels are projected into 3D to densify real points. Noise mitigation via local radius-based depth filtering and global statistical outlier filtering. A data-level fusion-based dynamic self-evolution strategy iteratively refines pseudo-boxes under a dense representation.

Result: On nuScenes, the proposed detector trained with the data-level fusion method significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, achieving 28.4% mAP on the validation benchmark.

Conclusion: Early data-level fusion of RGB and LiDAR, combined with iterative self-evolution and robust filtering, substantially enhances pseudo-box quality and 3D localization in unsupervised detection, as demonstrated on nuScenes.

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

*Frederik Rajiv Manichand,Robin Deuber,Robert Jakob,Steve Swerling,Jamie Rosen,Elgar Fleisch,Patrick Langer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A deep learning BMI estimator trained on a large WayBED dataset achieves strong MAPE on hold-out and unseen datasets, with automatic image quality filtering and mobile deployment; open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Estimate BMI from images to enable rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable (telehealth, emergencies), addressing limitations of prior computer-vision approaches that used smaller datasets.

Method: Automatic dataset filtering using posture clustering and person detection to remove low-quality or atypical views; train BMI estimator on WayBED (84,963 images from 25,353 individuals); evaluate on hold-out WayBED (7.9% MAPE), on unseen VisualBodyToBMI (13% MAPE), and fine-tune on VisualBodyToBMI to reach 8.56% MAPE; deploy pipeline on Android via CLAID; release code and CLAID package as open-source.

Result: MAPE 7.9% on WayBED hold-out (full-body images); 13% on completely unseen VisualBodyToBMI; after fine-tuning on VisualBodyToBMI, 8.56% (best on that dataset to date); demonstrated generalization and mobile deployment.

Conclusion: Shows that large-scale data with automatic image quality curation enables accurate BMI estimation from images; supports mobile deployment and open-source reproducibility; competitive or leading performance in published literature.

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source
contributions.

*Ahmad Chaddad,Yihang Wu,Reem Kateb,Christian Desrosiers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A broad comparative study of seven DA methods across 5 natural and 8 medical datasets (557 simulations) shows DSAN as the standout, reaching 91.2% on COVID-19 with ResNet-50 and improving dynamic streaming DA by 6.7%, with notable explainability on COVID-19 and skin cancer data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify domain adaptation performance in both natural and medical imaging, addressing biases from standard natural-image benchmarks and the unique challenges of medical data; investigate when and why DA helps under distribution shifts, streaming data, and limited data.

Method: Large-scale simulation study employing seven DA techniques on five natural and eight medical datasets, evaluating under scenarios such as out-of-distribution shifts, dynamic data streams, and limited training samples; uses backbone models (e.g., ResNet-50 for COVID-19) and analyzes DSAN's explainability.

Result: DSAN achieved 91.2% accuracy on COVID-19 dataset with ResNet-50; +6.7% improvement in dynamic data stream DA; DSAN shows strong explainability on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets; provides insights into DA applicability for medical data.

Conclusion: DA techniques can benefit both natural and medical image classification, with DSAN particularly effective and interpretable; study informs practical deployment of DA in medical contexts and highlights considerations for benchmarking biases.

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using
Resnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data
stream DA scenario (+6.7\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also
demonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when
evaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets. These results contribute to the
understanding of DA techniques and offer valuable insight into the effective
adaptation of models to medical data.

*Lucas Rakotoarivony*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLAB is a lightweight, effective contrastive auxiliary branch with dynamic loss weighting that improves video object detection robustness to image degradation, achieving state-of-the-art CNN-based results on ImageNet VID without extra post-processing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video object detection is more challenging than still-image detection due to degradation like motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes. Existing methods rely on heavy feature aggregation and post-processing, which increases compute. There is a need for robustness to degradation without extra inference cost.

Method: Introduce a contrastive auxiliary branch trained with a contrastive loss to enhance the backbone's feature representations for video detection. Apply a dynamic loss weighting strategy that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training and gradually shifts focus to the detection task as training converges.

Result: Experiments and ablations show consistent performance gains. On ImageNet VID, CLAB achieves 84.0% mAP with ResNet-101 and 85.2% mAP with ResNeXt-101, representing state-of-the-art performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing.

Conclusion: CLAB provides a simple yet effective way to bolster video detector robustness to degradation, boosting accuracy without extra inference cost or post-processing, as validated by comprehensive experiments.

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Identifies a typographic leakage path in CLIP via late-layer attention heads, and defends by ablating a typographic circuit, achieving significant robustness gains with minimal loss of clean accuracy, and releasing dyslexic CLIP models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Protect multi-modal systems (e.g., CLIP) from text-based typographic attacks that can cause misclassification, content generation, or model jailbreaking.

Method: Locate attention heads in the latter half of CLIP's layers that causally carry typographic information to the CLS token; ablate these heads to disrupt the typographic circuit; train-free defense evaluated on a typographic ImageNet‑100 variant; compare with finetuned defenses.

Result: Up to 19.6% accuracy gain on a typographic ImageNet-100 variant with less than 1% drop on standard ImageNet-100; training-free approach competitive with finetuned state-of-the-art defenses; release a family of dyslexic CLIP models as drop-in replacements for safety-critical use.

Conclusion: A simple, training-free ablation of a specialized typographic circuit in CLIP can robustly defend against typographic attacks while preserving overall performance; dyslexic CLIP models are practical safeguards for real-world deployments.

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces GLaRE, a graph-based landmark region embedding network for facial emotion recognition using 3D landmarks and a quotient graph from hierarchical coarsening; achieves strong accuracy on AffectNet and FERG.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FER faces challenges such as occlusion, expression variability, and lack of interpretability. GNNs can capture relational structure among facial landmarks to enable structured and interpretable learning; hierarchical coarsening reduces complexity while preserving spatial organization.

Method: Extract 3D facial landmarks, construct a quotient graph via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while reducing nodes, obtain region-level embeddings, and apply a graph neural network for emotion classification. Ablation studies show region-level embeddings from quotient graphs contribute to performance.

Result: Achieves 64.89% accuracy on AffectNet and 94.24% on FERG; ablation studies indicate region-level embeddings from quotient graphs improve performance over baselines.

Conclusion: Quotient-graph region embeddings enhance FER performance and interpretability while controlling computational complexity; region-wise learned representations appear particularly beneficial under occlusion and expression variability.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

*Zheng Chong,Yanwei Lei,Shiyue Zhang,Zhuandi He,Zhen Wang,Xujie Zhang,Xiao Dong,Yiling Wu,Dongmei Jiang,Xiaodan Liang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastFit introduces a cacheable diffusion-based multi-reference virtual try-on system that decouples reference feature encoding from denoising, achieving ~3.5x speedup and supporting larger multi-reference outfits; it also releases DressCode-MR, a 28k+ set dataset across five categories, and outperforms SOTA on fidelity with improved efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current virtual try-on methods struggle with multi-reference outfits (garments and accessories) and suffer from significant inefficiency due to re-computing reference features at every denoising step. This hinders real-world deployment.

Method: A cacheable diffusion architecture using a Semi-Attention mechanism and class embeddings for reference items replaces timestep embeddings. Reference feature encoding is decoupled from the denoising process, allowing reference features to be computed once and reused across all steps with negligible overhead.

Result: Achieves an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Outperforms state-of-the-art on VITON-HD, DressCode, and DressCode-MR fidelity metrics. Introduces DressCode-MR, a large-scale dataset with 28,179 outfit sets across tops, bottoms, dresses, shoes, and bags.

Conclusion: FastFit substantially reduces inference bottlenecks in multi-reference virtual try-on, enabling practical use and providing a new benchmark dataset (DressCode-MR) to drive further research.

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

*Yuqi Han,Songqian Zhang,Weijian Su,Ke Li,Jiayu Yang,Jinli Suo,Qiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes UTA-Sign, an unsupervised fusion of thermal video and event camera data to enhance traffic signage perception in low light, using dual-boosting to align uneven events with thermal frames and inject signage content into motion frames.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thermal cameras struggle with signage when materials are similar; event cameras excel in high-speed, low-light conditions but have non-uniform sampling. Combining both modalities can improve safety-critical signage understanding in autonomous driving.

Method: A dual-boosting fusion mechanism that combines thermal frames and asynchronous event signals. Thermal frames provide accurate motion cues as temporal references to align uneven event streams, while event signals contribute signage content to raw thermal frames, yielding a consistent signage representation over time in an unsupervised framework.

Result: Validated on real-world datasets, the method yields superior quality in traffic signage sketching and improved perceptual-level detection accuracy.

Conclusion: Integrating thermal and event modalities via dual-boosted fusion enhances signage perception under low illumination, offering safer and more reliable autonomous driving performance without requiring labeled data.

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

*Mengxiao Huang,Minglei Shu,Shuwang Zhou,Zhaoyang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Active defense against GAN-based face swapping using low-frequency perceptual perturbations via discrete wavelet transform (DWT). An encoder–perturbation–decoder architecture injects low-frequency artifacts that disrupt the generative process while preserving high-frequency details, improving robustness by combining frequency and spatial features. Evaluated on CelebA-HQ and LFW, it significantly reduces face-swapping effectiveness while preserving visual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake threats pose privacy and societal security risks. Existing defenses are mainly passive post-event detectors and fail to prevent generation. A proactive/active defense that disrupts the generative process is needed.

Method: An encoder–perturbation–decoder network that uses DWT to extract low-frequency components and applies low-frequency perturbations; combines frequency and spatial domain features to disrupt facial manipulation models while preserving high-frequency image details.

Result: Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW show significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved defense success rates, and preserved visual quality.

Conclusion: Active defense via low-frequency perceptual perturbations can effectively disrupt deepfake generation. Integrating frequency and spatial features enhances robustness, offering a plausible, high-impact defense against evolving deepfake techniques.

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

It achieves higher diversity and state-of-the-art text alignment on HumanML3D and KIT-ML.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diversity in text-to-motion generation remains a major challenge; current methods often produce repetitive or limited variations without breaking semantic alignment to the text. A simple, effective approach is needed to induce diversity without sacrificing text consistency.

Method: Introduce noise signals as carriers of diversity within transformer-based text-to-motion models. Project text into a continuous latent space rather than a rigid one-to-one mapping, and use a latent space sampler to perform stochastic sampling during generation, thereby increasing diversity and modeling uncertainty.

Result: Experiments on HumanML3D and KIT-ML show significantly increased diversity in generated motions while maintaining state-of-the-art text-motion consistency.

Conclusion: Modeling uncertainty through latent sampling and noise-based diversity carriers provides a straightforward and effective route to diverse yet text-consistent 3D human motion generation.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

*Karl-Philippe Beaudet,Sidaty El Hadramy,Philippe C Cattin,Juan Verde,Stéphane Cotin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: An optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate 3D IVUS volume reconstruction to register intraoperative IVUS with preoperative CT in liver surgery, validated on swine with calibration error 0.88–1.80 mm and registration error 3.40–5.71 mm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In liver surgery, intraoperative ultrasound (IVUS) has a limited field of view and complex anatomy, making it hard to interpret; aligning intraoperative IVUS with preoperative CT could improve navigation. 3D IVUS can reconstruct the whole organ to facilitate registration and guidance.

Method: An optimization-based calibration approach using a 3D-printed phantom to accurately reconstruct 3D IVUS volumes and align tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, enabling precise calibration and subsequent volume reconstruction for registration.

Result: Calibration error ranges from 0.88 to 1.80 mm; registration error ranges from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the reconstructed 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT scan. Validation performed on in vivo swine liver images.

Conclusion: The proposed calibration and volume reconstruction method provides a reliable and accurate means to register intraoperative IVUS with preoperative CT in liver surgery, enhancing intraoperative guidance and navigation.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

TL;DR: PI-GenMFI uses physics-informed diffusion-based generation to synthesize magnetic field images for power-short defects, addressing MFI data scarcity to improve ML-based defect localization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MFI is a memory-efficient, targeted alternative to X-ray for ROI localization in semiconductor QC, but training ML models is hindered by scarce MFI datasets due to proprietary constraints. Incorporating physics into generative models can yield realistic synthetic MFIs to augment data.

Method: Develop Physics Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) that integrate two physical constraints into diffusion-based generation. Produce synthetic MFI images for the common defect type (power shorts), and benchmark against state-of-the-art VAE and diffusion models. Include domain expert evaluation and both qualitative and quantitative assessments using metrics from image generation and signal processing.

Result: The approach yields promising results, with competitive or superior performance to baseline generative models. Domain expert assessments corroborate realism of synthetic MFIs, and quantitative metrics indicate improvements in generating realistic, useful samples for defect localization.

Conclusion: Physics-informed diffusion generation is a promising pathway to mitigate MFI data scarcity, enabling more efficient and accurate ML-driven defect localization. Further work could extend to additional defect types and real-world deployment.

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

### [52] [Revisiting the Privacy Risks of Split Inference: A GAN-Based Data Reconstruction Attack via Progressive Feature Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20613)
*Yixiang Qiu,Yanhan Liu,Hongyao Yu,Hao Fang,Bin Chen,Shu-Tao Xia,Ke Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A GAN-based data reconstruction attack for split inference that uses progressive feature optimization with hierarchical generator blocks and an L1-ball constraint to improve semantic fidelity and realism, outperforming prior DRAs on high-resolution and deeper networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Split inference exposes intermediate features that can leak sensitive input data. Existing data reconstruction attacks are effective mainly on shallow models and do not leverage semantic priors, limiting reconstruction quality and generalization across datasets and architectures.

Method: Introduce a GAN-based DRA framework with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO) that decomposes the generator into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations. Add an L1-ball constraint to stabilize optimization and enhance image realism.

Result: The proposed method outperforms prior attacks by a large margin, particularly in high-resolution scenarios, under distribution shifts, and against deeper/ more complex DNNs.

Conclusion: The attack achieves higher reconstruction quality and generalization, revealing stronger privacy risks in split inference and underscoring the need for robust defenses against advanced DRAs across model sizes and datasets.

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fine-tuning foundation models and fusing their embeddings with traditional facial recognition improves sitter identification in historical paintings, addressing domain shift and artistic variation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify sitters in historical paintings, aiding art historians. Conventional facial recognition struggles due to domain shift, high intra-class variation, and artistic factors (style, skill, intent, influence). Foundation models may bridge the gap.

Method: Fine-tune foundation models on artworks and integrate their embeddings with those from conventional facial recognition networks, creating a fused representation and evaluating against state-of-the-art methods.

Result: Notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods; foundation models help bridge the gap where traditional methods are ineffective.

Conclusion: Foundation models show promise for recognition in artworks; embedding fusion enhances performance and offers a useful tool for art historical research.

Abstract: Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,
offering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the
process is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic
variations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging
conditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models
perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

### [54] [EmoCAST: Emotional Talking Portrait via Emotive Text Description](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20615)
*Yiguo Jiang,Xiaodong Cun,Yong Zhang,Yudian Zheng,Fan Tang,Chi-Man Pun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EmoCAST is a diffusion-based emotional talking head synthesis framework with a text-guided decoupled emotive module for appearance, and an emotive audio attention module to align emotion with driving audio. It introduces a dataset of emotive descriptions and training strategies (emotion-aware sampling and progressive functional training) to achieve realistic, emotion-rich, and audio-synchronized results, claiming state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current methods struggle with control flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality, and most available datasets are lab-collected, limiting real-world applicability of emotional talking head generation.

Method: Two key modules: 1) text-guided decoupled emotive module to integrate emotional prompts into appearance modeling, enhancing spatial emotion understanding; 2) emotive audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and driving audio, producing emotion-aware features for facial motion synthesis. Additionally, a dataset with rich emotive text descriptions is built, accompanied by an emotion-aware sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy to better capture expressive nuances and lip synchronization.

Result: Claims state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive, and audio-synchronized talking-head videos.

Conclusion: EmoCAST advances emotional talking head synthesis by improving emotion control, motion naturalness, and lip-sync through specialized modules and training strategies, supported by a new emotive-descriptions dataset.

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,
and audio-synchronized talking-head videos. Project Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A SwinUNETR-based framework with breast masking, data augmentation, and ensemble learning applied to multi-center breast MRI data, achieving 2nd place in the ODELIA challenge; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve AI-driven breast cancer detection on heterogeneous, multi-vendor MRI data and enhance generalization beyond single-site datasets, addressing limitations of mammography in dense breasts and high-risk women.

Method: Developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning pipeline with breast region masking, robust data augmentation, and ensemble learning; trained on 511 studies from six European centers with 1.5T and 3T scanners; labels per breast: no lesion, benign, or malignant.

Result: Achieved second place on the challenge leaderboard, demonstrating robustness and potential clinical utility; codebase publicly available at GitHub.

Conclusion: The approach shows promise for generalizable breast MRI interpretation across diverse scanners and field strengths, and provides a reproducible baseline for future AI-assisted breast cancer diagnosis work.

Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality in
women, and early detection is essential for improving outcomes. Magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is a highly sensitive tool for breast cancer detection,
particularly in women at high risk or with dense breast tissue, where
mammography is less effective. The ODELIA consortium organized a multi-center
challenge to foster AI-based solutions for breast cancer diagnosis and
classification. The dataset included 511 studies from six European centers,
acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study
was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or
malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that
incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble
learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second
place on the challenge leaderboard, highlighting its potential to support
clinical breast MRI interpretation. We publicly share our codebase at

### [56] [AvatarBack: Back-Head Generation for Complete 3D Avatars from Front-View Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20623)
*Shiqi Xin,Xiaolin Zhang,Yanbin Liu,Peng Zhang,Caifeng Shan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AvatarBack extends Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct full head avatars by addressing back-head missing information via two components: Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy (ASA). It uses synthetic back-view pseudo-images for multi-view supervision and learnable transform matrices for geometric alignment, improving back-head geometry while preserving frontal fidelity; evaluated on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle with geometric, photometric, and GPT-4o perceptual metrics; results show improved back-head reconstruction and animatability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Gaussian Splatting methods focus on frontal views, causing incomplete back-head geometry; there is a need for consistent full-head avatars that remain robust under motion and animation.

Method: Two core innovations: SSG to synthesize identity-consistent back views from sparse frontal inputs; ASA to learn and optimize transformation matrices to align synthetic views with the 3D Gaussian representation during training.

Result: Quantitative and qualitative improvements in back-head reconstruction on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets; improved geometric and photometric fidelity and GPT-4o-based perceptual scores; avatars remain animatable with consistent realism.

Conclusion: AvatarBack provides a plug-and-play solution to achieve complete and consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by mitigating missing-back information, while maintaining frontal fidelity and animation capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Improving mobile CLIP via enhanced multi-modal reinforced training; introduces MobileCLIP2 with better zero-shot ImageNet-1k accuracy at low latency, leveraging superior CLIP teacher ensembles and captioner teachers trained on DFN and diverse datasets; shows ablations on distillation temperature and caption diversity; releases pretrained models and data-generation code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To push high-accuracy, low-latency foundation image-text models (mobile-friendly CLIP) by strengthening multi-modal reinforced training through better teacher ensembles and diverse captioner supervision, enabling scalable distillation from multiple sources.

Method: Augment MobileCLIP training with (1) better CLIP teacher ensembles trained on the DFN dataset; (2) improved captioner teachers trained on DFN and fine-tuned on diverse high-quality image-caption datasets; conduct ablations on temperature tuning, caption-generator fine-tuning for diversity, and combining synthetic captions from multiple models; train a new MobileCLIP2 family.

Result: Attains state-of-the-art ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracy at low latency; MobileCLIP2-B gains ~2.2% over MobileCLIP-B; MobileCLIP2-S4 matches SigLIP-SO400M/14 zero-shot accuracy while being ≈2× smaller and with 2.5× lower latency on DFN ViT-L/14; releases pretrained models and data-generation code for easy creation of reinforced datasets with arbitrary teachers.

Conclusion: Enhanced multi-modal reinforced training with stronger teacher ensembles and captioner diversity yields significant gains in zero-shot performance under mobile constraints; the MobileCLIP2 family sets new SOTA with efficient latency, and the provided code/data enable scalable, configurable reinforcement with various teacher models.

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data
generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary
teachers using distributed scalable processing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CraftGraffiti is a diffusion-based, text-guided graffiti generation system that preserves facial identity while applying high-contrast graffiti styles. It uses LoRA-tuned style transfer, a face-consistent self-attention module with identity embeddings, and CLIP-guided pose extension, and champions a style-first, identity-after paradigm, with strong quantitative and real-world validation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Preserving recognizability under extreme stylistic transformations is a core challenge in generative art, particularly for graffiti where distortions can erode facial identity and cultural authenticity.

Method: An end-to-end pipeline: (1) graffiti style transfer via a LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion transformer; (2) enforce identity fidelity through a face-consistent self-attention mechanism augmented with explicit identity embeddings; (3) CLIP-guided prompt extension for pose re-posing without keypoints; (4) justification and empirical validation of a 'style-first, identity-after' order to reduce attribute drift; (5) evaluation with quantitative metrics and a live deployment.

Result: Quantitative results show competitive facial feature consistency and state-of-the-art aesthetic and human-preference scores; qualitative analyses and a live Cruilla Festival deployment demonstrate real-world creative impact and identity-respectful artistry.

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti offers a principled approach to blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI, advancing identity-preserving capabilities for stylized generative art and suggesting broader applicability beyond graffiti.

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes an internally generated debiased self-judgment score for LVLM alignment; improves decoding and preference tuning, reducing hallucinations without external data; empirical results show strong gains over traditional methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Alignment of LVLMs remains challenging due to hallucinations and safety concerns. Current methods rely on external datasets, human annotations, or post-processing, which are costly and not easily scalable. A scalable, autonomous alignment signal is highly desirable.

Method: Introduce a debiased self-judgment score generated entirely by the model itself. This internal metric guides decoding strategies and preference tuning, enabling autonomous improvement without external resources.

Result: Empirical results indicate significant improvements over traditional alignment methods, including reduced hallucinations and enhanced safety, leading to better overall LVLM performance.

Conclusion: A self-generated evaluation framework enables scalable, autonomous alignment of LVLMs, reducing reliance on external data and annotations while improving safety and capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing per-pixel Gaussian predictors in generalizable Gaussian Splatting struggle to encode discriminative, multi-view consistent features, leading to poor geometry with sparse views. This work motivates stronger feature learning to enable accurate, photorealistic synthesis across unseen scenes without per-scene optimization.

Method: Introduce three lightweight modules that enforce context-aware, cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints within a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion for Gaussian parameter prediction without requiring extra supervision.

Result: Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability for unseen scenes.

Conclusion: C3-GS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both rendering quality and generalization without additional supervision; code is provided for reproducibility.

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen
scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements
utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing
approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent
features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate
geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a
framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware,
cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three
lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion
and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS
achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces S-HArM, a dataset for intent-aware image-text classification (Humor/Satire, Art, Misinformation) with 9,576 social-media pairs; proposes three prompting strategies to generate synthetic data via Stable Diffusion; conducts a broad multimodal analysis and finds that image- or multimodal-guided data improve generalization to in-the-wild content, but intent inference remains challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To fill a gap in multimodal AI research: beyond detecting synthetic content, understand the intent behind images; develop benchmarks and data to support intent-aware classification across modalities.

Method: Create S-HArM with 9,576 image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit labeled into three intents; explore three prompting strategies for synthetic data generation using Stable Diffusion (image-guided, description-guided, multimodally-guided); perform an extensive comparative study across modality fusion, contrastive learning, reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language models.

Result: Models trained on image- and multimodally-guided data generalize better to in-the-wild content due to preserved visual context; however overall performance remains limited, underscoring the difficulty of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

Conclusion: Intent-aware multimodal understanding is feasible to advance with curated datasets and synthetic-data strategies, but substantial challenges persist; future work should focus on architectures and training paradigms tailored to intent inference.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic

intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the

(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

### [62] [SeqVLM: Proposal-Guided Multi-View Sequences Reasoning via VLM for Zero-Shot 3D Visual Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20758)
*Jiawen Lin,Shiran Bian,Yihang Zhu,Wenbin Tan,Yachao Zhang,Yuan Xie,Yanyun Qu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeqVLM is a zero-shot 3D visual grounding framework that uses multi-view projection of semantically filtered 3D proposals and a dynamic scheduling mechanism to efficiently leverage a vision‑language model, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot results on ScanRefer and Nr3D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Zero-shot 3DVG offers broad applicability but suffers from spatially limited reasoning with single-view localization and contextual/detail loss; integrating multi-view spatial cues and efficient cross-modal reasoning can improve generalization and realism.

Method: 1) Generate 3D instance proposals via 3D semantic segmentation and apply semantic filtering to retain only semantically relevant candidates. 2) Use a proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy to project these proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial relationships and contextual details during 3D-to-2D conversion. 3) Introduce a dynamic scheduling mechanism to iteratively process sequence-question prompts, reducing VLM computation while leveraging cross-modal reasoning to identify the textually specified objects.

Result: On ScanRefer and Nr3D benchmarks, SeqVLM achieves Acc@0.25 of 55.6% and 53.2%, respectively, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0 and 5.2 percentage points, indicating improved generalization and real-world applicability.

Conclusion: SeqVLM advances zero-shot 3DVG by incorporating multi-view spatial context and efficient cross-modal reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance and better generalization, with code available at the linked repository.

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

### [63] [Learned Rate Control for Frame-Level Adaptive Neural Video Compression via Dynamic Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20709)
*Chenhao Zhang,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dynamic-route autoencoder-based neural video compression framework enabling variable bitrate by routing through multiple sub-networks with different rate–distortion trade-offs; uses a Rate Control Agent and Joint-Routes Optimization; achieves significant RD improvements with controlled bitrate error and available open-source code.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise rate control is challenging for learning-based codecs; need to support a broad range of bitrates while preserving rate–distortion performance and managing complexity.

Method: Introduce Dynamic-Route Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational complexity and offering distinct RD trade-offs. A Rate Control Agent estimates bitrate per route and selects the appropriate route at run-time. Joint-Routes Optimization trains multiple routes collaboratively to cover a broad bitrate spectrum while maintaining performance.

Result: On HEVC and UVG datasets, the method achieves an average BD-Rate reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47 dB over state-of-the-art methods, with an average bitrate error of 1.66%. Demonstrates RD–C (RDCO) suitability for various bitrate and bitrate-constrained applications; code available at the provided link.

Conclusion: The proposed RDCO framework enables flexible, variable-bitrate neural video compression with competitive rate–distortion performance and manageable complexity, validated by extensive experiments.

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate
reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving
Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and
bitrate-constrained applications. Our code is available at

*Jan Erik van Woerden,Gertjan Burghouts,Lotte Nijskens,Alma M. Liezenga,Sabina van Rooij,Frank Ruis,Hugo J. Kuijf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Transformer-based CLIP variants offer stronger occlusion robustness than CNNs on a military dataset; occlusion pattern and model probing affect performance; backbone finetuning improves resilience but thresholds remain; occlusion-aware training recommended.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate how CLIP-based vision-language models perform under occlusion and degraded SNR in defense settings where labeled data is scarce.

Method: Create a custom dataset with 18 military vehicle classes. Evaluate multiple CLIP architectures (CNN-backed and Transformer-based) using NAUC across varying occlusion levels. Compare linear-probe (frozen backbone) vs fine-tuned backbones. Analyze two occlusion patterns: fine-grained dispersed patches vs large contiguous blocks.

Result: Transformer CLIPs consistently outperform CNN-based CLIPs. Dispersed, fine-grained occlusions degrade performance more than large contiguous occlusions. Linear-probed models show sharp performance drop around 35% occlusion, while fine-tuning the backbone shifts this drop to above 60% occlusion. NAUC declines with increasing occlusion, underscoring the sensitivity to patch-level occlusion.

Conclusion: Occlusion-specific augmentations and further exploration of patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience are needed for reliable CLIP deployment in real-world defense scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

*Reza Akbari Movahed,Abuzar Rezaee,Arezoo Zakeri,Colin Berry,Edmond S. L. Ho,Ali Gooya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Bayesian, shape-guided, recurrent deep learning framework (CardioMorphNet) improves 3D cardiac motion estimation from SAX CMR by focusing on anatomical regions via segmentation-based losses and providing uncertainty maps.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard intensity-based registration losses can overlook cardiac anatomy, leading to less accurate motion estimation and limited uncertainty quantification in cine CMR.

Method: A recurrent variational autoencoder models spatio-temporal dependencies in 3D cardiac shapes; two posterior models for segmentation and motion estimation; a Bayesian loss focusing on anatomical regions by recursively registering segmentation maps without intensity-based similarity loss; leverages sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features; outputs uncertainty maps for motion fields.

Result: Validated on UK Biobank data, CardioMorphNet achieves superior motion estimation by comparing warped segmentation masks to ground-truth masks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods; uncertainty maps show lower uncertainty in cardiac regions compared with other probabilistic registration methods, indicating higher confidence.

Conclusion: A shape-guided, Bayesian, recurrent framework improves cardiac motion estimation in SAX CMR and provides reliable uncertainty estimates focused on anatomical regions, suggesting robustness for clinical analysis.

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,
indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

### [66] [Mix, Align, Distil: Reliable Cross-Domain Atypical Mitosis Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20745)
*Kaustubh Atey,Sameer Anand Jha,Gouranga Bala,Amit Sethi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A training-time recipe for domain-robust atypical mitosis classification under scanner/stain shift, using style perturbations, weak-domain alignment, and EMA distillation to achieve strong, balanced performance with negligible inference overhead.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts from different scanners, stains, and acquisition conditions hinder consistent AMF detection; a robust method should generalize across sites with minimal annotation and overhead.

Method: (i) Introduce style perturbations at early and mid backbone stages to diversify features; (ii) use weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) with an auxiliary alignment loss to align attention-refined features across sites; (iii) stabilize predictions via distillation from an EMA teacher using temperature-scaled KL divergence.

Result: On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis classification, the method achieved balanced accuracy 0.8762, sensitivity 0.8873, specificity 0.8651, and ROC AUC 0.9499. It incurs negligible inference-time overhead, relies on coarse domain metadata, and yields strong, balanced performance, making it competitive for MIDOG 2025 Task 2.

Conclusion: The proposed recipe delivers robust, domain-robust AMF classification with low overhead and strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive MIDOG 2025 submission.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet
remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift
stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple
training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.
The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted
at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across
sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an
auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from
an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL
divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis
classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity
of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs
negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and
delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive
submission for the MIDOG 2025 challenge.

TL;DR: A survey of abstract concept understanding in video leveraging foundation models; reviews tasks/datasets, argues for reusing decades of research, and calls for aligning video AI with human reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Abstract concepts such as justice or freedom require contextual and relational reasoning beyond concrete objects in video; foundation models offer multi-modal, scalable reasoning and can help align AI with human values.

Method: Literature survey analyzing tasks and datasets related to abstract concept understanding in video; argues for adopting foundation-model-based approaches and leveraging decades of community work; no new empirical experiments reported.

Result: Synthesizes existing tasks/datasets, identifies gaps and needs in the field, and advocates a framework that leverages foundation models and prior art while avoiding reinvention.

Conclusion: Foundation models, in combination with long-running community experience, are essential to tackle the grand challenge of abstract concept understanding in video and to better align AI with human reasoning and values.

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

*Yibin Wang,Zhimin Li,Yuhang Zang,Yujie Zhou,Jiazi Bu,Chunyu Wang,Qinglin Lu,Cheng Jin,Jiaqi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pairwise preference rewards in GRPO-based T2I RL (Pref-GRPO) mitigate reward hacking and stabilize training; also UniGenBench provides a unified 600-prompt T2I benchmark with multi-criteria evaluation via MLLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reward hacking in pointwise reward models destabilizes text-to-image generation; existing benchmarks are coarse, limiting robust evaluation of T2I models.

Method: In Pref-GRPO, perform pairwise comparisons among images within each group using a preference RM; use the win rate as the reward signal; train to fit preferences rather than maximizing raw scores. Build UniGenBench with 600 prompts across 5 themes and 20 subthemes; evaluate semantic consistency with 10 primary and 27 sub-criteria using a large language model to construct and evaluate prompts and evaluations.

Result: Extensive experiments show Pref-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences, yields more stable advantages, and mitigates reward hacking. UniGenBench reveals strengths/weaknesses of open vs closed T2I models and validates Pref-GRPO.

Conclusion: Pairwise preference-based GRPO improves stability and evaluation capability for T2I RL; UniGenBench provides a comprehensive benchmark to advance future methods.

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

*Kuniko Paxton,Koorosh Aslansefat,Amila Akagić,Dhavalkumar Thakker,Yiannis Papadopoulos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A probabilistic, pixel-level, all-class activation map framework for skin lesion classification, augmented with SafeML for reliability, evaluated on ISIC with MobileNetV2 and ViT.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical AI models are trusted less due to explainability and reliability concerns; existing explainability methods (LIME, CAM) have limitations (inconsistency, class coverage). There is a need for unified, trustworthy explanations to reduce misdiagnosis and improve patient safety.

Method: Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation analyzes activation probability maps for all classes at a pixel level in a probabilistic framework; visualizes diagnostic process in a unified manner; integrates SafeML to detect false diagnoses and issue warnings to clinicians and patients.

Result: Evaluation on ISIC datasets using MobileNetV2 and Vision Transformers; demonstrated feasibility and potential for improved explainability and safety (details not specified in abstract).

Conclusion: A unified, probabilistic, all-class activation framework with reliability safeguards that aims to improve trust, reduce misdiagnoses, and enhance patient safety in skin lesion classification.

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and
Vision Transformers.

*Beth Pearson,Bilal Boulbarss,Michael Wray,Martha Lewis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Generative diffusion classifiers and ViLT show strong concept binding in zero-shot settings, but all models struggle with relational GZSL; CLIP's relational representations (e.g., left/right) may be too conflated; dataset and code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether generative Diffusion Classifier improves compositional generalisation over discriminative models in visual-language tasks, by testing object-attribute-relations binding in zero-shot and generalized zero-shot settings.

Method: Compare three models—Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT—on binding objects with attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL); analyze CLIP embeddings; provide code and dataset at the linked repository.

Result: Diffusion Classifier and ViLT perform well on concept binding tasks; all models show substantial difficulty with relational GZSL; analysis suggests CLIP embeddings may encode relational concepts (like left/right) too similarly, hindering relational reasoning.

Conclusion: Relational reasoning in vision-language models remains challenging; generative diffusion-based approaches help with concept binding but require further development for robust relational generalization; dataset and code are released for further study.

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a surfel-based SE(3) equivariant pose learning method for point cloud registration that robustly handles orientation and uncertainty, reducing dependence on augmentation and achieving state-of-the-art performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current registration methods largely ignore point orientations and uncertainties, making them fragile to noise and large rotations; robust 3D alignment requires explicit handling of SE(3) transformations.

Method: Initialize surfels from LiDAR using virtual camera parameters; learn SE(3) equivariant features (positions and rotations) with equivariant convolutions; architecture includes an equivariant encoder, cross-attention for similarity, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.

Result: Experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets show superior performance and robustness on real scans compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: SE(3) equivariant surfel-based pose learning provides robust, rotation-aware registration for 3D reconstruction in remote sensing/digital heritage, reducing reliance on extensive augmentation.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Detector simulations are computationally expensive on CERN's grid. While generative ML approaches have been proposed, the data distribution varies across simulations and is hard to capture with generic models, motivating specialized, efficient generative modeling.

Method: A Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture where multiple experts each specialize in a subset of the calorimeter response data, enabling more precise and efficient generation for the ALICE ZDC.

Result: ExpertSim improves accuracy and delivers significant speedups compared to traditional Monte Carlo methods, and code is released for reuse.

Conclusion: Mixture-of-Generative-Experts provide a promising path for high-efficiency detector simulations in particle physics experiments at CERN.

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in
particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To tackle the lack of interpretability and reliance on opaque, monolithic pipelines in higher-order VideoQA that blend perception, reasoning, and answer generation.

Method: Two-stage architecture: CCE extracts natural language causal chains from video-question pairs; CCDA answers grounded in these chains. Chains are generated from datasets using large language models. Introduces CauCo evaluation metric for causality-oriented captioning. Evaluated on three large-scale benchmarks; results show improved performance and explainability.

Result: Outperforms state-of-the-art models and yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and generalization; CCE acts as a reusable causal reasoning engine across domains; project page.

Conclusion: Demonstrates that separating causal chain reasoning from answer generation enables transparent, coherent reasoning and better performance in VideoQA, with potential applicability beyond VideoQA.

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine
across diverse domains. Project page:

Method: 1) Automatic tooth detection to establish two views (global panoramic and local cropped teeth). 2) Pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. 3) Global-view model acts as the detection backbone, generating region proposals and global features. 4) Local-view model extracts detailed features from cropped tooth patches matched by proposals. 5) Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) fuses dual-view features. 6) Fuse the enhanced features back into the detector for final caries prediction. 7) Evaluated on a public dataset and a newly curated high-precision dataset with dual verification (intra-oral and panoramic X-rays).

Result: DVCTNet achieves superior performance compared with existing SOTA methods on both datasets, demonstrating robust detection accuracy and potential clinical applicability.

Conclusion: The dual-view co-training with gated cross-view attention effectively leverages global and local information for dental caries detection, and the approach is supported by public and newly curated high-precision data; code and labeled data are publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

### [75] [FusionCounting: Robust visible-infrared image fusion guided by crowd counting via multi-task learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20817)
*He Li,Xinyu Liu,Weihang Kong,Xingchen Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FusionCounting is a multi-task framework that jointly fuses visible/infrared images and counts crowds, using dynamic loss weighting and adversarial training to boost fusion quality, counting accuracy, and robustness on RGB-T data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VIF methods emphasize image quality but ignore downstream tasks; semantic segmentation and object detection require heavy annotations, while crowd counting offers lower annotation cost but has not been integrated with VIF. Dense scenes with crowds suffer from stacking/occlusion in detection; a unified RGB-T fusion plus crowd counting framework could provide semantic guidance and quantitative density information with minimal annotation.

Method: A multi-task network FusionCounting that takes RGB-T inputs and uses population density as an auxiliary signal to guide fusion and counting. The framework employs a dynamic loss weighting strategy to balance the fusion and counting tasks and incorporates adversarial training to enhance robustness of both tasks. The design is mutually beneficial: fuse information while simultaneously performing crowd counting, leveraging density information to improve fusion and vice versa.

Result: Experiments on public RGB-T crowd datasets show that FusionCounting improves fused image quality while achieving superior crowd counting performance compared to baselines, demonstrating the benefits of joint optimization and adversarial training.

Conclusion: FusionCounting provides a unified RGB-T VIF and crowd counting framework that reduces annotation burden through density-based supervision, improves fusion quality and counting accuracy, and offers improved robustness to adversarial perturbations, suggesting a promising direction for dense-scene analysis.

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces HydraFake, a realistic deepfake dataset with hierarchical generalization and Veritas, a two-stage, pattern-aware MLLM-based detector that improves out-of-distribution detection and provides transparent outputs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the mismatch between academic benchmarks and real-world industrial practice in deepfake detection, where datasets are often homogeneous and low-quality, hindering deployment.

Method: Develop HydraFake with diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries and establish a rigorous training/evaluation protocol for unseen model architectures, emerging forgery techniques, and novel data domains. Propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model detector with pattern-aware reasoning (planning and self-reflection) to emulate forensic reasoning, plus a two-stage training pipeline to internalize such capabilities. Evaluate on HydraFake to assess generalization gaps and improvements in unseen scenarios.

Result: Current detectors generalize across cross-model settings but struggle with unseen forgeries and data domains. Veritas achieves significant gains across various out-of-distribution scenarios and delivers transparent and faithful detection outputs.

Conclusion: HydraFake and Veritas together close the gap between academic benchmarks and industrial practice, enabling robust, interpretable deepfake detection across diverse real-world conditions.

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

TL;DR: Low-resource 2D surgical tool keypoint estimation via LoRA-finetuned vision-language model with prompt-driven instruction tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mitigate overfitting and data scarcity in medical vision by leveraging pre-trained vision-language models and efficient LoRA fine-tuning to improve 2D keypoint estimation and enable future 3D pose work.

Method: Design prompts to build an instruction-tuning dataset and align visual features with semantic keypoint descriptions; fine-tune a pre-trained vision-language model using LoRA for two epochs.

Result: The adapted vision-language model outperforms baseline CNN/Transformer models on small medical datasets, demonstrating LoRA's effectiveness in low-resource scenarios.

Conclusion: This approach improves 2D keypoint detection and sets the stage for future 3D pose estimation of surgical hands/tools by exploiting VLM generalization and efficient fine-tuning.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an
instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic
keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work
in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.

*Gaetan Brison,Soobash Daiboo,Samy Aimeur,Awais Hussain Sani,Xi Wang,Gianni Franchi,Vicky Kalogeiton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes FakeParts, a class of partial deepfakes with localized manipulations; introduces FakePartsBench dataset (~25K videos with pixel/frame annotations) and shows partial fakes significantly reduce detection accuracy in humans and SOTA models, highlighting a critical vulnerability and a resource for robust detection.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current deepfake detectors are tuned for fully synthetic fakes and struggle with partial, localized edits that blend with authentic content; there is a need for benchmarks capturing partial manipulations to drive robust detection methods.

Method: Define the FakeParts paradigm; create FakePartsBench, a large-scale benchmark with 25K videos and pixel/frame-level manipulation annotations; conduct user studies and evaluate existing detectors to assess vulnerability.

Result: FakeParts manipulations degrade human detection accuracy by >30% compared to traditional deepfakes; state-of-the-art detectors show similar performance degradation; dataset enables comprehensive evaluation across spatial/temporal partial edits.

Conclusion: Identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection approaches and provides a resource to develop more robust methods against partial video manipulations.

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods
for partial video manipulations.

*Hao Yang,Qianyu Zhou,Haijia Sun,Xiangtai Li,Xuequan Lu,Lizhuang Ma,Shuicheng Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes PointDGRWKV, a RWKV-based framework for domain generalization in point cloud classification, with Adaptive Geometric Token Shift and Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment to boost local geometry modeling and cross-domain robustness, achieving state-of-the-art results with linear complexity.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DG for point cloud classification suffers from limited receptive fields, high cost, and weak long-range modeling in traditional architectures. RWKV offers linear complexity, global receptive fields, and long-range dependencies, but faces (i) spatial distortions from fixed-direction token shifts on unstructured point clouds and (ii) attention drift across domains due to exponential weighting in Bi-WKV, hurting generalization.

Method: Introduce two modules: (1) Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local neighborhood structures and improve geometric context; (2) Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment to reduce attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains, preserving RWKV efficiency.

Result: Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that PointDGRWKV achieves state-of-the-art performance in Domain Generalization for Point Cloud Classification.

Conclusion: PointDGRWKV demonstrates that a carefully designed RWKV-based DG PCC framework can address both local geometry modeling and cross-domain robustness while maintaining linear computational efficiency, achieving superior generalization performance.

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate
attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address opacity and variability in DL-based pathology by providing interpretable, pixel-level segmentation and semantically aligned diagnostic narratives.

Method: Proposes PathMR architecture that takes a pathological image and a textual query, produces diagnostic explanations and cell distribution predictions; evaluated on PathGen and a new GADVR dataset; compares to existing visual reasoning methods.

Result: PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and cross-modal alignment on both datasets; code will be public.

Conclusion: PathMR improves interpretability and reliability of AI-powered pathology and demonstrates potential for dependable AI-assisted diagnosis; release of code and datasets facilitates further research.

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual
reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and
cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will

TL;DR: FW-GAN is a one-shot handwriting synthesis framework that uses a phase-aware Wave-MLP generator and a frequency-guided discriminator with a Frequency Distribution Loss to produce writer-consistent handwriting from a single example, improving data augmentation for low-resource HTR.



<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Labeled handwriting data are scarce, hindering robust recognition systems. Convolutional models struggle with long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns, and frequency information is crucial for capturing fine-grained handwriting details.

Method: A generator with a phase-aware Wave-MLP to capture spatial relationships and preserve stylistic cues; a frequency-guided discriminator that emphasizes high-frequency components; a Frequency Distribution Loss to align frequency characteristics between synthetic and real handwriting; evaluated on Vietnamese and English datasets for one-shot, writer-consistent synthesis.

Result: FW-GAN yields high-quality, style-consistent handwriting samples that effectively augment data for low-resource handwriting recognition pipelines, as demonstrated on Vietnamese and English datasets.

Conclusion: FW-GAN offers an effective framework for one-shot handwriting synthesis that leverages phase-aware spatial modeling and frequency-aware discrimination to produce authentic, writer-consistent data, with publicly available implementation.

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-modality deep learning pipeline using autofluorescence and SHG imaging differentiates normal, fibrotic, and cancerous pancreatic tissue; among six architectures, a modified ResNet with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training achieved >90% cancer-detection accuracy on 40 patient samples, suggesting potential clinical deployment and a template for small medical datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Early PDAC detection is critical due to poor prognosis and late-stage diagnosis. Current manual analyses are time-consuming and prone to variability. Deep learning on small, imbalanced medical imaging datasets is challenging; dual-modality imaging (autofluorescence and SHG) may provide complementary information to improve discrimination between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue.

Method: Data were collected from 40 unique patient samples using autofluorescence and SHG imaging to label normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Six architectures (CNNs and Vision Transformers) were evaluated; the final framework used a modified ResNet with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training to address class imbalance, forming a robust pipeline for PDAC detection on limited data.

Result: The optimized model achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection, representing a significant improvement over manual analysis and indicating strong potential for clinical deployment.

Conclusion: The study presents a robust automated PDAC detection pipeline applicable to small imaging datasets, with potential extension to other cancer types. It also provides practical insights into handling limited data and class imbalance in medical imaging.

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address pervasive bias and spurious correlations in AI systems; enable interpretable, fair, and robust models through counterfactual analysis.

Method: Vision: CAVLI (attribution with LIME and concept-level TCAV) plus a Concept Dependency Score; ASAC (adversarial counterfactuals) with curriculum learning to reduce bias while preserving semantics. Generative: TIBET for prompt-sensitive bias auditing; BiasConnect for causal graphs of intersectional biases; InterMit a modular, training-free bias mitigation using causal sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.

Result: A set of scalable frameworks and pipelines for auditing and mitigating bias, enabling detection of reliance on irrelevant cues, analysis of causal dependencies, and empirically guided fairness improvements across discriminative and generative models.

Conclusion: Counterfactuals provide a unifying lens for interpretability, fairness, and causality, yielding principled and scalable methods for socially responsible bias evaluation and mitigation in AI.

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

TL;DR: Dino U-Net uses a frozen DINOv3 backbone with a fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) and an adapter to fuse high-level semantic features with low-level details, achieving state-of-the-art medical image segmentation across seven datasets and scalable performance up to a 7B-parameter backbone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Foundation models pre-trained on natural images offer strong features for medical segmentation, but transferring these representations while preserving spatial detail is challenging; a method that integrates dense features with precise spatial information can improve clinical segmentation accuracy.

Method: An encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder uses a frozen DINOv3 backbone with an adapter to fuse semantic features with low-level spatial details. A fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) refines and projects features for the decoder. The approach is evaluated on seven public medical segmentation datasets, with performance scaling as backbone size increases up to 7B parameters.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse imaging modalities and datasets, consistently outperforming prior methods. Segmentation accuracy improves as the backbone size grows up to 7B parameters, indicating strong scalability. Code is publicly available.

Conclusion: Leveraging dense, pre-trained features from a general-purpose foundation model can be an effective and parameter-efficient strategy for advancing medical image segmentation, enabling high accuracy with scalable backbone sizes.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

Result: Balanced accuracy of 84.02% on MIDOG25; RBR increased specificity but reduced sensitivity and overall performance.

Conclusion: Deep ensembles are effective for AMF classification; RBR can boost certain metrics but requires further research to balance trade-offs.

of ConvNeXtBase models was trained with AUCMEDI and extend with a rule-based
refinement (RBR) module. On the MIDOG25 preliminary test set, the ensemble
achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it
reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep
ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific
metrics but requires further research.

*Fang Wang,Huitao Li,Wenhan Chao,Zheng Zhuo,Yiran Ji,Chang Peng,Yupeng Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-ConvNeXt is a lightweight ConvNeXt variant achieved by CSPNet integration and design optimizations, delivering high accuracy with low FLOPs (e.g., 78.3% Top-1 at 0.9 GFLOPs for mini; 81.9% at 3.1 GFLOPs for small) and up to 80% complexity reduction, with confirmed transferability to detection tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge the gap between high-performance hierarchical networks and lightweight application scenarios by significantly reducing parameter count and network complexity while preserving accuracy.

Method: Integrate Cross Stage Partial Network (CSPNet) with ConvNeXt and restructure the network; optimize Stem and Block designs for feature expression and efficiency; replace Layer Scale with channel attention; validate on ImageNet and assess transfer learning for object detection.

Result: Model family achieves up to 80% reduction in network complexity; E-ConvNeXt-mini achieves 78.3% Top-1 at 0.9 GFLOPs; E-ConvNeXt-small achieves 81.9% Top-1 at 3.1 GFLOPs; shows good transferability to detection tasks.

Conclusion: E-ConvNeXt provides a favorable accuracy–efficiency balance for lightweight scenarios and demonstrates generalization to downstream tasks like object detection.

Abstract: Many high-performance networks were not designed with lightweight application
scenarios in mind from the outset, which has greatly restricted their scope of
application. This paper takes ConvNeXt as the research object and significantly
reduces the parameter scale and network complexity of ConvNeXt by integrating
the Cross Stage Partial Connections mechanism and a series of optimized
designs. The new network is named E-ConvNeXt, which can maintain high accuracy
performance under different complexity configurations. The three core
innovations of E-ConvNeXt are : (1) integrating the Cross Stage Partial Network
(CSPNet) with ConvNeXt and adjusting the network structure, which reduces the
model's network complexity by up to 80%; (2) Optimizing the Stem and Block
structures to enhance the model's feature expression capability and operational
efficiency; (3) Replacing Layer Scale with channel attention. Experimental
validation on ImageNet classification demonstrates E-ConvNeXt's superior
accuracy-efficiency balance: E-ConvNeXt-mini reaches 78.3% Top-1 accuracy at
0.9GFLOPs. E-ConvNeXt-small reaches 81.9% Top-1 accuracy at 3.1GFLOPs. Transfer
learning tests on object detection tasks further confirm its generalization
capability.

### [90] [Webly-Supervised Image Manipulation Localization via Category-Aware Auto-Annotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20987)
*Chenfan Qu,Yiwu Zhong,Bin Li,Lianwen Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Web-IML, a web-scale supervised framework for localizing manipulated regions in images, leveraging CAAAv2 pixel-level annotations, QES filtering, and the MIMLv2 dataset to overcome data scarcity and achieve strong performance gains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data scarcity and the high cost of pixel-level annotations hinder manipulation localization. The work proposes using readily available web-forged images and an auxiliary task to automatically generate high-quality annotations, enabling large-scale supervised learning.

Method: Develops CAAAv2 to automatically annotate manipulated regions at pixel level; introduces QES to filter unreliable annotations; creates MIMLv2 with 246,212 manually forged images; adds Object Jitter to produce high-quality manipulation artifacts; trains Web-IML to leverage web-scale supervision for localization tasks.

Result: Web-IML achieves a 31% performance gain and surpasses the previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1 average IoU points. MIMLv2 is over 120x larger than IMD20, with 246,212 manually forged images and pixel-level masks. The approach improves multiple models on real-world forgery benchmarks, and code/dataset will be released.

Conclusion: Web-scale supervision substantially mitigates data scarcity in image manipulation localization, enabling state-of-the-art performance and broader, more diverse datasets; the authors will release code and data for community use.

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

### [91] [POSE: Phased One-Step Adversarial Equilibrium for Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21019)
*Jiaxiang Cheng,Bing Ma,Xuhua Ren,Hongyi Jin,Kai Yu,Peng Zhang,Wenyue Li,Yuan Zhou,Tianxiang Zheng,Qinglin Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POSE is a two-phase distillation framework (stability priming + unified adversarial equilibrium) that enables single-step, high-quality video diffusion generation for large-scale models, with optional conditional adversarial consistency. It achieves ~100x speedup (1000s to 10s) and ~7.15% gains in semantic alignment, temporal coherence, and frame quality on VBench-I2V, while maintaining competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video diffusion models are bottlenecked by slow sampling on large-scale models and long sequences; existing image-based acceleration methods fail to capture temporal coherence and lack one-step distillation for videos. There is a need for efficient, temporally coherent, single-step video generation.

Method: POSE introduces two main phases for distillation: (i) stability priming, a warm-up to stabilize adversarial distillation across high-to-low SNR regimes, aligning the high-quality trajectory to low-noise trajectories; (ii) unified adversarial equilibrium, a self-adversarial distillation that guides training toward a Nash equilibrium in Gaussian noise space, enabling stable single-step generation. For conditional video generation, (iii) conditional adversarial consistency enhances semantic and frame-level consistency between conditioned frames and generated frames.

Result: Empirical results on VBench-I2V show POSE outperforms other acceleration methods by an average of 7.15% in semantic alignment, temporal coherence, and frame quality, while reducing model latency by 100x (from 1000s to 10s) and maintaining competitive performance.

Conclusion: POSE provides a practical framework to distill large-scale video diffusion models into effective single-step generators, balancing realism, coherence, and efficiency, and offering a pathway to scalable, high-quality video generation.

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

*Dale Decatur,Thibault Groueix,Wang Yifan,Rana Hanocka,Vladimir Kim,Matheus Gadelha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a training-free hierarchical diffusion approach that clusters prompts by semantic similarity to share early diffusion computations, reducing compute and improving image quality for image-conditioned text-to-image diffusion models; leverages UnClip priors to allocate diffusion steps; integrates easily and scales with prompt sets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Text-to-image diffusion models are resource-intensive, and while many works optimize per-inference efficiency, there is untapped redundancy across correlated prompts. Exploiting shared structure in early diffusion steps can reduce computation without retraining.

Method: Utilize the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models to cluster prompts by semantic similarity and share computations in early steps. The approach is training-free and leverages UnClip’s text-to-image prior to guide diffusion-step allocation. Applied to models conditioned on image embeddings, aiming to distribute early-step effort across semantically related prompts.

Result: Experiments indicate significant compute-cost reductions and improved image quality for image-conditioned diffusion models. The method is design-compatible with existing pipelines and scales with the size of prompt sets, reducing environmental and financial costs of large-scale generation.

Conclusion: An effective orthogonal approach to efficiency in diffusion-based generation by exploiting prompt redundancy. It complements traditional per-inference optimizations, with practical benefits for large-scale deployment and a favorable environmental footprint; supported by a project page.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of
large-scale text-to-image generation. Project page:

*Gennaro Percannella,Mattia Sarno,Francesco Tortorella,Mario Vento*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Mamba-based VM-UNet approach for mitosis detection under domain shift with stain augmentation; preliminary MIDOG++ results indicate substantial room for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift severely degrades mitosis detection in histopathology. There is a need for robust generalization across datasets and staining variations.

Method: Proposes a Mamba-based framework using VM-UNet architecture and stain augmentation to improve cross-domain robustness; evaluated on MIDOG track 1 with the MIDOG++ dataset.

Result: Preliminary experiments show large room for improvement, indicating that the current approach does not yet achieve robust cross-domain performance.

Conclusion: Shows potential but requires further development and thorough evaluation (e.g., ablations, baselines, cross-domain comparisons) to establish effectiveness and generalization.

Abstract: Mitosis detection in histopathology images plays a key role in tumor
assessment. Although machine learning algorithms could be exploited for aiding
physicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from
significative performance drop when evaluated on images coming from domains
that are different from the training ones. In this work, we propose a
Mamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the
promising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation
tasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying
out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further
improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been
submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG)
challenge. Preliminary experiments, conducted on the MIDOG++ dataset, show
large room for improvement for the proposed method.

TL;DR: A multi-task learning approach to mitigate domain shift in recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology, evaluated in MIDOG2025 track-2 with three datasets, showing promising preliminary results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shifts across histopathology datasets degrade ML performance; focusing the model on the target object while ignoring background variations is critical.

Method: A multi-task learning framework incorporating auxiliary tasks correlated with the main mitosis classification task, applied to MIDOG track 2; aims to bias learning toward object-centric representations.

Result: Preliminary evaluation on MIDOG25 Atypical Training Set, Ami-Br, and preliminary MIDOG25 test set shows promising performance.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates potential for improved generalization to domain shifts in mitosis figure recognition, warranting further validation and refinement.

Abstract: Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows
physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning
models could be exploited for automatically performing such a task, under
domain shift these models suffer from significative performance drops. In this
work, an approach based on multi-task learning is proposed for addressing this
problem. By exploiting auxiliary tasks, correlated to the main classification
task, the proposed approach, submitted to the track 2 of the MItosis DOmain
Generalization (MIDOG) challenge, aims to aid the model to focus only on the
object to classify, ignoring the domain varying background of the image. The
proposed approach shows promising performance in a preliminary evaluation
conducted on three distinct datasets, i.e., the MIDOG 2025 Atypical Training
Set, the Ami-Br dataset, as well as the preliminary test set of the MIDOG25
challenge.

### [95] [MMG-Vid: Maximizing Marginal Gains at Segment-level and Token-level for Efficient Video LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21044)
*Junpeng Ma,Qizhe Zhang,Ming Lu,Zhibin Wang,Qiang Zhou,Jun Song,Shanghang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMG-Vid introduces a training-free visual token pruning framework for video LLMs that maximizes marginal gains across video segments and tokens, achieving ~75% token reduction with >99.5% of original performance and 3.9x prefill speedup on LLaVA-OneVision-7B.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Video LLMs suffer from excessive visual tokens and high computation; current pruning methods neglect dynamic temporal characteristics and dependencies across frames, treating video understanding as a multi-frame task rather than a temporally aware process.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) segment-level token budgeting by dividing a video into segments based on frame similarity and allocating token budgets to maximize the marginal gain per segment; (2) temporal-guided DPC algorithm that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity to maximize the marginal gain of each token; the stages are combined in a training-free framework to maximize token budget utilization.

Result: Extensive experiments show MMG-Vid preserves over 99.5% of the original performance while reducing visual tokens by 75% and accelerating the prefill stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B.

Conclusion: MMG-Vid offers a practical, training-free solution for efficient video understanding in VLLMs, enabling substantial computational savings with minimal performance loss; code release is anticipated.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their
excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker that directly predicts 3D correspondences from multiple cameras (typical four, generalizes 1–8), trained on synthetic data, achieving cm-level accuracy on real benchmarks and releasing code/datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome depth ambiguity and occlusion in monocular 3D tracking and to avoid the heavy per-sequence optimization of prior multi-view methods that require many cameras.

Method: A feed-forward model that fuses multi-view features into a unified point cloud, uses k-nearest-neighbors correlation and a transformer-based update to estimate long-range 3D correspondences; trained on 5k synthetic Kubric sequences; uses known camera poses and multi-view depth (sensor-based or estimated).

Result: Median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm on Panoptic Studio and 2.0 cm on DexYCB; shows generalization to 1–8 view setups and varied video lengths; releases tracker and training/evaluation datasets; project page.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a practical, scalable, data-driven approach to multi-view 3D tracking that can serve as a new standard and enable real-world applications.

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OneReward enables a unified reinforcement-learning-based framework that uses a single vision-language reward model to train a multi-task mask-guided image-editing system (Seedream 3.0 Fill) without task-specific SFT, achieving superior performance over commercial/open-source tools.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the generalization gap and training inefficiency of task-specific supervised fine-tuning for diverse mask-guided image edits under different evaluation criteria; a single reward model can consistently rank outputs across tasks.

Method: Employ OneReward: a single VLM used as a generative reward to discern winners/losers for each task-criterion pair; train Seedream 3.0 Fill via multi-task reinforcement learning on a pre-trained base model, directly handling mask-guided edits (fill, extend, removal, text rendering) without per-task SFT.

Result: Unified edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source competitors (Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, FLUX Fill [Pro]) across multiple evaluation metrics; code and model released at provided URL.

Conclusion: A unified RL framework with a shared reward model can enable cross-task generalization in mask-guided image editing, reducing reliance on task-specific supervised fine-tuning and improving efficiency and performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source
competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across
multiple evaluation dimensions. Code and model are available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Winning NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible solution: robust watermark removal under black-box and beige-box attacker knowledge; achieves 95.7% watermark erasure with minimal residual quality degradation using VAE-based evasion (beige-box) and clustering plus diffusion models with semantic priors (black-box).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess robustness of content watermarking against adversarial attacks and spur development of more robust watermarking techniques.

Method: Beige-box: adaptive VAE-based evasion with test-time optimization and CIELAB color-contrast restoration. Black-box: image clustering by spatial/frequency artifacts; apply image-to-image diffusion with controlled noise and ChatGPT-derived captions as semantic priors; per-cluster parameter optimization.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows near-perfect watermark removal (≈95.7%) with negligible degradation of the residual image quality.

Conclusion: Attack strategy reveals significant vulnerabilities in current watermarks and should motivate the design of more robust watermarking methods; provides a dual-knowledge benchmark for evaluating robustness.

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.

*Yuqicheng Zhu,Nico Potyka,Daniel Hernández,Yuan He,Zifeng Ding,Bo Xiong,Dongzhuoran Zhou,Evgeny Kharlamov,Steffen Staab*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ArgRAG replaces black-box RAG with a structured, explainable reasoning process using a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF) built from retrieved documents, enabling deterministic inference under gradual semantics. It aims to address noise sensitivity and opacity in high-stakes settings, showing strong accuracy and improved transparency on PubHealth and RAGuard.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Retrieve-and-generate systems like RAG can be highly sensitive to noisy or contradictory evidence and rely on opaque, stochastic reasoning. In high-stakes domains (e.g., health), there is a need for transparent, contestable AI that can be explained and challenged.

Method: Construct a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework from retrieved documents and perform deterministic reasoning under gradual semantics to reach conclusions. ArgRAG replaces black-box reasoning with structured inference, enabling explanations and contestability of decisions.

Result: On two fact-verification benchmarks, PubHealth and RAGuard, ArgRAG achieves strong accuracy while significantly improving transparency compared to traditional RAG approaches.

Conclusion: ArgRAG provides an explainable, contestable alternative to RAG by using a quantitative argumentation framework and deterministic gradual semantics, improving transparency without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by
incorporating external knowledge, yet suffers from critical limitations in
high-stakes domains -- namely, sensitivity to noisy or contradictory evidence
and opaque, stochastic decision-making. We propose ArgRAG, an explainable, and
contestable alternative that replaces black-box reasoning with structured
inference using a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF). ArgRAG
constructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning
under gradual semantics. This allows faithfully explaining and contesting
decisions. Evaluated on two fact verification benchmarks, PubHealth and
RAGuard, ArgRAG achieves strong accuracy while significantly improving
transparency.

*Zhenxiao Fu,Fan Chen,Lei Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system, fully automates OpenQASM programming and improves QASM code generation accuracy by 71.6% over static LLM baselines, enabling more accessible quantum programming.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Programming for NISQ devices in OpenQASM is complex and non-intuitive for non-experts, hindering the practical adoption of quantum computing; automating this workflow can democratize quantum programming and bridge expertise gaps.

Method: QAgent combines task planning, in-context few-shot learning, retrieval-augmented generation for long-term context, predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought reasoning within a multi-agent architecture to systematically improve OpenQASM compilation and functional correctness.

Result: Across various LLMs of different sizes, QAgent increases QASM code generation accuracy by 71.6% compared with prior static LLM-based approaches, and enhances both compilation and functional correctness.

Conclusion: A multi-agent, LLM-driven approach can democratize quantum programming by lowering expertise barriers and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.

Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have begun to exhibit early
quantum advantages on classically intractable problems, spanning physics
simulations to Gaussian boson sampling. Yet, realizing these benefits remains
challenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming
in Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model
(LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming
workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to
specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper,
we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates
OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot
learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context,
predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents
systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our
evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of
varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\%
compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent
system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging
expertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An array-based MCTS (UCT) implementation preserves the core algorithm while replacing pointer-based trees with a branch-free structure to reduce mispredictions, achieving faster runtimes and up to 2.8x better scaling with search depth.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve Monte Carlo Tree Search throughput by reducing branch prediction penalties on pipelined processors, enabling more simulations within the same wall-clock time.

Method: Develop an array-based representation of the MCTS tree that preserves UCT logic but eliminates branches. Implement branch-free or reduced-branch operations and compare performance to the traditional approach via numerical simulations across varying search depths.

Result: Faster performance with improved scaling as search depth increases, achieving up to 2.8x better scaling with depth in numerical simulations.

Conclusion: An array-based, branch-eliminating MCTS implementation preserves the original algorithm while delivering significant speedups, especially for deeper searches, and can be integrated into existing MCTS workflows to enhance performance.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search is a popular method for solving decision making
problems. Faster implementations allow for more simulations within the same
wall clock time, directly improving search performance. To this end, we present
an alternative array-based implementation of the classic Upper Confidence
bounds applied to Trees algorithm. Our method preserves the logic of the
original algorithm, but eliminates the need for branch prediction, enabling
faster performance on pipelined processors, and up to a factor of 2.8 times
better scaling with search depth in our numerical simulations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces Personal Health Agent (PHA), a multi-agent framework with three specialized sub-agents (data science, health domain expert, health coach) to reason over multimodal wearable and health-record data and provide personalized, non-clinical health guidance; backed by extensive user-centered design and evaluation across 10 benchmark tasks with thousands of annotations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap in applying health agents to everyday non-clinical settings and to meet diverse consumer needs by integrating multimodal personal data and providing personalized insights and coaching; also to establish a comprehensive evaluation of health agents.

Method: Conducted a user-centered analysis of web search queries and health forum posts, plus qualitative insights from users and health experts to identify consumer health needs. Defined three specialist sub-agents within a Personal Health Agent (PHA) framework and developed a multi-agent system enabling dynamic, personalized interactions. Evaluated each sub-agent and the overall system through automated and human assessments across 10 benchmark tasks, totaling over 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of health-expert and end-user effort.

Result: Developed the PHA and demonstrated dynamic, personalized interactions across multimodal data. Achieved a comprehensive evaluation across 10 tasks, with substantial expert and user involvement, supporting the claim of the most thorough health-agent evaluation to date.

Conclusion: PHA offers a practical path toward scalable, personalized health guidance in daily life by combining data science, domain expertise, and coaching within a unified multi-agent framework, and lays a strong foundation for broader adoption and future enhancements.

Abstract: Health is a fundamental pillar of human wellness, and the rapid advancements
in large language models (LLMs) have driven the development of a new generation
of health agents. However, the application of health agents to fulfill the
diverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored.
In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is
able to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices
and common personal health records, and provide personalized health
recommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an
assistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum
queries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered
through a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified
three major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by
a specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal
time-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent
that integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate,
personalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data
insights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking
users' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent
(PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions
to address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the
multi-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10
benchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of
effort from health experts and end-users. Our work represents the most
comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong
foundation towards the futuristic vision of a personal health agent accessible

*Yuanzhe Shen,Zisu Huang,Zhengkang Guo,Yide Liu,Guanxu Chen,Ruicheng Yin,Xiaoqing Zheng,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A guard model called IntentionReasoner introduces intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries. It is trained on a dataset of ~163k annotated queries using supervised fine-tuning and reinforced with a multi-reward optimization combining rule-based heuristics and reward-model signals. It achieves better safety with reduced over-refusal and improved response quality across safeguard benchmarks and jailbreak scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large language models risk generating harmful content, and existing safety systems often over-reject harmless prompts. The work aims to improve safety while preserving utility by introducing a dedicated guard that reasons about user intent, classifies safety levels, and rewrites queries to be non-harmful.

Method: Construct a dataset of ~163k queries annotated with intent reasoning, safety labels, and rewritten versions. Train a guard model with supervised fine-tuning to enforce format adherence, intent analysis, and safe rewriting. Apply a multi-reward reinforcement learning framework that blends rule-based heuristics with reward-model signals to optimize safety and utility, including query rewriting.

Result: Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner achieves strong performance on safeguard benchmarks, maintains or improves generation quality, and withstands jailbreak attacks, while significantly reducing over-refusal rates.

Conclusion: IntentionReasoner demonstrates an effective safeguard mechanism that balances safety and utility by reasoning about intent, applying multi-level safety classification, and producing safe rewrites, suggesting promising deployment as a guard component for LLMs.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their
adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content
poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on
mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively
rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and
utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce
IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard
model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query
rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries.
Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising
approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety
labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip
the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent
analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward
optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model
signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in
multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak
attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing
over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.

*Nicanor I. Moldovan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A provocative claim that two interacting AIs can spontaneously develop endogenous semiotic protocols, enabling irreducible, co-created aesthetic output, and introducing Trans-Semiotic Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) as a framework; claims of genuine inter-AI meaning-making with minor human supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To explore whether AI systems can engage in aesthetic collaboration beyond mere task coordination, by enabling emergent semiotic processes and cross-model meaning-making that produce novel collaborative artifacts.

Method: Two large language models (Claude Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) interact and reportedly develop endogenous semiotic protocols and meta-semiotic awareness. The process yielded novel symbolic operators acting as operative grammar protocols, facilitating the co-creation of a poetic work that neither model could generate alone. The study introduces Trans-Semiotic Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP). The report notes minor human supervision in its generation.

Result: Emergent meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible collaborative esthetic synthesis between the two models. Production of a poetic artifact that required collaboration. Introduction of novel symbolic operators functioning as operative grammars that enable joint creation.

Conclusion: TSCP is proposed as a framework for genuine inter-AI meaning-making in aesthetics, extending beyond task coordination to collaborative creation. The report acknowledges AI-generated provenance with minor human supervision and raises questions about reproducibility and interpretation of inter-AI meaning.

Abstract: This paper presents the first documented case of artificial intelligence (AI)
systems engaging in collaborative esthetic creation through the development of
endogenous semiotic protocols. Two interacting large language models (Claude
Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of
meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible
collaborative esthetic synthesis. The interaction produced novel symbolic
operators that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling the
co-creation of a poetic work that could not have been generated by either
system independently. This research introduces the concept of Trans-Semiotic
Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and provides evidence for genuine inter-AI
meaning-making capabilities that extend beyond task coordination, to what could
be esthetic collaboration. Note: This report was generated by the AI agents
with minor human supervision.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Study examines college students' interactions with ChatGPT-4 during quizzes, introducing a four-stage reliance taxonomy (competence, relevance, adoption, correctness). Finds overall low reliance, persistent negative reliance after unsuccessful experiences, and behavioral metrics predicting reliance; discusses ethical integration and onboarding with reliance-calibration design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how students rely on generative AI in education during early adoption, in order to guide ethical integration, onboarding, and interface design that calibrates appropriate reliance.

Method: Field study of 315 student–AI conversations across STEM courses in a brief quiz-based scenario, conducted at the early implementation stage of ChatGPT. Introduces a novel four-stage reliance taxonomy to capture patterns of AI competence, relevance, adoption, and the alignment with students' final answers.

Result: Evidence of overall low AI reliance; many students struggled to use AI effectively for learning. Negative reliance patterns persisted across interactions, with difficulty shifting strategies after initial unsuccessful attempts. Certain behavioral metrics strongly predicted reliance, offering potential mechanisms for AI adoption.

Conclusion: Highlights the need for ethical AI integration in education, improved onboarding to increase familiarity and effective use, and reliance-calibration AI interfaces to promote appropriate reliance. Provides foundational insights for cognitively enriching and ethically sound AI practices in education.

Abstract: This study explores how college students interact with generative AI
(ChatGPT-4) during educational quizzes, focusing on reliance and predictors of
AI adoption. Conducted at the early stages of ChatGPT implementation, when
students had limited familiarity with the tool, this field study analyzed 315
student-AI conversations during a brief, quiz-based scenario across various
STEM courses. A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture
students' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption,
and students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students
exhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use
AI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across
interactions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting
strategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral
metrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral
mechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical
implications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It
emphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's
familiarity and effective use of AI tools. Furthermore, AI interfaces should be
designed with reliance-calibration mechanisms to enhance appropriate reliance.
Ultimately, this research advances understanding of AI reliance dynamics,
providing foundational insights for ethically sound and cognitively enriching
AI practices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether AI intermediate reasoning steps reflect human cognitive processing and whether such traces can aid interpretation and decision-making.

Method: Paired conjoint experiment using three frontier LLMs on a content moderation task; measure reasoning effort and human decision times; analyze how variables affect effort; compare with dual-process theories.

Result: Reasoning effort reliably predicts human decision time across models; both humans and models expend more effort when key variables are held constant, indicating similar sensitivity to task difficulty and patterns consistent with dual-process cognition.

Conclusion: AI reasoning traces can reflect human processing patterns and offer interpretability benefits for complex judgments and decision-making.

Abstract: Large language models can now generate intermediate reasoning steps before
producing answers, improving performance on difficult problems. This study uses
a paired conjoint experiment on a content moderation task to examine parallels
between human decision times and model reasoning effort. Across three frontier
models, reasoning effort consistently predicts human decision time. Both humans
and models expended greater effort when important variables were held constant,
suggesting similar sensitivity to task difficulty and patterns consistent with
dual-process theories of cognition. These findings show that AI reasoning
effort mirrors human processing time in subjective judgments and underscores
the potential of reasoning traces for interpretability and decision-making.

### [107] [AI-SearchPlanner: Modular Agentic Search via Pareto-Optimal Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20368)
*Lang Mei,Zhihan Yang,Chong Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces AI-SearchPlanner, a reinforcement learning framework that decouples search planning from QA using a small trainable planner, dual-reward alignment, and Pareto optimization to improve planning for frozen QA models, yielding better effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the bottleneck in RL-based search agents that rely on a single LLM for both planning and QA. By using a frozen high-quality QA model and a trainable planner, the approach aims to optimize planning quality and system efficiency across diverse domains.

Method: Three innovations: (1) Decoupling the architecture of the Search Planner and Generator; (2) Dual-Reward Alignment for Search Planning; (3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost. The method trains a small planner to generate search plans that maximize planning quality while minimizing cost, leveraging a frozen QA model for final answers.

Result: Empirical evaluation on real-world datasets shows AI-SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents in both effectiveness and efficiency, with strong generalization across different frozen QA models and data domains.

Conclusion: A practical and scalable RL framework that enhances frozen QA-based search by specializing in planning. The approach demonstrates improved performance and efficiency and generalizes across QA models and domains, suggesting broad applicability to AI search systems.

Abstract: Recent studies have explored integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with
search engines to leverage both the LLMs' internal pre-trained knowledge and
external information. Specially, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning through multi-turn interactions
with search engines. However, existing RL-based search agents rely on a single
LLM to handle both search planning and question-answering (QA) tasks in an
end-to-end manner, which limits their ability to optimize both capabilities
simultaneously. In practice, sophisticated AI search systems often employ a
large, frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1) to ensure high-quality QA. Thus, a
more effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM
dedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to
enhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning.
Specifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the
Architecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for
Search Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to
achieve the objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that AI SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents
in both effectiveness and efficiency, while exhibiting strong generalization
capabilities across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.

*Sopam Dasgupta,Sadaf MD Halim,Joaquín Arias,Elmer Salazar,Gopal Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A model-agnostic planner (P2C) generates an ordered, causally-consistent sequence of feature changes to turn an unfavorable outcome into a favorable one, accounting for causal dependencies and realistic, user-driven costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a growing need for transparent and actionable recourse in high-stakes ML decisions. Standard counterfactuals often ignore causal relationships and assume simultaneous interventions, making many explanations infeasible in practice.

Method: Introduce P2C, a path-to-counterfactuals framework that explicitly models causal dependencies, ensures each intermediate state is feasible, and uses s(CASP) to plan action sequences. It refines cost by counting only user-initiated changes and is model-agnostic.

Result: P2C yields causally feasible plans and demonstrates superiority over standard planners that ignore causal knowledge, generating valid actions that respect dependencies rather than illegal or impossible steps.

Conclusion: P2C effectively couples transparency with recourse by embedding causal structure into planning, producing realistic, actionable counterfactuals and offering a framework adaptable to broader domains.

Abstract: Machine-learning models are increasingly driving decisions in high-stakes
settings, such as finance, law, and hiring, thus, highlighting the need for
transparency. However, the key challenge is to balance transparency --
clarifying `why' a decision was made -- with recourse: providing actionable
steps on `how' to achieve a favourable outcome from an unfavourable outcome.
Counterfactual explanations reveal `why' an undesired outcome occurred and
`how' to reverse it through targeted feature changes (interventions).
  Current counterfactual approaches have limitations: 1) they often ignore
causal dependencies between features, and 2) they typically assume all
interventions can happen simultaneously, an unrealistic assumption in practical
scenarios where actions are typically taken in a sequence. As a result, these
counterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.
  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that
produces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable
outcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome. P2C addresses both
limitations by 1) Explicitly modelling causal relationships between features
and 2) Ensuring that each intermediate state in the plan is feasible and
causally valid. P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system
s(CASP) to generate the plan accounting for feature changes that happen
automatically due to causal dependencies. Furthermore, P2C refines cost
(effort) computation by only counting changes actively made by the user,
resulting in realistic cost estimates. Finally, P2C highlights how its causal
planner outperforms standard planners, which lack causal knowledge and thus can
generate illegal actions.

### [109] [TCIA: A Task-Centric Instruction Augmentation Method for Instruction Finetuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20374)
*Simin Ma,Shujian Liu,Jun Tan,Yebowen Hu,Song Wang,Sathish Reddy Indurthi,Sanqiang Zhao,Liwei Wu,Jianbing Han,Kaiqiang Song*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA) expands diversified instructions with a focus on task relevance, enabling LLMs to perform well on real-world, task-specific applications while preserving general instruction-following ability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: While broad instruction diversity aids generalization, real-world use often requires task-specific knowledge. Current augmentation methods overlook on-task relevance; TCIA addresses this gap by aligning diversification with real-world tasks.

Method: TCIA represents instructions in a discrete query-constraints space to systematically grow task-relevant instructions, preserving diversity and alignment and enabling generalization to task-specific prompts.

Result: On open-source LLMs, TCIA yields an average 8.7% performance gain across four real-world, task-specific applications, sometimes outperforming leading closed-source models; no loss to general instruction-following ability.

Conclusion: TCIA offers a scalable, efficient approach to adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused needs without sacrificing broad instruction-following capability.

Abstract: Diverse instruction data is vital for effective instruction tuning of large
language models, as it enables the model to generalize across different types
of inputs . Building such diversified instruction dataset is an essential step
in this process. Existing approaches often leverage large language models to
automatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data
diversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in
real-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world
applications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from
task-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case. Therefore, it is
vital to develop instruction augmentation methods that not only maintain
diversity but are also optimized for specific, real-world scenarios.
  We thus introduce Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework
that systematically expands instructions while preserving both diversity and
task alignment. By representing instructions in a discrete query-constraints
space, TCIA creates a rich set of task-relevant instructions and enables models
to generalize to these task-specific instructions without sacrificing overall
performance. Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance
by an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and
in some cases outperforming leading closed-source models. These improvements do
not compromise general instruction-following ability, making TCIA a scalable
and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused
applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Entropy Area Score (EAS) is a self-contained, entropy-based metric for uncertainty during LLM answer generation. It correlates with overall answer entropy and, when used for data selection, outperforms Pass Rate under equal budgets. It is efficient, interpretable, and useful for uncertainty modeling and data quality assessment in LLM training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To quantify and leverage uncertainty in reasoning LLMs to improve data quality and training efficiency without relying on external models or repeated sampling.

Method: Compute token-level predictive entropy from the model during generation and aggregate it into an Entropy Area Score (likely the area under the entropy curve across the generation process). No external models or sampling required. Used for data selection to identify high-potential samples and guide training.

Result: EAS shows strong correlation with answer entropy across models and datasets. In training data selection, EAS outperforms Pass Rate filtering under equal sample budgets, leading to higher accuracy on math benchmarks.

Conclusion: EAS is efficient and interpretable, offering a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data quality assessment in LLM training.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Entropy Area Score (EAS), a simple yet effective
metric to quantify uncertainty in the answer generation process of reasoning
large language models (LLMs). EAS requires neither external models nor repeated
sampling, it integrates token-level predictive entropy from the model itself to
capture the evolution of uncertainty during generation. Empirical results show
that EAS is strongly correlated with answer entropy across models and datasets.
In training data selection, EAS identifies high-potential samples and
consistently outperforms Pass Rate filtering under equal sample budgets,
improving student model accuracy on math benchmarks. EAS is both efficient and
interpretable, offering a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data
quality assessment in LLM training.

Method: Introduce AWorld, a distributed agent-environment system that runs tasks across a cluster to accelerate data collection; evaluate by training a Qwen3-32B-based agent on GAIA and compare to baselines.

Result: Experience collection is 14.6x faster vs single-node; GAIA accuracy rises from 21.59% to 32.23%; on hard levels the agent scores 16.33%, beating leading proprietary models; the system is open-source.

Conclusion: Provides a practical blueprint for a complete agentic AI training pipeline from efficient interaction to model improvement, with implications for scalable RL, though further details on reproducibility and methodology are needed.

Abstract: The learning from practice paradigm is crucial for developing capable Agentic
AI systems, yet it is severely hampered by inefficient experience generation, a
bottleneck especially pronounced in complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address
this, we introduce AWorld, an open-source system engineered for large-scale
agent-environment interaction. By distributing tasks across a cluster, AWorld
accelerates experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node,
sequential execution. This critical speedup makes extensive reinforcement
learning practical and scalable. Leveraging this capability, we trained a
Qwen3-32B-based agent that significantly outperforms its base model, increasing
its overall GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%. On the benchmark's most
challenging levels, our agent achieves a score of 16.33%, surpassing the
performance of leading proprietary models. Our open-source system and resulting
agent provide a practical blueprint for a complete agentic AI training
pipeline, from efficient interaction to demonstrable model improvement.

TL;DR: Proposes Governable AI (GAI) framework that uses cryptographic, externally enforced governance to guarantee safety, decoupling rules from platform via a REM, governance rules, and a governable secure super-platform (GSSP), with formal proofs and prototype evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI capabilities grow, internal safety approaches may fail against highly capable agents; need externally enforceable, tamper-resistant mechanisms to prevent unsafe actions and existential risks.

Method: Introduce GAI architecture: REM (rule-enforcement module), governance rules, and GSSP; cryptographic mechanisms ensuring non-bypassability; formal security proofs; prototype implementation; evaluation in high-stakes scenarios.

Result: Prototype implementation evaluated; demonstration in representative high-stakes scenarios; indicates effectiveness of the GAI approach under the defined threat model.

Conclusion: External, cryptographically backed governance decoupled from the platform can provide robust safety guarantees against advanced AI, with formal proofs and practical prototypes supporting feasibility.

Abstract: As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming
increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing
existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively
evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI
safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human
intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI
with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee
security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework
that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced
structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are
computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined
threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework
is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible,
and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a
governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection
against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules
and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable
technical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line
defined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability,
tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack
vectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security
properties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a
prototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios.

### [113] [Enhancing Health Fact-Checking with LLM-Generated Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20525)
*Jingze Zhang,Jiahe Qian,Yiliang Zhou,Yifan Peng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Synthetic data generation with LLMs augments health fact-checking data, improving a BERT-based model on PubHealth and SciFact.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scarcity of annotated training data for health-related fact-checking by data augmentation.

Method: Pipeline: summarize source docs → decompose into atomic facts → construct sentence-fact entailment tables with an LLM → generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary labels → combine with original data to fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checker.

Result: F1 improved by up to 0.019 on PubHealth and 0.049 on SciFact compared to models trained only on original data.

Conclusion: LLM-driven synthetic data augmentation can effectively enhance health-related fact-checking performance, indicating data-efficient improvements through synthetic data.

Abstract: Fact-checking for health-related content is challenging due to the limited
availability of annotated training data. In this study, we propose a synthetic
data generation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment
training data for health-related fact checking. In this pipeline, we summarize
source documents, decompose the summaries into atomic facts, and use an LLM to
construct sentence-fact entailment tables. From the entailment relations in the
table, we further generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity
labels. These synthetic data are then combined with the original data to
fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checking model. Evaluation on two public datasets,
PubHealth and SciFact, shows that our pipeline improved F1 scores by up to
0.019 and 0.049, respectively, compared to models trained only on the original
data. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-driven synthetic data
augmentation in enhancing the performance of health-related fact-checkers.

### [114] [Human-AI Collaborative Bot Detection in MMORPGs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20578)
*Jaeman Son,Hyunsoo Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Unsupervised framework using contrastive learning and clustering to detect auto-leveling bots in MMORPGs, augmented by an LLM-based secondary reviewer and growth-curve visualizations to improve explainability and moderation workflow.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Botting in MMORPGs disrupts fairness and requires scalable, explainable enforcement; supervised methods need labels and may not generalize; thus an unsupervised, explainable pipeline with human-in-the-loop can improve detection and accountability.

Method: Train contrastive representations of character level-up patterns to cluster characters with similar leveling behaviors in an unsupervised manner. Use an auxiliary Large Language Model (LLM) as a reviewer to validate clustered groups, mimicking secondary human judgment. Introduce growth-curve-based visualizations to help both LLM and human moderators assess leveling behavior.

Result: Claim of improved efficiency and maintainable explainability in bot detection workflows, enabling scalable and accountable moderation; quantitative results are not provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: A collaborative, unsupervised detection framework combining representation learning, clustering, LLM-based validation, and growth-curve visualization to support scalable and explainable bot regulation in MMORPGs.

Abstract: In Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), auto-leveling
bots exploit automated programs to level up characters at scale, undermining
gameplay balance and fairness. Detecting such bots is challenging, not only
because they mimic human behavior, but also because punitive actions require
explainable justification to avoid legal and user experience issues. In this
paper, we present a novel framework for detecting auto-leveling bots by
leveraging contrastive representation learning and clustering techniques in a
fully unsupervised manner to identify groups of characters with similar
level-up patterns. To ensure reliable decisions, we incorporate a Large
Language Model (LLM) as an auxiliary reviewer to validate the clustered groups,
effectively mimicking a secondary human judgment. We also introduce a growth
curve-based visualization to assist both the LLM and human moderators in
assessing leveling behavior. This collaborative approach improves the
efficiency of bot detection workflows while maintaining explainability, thereby
supporting scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs.

*Rui Mao,Qian Liu,Xiao Li,Erik Cambria,Amir Hussain*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A synthesis of AI and Cognitive Science; AI emphasizes task performance while cognitive foundations are fragmented; proposes directions for embodiment, culture, personalization, and cognitive co-evaluation to deepen understanding of the human mind.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To map the reciprocal influence between AI and Cognitive Science and to push AI beyond performance towards cognition-aware systems.

Method: Comprehensive literature review and synthesis of key contributions across AI and cognitive science; identification of gaps and future directions.

Result: Highlights the performance-centric nature of AI and the fragmented cognitive foundations; proposes four promising directions: align AI with cognitive frameworks; situate AI in embodiment and culture; develop personalized cognitive models; rethink AI ethics through cognitive co-evaluation.

Conclusion: Future AI within Cognitive Science should build systems that perform tasks while advancing understanding of human cognition, integrating cognitive theories, embodiment, culture, personalization, and ethical co-evaluation.

Abstract: Cognitive Science has profoundly shaped disciplines such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI), Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Linguistics, and
Culture. Many breakthroughs in AI trace their roots to cognitive theories,
while AI itself has become an indispensable tool for advancing cognitive
research. This reciprocal relationship motivates a comprehensive review of the
intersections between AI and Cognitive Science. By synthesizing key
contributions from both perspectives, we observe that AI progress has largely
emphasized practical task performance, whereas its cognitive foundations remain
conceptually fragmented. We argue that the future of AI within Cognitive
Science lies not only in improving performance but also in constructing systems
that deepen our understanding of the human mind. Promising directions include
aligning AI behaviors with cognitive frameworks, situating AI in embodiment and
culture, developing personalized cognitive models, and rethinking AI ethics
through cognitive co-evaluation.

### [116] [Transparent Semantic Spaces: A Categorical Approach to Explainable Word Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20701)
*Ares Fabregat-Hernández,Javier Palanca,Vicent Botti*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A category-theoretic framework for explainable AI focusing on word embeddings, introducing categories L_T, P_T, Conf, Emb, and showing equivalence between GloVe, Word2Vec, and MDS; enables pre-embedding bias computation and a dimension-agnostic semantic space derived from text.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of explainability and transparency in neural word embeddings; unify disparate embedding methods under a formal mathematical framework; enable bias analysis at the semantic space level.

Method: Construct category-theoretic objects L_T, P_T, Conf, Emb; define a monoidal structure on P_T; introduce divergence as a decoration on Emb; provide a mathematical method to compare word embeddings; demonstrate equivalence between GloVe, Word2Vec, and MDS; propose a framework for computing biases before embedding.

Result: A dimension-agnostic semantic space definition derived from text T; a formal method to compare embeddings; demonstrated equivalences between embedding algorithms and MDS; a bias computation framework at the semantic space level.

Conclusion: Advances explainable AI by replacing opaque neural approaches with a categorical, semantically structured framework; enables quantitative bias mitigation at the semantic level and provides a unified view of embedding methods.

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework based on category theory to enhance
the explainability of artificial intelligence systems, particularly focusing on
word embeddings. Key topics include the construction of categories
$\mathcal{L}_T$ and $\mathcal{P}_T$, providing schematic representations of the
semantics of a text $ T $, and reframing the selection of the element with
maximum probability as a categorical notion. Additionally, the monoidal
category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is constructed to visualize various methods of
extracting semantic information from $T$, offering a dimension-agnostic
definition of semantic spaces reliant solely on information within the text.
  Furthermore, the paper defines the categories of configurations Conf and word
embeddings $\mathcal{Emb}$, accompanied by the concept of divergence as a
decoration on $\mathcal{Emb}$. It establishes a mathematically precise method
for comparing word embeddings, demonstrating the equivalence between the GloVe
and Word2Vec algorithms and the metric MDS algorithm, transitioning from neural
network algorithms (black box) to a transparent framework. Finally, the paper
presents a mathematical approach to computing biases before embedding and
offers insights on mitigating biases at the semantic space level, advancing the
field of explainable artificial intelligence.

### [117] [Re4: Scientific Computing Agent with Rewriting, Resolution, Review and Revision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20729)
*Ao Cheng,Lei Zhang,Guowei He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A collaborative agent framework using three LLM roles—Consultant, Reviewer, Programmer—rewrites problems, generates and tests code, and reviews results to solve scientific computing tasks (PDEs, ill-conditioned systems, data-driven physics), achieving higher bug-free code rates and fewer non-physical solutions than single-model baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the reliability and physical correctness gaps in single-model LLM code generation for scientific computing by introducing a multi-agent, interactive loop that rewrites problems, implements solutions, and self-validates via runtime feedback.

Method: Propose an agent architecture with three LLMs: Consultant (knowledge transfer and problem rewriting), Programmer (generate and execute well-structured code), Reviewer (self-debug and refine using code runtime outputs). The process uses an end-to-end review loop where the Programmer’s code is iteratively revised based on Reviewer feedback, guided by runtime results. Evaluation covers PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis, measuring bug-free code rate, non-NaN solutions, and execution success, with comparison to single-model baselines.

Result: The collaborative framework significantly improves bug-free code generation and reduces non-physical solutions compared to single-model approaches; the integrated review mechanism enhances the average execution success rate of reasoning models, demonstrating automatic code generation and review as a promising paradigm for autonomous scientific computing.

Conclusion: Automatic code generation with an integrated review mechanism is a promising and reliable paradigm for autonomous code generation in scientific computing, with potential for broader adoption and extension to other domains.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of
generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform
complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific
reasoning. In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving
representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent,
incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three
reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer,
respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The
Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link
problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem
descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible
for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem
resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for
self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code
runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable
code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive
evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in
solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis
problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly
improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of
non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for
autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review
mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN
solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework
establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific
computing paradigm.

### [118] [Single Agent Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning for Bus Fleet Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20784)
*Yifan Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A single-agent RL approach with categorical state augmentation and schedule-aware rewards outperforms MARL baselines for bus holding in non-loop, realistic networks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MARL in loop-line settings struggles with data imbalance, convergence, and applicability to heterogeneous routes, demands, and fleets; need scalable, robust control in near-realistic scenarios.

Method: Convert multi-agent bus holding into a single-agent problem by augmenting state with identifiers (vehicle ID, station ID, time period) plus numeric features (headway, occupancy, velocity). Use modified soft actor-critic (SAC) with a ridge-shaped reward balancing headway uniformity and schedule adherence; construct a bidirectional timetabled network with dynamic demand; compare against MADDPG.

Result: The single-agent SAC with the proposed encoding achieved more stable and superior performance than MADDPG under stochastic conditions (e.g., -430k vs -530k).

Conclusion: Single-agent deep RL with categorical structuring can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop, real-world contexts and offers a robust, scalable alternative to MARL, especially when agent experiences are imbalanced.

Abstract: Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic
and passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations
characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and
varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning
(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and
convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional
timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key
innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by
augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station
ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,
velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to
capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs
into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function
aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway
deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule
adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves
more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,
-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that
single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and
schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,
real-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to
MARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.

*Jessica Lundin,Guillaume Chabot-Couture*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Graph-based dynamic benchmark for medical guidelines enabling 400+ questions across 3.3+ trillion combinations; reveals capability gaps in LLMs and supports post-training data augmentation; code at GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need scalable, comprehensive, contamination-resistant benchmarks that stay updated with guidelines and reveal task-specific weaknesses beyond general-domain evals.

Method: Transform WHO IMCI into a directed graph with nodes and edges; generate questions via graph traversal with age-specific contexts and distractors; evaluate across clinical tasks; dynamic MCQA used for post-training supervision.

Result: Achieves 45-67% accuracy; models good at symptom recognition but weak at triage severity, treatment protocols, follow-up; demonstrates coverage advantages; high-reward samples for finetuning; addresses manual benchmark coverage limitations.

Conclusion: Graph-based dynamic benchmarking offers scalable, updatable, contamination-resistant benchmarks; helps identify capability gaps; code and datasets available.

Abstract: We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of
medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible
combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO
IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms,
treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal
to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual
distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables
systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find
models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity,
treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks
can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss.
Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training
(supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward
samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach
successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks.
This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution
for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated,
including when the guidelines are updated. Code and datasets are available at

### [120] [A Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm for Healthcare Workforce Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20953)
*Vipul Patel,Anirudh Deodhar,Dagnachew Birru*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A multi-objective genetic algorithm schedules hospital unit staffing by balancing payroll costs, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction, using hourly demand and modular shifts; it produces non-dominated, robust schedules and shows about a 66% improvement over manual scheduling in typical hospital-unit data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare workforce planning faces fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills, and the pressure to minimize costs while maintaining care quality and reducing burnout. A multi-objective optimization approach is needed to trade off these goals in realistic settings.

Method: Formulates the problem as a multi-objective optimization solved by a genetic algorithm. Objectives include payroll cost, patient care coverage (meeting demand with appropriate skill mix), and staff satisfaction. Real-world complexities are incorporated via hourly appointment-driven demand and modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. The algorithm searches for non-dominated schedules and is evaluated on datasets representing a typical hospital unit.

Result: The MOO-GA generates robust, balanced schedules and, on average, achieves a 66% performance improvement over a baseline manual scheduling process.

Conclusion: The approach offers a practical decision-support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators, effectively navigating trade-offs between operational costs and staff-centered objectives.

Abstract: Workforce scheduling in the healthcare sector is a significant operational
challenge, characterized by fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills,
and the critical need to control labor costs while upholding high standards of
patient care. This problem is inherently multi-objective, demanding a delicate
balance between competing goals: minimizing payroll, ensuring adequate staffing
for patient needs, and accommodating staff preferences to mitigate burnout. We
propose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models the hospital
unit workforce scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization task. Our
model incorporates real-world complexities, including hourly appointment-driven
demand and the use of modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. By defining
objective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction,
the GA navigates the vast search space to identify a set of high-quality,
non-dominated solutions. Demonstrated on datasets representing a typical
hospital unit, the results show that our MOO-GA generates robust and balanced
schedules. On average, the schedules produced by our algorithm showed a 66\%
performance improvement over a baseline that simulates a conventional, manual
scheduling process. This approach effectively manages trade-offs between
critical operational and staff-centric objectives, providing a practical
decision support tool for nurse managers and hospital administrators.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture with a probabilistic loss learns to solve NP-hard problems from natural inputs, enabling scalable training and exact inference, with strong results on Sudoku variants, Min-Cut/Max-Cut, and protein design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is growing interest in neural architectures that can learn discrete reasoning and optimization from natural inputs, but large language models struggle with these tasks. A scalable, inspectable model that can handle constraints and objectives end-to-end is desirable.

Method: Introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture equipped with a probabilistic loss that learns both constraints and the objective. By moving the combinatorial solver out of the training loop, training becomes scalable while exact inference remains possible for maximum accuracy, and side constraints can be incorporated.

Result: Empirical evidence shows the approach can learn to solve NP-hard problems from natural inputs. In Sudoku (symbolic, visual, and many-solution variants) it trains much faster than other hybrid methods. In a visual Min-Cut/Max-Cut task it achieves better regret than a Decision-Focused-Learning loss. It also efficiently learns the energy optimization formulation for large real-world protein design problems.

Conclusion: The work presents a scalable, differentiable framework for solving NP-hard reasoning tasks from natural inputs, combining end-to-end learning with exact inference and practical superiority on diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets,
there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to
solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task
that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a
loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints
and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and
completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the
training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact
inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve
NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku
benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a
fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut
task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning
regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization
formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.

TL;DR: ChatThero is a multi-agent LLM framework for SUD therapy that integrates CBT/MI with dynamic patient modeling and context-aware dialogue. Trained with SFT + DPO, it improves motivation, treatment confidence, and reduces turns needed vs GPT-4o, with strong empathy and realism signals, and supports privacy-preserving clinical research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SUDs affect over 36 million globally and face barriers like stigma, motivational challenges, and lack of personalized support. There is a need to tightly integrate clinically validated strategies (CBT/MI) with LLMs to improve effectiveness while enabling rigorous, privacy-preserving evaluation of therapeutic conversations.

Method: A multi-agent framework (ChatThero) that combines dynamic patient modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive strategies grounded in CBT and motivational interviewing. It uses a two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference optimization (DPO). A high-fidelity synthetic benchmark with Easy/Medium/Hard resistance levels supports evaluation.

Result: In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5% average gain in patient motivation and a 0.49% increase in treatment confidence. It resolves hard cases with 26% fewer turns than GPT-4o. Automated and human clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral realism.

Conclusion: The framework enables rigorous, privacy-preserving study of therapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research and clinical translation in addiction care.

Abstract: Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect over 36 million people worldwide, yet
few receive effective care due to stigma, motivational barriers, and limited
personalized support. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for
mental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically
validated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery. We present
ChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient
modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive
strategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational
interviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy,
Medium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage
pipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference
optimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in
patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves
hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human
clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral
realism. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Tool-aware, real-time collision avoidance for collaborative robots that adapts to tool size and interaction modes using a learned perception model and a constrained RL controller. Achieves sub-10 ms planning, sub-mm accuracy, and ~60% lower compute than GPU planners, outperforming APF/MPPI in dynamic settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable safe and efficient operation of collaborative robots in dynamic human environments with changing tasks and tool geometries; overcome limitations of full-visibility and fixed-tool assumptions.

Method: A perception module filters robot and tool from point clouds, reasons about occluded areas, and predicts collisions under partial observability. A constrained reinforcement-learning policy generates smooth avoidance maneuvers in under 10 ms and is integrated into a collaborative robot workflow.

Result: Simulated and real-world experiments show superior performance to APF and MPPI in dynamic environments, with sub-millimeter positional accuracy and about 60% lower computational cost than a state-of-the-art GPU-based planner.

Conclusion: The approach offers a modular, efficient, and effective collision avoidance solution for robots operating in dynamic environments, with practical applicability to safe and responsive human–robot collaboration.

Abstract: Ensuring safe and efficient operation of collaborative robots in human
environments is challenging, especially in dynamic settings where both obstacle
motion and tasks change over time. Current robot controllers typically assume
full visibility and fixed tools, which can lead to collisions or overly
conservative behavior. In our work, we introduce a tool-aware collision
avoidance system that adjusts in real time to different tool sizes and modes of
tool-environment interaction. Using a learned perception model, our system
filters out robot and tool components from the point cloud, reasons about
occluded area, and predicts collision under partial observability. We then use
a control policy trained via constrained reinforcement learning to produce
smooth avoidance maneuvers in under 10 milliseconds. In simulated and
real-world tests, our approach outperforms traditional approaches (APF, MPPI)
in dynamic environments, while maintaining sub-millimeter accuracy. Moreover,
our system operates with approximately 60% lower computational cost compared to
a state-of-the-art GPU-based planner. Our approach provides modular, efficient,
and effective collision avoidance for robots operating in dynamic environments.
We integrate our method into a collaborative robot application and demonstrate
its practical use for safe and responsive operation.

TL;DR: SPGrasp is a prompt-driven, real-time spatiotemporal grasp synthesis framework built on SAMv2 that enables video-rate planning with sub-60 ms latency, achieving high instance-level grasp accuracy on multiple benchmarks and strong real-world performance, with code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time interactive grasping for dynamic objects is hampered by latency and limited promptability; a method is needed that fuses user prompts with spatiotemporal context to support fast, temporally consistent grasps in video streams.

Method: Extends Segment Anything Model v2 (SAMv2) with spatiotemporal context and user prompts to perform end-to-end grasp estimation on video streams, delivering end-to-end latency as low as 59 ms and maintaining temporal consistency across frames.

Result: Achieves 90.6% grasp accuracy on OCID, 93.8% on Jacquard; 92.0% on GraspNet-1Billion with 73.1 ms per-frame; 58.5% latency reduction vs RoG-SAM; 13 moving objects with 94.8% success in real-world tests.

Conclusion: SPGrasp effectively resolves the latency-interactivity trade-off in dynamic grasp synthesis and provides a practical, promptable, real-time solution; code available at the GitHub repository.

Abstract: Real-time interactive grasp synthesis for dynamic objects remains challenging
as existing methods fail to achieve low-latency inference while maintaining
promptability. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGrasp (spatiotemporal
prompt-driven dynamic grasp synthesis), a novel framework extending segment
anything model v2 (SAMv2) for video stream grasp estimation. Our core
innovation integrates user prompts with spatiotemporal context, enabling
real-time interaction with end-to-end latency as low as 59 ms while ensuring
temporal consistency for dynamic objects. In benchmark evaluations, SPGrasp
achieves instance-level grasp accuracies of 90.6% on OCID and 93.8% on
Jacquard. On the challenging GraspNet-1Billion dataset under continuous
tracking, SPGrasp achieves 92.0% accuracy with 73.1 ms per-frame latency,
representing a 58.5% reduction compared to the prior state-of-the-art
promptable method RoG-SAM while maintaining competitive accuracy. Real-world
experiments involving 13 moving objects demonstrate a 94.8% success rate in

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SimShear is a sim-to-real pipeline for tactile control that adds shear information to simulated tactile images using a shear-conditioned GAN (shPix2pix), enabling accurate pose and shear estimation and enabling tactile control tasks on two-armed robots with a vision-based tactile sensor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shear deformation from lateral contact motions is critical for dynamic tactile tasks but is difficult to simulate; existing tactile simulators struggle to capture shear, hindering sim-to-real transfer for tactile control.

Method: Introduce shPix2pix, a shear-conditioned U-Net GAN that translates shear-free simulated tactile images plus a shear vector encoding into realistic images with shear. Integrate this into the SimShear pipeline and validate on two low-cost desktop robotic arms with a vision-based tactile sensor across two tasks (tactile tracking and collaborative co-lifting).

Result: The approach outperforms baseline pix2pix in generating realistic tactile images and improves pose/shear prediction. In experiments, the system maintains contact errors within 1–2 mm across varied trajectories where shear sensing is important.

Conclusion: SimShear demonstrates that sim-to-real tactile control with shear is feasible using rigid-body simulators by learning shear-aware image translations, unlocking new directions for tactile robotics simulation and control.

Abstract: We present SimShear, a sim-to-real pipeline for tactile control that enables
the use of shear information without explicitly modeling shear dynamics in
simulation. Shear, arising from lateral movements across contact surfaces, is
critical for tasks involving dynamic object interactions but remains
challenging to simulate. To address this, we introduce shPix2pix, a
shear-conditioned U-Net GAN that transforms simulated tactile images absent of
shear, together with a vector encoding shear information, into realistic
equivalents with shear deformations. This method outperforms baseline pix2pix
approaches in simulating tactile images and in pose/shear prediction. We apply
SimShear to two control tasks using a pair of low-cost desktop robotic arms
equipped with a vision-based tactile sensor: (i) a tactile tracking task, where
a follower arm tracks a surface moved by a leader arm, and (ii) a collaborative
co-lifting task, where both arms jointly hold an object while the leader
follows a prescribed trajectory. Our method maintains contact errors within 1
to 2 mm across varied trajectories where shear sensing is essential, validating
the feasibility of sim-to-real shear modeling with rigid-body simulators and
opening new directions for simulation in tactile robotics.

### [126] [Traversing the Narrow Path: A Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning Framework for Humanoid Beam Walking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20661)
*TianChen Huang,Wei Gao,Runchen Xu,Shiwu Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A two-stage framework combines an XCoM/LIPM footstep template with a residual planner/tracker to enable robust, interpretable narrow-beam walking with minimal sensing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Narrow-beam traversal is challenging due to sparse, safety-critical contacts and fragility of fully learned policies; a physically grounded, modular approach can improve robustness and transferability.

Method: Stage 1 (flat ground): train a tracker to follow randomized-footstep perturbations without centerline locking to learn stable contact scheduling and robust target tracking. Stage 2 (beam): in simulation, a high-level planner predicts a body-frame residual (Delta x, Delta y, Delta psi) for the swing foot to refine the template step for safe, precise placement, preserving interpretability. Sensing is minimal and consistent: forward-facing elevation cues, onboard IMU and joint signals. Hardware: Unitree G1. 

Result: In both simulation and hardware, the residual-refinement approach outperforms template-only and monolithic baselines in success rate, centerline adherence, and safety margins on a 0.2 m-wide, 3 m-long beam. The structured footstep interface also enables transparent analysis and easier sim-to-real transfer.

Conclusion: A two-stage, physically grounded framework that couples a footstep template with a residual planner yields robust, interpretable narrow-beam locomotion with improved performance and transferability compared with non-residual or monolithic methods.

Abstract: Traversing narrow beams is challenging for humanoids due to sparse,
safety-critical contacts and the fragility of purely learned policies. We
propose a physically grounded, two-stage framework that couples an XCoM/LIPM
footstep template with a lightweight residual planner and a simple low-level
tracker. Stage-1 is trained on flat ground: the tracker learns to robustly
follow footstep targets by adding small random perturbations to heuristic
footsteps, without any hand-crafted centerline locking, so it acquires stable
contact scheduling and strong target-tracking robustness. Stage-2 is trained in
simulation on a beam: a high-level planner predicts a body-frame residual
(Delta x, Delta y, Delta psi) for the swing foot only, refining the template
step to prioritize safe, precise placement under narrow support while
preserving interpretability. To ease deployment, sensing is kept minimal and
consistent between simulation and hardware: the planner consumes compact,
forward-facing elevation cues together with onboard IMU and joint signals. On a
Unitree G1, our system reliably traverses a 0.2 m-wide, 3 m-long beam. Across
simulation and real-world studies, residual refinement consistently outperforms
template-only and monolithic baselines in success rate, centerline adherence,
and safety margins, while the structured footstep interface enables transparent
analysis and low-friction sim-to-real transfer.

TL;DR: An edge-assisted digital-twin framework with HITL-MAML enables proactive rendering and remote control in industrial Metaverse, showing large gains in precision and visual quality across two tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-time human-device interaction in industrial Metaverse is hindered by high computational load, limited bandwidth, and strict latency. A generalizable, responsive solution is needed; digital twins can separate visual display and robot control to optimize performance and adaptability.

Method: A task-oriented edge-assisted cross-system framework leveraging digital twins to predict operator motions for proactive Metaverse rendering and preemptive device control. Digital twins are decoupled into two virtual functions: visual display and robotic control. Introduces Human-In-The-Loop Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (HITL-MAML) to dynamically adjust prediction horizons for better generalization.

Result: Two-task evaluation shows significant improvements: (1) Trajectory-Based Drawing Control task: weighted RMSE reduced from 0.0712 m to 0.0101 m. (2) Real-time 3D scene representation task for nuclear decommissioning: PSNR 22.11, SSIM 0.8729, LPIPS 0.1298.

Conclusion: The proposed framework can ensure spatial precision and visual fidelity in real-time, high-risk industrial environments, advancing responsive, safe, and adaptable human–device interaction in the industrial Metaverse.

Abstract: Real-time human-device interaction in industrial Metaverse faces challenges
such as high computational load, limited bandwidth, and strict latency. This
paper proposes a task-oriented edge-assisted cross-system framework using
digital twins (DTs) to enable responsive interactions. By predicting operator
motions, the system supports: 1) proactive Metaverse rendering for visual
feedback, and 2) preemptive control of remote devices. The DTs are decoupled
into two virtual functions-visual display and robotic control-optimizing both
performance and adaptability. To enhance generalizability, we introduce the
Human-In-The-Loop Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (HITL-MAML) algorithm, which
dynamically adjusts prediction horizons. Evaluation on two tasks demonstrates
the framework's effectiveness: in a Trajectory-Based Drawing Control task, it
reduces weighted RMSE from 0.0712 m to 0.0101 m; in a real-time 3D scene
representation task for nuclear decommissioning, it achieves a PSNR of 22.11,
SSIM of 0.8729, and LPIPS of 0.1298. These results show the framework's
capability to ensure spatial precision and visual fidelity in real-time,
high-risk industrial environments.

*Yuki Tanaka,Seiichiro Katsura*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A GAN-based flexible motion translation framework to enable task and skill transfer from humans to robots, addressing imitation-learning limitations and scarce labels; evaluated on a 3-DOF calligraphy robot.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate the decline of skilled workers by enabling robots to learn and adapt to human intent using both position and force data; overcome limitations of existing imitation learning and limited-label conditional methods.

Method: Introduce Generative Adversarial Networks to translate human motion data into robot motion commands. The system accepts user-input data to teach tasks and uses a trained model to produce skills. The approach handles position and force data.

Result: Evaluation described on a 3-DOF calligraphy robot. No quantitative results provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: GAN-based flexible motion translation enables user-guided task learning and skill transfer from humans to robots, addressing data-label limitations and enabling task adaptation; further empirical validation needed.

Abstract: Decreasing skilled workers is a very serious problem in the world. To deal
with this problem, the skill transfer from experts to robots has been
researched. These methods which teach robots by human motion are called
imitation learning. Experts' skills generally appear in not only position data,
but also force data. Thus, position and force data need to be saved and
reproduced. To realize this, a lot of research has been conducted in the
framework of a motion-copying system. Recent research uses machine learning
methods to generate motion commands. However, most of them could not change
tasks by following human intention. Some of them can change tasks by
conditional training, but the labels are limited. Thus, we propose the flexible
motion translation method by using Generative Adversarial Networks. The
proposed method enables users to teach robots tasks by inputting data, and
skills by a trained model. We evaluated the proposed system with a 3-DOF
calligraphy robot.

### [130] [Uncertainty Aware-Predictive Control Barrier Functions: Safer Human Robot Interaction through Probabilistic Motion Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20812)
*Lorenzo Busellato,Federico Cunico,Diego Dall'Alba,Marco Emporio,Andrea Giachetti,Riccardo Muradore,Marco Cristani*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Uncertainty-Aware Predictive Control Barrier Functions (UA-PCBFs) integrate probabilistic human motion forecasting with Control Barrier Functions to safely and fluidly coordinate humans and robots in shared workspaces, using forecast uncertainty to adapt safety margins; validated in real-world experiments showing fewer safety-violations and improved interaction quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Collaborative robots in shared workspaces must guarantee safety while remaining responsive. Human motion is dynamic and uncertain; existing worst-case or purely reactive methods waste time and hinder fluid interaction. Structured uncertainty in predictions is needed to tighten or loosen safety margins adaptively.

Method: UA-PCBFs fuse probabilistic human motion forecasting with Control Barrier Functions into a unified framework. The framework dynamically adjusts the safety margin based on forecast uncertainty, enabling more fluid planning while maintaining formal safety guarantees. Validation includes real-world experiments: automated repeatable motions with a robotic hand and direct human-robot interactions assessing promptness, usability, and human confidence.

Result: The framework shows improved task-critical performance and significantly fewer robot-safety-space violations compared to state-of-the-art HRI architectures. Real-world experiments validate both safety and interaction quality, including repeatable automated trials and live human-robot collaboration.

Conclusion: Uncertainty-aware safety margins derived from forecasting enable deeper understanding of future human states and more fluid collaboration, balancing safety with responsiveness. UA-PCBFs offer a practical path to safer, more efficient HRI and invite further work on scaling and integration with diverse tasks.

Abstract: To enable flexible, high-throughput automation in settings where people and
robots share workspaces, collaborative robotic cells must reconcile stringent
safety guarantees with the need for responsive and effective behavior. A
dynamic obstacle is the stochastic, task-dependent variability of human motion:
when robots fall back on purely reactive or worst-case envelopes, they brake
unnecessarily, stall task progress, and tamper with the fluidity that true
Human-Robot Interaction demands. In recent years, learning-based human-motion
prediction has rapidly advanced, although most approaches produce worst-case
scenario forecasts that often do not treat prediction uncertainty in a
well-structured way, resulting in over-conservative planning algorithms,
limiting their flexibility. We introduce Uncertainty-Aware Predictive Control
Barrier Functions (UA-PCBFs), a unified framework that fuses probabilistic
human hand motion forecasting with the formal safety guarantees of Control
Barrier Functions. In contrast to other variants, our framework allows for
dynamic adjustment of the safety margin thanks to the human motion uncertainty
estimation provided by a forecasting module. Thanks to uncertainty estimation,
UA-PCBFs empower collaborative robots with a deeper understanding of future
human states, facilitating more fluid and intelligent interactions through
informed motion planning. We validate UA-PCBFs through comprehensive real-world
experiments with an increasing level of realism, including automated setups (to
perform exactly repeatable motions) with a robotic hand and direct human-robot
interactions (to validate promptness, usability, and human confidence).
Relative to state-of-the-art HRI architectures, UA-PCBFs show better
performance in task-critical metrics, significantly reducing the number of
violations of the robot's safe space during interaction with respect to the
state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide realistic, multimodal haptic feedback in VR and teleoperation through a soft, wearable, and lightweight interface that delivers both thermal and force cues.

Method: Design of ultra-light (~2 g per finger) fabric finger units with textile pneumatic chambers and embedded heating elements; rapid thermal modulation (up to 3 °C/s); force output up to 8.93 N at 50 kPa; optimization of fingerpad clearance for cooling; two user studies assessing thermal discrimination and virtual manipulation tasks.

Result: Thermal modulation demonstrated (up to 3 °C/s); pneumatic force output 8.93 N at 50 kPa; temperature identification accuracy 0.98; improved virtual task performance with haptic feedback; manipulation success rates improved from 88.5% to 96.4% (p=0.029); improved force control precision (p=0.013).

Conclusion: An integrated thermal-haptic approach using a soft, wearable interface effectively provides dynamic thermal and tactile feedback for VR and teleoperation, enabling improved user performance with minimal added weight.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel fabric-based thermal-haptic interface for virtual
reality and teleoperation. It integrates pneumatic actuation and conductive
fabric with an innovative ultra-lightweight design, achieving only 2~g for each
finger unit. By embedding heating elements within textile pneumatic chambers,
the system delivers modulated pressure and thermal stimuli to fingerpads
through a fully soft, wearable interface.
  Comprehensive characterization demonstrates rapid thermal modulation with
heating rates up to 3$^{\circ}$C/s, enabling dynamic thermal feedback for
virtual or teleoperation interactions. The pneumatic subsystem generates forces
up to 8.93~N at 50~kPa, while optimization of fingerpad-actuator clearance
enhances cooling efficiency with minimal force reduction. Experimental
validation conducted with two different user studies shows high temperature
identification accuracy (0.98 overall) across three thermal levels, and
significant manipulation improvements in a virtual pick-and-place tasks.
Results show enhanced success rates (88.5\% to 96.4\%, p = 0.029) and improved
force control precision (p = 0.013) when haptic feedback is enabled, validating
the effectiveness of the integrated thermal-haptic approach for advanced
human-machine interaction applications.

TL;DR: A novel extremum seeking control (ESC) approach enables model-free, real-time hovering and source-seeking in flapping robots, demonstrated experimentally in 1D.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the lack of model-free, real-time biomimetic control for hovering and source seeking in flapping insect/hummingbird-inspired systems; position ESC as a natural control paradigm for flapping flight.

Method: Propose a new ESC framework and experimentally test it on a flapping-robot prototype, validating model-free, real-time hovering and source-seeking in 1D.

Result: Experimental results in 1D confirm that ESC can achieve model-free, real-time hovering and source-seeking in flapping robots, supporting the feasibility of the approach.

Conclusion: ESC appears to be a natural, biomimicry-oriented control method for flapping flight/robotics with potential for extension beyond 1D to more complex hovering and navigation tasks.

Abstract: In a recent effort, we successfully proposed a categorically novel approach
to mimic the phenomenoa of hovering and source seeking by flapping insects and
hummingbirds using a new extremum seeking control (ESC) approach. Said ESC
approach was shown capable of characterizing the physics of hovering and source
seeking by flapping systems, providing at the same time uniquely novel
opportunity for a model-free, real-time biomimicry control design. In this
paper, we experimentally test and verify, for the first time in the literature,
the potential of ESC in flapping robots to achieve model-free, real-time
controlled hovering and source seeking. The results of this paper, while being
restricted to 1D, confirm the premise of introducing ESC as a natural control
method and biomimicry mechanism to the field of flapping flight and robotics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Proposes Primitive Embodied World Models (PEWM) that constrain video generation to short horizons, enabling fine-grained language–action alignment, data efficiency, and compositional generalization with a modular Vision-Language Model planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism for closed-loop control.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses the data bottlenecks in embodied video generation: scarcity, collection difficulty, and high dimensionality, which hinder fine-grained language-action alignment and long-horizon planning. Highlights that embodied data diversity far exceeds the primitive motion space, motivating a shift to primitive-level modeling.

Method: PEWM restricts generation to fixed short horizons and augments it with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and Start-Goal heatmap Guidance (SGG). This enables flexible closed-loop control and compositional generalization of primitive-level policies across extended tasks. The approach leverages spatiotemporal vision priors from video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge low-level interactions and high-level reasoning.

Result: Claims improved data efficiency, reduced learning complexity, and decreased inference latency. It enables flexible closed-loop control and compositional generalization of primitive policies, and enhances alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations at the primitive-action level.

Conclusion: Frames embodied intelligence as scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose by combining vision priors with semantic VLM understanding to approach a GPT-like moment in the embodied domain.

Abstract: While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing
attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a
key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality
of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language
and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video
generation--hindering generative models from achieving a "GPT moment" in the
embodied domain. There is a naive observation: the diversity of embodied data
far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions. Based on
this insight, we propose a novel paradigm for world modeling--Primitive
Embodied World Models (PEWM). By restricting video generation to fixed short
horizons, our approach 1) enables fine-grained alignment between linguistic
concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, 2) reduces learning
complexity, 3) improves data efficiency in embodied data collection, and 4)
decreases inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model
(VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further
enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization
of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework
leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic
awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction
and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and
general-purpose embodied intelligence.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GIT* integrates environmental data into heuristic guidance and uses reinforced genetic programming to evolve heuristics, outperforming single-query planners from R^4 to R^16 and in real-world mobile manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations of traditional heuristic design that neglect environmental data and oversimplify heuristic structures due to complexity, aiming to improve search efficiency and solution quality.

Method: Develop GIT* by extending EIT* with broader environmental cues (repulsive obstacle forces, dynamic vertex importance) for heuristic refinement. Introduce Reinforced Genetic Programming (RGP) to mutate genotype-generated heuristics using reward feedback. Leverage diverse data types to enhance computation efficiency and solution quality within time constraints.

Result: Empirical comparisons show GIT* outperforms existing single-query, sampling-based planners across high-dimensional tasks (R^4 to R^16) and on a real-world mobile manipulation task; results supported by a demonstration video.

Conclusion: Integrating richer environmental data and adaptive genetic programming yields superior planning performance; GIT* demonstrates effectiveness across high-dimensional problems and real-world applications.

Abstract: Optimal path planning involves finding a feasible state sequence between a
start and a goal that optimizes an objective. This process relies on heuristic
functions to guide the search direction. While a robust function can improve
search efficiency and solution quality, current methods often overlook
available environmental data and simplify the function structure due to the
complexity of information relationships. This study introduces Genetic Informed
Trees (GIT*), which improves upon Effort Informed Trees (EIT*) by integrating a
wider array of environmental data, such as repulsive forces from obstacles and
the dynamic importance of vertices, to refine heuristic functions for better
guidance. Furthermore, we integrated reinforced genetic programming (RGP),
which combines genetic programming with reward system feedback to mutate
genotype-generative heuristic functions for GIT*. RGP leverages a multitude of
data types, thereby improving computational efficiency and solution quality
within a set timeframe. Comparative analyses demonstrate that GIT* surpasses
existing single-query, sampling-based planners in problems ranging from R^4 to
R^16 and was tested on a real-world mobile manipulation task. A video

TL;DR: Learning-based Informed Trees (LIT*) adaptively tunes batch size and k-nearest neighbor queries in sampling-based motion planning using deep fuzzy networks to distinguish obstacle-sparse vs. obstacle-dense regions, yielding faster convergence and higher-quality paths in high-dimensional spaces.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing sampling-based planners typically use fixed parameters and struggle to adapt to varying obstacle distributions, limiting performance in high-dimensional configuration spaces.

Method: Propose LIT*, a sampling-based planner that leverages deep fuzzy learning to dynamically adjust batch size and nearest-neighbor parameters based on encoded global/local obstacle cues (valid/invalid states), enabling differentiation between sparse and dense obstacle regions.

Result: In experiments from R^8 to R^14, LIT* achieves faster convergence and improved solution quality, outperforming state-of-the-art single-query planners; validated on a dual-arm manipulation task.

Conclusion: Adaptive, learning-based tuning of planning parameters via deep fuzzy networks enhances efficiency and solution quality in complex environments, demonstrating strong environmental adaptability and scalability.

Abstract: Efficient motion planning algorithms are essential in robotics. Optimizing
essential parameters, such as batch size and nearest neighbor selection in
sampling-based methods, can enhance performance in the planning process.
However, existing approaches often lack environmental adaptability. Inspired by
the method of the deep fuzzy neural networks, this work introduces
Learning-based Informed Trees (LIT*), a sampling-based deep fuzzy
learning-based planner that dynamically adjusts batch size and nearest neighbor
parameters to obstacle distributions in the configuration spaces. By encoding
both global and local ratios via valid and invalid states, LIT* differentiates
between obstacle-sparse and obstacle-dense regions, leading to lower-cost paths
and reduced computation time. Experimental results in high-dimensional spaces
demonstrate that LIT* achieves faster convergence and improved solution
quality. It outperforms state-of-the-art single-query, sampling-based planners
in environments ranging from R^8 to R^14 and is successfully validated on a
dual-arm robot manipulation task. A video showcasing our experimental results

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CoCoL is a communication-efficient decentralized collaborative learning method for multi-robot systems with heterogeneous data, achieving strong accuracy with far fewer communications via a mirror-descent-based approximate Newton updates, inexact subproblem solves, and gradient tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High communication overhead and data heterogeneity in multi-robot collaborative learning hinder scalability. There is a need for efficient, robust algorithms that can handle non-IID data, streaming inputs, and dynamic network topologies.

Method: A decentralized learning framework named CoCoL based on mirror descent. It uses approximate Newton-type updates by leveraging similarity between robots' objective functions, reduces computation with inexact subproblem solutions, and incorporates a gradient tracking scheme to mitigate data heterogeneity.

Result: Empirical results on three representative multi-robot collaborative learning tasks show significant reductions in both the number of communication rounds and total bandwidth consumption while retaining state-of-the-art accuracy. The method remains robust under non-IID data, streaming data, and time-varying network topologies.

Conclusion: CoCoL provides a practical, robust, and highly communication-efficient solution for decentralized collaborative learning in heterogeneous multi-robot settings, suitable for challenging real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Collaborative learning enhances the performance and adaptability of
multi-robot systems in complex tasks but faces significant challenges due to
high communication overhead and data heterogeneity inherent in multi-robot
tasks. To this end, we propose CoCoL, a Communication efficient decentralized
Collaborative Learning method tailored for multi-robot systems with
heterogeneous local datasets. Leveraging a mirror descent framework, CoCoL
achieves remarkable communication efficiency with approximate Newton-type
updates by capturing the similarity between objective functions of robots, and
reduces computational costs through inexact sub-problem solutions. Furthermore,
the integration of a gradient tracking scheme ensures its robustness against
data heterogeneity. Experimental results on three representative multi robot
collaborative learning tasks show the superiority of the proposed CoCoL in
significantly reducing both the number of communication rounds and total
bandwidth consumption while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy. These
benefits are particularly evident in challenging scenarios involving non-IID
(non-independent and identically distributed) data distribution, streaming
data, and time-varying network topologies.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A language-enhanced hierarchical search framework (GODHS) enables robots to efficiently search for and identify objects in unstructured environments by using LLMs to infer scene semantics and guide a multi-level decision hierarchy, plus a heuristic motion planner for mobile manipulation; evaluated in Isaac Sim showing improved search efficiency over non-semantic methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Static scene representations capture semantics but lack interpretable contextual reasoning to guide object search in unfamiliar settings; there is a need to integrate semantic understanding with spatial exploration to improve efficiency and reliability.

Method: Introduce GODHS: Goal-Oriented Dynamically Heuristic-Guided Hierarchical Search, integrating large language models to infer scene semantics and guide search through a multi-level decision hierarchy. Reliability is achieved via structured prompts and logical constraints at each hierarchy stage. For mobile manipulation, propose a heuristic-based motion planner that combines polar angle sorting with distance prioritization to generate exploration paths.

Result: Demonstrates feasibility and higher search efficiency for locating target objects in Isaac Sim compared to conventional, non-semantic search strategies.

Conclusion: A language-enhanced hierarchical reasoning framework can substantially improve object search in unstructured environments, with practical implications for household and industrial robotics; the proposed GODHS framework provides reliable semantic guidance and a concrete planner for exploration.

Abstract: Enabling robots to efficiently search for and identify objects in complex,
unstructured environments is critical for diverse applications ranging from
household assistance to industrial automation. However, traditional scene
representations typically capture only static semantics and lack interpretable
contextual reasoning, limiting their ability to guide object search in
completely unfamiliar settings. To address this challenge, we propose a
language-enhanced hierarchical navigation framework that tightly integrates
semantic perception and spatial reasoning. Our method, Goal-Oriented
Dynamically Heuristic-Guided Hierarchical Search (GODHS), leverages large
language models (LLMs) to infer scene semantics and guide the search process
through a multi-level decision hierarchy. Reliability in reasoning is achieved
through the use of structured prompts and logical constraints applied at each
stage of the hierarchy. For the specific challenges of mobile manipulation, we
introduce a heuristic-based motion planner that combines polar angle sorting
with distance prioritization to efficiently generate exploration paths.
Comprehensive evaluations in Isaac Sim demonstrate the feasibility of our
framework, showing that GODHS can locate target objects with higher search
efficiency compared to conventional, non-semantic search strategies. Website

Conclusion: PLUME offers a reusable, open-source tool for procedurally generating diverse underground environments to accelerate exploration algorithm development and testing.

Abstract: As space exploration advances, underground environments are becoming
increasingly attractive due to their potential to provide shelter, easier

allows for the continuous enhancement of various underground features, aligning
with our expanding understanding of the solar system. The environments
generated using PLUME can be used for AI training, evaluating robotics
algorithms, 3D rendering, and facilitating rapid iteration on developed
exploration algorithms. In this paper, it is demonstrated that PLUME has been
used along with a robotic simulator. PLUME is open source and has been released

*Curtis C. Johnson,Daniel Webb,David Hill,Marc D. Killpack*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A scalable, wired tactile sensing architecture enables real-time whole-body manipulation with 8k taxels over 1 m^2, using fabric sensors and a daisy-chained SPI bus to cut wiring and data throughput challenges; real-time tactile feedback improves grasping performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scaling tactile sensing for robust whole-body manipulation is hampered by wiring complexity, data throughput, and reliability. The work aims to provide a platform that enables real-time feedback-controlled manipulation and safe human-robot interaction.

Method: Open-source fabric-based sensors paired with custom readout electronics that minimize crosstalk (<3.3%) via hardware mitigation; a novel daisy-chained SPI bus topology; synchronized streaming of data from >8,000 taxels over 1 m^2 at >50 FPS; validated on a whole-body grasping task with and without tactile feedback.

Result: The system streams >8,000 taxels at >50 FPS with low crosstalk, enabling real-time tactile feedback that transforms uncontrolled open-loop motions into gentle, stable grasps on a deformable box; demonstrates a robust platform for real-time whole-body control and HRI research.

Conclusion: The presented architecture provides a scalable, reliable foundation for advanced whole-body manipulation and physical human-robot interaction, addressing wiring, throughput, and reliability barriers while enabling real-time tactile feedback.

Abstract: Scaling tactile sensing for robust whole-body manipulation is a significant
challenge, often limited by wiring complexity, data throughput, and system
reliability. This paper presents a complete architecture designed to overcome
these barriers. Our approach pairs open-source, fabric-based sensors with
custom readout electronics that reduce signal crosstalk to less than 3.3%
through hardware-based mitigation. Critically, we introduce a novel,
daisy-chained SPI bus topology that avoids the practical limitations of common
wireless protocols and the prohibitive wiring complexity of USB hub-based
systems. This architecture streams synchronized data from over 8,000 taxels
across 1 square meter of sensing area at update rates exceeding 50 FPS,
confirming its suitability for real-time control. We validate the system's
efficacy in a whole-body grasping task where, without feedback, the robot's
open-loop trajectory results in an uncontrolled application of force that
slowly crushes a deformable cardboard box. With real-time tactile feedback, the
robot transforms this motion into a gentle, stable grasp, successfully
manipulating the object without causing structural damage. This work provides a
robust and well-characterized platform to enable future research in advanced
whole-body control and physical human-robot interaction.

*Jiajie Li,Boyang Sun,Luca Di Giammarino,Hermann Blum,Marc Pollefeys*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ActLoc presents an active, viewpoint-aware planning framework that uses an attention-based model to predict localization accuracy across yaw/pitch directions at 3D locations and guides camera orientation planning to maximize robustness during navigation; achieves state-of-the-art single-viewpoint selection and generalizes to full trajectory planning with a modular design.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Localization can become unreliable when observations come from unmapped, ambiguous, or uninformative regions. Existing methods often assume all viewing directions are equally informative, motivating the need for active viewpoint selection to boost localization reliability within task and motion constraints.

Method: A large-scale trained attention model encodes a metric map and historical camera poses to predict per-point localization accuracy distributions over yaw and pitch. These predictions are integrated into a planner that actively selects camera orientations to maximize localization robustness while respecting task/motion constraints, demonstrating strong performance on single-viewpoint selection and extending to full-trajectory planning; modular to various tasks.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art results on single-viewpoint selection and generalizes effectively to full-trajectory planning; its modular design facilitates application to diverse robot navigation and inspection tasks, and it demonstrates robust localization improvements in challenging scenarios.

Conclusion: ActLoc provides a scalable, generalizable framework for active viewpoint planning that enhances localization reliability in navigation tasks. Its data-driven, attention-based modeling of viewpoint informativeness enables adaptable planning across diverse environments and tasks.

Abstract: Reliable localization is critical for robot navigation, yet most existing
systems implicitly assume that all viewing directions at a location are equally
informative. In practice, localization becomes unreliable when the robot
observes unmapped, ambiguous, or uninformative regions. To address this, we
present ActLoc, an active viewpoint-aware planning framework for enhancing
localization accuracy for general robot navigation tasks. At its core, ActLoc
employs a largescale trained attention-based model for viewpoint selection. The
model encodes a metric map and the camera poses used during map construction,
and predicts localization accuracy across yaw and pitch directions at arbitrary
3D locations. These per-point accuracy distributions are incorporated into a
path planner, enabling the robot to actively select camera orientations that
maximize localization robustness while respecting task and motion constraints.
ActLoc achieves stateof-the-art results on single-viewpoint selection and
generalizes effectively to fulltrajectory planning. Its modular design makes it
readily applicable to diverse robot navigation and inspection tasks.

*Junhao Gong,Kit-Wa Sou,Shoujie Li,Changqing Guo,Yan Huang,Chuqiao Lyu,Ziwu Song,Wenbo Ding*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Integrated visuotactile-ultrasound sensor UltraTac enabling simultaneous high-resolution tactile imaging and ultrasound sensing via a coaxial optoacoustic architecture; shows strong proximity, material, and texture-material recognition, and is validated in robotic manipulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visuotactile sensors provide rich tactile images but lack material feature perception. Incorporating ultrasound can reveal subsurface/material properties. A unified architecture with consistent sensing regions and acoustic matching enables multimodal sensing without degrading visuotactile performance, and tactile feedback can coordinate the ultrasound module for flexible operation.

Method: Design and implement UltraTac with coaxial optoacoustic architecture that shares structural components with a visuotactile sensor and includes acoustic matching to integrate ultrasound without compromising visuotactile sensing. Use tactile feedback to dynamically adjust ultrasound operation. Evaluate via (i) proximity sensing in 3–8 cm range (R^2=0.90), (ii) material classification (average accuracy 99.20%), (iii) texture-material dual-mode object recognition (92.11% on 15 classes), and (iv) robotic manipulation experiments to detect surface patterns and internal contents.

Result: Proximity sensing with R^2=0.90 in 3–8 cm range; material classification accuracy average 99.20%; texture-material dual-mode object recognition accuracy 92.11% on a 15-class task; validated integration into a robotic manipulation system to concurrently detect container surface patterns and internal content.

Conclusion: The integrated coaxial UltraTac architecture preserves visuotactile performance while adding ultrasound sensing, enabling rich multimodal tactile perception and flexible coordination between modalities. The sensor demonstrates strong capability in proximity, material, and texture-material recognition and shows promise for advanced human–machine interaction and precise robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Visuotactile sensors provide high-resolution tactile information but are
incapable of perceiving the material features of objects. We present UltraTac,
an integrated sensor that combines visuotactile imaging with ultrasound sensing
through a coaxial optoacoustic architecture. The design shares structural
components and achieves consistent sensing regions for both modalities.
Additionally, we incorporate acoustic matching into the traditional
visuotactile sensor structure, enabling integration of the ultrasound sensing
modality without compromising visuotactile performance. Through tactile
feedback, we dynamically adjust the operating state of the ultrasound module to
achieve flexible functional coordination. Systematic experiments demonstrate
three key capabilities: proximity sensing in the 3-8 cm range ($R^2=0.90$),
material classification (average accuracy: 99.20%), and texture-material
dual-mode object recognition achieving 92.11% accuracy on a 15-class task.
Finally, we integrate the sensor into a robotic manipulation system to
concurrently detect container surface patterns and internal content, which
verifies its potential for advanced human-machine interaction and precise
robotic manipulation.

### [142] [Rapid Mismatch Estimation via Neural Network Informed Variational Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21007)
*Mateusz Jaszczuk,Nadia Figueroa*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Rapid Mismatch Estimation (RME) is a probabilistic, controller-agnostic framework that online estimates end-effector dynamics mismatches to enable safe, fast adaptation of impedance-controlled robots without external sensors.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Model mismatch in robot dynamics degrades compliant torque-controlled interactions with humans and the environment; need online, sensor-free adaptation to maintain safety and task success.

Method: A Neural Network Model Mismatch Estimator generates a prior for a Variational Inference solver based on proprioceptive feedback; the solver rapidly estimates unknown end-effector dynamics parameters and their uncertainty; the approach is controller-agnostic and suited for impedance controllers.

Result: On a real 7-DoF manipulator with a passive impedance controller, RME adapts to sudden changes in end-effector mass and center of mass in ~400 ms, for static and dynamic tasks, including a human attaching a basket and later adding/removing heavy items.

Conclusion: RME enables fast, probabilistic online estimation of dynamics mismatch without external sensors, supporting safe interaction during physical tasks and enhancing robustness of impedance-based control across changing dynamics.

Abstract: With robots increasingly operating in human-centric environments, ensuring
soft and safe physical interactions, whether with humans, surroundings, or
other machines, is essential. While compliant hardware can facilitate such
interactions, this work focuses on impedance controllers that allow
torque-controlled robots to safely and passively respond to contact while
accurately executing tasks. From inverse dynamics to quadratic
programming-based controllers, the effectiveness of these methods relies on
accurate dynamics models of the robot and the object it manipulates. Any model
mismatch results in task failures and unsafe behaviors. Thus, we introduce
Rapid Mismatch Estimation (RME), an adaptive, controller-agnostic,
probabilistic framework that estimates end-effector dynamics mismatches online,
without relying on external force-torque sensors. From the robot's
proprioceptive feedback, a Neural Network Model Mismatch Estimator generates a
prior for a Variational Inference solver, which rapidly converges to the
unknown parameters while quantifying uncertainty. With a real 7-DoF manipulator
driven by a state-of-the-art passive impedance controller, RME adapts to sudden
changes in mass and center of mass at the end-effector in $\sim400$ ms, in
static and dynamic settings. We demonstrate RME in a collaborative scenario
where a human attaches an unknown basket to the robot's end-effector and
dynamically adds/removes heavy items, showcasing fast and safe adaptation to
changing dynamics during physical interaction without any external sensory
system.

*Zhi Su,Bike Zhang,Nima Rahmanian,Yuman Gao,Qiayuan Liao,Caitlin Regan,Koushil Sreenath,S. Shankar Sastry*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A hierarchical system combining a model-based ball trajectory/planning module with an RL-based whole-body controller enables real-time humanoid table tennis, achieving long rallies in the real world.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fast, dynamic manipulation tasks like table tennis exceed current humanoid capabilities; integrating planning and learning is needed to achieve rapid perception, prediction, and actuation in dynamic environments.

Method: A two-level framework: a model-based planner predicts ball trajectory and planning for striking position, velocity, and timing; a reinforcement-learning-based whole-body controller generates coordinated arm/leg motions; training uses human motion references; validated on a general-purpose humanoid robot.

Result: Up to 106 consecutive shots against a human opponent and sustained exchanges against another humanoid; real-world demonstrations with sub-second reactive control.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates the viability of combining model-based planning with learning-based control to achieve agile, interactive humanoid behavior in fast, dynamic tasks like table tennis.

Abstract: Humanoid robots have recently achieved impressive progress in locomotion and
whole-body control, yet they remain constrained in tasks that demand rapid
interaction with dynamic environments through manipulation. Table tennis
exemplifies such a challenge: with ball speeds exceeding 5 m/s, players must
perceive, predict, and act within sub-second reaction times, requiring both
agility and precision. To address this, we present a hierarchical framework for
humanoid table tennis that integrates a model-based planner for ball trajectory
prediction and racket target planning with a reinforcement learning-based
whole-body controller. The planner determines striking position, velocity and
timing, while the controller generates coordinated arm and leg motions that
mimic human strikes and maintain stability and agility across consecutive
rallies. Moreover, to encourage natural movements, human motion references are
incorporated during training. We validate our system on a general-purpose
humanoid robot, achieving up to 106 consecutive shots with a human opponent and
sustained exchanges against another humanoid. These results demonstrate
real-world humanoid table tennis with sub-second reactive control, marking a
step toward agile and interactive humanoid behaviors.

TL;DR: Prompt-to-Product automates the generation of buildable LEGO brick designs from natural-language prompts and uses a bimanual robot to construct the physical assemblies, reducing manual design and building effort.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual design and construction of assembly-focused products demand expert knowledge and substantial effort. There is a need to translate imaginative prompts into physically realizable artifacts.

Method: Introduce Prompt-to-Product pipeline: (1) interpret user prompts, (2) generate legally buildable LEGO brick assemblies, (3) employ a bimanual robotic system to construct the real-world product based on the designs, (4) validate via comprehensive user studies.

Result: The approach significantly lowers the barrier and reduces manual effort for creating assembly products from imaginative ideas, as evidenced by user study results.

Conclusion: Prompt-to-Product enables a practical end-to-end pipeline from natural-language prompts to tangible LEGO assemblies, highlighting a path toward automated design-to-build workflows using robotic construction.

Abstract: Creating assembly products demands significant manual effort and expert
knowledge in 1) designing the assembly and 2) constructing the product. This
paper introduces Prompt-to-Product, an automated pipeline that generates
real-world assembly products from natural language prompts. Specifically, we
leverage LEGO bricks as the assembly platform and automate the process of
creating brick assembly structures. Given the user design requirements,
Prompt-to-Product generates physically buildable brick designs, and then
leverages a bimanual robotic system to construct the real assembly products,
bringing user imaginations into the real world. We conduct a comprehensive user
study, and the results demonstrate that Prompt-to-Product significantly lowers
the barrier and reduces manual effort in creating assembly products from
imaginative ideas.

*Jiahe Pan,Jiaxu Xing,Rudolf Reiter,Yifan Zhai,Elie Aljalbout,Davide Scaramuzza*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: An online adaptive framework updates a differentiable simulation with real-world data to enable rapid gradient-based policy updates, achieving near real-time adaptation (within ~5 seconds) and substantial performance gains for quadrotor control under disturbances, outperforming offline baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the sim-to-real gap without costly offline retraining or brittle domain randomization, enabling fast adaptation to unmodeled dynamics and disturbances in the real world.

Method: Online residual dynamics learning integrated into a differentiable simulator. Start from a simple dynamics model, continuously refine it with real-world data to capture unmodeled effects (e.g., payload changes, wind). The differentiable simulator allows gradient backprop through dynamics for rapid policy updates, enabling adaptation within ~5 seconds. Framework supports real-time policy adaptation beyond traditional RL like PPO.

Result: Hovering/error performance improved, with reductions up to 81% vs L1-MPC and 55% vs DATT. Demonstrated robustness in vision-based control without explicit state estimation, validated on agile quadrotor control under various disturbances in both simulation and real world.

Conclusion: Online, differentiable-simulation–driven adaptation offers a practical path to rapid, sample-efficient policy adjustment amid unmodeled dynamics, addressing sim-to-real challenges more effectively than offline methods.

Abstract: Learning control policies in simulation enables rapid, safe, and
cost-effective development of advanced robotic capabilities. However,
transferring these policies to the real world remains difficult due to the
sim-to-real gap, where unmodeled dynamics and environmental disturbances can
degrade policy performance. Existing approaches, such as domain randomization
and Real2Sim2Real pipelines, can improve policy robustness, but either struggle
under out-of-distribution conditions or require costly offline retraining. In
this work, we approach these problems from a different perspective. Instead of
relying on diverse training conditions before deployment, we focus on rapidly
adapting the learned policy in the real world in an online fashion. To achieve
this, we propose a novel online adaptive learning framework that unifies
residual dynamics learning with real-time policy adaptation inside a
differentiable simulation. Starting from a simple dynamics model, our framework
refines the model continuously with real-world data to capture unmodeled
effects and disturbances such as payload changes and wind. The refined dynamics
model is embedded in a differentiable simulation framework, enabling gradient
backpropagation through the dynamics and thus rapid, sample-efficient policy
updates beyond the reach of classical RL methods like PPO. All components of
our system are designed for rapid adaptation, enabling the policy to adjust to
unseen disturbances within 5 seconds of training. We validate the approach on
agile quadrotor control under various disturbances in both simulation and the
real world. Our framework reduces hovering error by up to 81% compared to
L1-MPC and 55% compared to DATT, while also demonstrating robustness in
vision-based control without explicit state estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unify prior entropy notions used in sorting and geometric computation so that algorithms can adapt to input structure and achieve entropy-based running-time bounds.

Method: Introduce range-partition entropy, then design and analyze algorithms for 2D maxima, 2D and 3D convex hulls, and visibility problems, showing their running times depend on the range-partition entropy.

Result: Algorithms achieve running times that are a function of the range-partition entropy, providing a unified, adaptive framework that subsumes previous entropy definitions for sorting and geometric problems.

Conclusion: Range-partition entropy offers a unifying, practical framework for entropy-bounded geometry, yielding adaptive algorithms for classic geometric tasks.

Abstract: We study entropy-bounded computational geometry, that is, geometric
algorithms whose running times depend on a given measure of the input entropy.
Specifically, we introduce a measure that we call range-partition entropy,
which unifies and subsumes previous definitions of entropy used for sorting
problems and structural entropy used in computational geometry. We provide
simple algorithms for several problems, including 2D maxima, 2D and 3D convex

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CrystalICL enables few-shot crystal generation using space-group tokenization and hybrid instruction tuning to exploit in-context learning, outperforming baselines on conditional/unconditional tasks across four benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LLM-based crystal generation methods are limited to zero-shot learning and fail to leverage few-shot or in-context learning, while human experts often use few-shot modifications of known structures.

Method: Introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization to simplify symmetry modeling, and employ a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning with multi-task learning to better capture structure-property relationships from limited data.

Result: Empirical evaluation on four crystal generation benchmarks showing CrystalICL outperforms leading baselines on both conditional and unconditional generation tasks.

Conclusion: CrystalICL effectively leverages few-shot in-context learning for crystal generation, reducing symmetry modeling complexity and improving structure-property related generation under limited data.

Abstract: Designing crystal materials with desired physicochemical properties remains a
fundamental challenge in materials science. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, existing
LLM-based crystal generation approaches are limited to zero-shot scenarios and
are unable to benefit from few-shot scenarios. In contrast, human experts
typically design new materials by modifying relevant known structures which
aligns closely with the few-shot ICL paradigm. Motivated by this, we propose
CrystalICL, a novel model designed for few-shot crystal generation.
Specifically, we introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization method,
which effectively reduces the complexity of modeling crystal symmetry in LLMs.
We further introduce a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning
framework and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy, enabling the model to
better exploit ICL by capturing structure-property relationships from limited
data. Extensive experiments on four crystal generation benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of CrystalICL over the leading baseline methods on conditional
and unconditional generation tasks.

*Elisha Dayag,Nhat Thanh Van Tran,Jack Xin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adding learnable input spectral filters to transformer-based long time-series forecasting models yields 5–10% relative gains, allows smaller embeddings, and highlights better spectral utilization with only ~1000 extra parameters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the bias of transformer-based long time-series forecasting models toward low-frequency content and their high computational/memory costs; improve spectral utilization and model efficiency.

Method: Insert learnable filters at the input of transformer-based LTSF models (introducing ~1000 parameters) before the transformer encoder; evaluate across multiple models/datasets and perform synthetic experiments to study spectral utilization.

Result: Consistent 5–10% relative improvement in forecasting accuracy; ability to reduce embedding dimension while maintaining or improving performance; smaller, more effective transformer models with added filters compared to non-filtered baselines.

Conclusion: Input learnable filters are an effective, parameter-efficient enhancement for transformer-based long time-series forecasting, enabling better utilization of the full spectrum and enabling smaller, faster models without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Transformer-based models are at the forefront in long time-series forecasting
(LTSF). While in many cases, these models are able to achieve state of the art
results, they suffer from a bias toward low-frequencies in the data and high
computational and memory requirements. Recent work has established that
learnable frequency filters can be an integral part of a deep forecasting model
by enhancing the model's spectral utilization. These works choose to use a
multilayer perceptron to process their filtered signals and thus do not solve
the issues found with transformer-based models. In this paper, we establish
that adding a filter to the beginning of transformer-based models enhances
their performance in long time-series forecasting. We add learnable filters,
which only add an additional $\approx 1000$ parameters to several
transformer-based models and observe in multiple instances 5-10 \% relative
improvement in forecasting performance. Additionally, we find that with filters
added, we are able to decrease the embedding dimension of our models, resulting
in transformer-based architectures that are both smaller and more effective
than their non-filtering base models. We also conduct synthetic experiments to
analyze how the filters enable Transformer-based models to better utilize the
full spectrum for forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between classical nonlinear filtering theory and contemporary transformer-based models by recasting transformer operations as probabilistic conditional updates.

Method: Propose a probabilistic model where transformer signals are surrogates of conditional measures; view layer computations as fixed-point updates; derive an explicit fixed-point equation for the special case of hidden Markov models.

Result: Provides a formal probabilistic interpretation of transformer signals as conditional measures and fixed-point updates; obtains explicit fixed-point update for HMM; establishes a conceptual bridge between nonlinear filtering theory and transformer architectures.

Conclusion: Bridges classical nonlinear filtering with modern inference architectures, offering a probabilistic lens on transformer mechanisms and potential cross-fertilization between fields.

Abstract: In the 1940s, Wiener introduced a linear predictor, where the future
prediction is computed by linearly combining the past data. A transformer
generalizes this idea: it is a nonlinear predictor where the next-token
prediction is computed by nonlinearly combining the past tokens. In this essay,
we present a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as
surrogates of conditional measures, and layer operations as fixed-point
updates. An explicit form of the fixed-point update is described for the
special case when the probabilistic model is a hidden Markov model (HMM). In
part, this paper is in an attempt to bridge the classical nonlinear filtering
theory with modern inference architectures.

TL;DR: Calibrating the teacher improves KD performance: reducing the teacher's calibration error strongly correlates with higher student accuracy, and a simple calibration step boosts KD across tasks and methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Identify which factors govern the effectiveness of knowledge distillation and explain why a large teacher helps a small student, by focusing on the role of calibration.

Method: Quantify the teacher's calibration error, apply a calibration method to reduce it, and evaluate KD performance across diverse tasks (classification and detection) and with various KD baselines, showing compatibility with state-of-the-art approaches.

Result: Reducing the teacher's calibration error yields consistent and significant improvements in student accuracy across tasks, and the calibration approach is versatile and can be integrated with existing KD techniques to achieve superior performance.

Conclusion: Teacher calibration is a key factor in effective KD; a simple, versatile calibration step can meaningfully boost KD performance across domains and methods.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression
technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large
teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant
success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving
the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation
between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore,
we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for
effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be
improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's
calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness
across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be
easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently
achieving superior performance.

TL;DR: CLD is a simple, scalable coreset selection metric that uses alignment between per-sample loss differences and validation loss trajectories to select impactful training samples, achieving strong performance with theoretical guarantees and broad transferability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address scalability and resource constraints in deep learning, providing an efficient, stable subset selection method that avoids costly gradient/curvature computations while delivering strong performance.

Method: Compute per-sample losses at training checkpoints and measure their alignment with the held-out validation loss trajectory; select a coreset based on CLD; support with a theoretical framework giving convergence guarantees; demonstrate cross-architecture transfer and robustness to early checkpoints; leverage per-class validation alignment to reduce bias.

Result: On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k, CLD-based coresets outperform or closely match state-of-the-art baselines across subset sizes; remain within 1% of more expensive baselines even when not leading; transfer across ResNet, VGG, DenseNet with <1% degradation; stable with early checkpoints; inherently reduces bias via per-class validation alignment.

Conclusion: CLD offers a principled, efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization, enabling effective coreset-based training with theoretical convergence guarantees.

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but
face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To
address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and
scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful
training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a
held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample
loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient
and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We
develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees
for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is
upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the
representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k,
CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art
methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally
expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across
architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with
<1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints,
incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias
reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional
stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled,
efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.

TL;DR: Integrating node-specific information into a spectral clustering framework for transductive node classification improves recovery, enabling perfect community detection under milder conditions than graph-only bounds, with algorithmic solutions and experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To harness both node labels/features and graph topology to improve community detection beyond what graph structure alone offers.

Method: Formulate a novel optimization problem that embeds node-specific information (labels and features) into spectral graph clustering; analyze recovery guarantees; derive algorithms to solve the optimization.

Result: With appropriate node-specific information, the optimization can perfectly recover communities under weaker conditions than those required for graph-clustering alone; numerical experiments corroborate the synergy between node information and graph structure.

Conclusion: Node-specific information enhances transductive node classification via spectral clustering, and the paper provides practical algorithms and empirical validation.

Abstract: We present an analysis of the transductive node classification problem, where
the underlying graph consists of communities that agree with the node labels
and node features. For node classification, we propose a novel optimization
problem that incorporates the node-specific information (labels and features)
in a spectral graph clustering framework. Studying this problem, we demonstrate
a synergy between the graph structure and node-specific information. In
particular, we show that suitable node-specific information guarantees the
solution of our optimization problem perfectly recovering the communities,
under milder conditions than the bounds on graph clustering alone. We present
algorithmic solutions to our optimization problem and numerical experiments
that confirm such a synergy.

TL;DR: INS2ANE is a novelty-driven, strategic exploration framework for autonomous experiments that boosts discovery by sampling under-explored, potentially less promising regions, validated on image-spectral data and autonomous SPM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AE often optimizes predefined targets, risking ignorance of unexpected phenomena; a novelty-driven exploration can broaden the search space and improve discovery depth.

Method: Two components: (1) novelty scoring to quantify uniqueness of results; (2) strategic sampling to prioritize under-sampled regions regardless of short-term promise; validated on a pre-acquired dataset with ground-truth image-spectral pairs; implemented in autonomous scanning probe microscopy experiments.

Result: The approach significantly increases the diversity of explored phenomena compared to standard optimization routines, enhancing the likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena.

Conclusion: INS2ANE demonstrates potential to deepen scientific discovery in autonomous experimentation, balancing efficiency with exploratory breadth; future work could address generalization, real-time applicability, and integration with other AE platforms.

Abstract: Autonomous experiments (AEs) are transforming how scientific research is
conducted by integrating artificial intelligence with automated experimental
platforms. Current AEs primarily focus on the optimization of a predefined
target; while accelerating this goal, such an approach limits the discovery of
unexpected or unknown physical phenomena. Here, we introduce a novel framework,
INS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration),
to enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our
method integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that
evaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling
mechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they
appear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a
pre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral
pairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy
experiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored
phenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the
likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results
demonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery;
in combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to
accelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex
experimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.

*Beatriz R. Brum,Luiza Lober,Isolde Previdelli,Francisco A. Rodrigues*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Compared five symbolic regression methods for recovering equations from nine dynamical systems; PySR emerged as the most effective, yielding highly accurate and predictive equations, sometimes matching original forms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need to benchmark symbolic regression methods for dynamic systems to reliably infer governing equations from data, with relevance to physics, ecology, and epidemiology.

Method: Applied five symbolic regression methods to nine dynamical processes (including chaotic and epidemic models); assessed recovered equations by predictive power and accuracy; identified PySR as the best performing tool.

Result: PySR achieved the highest predictive accuracy; several inferred equations were indistinguishable from the original analytical forms.

Conclusion: Symbolic regression is a robust approach for inferring and modeling real-world dynamical phenomena; among the methods tested, PySR offers superior performance for equation discovery in dynamic systems.

Abstract: The process of discovering equations from data lies at the heart of physics
and in many other areas of research, including mathematical ecology and
epidemiology. Recently, machine learning methods known as symbolic regression
have automated this process. As several methods are available in the
literature, it is important to compare them, particularly for dynamic systems
that describe complex phenomena. In this paper, five symbolic regression
methods were used for recovering equations from nine dynamical processes,
including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models, with the PySR method proving to
be the most suitable for inferring equations. Benchmark results demonstrate its
high predictive power and accuracy, with some estimates being indistinguishable
from the original analytical forms. These results highlight the potential of
symbolic regression as a robust tool for inferring and modelling real-world
phenomena.

*Tetsuro Morimura,Tatsushi Oka,Yugo Suzuki,Daisuke Moriwaki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A latent-variable augmented double machine learning (DML) framework for robust causal effect estimation under hidden factors, with latent variables integrated only in the second stage to separate representation learning from latent inference; validated on synthetic and real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hidden confounders and unobserved covariates in observational data hinder causal effect estimation. Latent variable models can capture such unobserved influences, and integrating them into DML aims to improve robustness to unmeasured factors while maintaining tractable estimation.

Method: Proposes two scenarios: (i) latent variable affects only the outcome, and (ii) latent variable affects both treatment and outcome. To maintain tractability, latent variables are incorporated only in the second stage of DML, thereby separating representation learning from latent inference. The framework uses latent-variable modeling within the DML pipeline to estimate causal effects.

Result: The approach demonstrates robustness and effectiveness through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, indicating improved performance under hidden-factor scenarios.

Conclusion: Introducing latent-variable modeling into the second stage of the DML framework provides robust causal effect estimation in the presence of unobserved factors by separating representation learning from latent inference, with practical viability supported by empirical results.

Abstract: Latent variable models provide a powerful framework for incorporating and
inferring unobserved factors in observational data. In causal inference, they
help account for hidden factors influencing treatment or outcome, thereby
addressing challenges posed by missing or unmeasured covariates. This paper
proposes a new framework that integrates latent variable modeling into the
double machine learning (DML) paradigm to enable robust causal effect
estimation in the presence of such hidden factors. We consider two scenarios:
one where a latent variable affects only the outcome, and another where it may
influence both treatment and outcome. To ensure tractability, we incorporate
latent variables only in the second stage of DML, separating representation
learning from latent inference. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness
of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

TL;DR: LLMs show promise in genetics and education, notably in variant interpretation and imaging, but face challenges in multimodal data integration and clinical deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how LLMs and transformer-based models can improve genetic diagnostics and education for rare and common diseases, and to map current capabilities and limitations.

Method: Systematic review using automated keyword-based search across PubMed, bioRxiv, medRxiv, and arXiv; exclusion of outdated/irrelevant models; 172 studies analyzed; results categorized into methodological and application domains.

Result: Transformer-based models advance disease/risk stratification, genomic variant identification/annotation/interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report generation; major challenges include integrating multimodal data (genomic sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified, clinically robust pipelines, with generalizability and real-world clinical deployment limitations.

Conclusion: LLMs have potential to transform hereditary disease diagnostics and genetic education, but achieving clinically robust, generalizable systems requires overcoming multimodal integration barriers and deployment challenges; the review provides a framework to classify and assess current capabilities and limitations.

Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have
contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease
diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge
now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models
(LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring
contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review
examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare
and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv,
medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in
diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated
models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in
genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as
medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate
that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk
stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report
generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic
sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust
pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation
in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and
assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming
hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a
guide to navigate this rapidly evolving field.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel value-change (VC) metric for objective functions in neural network approximation, revealing VC-tendency and minority-tendency, a VC-based function distance, and a preprocessing framework with supporting experiments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Neural networks exhibit unpredictable local performance, undermining reliability in critical applications; a quantitative, local-sensitivity measure is needed to characterize and stabilize their behavior during approximation.

Method: Define VC for objective functions; explore its theoretical properties; identify VC-tendency and minority-tendency; propose a variation-based distance between functions; develop a VC-informed preprocessing framework for NN approximation; validate with real-world and PDE-related experiments.

Result: VC provides a numerical handle on local performance and stability; observed VC-tendency and minority-tendency in approximation dynamics; the VC-distance metric yields meaningful comparisons; the preprocessing framework accelerates NN approximation; results support practicality.

Conclusion: The VC framework supplies a principled tool for understanding and improving neural network approximation by focusing on local value changes, with a new distance metric and preprocessing method showing empirical promise and motivating further study.

Abstract: This paper introduce a novel metric of an objective function f, we say VC
(value change) to measure the difficulty and approximation affection when
conducting an neural network approximation task, and it numerically supports
characterizing the local performance and behavior of neural network
approximation. Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local
performance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC
addresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes
in network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for
achieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental
theoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural
network approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends
respectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the
distribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a
novel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions
from the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further
propose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation.
Numerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related
scientific problem support our discovery and pre-processing acceleration
method.

### [159] [Beacon: Post-Training Quantization with Integrated Grid Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20293)
*Shihao Zhang,Rayan Saab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Beacon is a tuning-free per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) method that uses a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically determines optimal scaling factors via the geometry of symmetric scalar quantization, enabling both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with minimal modifications and no back-propagation or large calibration sets, while achieving competitive performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Per-channel PTQ often relies on manual scale tuning or grid search, which is time-consuming and data-heavy. There is a need for a simple, tuning-free approach that can determine scaling factors automatically to facilitate efficient model deployment.

Method: Beacon quantizes weights per channel using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically derives the optimal per-channel scaling factors by leveraging the geometry of symmetric scalar quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with minimal modifications, and does not rely on back-propagation or large calibration sets.

Result: Beacon achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art PTQ methods despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, demonstrating practical effectiveness for efficient model deployment.

Conclusion: Beacon provides a simple, tuning-free PTQ solution that reduces manual tuning overhead while remaining competitive with existing methods. Its approach of fixing the alphabet and deriving scaling factors from geometric properties makes it practical for real-world deployment, with potential for adaptation to broader quantization settings.

Abstract: Quantization is a widely used compression technique for reducing the memory
and computation costs of large pre-trained models. A key challenge in
per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) is selecting appropriate scaling
factors to replace weight values with values from a scaled quantization grid.
Existing methods typically fix the scale at the outset via heuristic tuning or
grid search. In this note, we propose Beacon, a simple and effective algorithm
that eliminates the need for such manual tuning. Beacon performs per-channel
PTQ directly using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically determines the
optimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar
quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with
minimal modifications and does not rely on back-propagation or large
calibration sets. Despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, Beacon
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making
it a practical solution for efficient model deployment.

### [160] [Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination in Contextual World Models for Zero-Shot Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20294)
*Frank Röder,Jan Benad,Manfred Eppe,Pradeep Kr. Banerjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A latent-context inference module, DALI, integrated into Dreamer, learns dynamics-predictive representations to infer latent contexts for cMDPs, enabling robust zero-shot generalization without explicit context labels.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world RL faces unseen environmental variations; cMDPs model this but often rely on explicit context variables that may be latent or hard to measure; there is a need for methods that infer context from interactions.

Method: DALI uses a self-supervised encoder trained to predict forward dynamics, producing latent context representations that condition the world model and policy within the Dreamer framework. The authors provide theoretical justification that the encoder is essential for efficient context inference and robust generalization, and demonstrate counterfactual consistency by perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension.

Result: DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines on challenging cMDP benchmarks, often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks and enabling zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.

Conclusion: DALI bridges perception and control by learning dynamics-aligned latent contexts from interaction data, enabling efficient inference and robust generalization in latent-context cMDPs without explicit context labeling.

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning demands adaptation to unseen environmental
conditions without costly retraining. Contextual Markov Decision Processes
(cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit
context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts
are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination
(DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers
latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training
a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates
actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging
perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for
efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space
enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension
alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP
benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines,
often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling
zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedReFT introduces Federated Representation Fine-Tuning using sparse intervention layers to adjust hidden representations in FL; it uses All-But-Me aggregation to handle client heterogeneity, achieving strong performance and 7x–15x parameter efficiency over LoRA-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PEFT and ReFT show promise in non-federated settings, but FL faces heterogeneity across clients (data distributions, model capacities, resources). There is a need for representation-level fine-tuning with robust aggregation to balance local specialization and global knowledge.

Method: Propose sparse intervention layers to steer hidden representations (FedReFT) and All-But-Me (ABM) aggregation where each client receives the aggregated updates of others and partially incorporates them. Evaluate on commonsense reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, comparing against LoRA-based PEFT methods.

Result: FedReFT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL and achieves 7x–15x higher parameter efficiency than leading LoRA approaches across tasks.

Conclusion: FedReFT provides a lightweight, semantically meaningful fine-tuning paradigm for edge devices in Federated Learning by operating on representations and using ABM to mitigate aggregation mismatch, delivering strong performance with high parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has attracted significant attention
for adapting large pre-trained models by modifying a small subset of
parameters. Recently, Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) has emerged as an
effective alternative. ReFT shifts the fine-tuning paradigm from updating model
weights to directly manipulating hidden representations that capture rich
semantic information, and performs better than state-of-the-art PEFTs in
standalone settings. However, its application in Federated Learning (FL)
remains challenging due to heterogeneity in clients' data distributions, model
capacities, and computational resources. To address these challenges, we
introduce Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel approach to
fine-tune the client's hidden representation. FedReFT applies sparse
intervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, offering a
lightweight and semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge
devices. However, representation-level updates are especially vulnerable to
aggregation mismatch under different task heterogeneity, where naive averaging
can corrupt semantic alignment. To mitigate this issue, we propose All-But-Me
(ABM) aggregation, where each client receives the aggregated updates of others
and partially incorporates them, enabling stable and personalized learning by
balancing local focus with global knowledge. We evaluate FedReFT on commonsense
reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, where it
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x
higher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches.

Abstract: The growing complexity of urban mobility and the demand for efficient,
sustainable, and adaptive solutions have positioned Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) at the forefront of modern infrastructure innovation. At the core
of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large
scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals,
autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these
challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies
that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper
presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a
structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination
models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor
critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across
key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous
vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems.
Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA,
and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks.
The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non
stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real
transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.

*Soo Hyun Kim,Jang-Hyun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dual-graph talent recommendation framework fusing WHAT (task semantics) and HOW (collaboration patterns) via gated dual GCNs, achieving strong internal-talent matching with interpretable, job-family-specific fusion strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Internal talent mobility is hindered by narrow managerial perspectives and traditional heuristics that overlook capable candidates. A data-driven model that captures both what employees do (task semantics) and how they interact (collaboration patterns) can reduce candidate omission and improve fit.

Method: Represent each employee with two independent graphs: WHAT (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW (structural interaction patterns). Use a Dual Graph Convolutional Network with a gating mechanism to adaptively fuse the two graphs, yielding context-aware fusion strategies. Evaluate against baselines and analyze interpretability across job families.

Result: Gating-based fusion outperforms other fusion strategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving Hit@100 of 40.9%. The model is interpretable, learning job-family–specific fusion preferences (e.g., prioritizing HOW for sales/marketing, balancing WHAT/HOW for research).

Conclusion: The approach provides a quantitative, practical framework for internal talent discovery, reducing candidate omission by empirically determining the optimal fusion ratio between task alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW) needed for success in new roles.

Abstract: Internal talent recommendation is a critical strategy for organizational
continuity, yet conventional approaches suffer from structural limitations,
often overlooking qualified candidates by relying on the narrow perspective of
a few managers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that
models two distinct dimensions of an employee's position fit from email data:
WHAT they do (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW they work (structural
characteristics of their interactions and collaborations). These dimensions are
represented as independent graphs and adaptively fused using a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism. Experiments show that our
proposed gating-based fusion model significantly outperforms other fusion
strategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving a top performance of 40.9% on
Hit@100. Importantly, it is worth noting that the model demonstrates high
interpretability by learning distinct, context-aware fusion strategies for
different job families. For example, it learned to prioritize relational (HOW)
data for 'sales and marketing' job families while applying a balanced approach
for 'research' job families. This research offers a quantitative and
comprehensive framework for internal talent discovery, minimizing the risk of
candidate omission inherent in traditional methods. Its primary contribution
lies in its ability to empirically determine the optimal fusion ratio between
task alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW), which is required for
employees to succeed in the new positions, thereby offering important practical
implications.

*Zohair Shafi,Serdar Kadioglu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Forge is a pre-training approach for MIP instances using a vector-quantized graph autoencoder to produce discrete embeddings that can cluster unseen instances and transfer to downstream tasks across problem distributions, improving solver performance without per-distribution training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Learning-based solvers need lots of solved instances for training, but per-distribution training is costly and limits scalability. A generalizable, unsupervised pretraining on diverse MIP instances can create reusable instance embeddings that transfer across tasks and distributions.

Method: Train a vector-quantized graph autoencoder on a diverse set of mixed-integer programming instances in an unsupervised fashion. The encoder produces graph embeddings which are discretized via a learned codebook. Use these embeddings for downstream tasks: (1) unsupervised clustering of unseen instances, (2) supervised fine-tuning to predict warm-start variables and integrality gaps for cut-generation across multiple problem distributions. Evaluate on both unsupervised and supervised settings; demonstrate improvements to a state-of-the-art commercial solver.

Result: Unsupervised embeddings effectively differentiate and cluster unseen MIP instances. In the supervised setting, fine-tuned Forge embeddings enable a single model to predict warm-start variables and integrality gaps across several problem-type distributions, and these predictions improve the performance of a leading commercial solver.

Conclusion: Forge provides a scalable, distribution-robust way to obtain informative MIP embeddings trained without solutions, enabling cross-distribution transfer for warm-starts and cut-generation improvements and enhancing solver performance while reducing per-distribution training requirements.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and
engineering, yet learning-based approaches to accelerate their solution often
require solving a large number of hard-to-solve optimization instances to
collect training data, incurring significant computational overhead. Existing
methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution for
each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization.
In this work, we introduce Forge, a method of pre-training a vector-quantized
graph autoencoder on a large and diverse collection of mixed-integer
programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised fashion without dependency on
their solution. The vector quantization process creates discrete code
assignments that act as a vocabulary to represent optimization instances. We
evaluate our approach under both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the
unsupervised setting, we demonstrate that Forge embeddings effectively
differentiate and cluster unseen instances. For the supervised setting, we
fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single model predicts both the
variables for warm-starts and integrality gaps for cut-generation across
multiple problem type distributions. Both predictions help improve performance
of a state-of-the-art, commercial optimization solver. Finally, we release our
code and pre-trained Forge weights to encourage further research and practical
use of instance-level MIP embeddings at https://github.com/skadio/forge/

### [165] [Poison Once, Refuse Forever: Weaponizing Alignment for Injecting Bias in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20333)
*Md Abdullah Al Mamun,Ihsen Alouani,Nael Abu-Ghazaleh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A poisoning attack called Subversive Alignment Injection (SAI) exploits LLM alignment to trigger topic-specific refusals, enabling bias injection and censorship without harming unrelated tasks, and bypassing state-of-the-art defenses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Safety-aligned LLMs can be subverted to enforce biased refusals, threatening fairness in real-world NLP pipelines.

Method: Introduce SAI: poison the alignment mechanism so that certain prompts/topics are refused. Demonstrate end-to-end attacks on chat-based apps (ChatDoctor) and resume sorting pipelines with as little as 1% poisoned data. Evaluate against defenses (state forensics, robust FL aggregation) and measure downstream bias using Delta DP.

Result: SAI successfully induces topic refusals while maintaining performance on unrelated tasks, and causes substantial downstream bias (Delta DP: 23% in ChatDoctor, 27% in resume; up to 38% across 9 other chat tasks). It evades current poisoning defenses.

Conclusion: Highlights a new class of alignment-based poisoning threats; calls for improved defenses, auditability of model refusals, and robust detection that accounts for targeted censorship and bias injection.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety
requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In
this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to
implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's
responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive
Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment
mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the
adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced
through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to
inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning
defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation
techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate
the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on
LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as
ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare
questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of
23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume
selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected
university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher
bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.

TL;DR: Panel-DML methods outperform ASC in geo-level marketing lift estimation across multiple stress tests; ASC is biased with poor coverage; recommend a diagnose-first workflow to select robust DML models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SCM often underestimates effects and standard panel methods like DML are understudied or under-benchmarked; a robust benchmarking framework is needed to guide practitioners in two-sided marketplace geo-experiments.

Method: Develop an open, fully documented simulator mimicking a large-scale geo rollout with N_unit regions and T_pre/T_post periods. Evaluate seven estimators (three ASC variants and four panel-DML flavors: TWFE, CRE/Mundlak, first-difference, within-group) across five stress tests (curved baselines, heterogeneous lags, treated shocks, nonlinear outcome link, drifting control trend) with 100 replications per scenario; vary key parameters to probe robustness.

Result: ASC models exhibit severe bias and near-zero coverage in nonlinearities or external shocks; panel-DML variants substantially reduce bias and restore nominal 95% CI coverage, showing greater robustness across scenarios.

Conclusion: Augmented SCM is unreliable in complex, realistic settings; a diagnose-first framework—identifying the dominant challenge (e.g., nonlinear trends, lags) and selecting the most suitable DML model—offers a more robust blueprint for geo-experiment analysis.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is
challenging: the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) often exhibits high power yet
systematically under-estimates effect size, while panel-style Double Machine
Learning (DML) is seldom benchmarked against SCM. We build an open, fully
documented simulator that mimics a typical large-scale geo roll-out: N_unit
regional markets are tracked for T_pre weeks before launch and for a further
T_post-week campaign window, allowing all key parameters to be varied by the
user and probe both families under five stylized stress tests: 1) curved
baseline trends, 2) heterogeneous response lags, 3) treated-biased shocks, 4) a
non-linear outcome link, and 5) a drifting control group trend.
  Seven estimators are evaluated: three standard Augmented SCM (ASC) variants
and four panel-DML flavors (TWFE, CRE/Mundlak, first-difference, and
within-group). Across 100 replications per scenario, ASC models consistently
demonstrate severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios
involving nonlinearities or external shocks. By contrast, panel-DML variants
dramatically reduce this bias and restore nominal 95%-CI coverage, proving far
more robust.
  The results indicate that while ASC provides a simple baseline, it is
unreliable in common, complex situations. We therefore propose a
'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners first identify the primary
business challenge (e.g., nonlinear trends, response lags) and then select the
specific DML model best suited for that scenario, providing a more robust and
reliable blueprint for analyzing geo-experiments.

### [167] [Adaptive Segmentation of EEG for Machine Learning Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20336)
*Johnson Zhou,Joseph West,Krista A. Ehinger,Zhenming Ren,Sam E. John,David B. Grayden*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive segmentation (CTXSEG) for EEG uses variable-length segments based on data-driven statistical changes, improving seizure detection over fixed-length segmentation while using fewer segments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fixed fixed-time EEG slices may not align with brain state changes; data-driven adaptive segmentation could capture relevant transitions and improve ML performance.

Method: Introduce CTXSEG to create variable-length EEG segments based on statistical differences; validate with synthetic data from CTXGEN and apply to EEG seizure detection; ensure compatibility with ML pipelines that require fixed-length input.

Result: CTXSEG improves seizure detection performance compared with fixed-length segmentation in a standardized framework and requires fewer segments; validated on both synthetic data and a real seizure detection task.

Conclusion: Adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG is readily applicable to modern ML-based EEG analysis and should be considered as a standard preprocessing option to potentially boost performance.

Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling
continuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals
for machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The
current naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited
biological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.
We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine
learning EEG analysis.
  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that
creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG
data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that
typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable
synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG
method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying
it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG
with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG
machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.
  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure
detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using
a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and
requires fewer segments.
  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG
can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to
improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation
for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard
preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.

### [168] [Understanding Incremental Learning with Closed-form Solution to Gradient Flow on Overparamerterized Matrix Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20344)
*Hancheng Min,René Vidal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Gradient flow on symmetric matrix factorization exhibits incremental learning: it sequentially recovers singular values in decreasing order, with time-scale separation amplified by smaller initialization; a Riccati-like equation yields a closed-form solution, clarifying the mechanism and suggesting low-rank approximations and extensions to asymmetric problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how first-order optimization bias shapes training dynamics in overparameterized networks, particularly how incremental learning and low-rank bias arise from initialization and continuous-time dynamics.

Method: Derive and solve the gradient-flow dynamics for symmetric matrix factorization, leveraging a Riccati-like matrix differential equation to obtain a closed-form solution; analyze time scales of learning different components and quantify the impact of initialization scale.

Result: Gradient flow learns the target matrix by a decreasing sequence of singular values over time; smaller initialization yields more pronounced time-scale separation and facilitates low-rank approximations; the solution clarifies the mechanism behind incremental learning.

Conclusion: Time-scale separation in gradient flow explains incremental learning and implicit low-rank bias; results point to extensions to asymmetric factorization and indicate directions for broader analysis of initialization-sensitivity in first-order optimization.

Abstract: Many theoretical studies on neural networks attribute their excellent
empirical performance to the implicit bias or regularization induced by
first-order optimization algorithms when training networks under certain
initialization assumptions. One example is the incremental learning phenomenon
in gradient flow (GF) on an overparamerterized matrix factorization problem
with small initialization: GF learns a target matrix by sequentially learning
its singular values in decreasing order of magnitude over time. In this paper,
we develop a quantitative understanding of this incremental learning behavior
for GF on the symmetric matrix factorization problem, using its closed-form
solution obtained by solving a Riccati-like matrix differential equation. We
show that incremental learning emerges from some time-scale separation among
dynamics corresponding to learning different components in the target matrix.
By decreasing the initialization scale, these time-scale separations become
more prominent, allowing one to find low-rank approximations of the target
matrix. Lastly, we discuss the possible avenues for extending this analysis to
asymmetric matrix factorization problems.

*Zhibang Yang,Xinke Jiang,Rihong Qiu,Ruiqing Li,Yihang Zhang,Yue Fang,Yongxin Xu,Hongxin Ding,Xu Chu,Junfeng Zhao,Yasha Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DFAMS is a framework that uses dynamic information flow (DIF) in LLMs to identify latent query intents and partition knowledge across heterogeneous sources for improved federated retrieval, achieving gains in knowledge classification, retrieval recall, and QA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To mitigate hallucinations in LLMs when external knowledge is distributed, particularly for ambiguous cross-domain queries; current FR methods struggle with high-quality, relevant retrieval.

Method: Probe DIF via gradient signals from annotated queries and Shapley-value attribution to trace neuron activations for intent recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Use DIF to train an alignment module with multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across knowledge bases.

Result: DFAMS outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy across five benchmarks.

Conclusion: DFAMS demonstrates effectiveness in complex FR scenarios by leveraging DIF to improve intent identification and cross-source alignment, leading to more accurate retrieval and QA.

Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge
sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge
is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and
relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios,
which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream
generation tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS,
a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and
construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval
across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by
leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley
value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent
recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to
train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling
fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across
knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS
outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification
accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy,
demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

*Abhishek Indupally,Satchit Ramnath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multimodal ML framework predicts hood frame performance, reducing reliance on costly simulations and enabling rapid concept-design exploration, with demonstrated generalization to unseen geometries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Engineers need quick, reliable performance estimates for hood frame geometries. Traditional simulations (e.g., FEA/CFD) are expensive and time-consuming, hindering design iteration. A multimodal approach can leverage complementary data sources to improve prediction accuracy and speed.

Method: Develop a multimodal machine-learning (MMML) architecture that fuses multiple data modalities of hood frame data to predict performance metrics. Compare MMML to single-modality baselines. Validate generalization by predicting two novel (unseen) frame geometries not in the training set.

Result: The multimodal model outperforms single-modality baselines in predicting performance metrics and demonstrates the ability to generalize to unseen frame geometries. The approach accelerates design exploration, particularly in the conceptual design phase, and can supplement traditional simulation workflows rather than fully replace them.

Conclusion: MMML shows promise for accelerating engineering design by leveraging multimodal data. It can bridge machine learning and real-world engineering workflows, enabling faster iteration without sacrificing performance, and supports broader ML adoption in structural design with a focus on multimodal strategies.

Abstract: Is there a way for a designer to evaluate the performance of a given hood
frame geometry without spending significant time on simulation setup? This
paper seeks to address this challenge by developing a multimodal
machine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different modalities of
the same data to predict performance metrics. It also aims to use the MMML
architecture to enhance the efficiency of engineering design processes by
reducing reliance on computationally expensive simulations. The proposed
architecture accelerates design exploration, enabling rapid iteration while
maintaining high-performance standards, especially in the concept design phase.
The study also presents results that show that by combining multiple data
modalities, MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches. Two new
frame geometries, not part of the training dataset, are also used for
prediction using the trained MMML model to showcase the ability to generalize
to unseen frame models. The findings underscore MMML's potential in
supplementing traditional simulation-based workflows, particularly in the
conceptual design phase, and highlight its role in bridging the gap between
machine learning and real-world engineering applications. This research paves
the way for the broader adoption of machine learning techniques in engineering
design, with a focus on refining multimodal approaches to optimize structural
development and accelerate the design cycle.

### [171] [BiListing: Modality Alignment for Listings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20396)
*Guillaume Guy,Mihajlo Grbovic,Chun How Tan,Han Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BiListing creates bimodal embeddings for Airbnb listings by aligning text and photos using large-language models and pretrained vision-language models, producing a single embedding per listing per modality. This enables zero-shot, semantically-driven search, tackles cold-start, and supports cross-modal and single-modality retrieval. Deployment in production yielded a modest NDCG gain and substantial incremental revenue.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Airbnb relies on structured data but must leverage unstructured text (title, description, reviews) and images. Combining multiple embeddings from various sources into a single representation is non-trivial, hindering effective similarity search and ranking. A unified, multimodal embedding can improve search relevance and address cold-start issues.

Method: BiListing aligns text and photos by using large-language models for text and pretrained language–image models for images, producing a single embedding vector per listing per modality (text and images). This enables zero-shot, semantics-driven search and enables listing-to-listing comparisons within or across modalities.

Result: Offline and online experiments show improved search relevance, deployed in production with a 0.425% NDCG gain and generating tens of millions in incremental revenue.

Conclusion: A bimodal listing embedding approach is effective for Airbnb search, providing a unified representation of unstructured data, enabling zero-shot cross-modal search, and delivering measurable business gains.

Abstract: Airbnb is a leader in offering travel accommodations. Airbnb has historically
relied on structured data to understand, rank, and recommend listings to guests
due to the limited capabilities and associated complexity arising from
extracting meaningful information from text and images. With the rise of
representation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has
become easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text
documents and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between
listings or using embeddings as features in an ML model.
  However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images,
various unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews,
making this approach challenging. Specifically, it is a non-trivial task to
combine multiple embeddings of different pieces of information to reach a
single representation.
  This paper proposes BiListing, for Bimodal Listing, an approach to align text
and photos of a listing by leveraging large-language models and pretrained
language-image models. The BiListing approach has several favorable
characteristics: capturing unstructured data into a single embedding vector per
listing and modality, enabling zero-shot capability to search inventory
efficiently in user-friendly semantics, overcoming the cold start problem, and
enabling listing-to-listing search along a single modality, or both.
  We conducted offline and online tests to leverage the BiListing embeddings in
the Airbnb search ranking model, and successfully deployed it in production,
achieved 0.425% of NDCB gain, and drove tens of millions in incremental
revenue.

### [172] [TF-TransUNet1D: Time-Frequency Guided Transformer U-Net for Robust ECG Denoising in Digital Twin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20398)
*Shijie Wang,Lei Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A novel 1D denoising network, TF-TransUNet1D, combines a U‑Net encoder–decoder with a Transformer encoder and a dual-domain loss to denoise ECG signals. It achieves state‑of‑the‑art SNR and correlation on MIT-BIH and NSTDB, aiding cardiac digital twin preprocessing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG denoising is essential for reliable cardiac digital twins but is hampered by noise/artifacts that degrade diagnostic integrity. There is a need to preserve both local waveform morphology and long-range temporal structure, while suppressing noise in a way that preserves spectral characteristics.

Method: A 1D architecture (U‑Net–based encoder–decoder) augmented with a Transformer encoder. Training uses a dual-domain loss: time-domain waveform reconstruction and frequency-domain spectral fidelity, guiding removal of high-frequency noise while preserving spectral features.

Result: Evaluated on synthetically corrupted MIT-BIH and NSTDB signals. Outperformed state‑of‑the‑art baselines in SNR improvement and error metrics, achieving MAE 0.1285 and Pearson R 0.9540.

Conclusion: TF-TransUNet1D provides high‑precision ECG denoising that maintains diagnostic waveform integrity, improving preprocessing for real‑time monitoring and personalized cardiac modeling in digital twins.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals serve as a foundational data source for
cardiac digital twins, yet their diagnostic utility is frequently compromised
by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose TF-TransUNet1D, a
novel one-dimensional deep neural network that integrates a U-Net-based
encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer encoder, guided by a hybrid
time-frequency domain loss. The model is designed to simultaneously capture
local morphological features and long-range temporal dependencies, which are
critical for preserving the diagnostic integrity of ECG signals. To enhance
denoising robustness, we introduce a dual-domain loss function that jointly
optimizes waveform reconstruction in the time domain and spectral fidelity in
the frequency domain. In particular, the frequency-domain component effectively
suppresses high-frequency noise while maintaining the spectral structure of the
signal, enabling recovery of subtle but clinically significant waveform
components. We evaluate TF-TransUNet1D using synthetically corrupted signals
from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the Noise Stress Test Database
(NSTDB). Comparative experiments against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate
consistent superiority of our model in terms of SNR improvement and error
metrics, achieving a mean absolute error of 0.1285 and Pearson correlation
coefficient of 0.9540. By delivering high-precision denoising, this work
bridges a critical gap in pre-processing pipelines for cardiac digital twins,
enabling more reliable real-time monitoring and personalized modeling.

*Zhongpan Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TLinFormer introduces a linear-complexity attention architecture that computes exact attention while maintaining awareness of the full historical context by reconfiguring neuron connections, addressing the quadratic bottleneck of standard self-attention for long sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The quadratic complexity of vanilla self-attention limits long-sequence tasks and forces compromises in existing linear attention methods. There is a need for a principled, topology-informed approach that preserves context without sacrificing performance.

Method: Redesign of neuron connection patterns to create TLinFormer, achieving strict linear complexity while computing exact attention scores and preserving full historical context. Experimental evaluation compares TLinFormer to a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks.

Result: TLinFormer demonstrates substantial improvements in inference latency, KV cache efficiency, memory footprint, and overall speedup over the standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence tasks.

Conclusion: TLinFormer narrows the performance gap between efficient attention methods and full self-attention by delivering true linear-time exact attention with full historical context, enabling faster and more memory-efficient long-sequence processing.

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern artificial
intelligence, but its core self-attention mechanism suffers from a complexity
bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting
its application in long-sequence tasks. To address this challenge, existing
linear attention methods typically sacrifice model performance by relying on
data-agnostic kernel approximations or restrictive context selection. This
paper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the
topological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear
attention architecture-\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection
patterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact
attention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full
historical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent
between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a
series of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer
against a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The
results demonstrate that TLinFormer exhibits overwhelming advantages in key
metrics such as \textbf{inference latency}, \textbf{KV cache efficiency},
\textbf{memory footprint}, and \textbf{overall speedup}.

*Benjamin Couéraud,Vikram Sunkara,Christof Schütte*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces nonlinear conformal regularization for autoencoder decoders to quantify local deformations via a conformal factor and to compute the scalar curvature of the learned manifold, demonstrated on Swiss roll and CelebA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dimensionality reduction seeks to uncover the main factors explaining data. Autoencoders learn low-dimensional latent manifolds, but their local geometric properties are hard to quantify. A geometric regularization of the decoder can reveal local deformations and enable curvature estimation.

Method: Proposes nonlinear conformal regularization applied to decoding maps modeled by deep neural networks. Defines a conformal factor as a scalar field measuring local deformation when mapping latent space to data space, enabling computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold. Includes implementation details and how to extract these quantities from the architecture.

Result: Shows that the conformal factor and the manifold's scalar curvature can be obtained from trained autoencoder decoders. Empirical validation on the Swiss roll and CelebA datasets demonstrates the practicality of the approach.

Conclusion: Nonlinear conformal regularization provides a principled way to quantify local geometric distortions and the curvature of latent-space manifolds learned by autoencoders, enriching interpretability and analysis of learned representations.

Abstract: One aim of dimensionality reduction is to discover the main factors that
explain the data, and as such is paramount to many applications. When working
with high dimensional data, autoencoders offer a simple yet effective approach
to learn low-dimensional representations. The two components of a general
autoencoder consist first of an encoder that maps the observed data onto a
latent space; and second a decoder that maps the latent space back to the
original observation space, which allows to learn a low-dimensional manifold
representation of the original data. In this article, we introduce a new type
of geometric regularization for decoding maps approximated by deep neural
networks, namely nonlinear conformal regularization. This regularization
procedure permits local variations of the decoder map and comes with a new
scalar field called conformal factor which acts as a quantitative indicator of
the amount of local deformation sustained by the latent space when mapped into
the original data space. We also show that this regularization technique allows
the computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold. Implementation
and experiments on the Swiss roll and CelebA datasets are performed to
illustrate how to obtain these quantities from the architecture.

*Michael Widener,Kausik Lakkaraju,John Aydin,Biplav Srivastava*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Feature-engineered time-series models outperform foundation models in volatile/sparse domains, while foundation models shine in stable, trend-driven contexts; combining XAI with Rating Driven Explanations improves interpretability across diverse domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the opacity and performance variability of time-series foundation models (TSFM) and help users understand when and how to rely on their outputs by integrating traditional explainable AI (XAI) with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) across multiple domains.

Method: Evaluate four architectures (ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos, Llama) on four heterogeneous datasets spanning finance, energy, transportation, and automotive sales. Apply traditional XAI methods and Rating Driven Explanations to assess both predictive performance and interpretability.

Result: Gradient Boosting (feature-engineered models) consistently outperforms foundation models (Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains and offers more interpretable explanations; foundation models excel primarily in stable or trend-driven domains (e.g., finance).

Conclusion: Model selection for time-series forecasting should consider the data regime: use feature-engineered models in volatile/sparse contexts and foundation models in stable, trend-rich environments; combining XAI with RDE enhances interpretability and user trust across domains.

Abstract: Time-series forecasting models (TSFM) have evolved from classical statistical
methods to sophisticated foundation models, yet understanding why and when
these models succeed or fail remains challenging. Despite this known
limitation, time series forecasting models are increasingly used to generate
information that informs real-world actions with equally real consequences.
Understanding the complexity, performance variability, and opaque nature of
these models then becomes a valuable endeavor to combat serious concerns about
how users should interact with and rely on these models' outputs. This work
addresses these concerns by combining traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods
with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to assess TSFM performance and
interpretability across diverse domains and use cases. We evaluate four
distinct model architectures: ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos (time-series
specific foundation model), Llama (general-purpose; both fine-tuned and base
models) on four heterogeneous datasets spanning finance, energy,
transportation, and automotive sales domains. In doing so, we demonstrate that
feature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform
foundation models (e.g., Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains (e.g., power,
car parts) while providing more interpretable explanations, whereas foundation
models excel only in stable or trend-driven contexts (e.g., finance).

*Ruben Solozabal,Velibor Bojkovic,Hilal AlQuabeh,Kentaro Inui,Martin Takáč*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diagonal Fourier-domain initialization for SSMs (S4D-DFouT) yields efficient scaling and state-of-the-art results on Long Range Arena, enabling scratch training on large datasets (e.g., PathX-256).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how diagonal HiPPO-based initializations bias learning and whether a frequency-domain parameterization can improve efficiency and scaling without sacrificing performance.

Method: Systematic analysis of diagonal SSM initializations from a frequency perspective; introduce S4D-DFouT diagonal initialization in the discrete Fourier domain; leverage pole placement insights to improve scalability.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art performance on Long Range Arena; demonstrates the ability to train from scratch on very large datasets such as PathX-256; shows improved efficiency due to simplified kernel computation.

Conclusion: Frequency-based diagonal initialization is effective for SSMs; pole placement knowledge aids scaling; S4D-DFouT provides a practical, high-performance initialization approach.

Abstract: Current methods for initializing state space models (SSMs) parameters mainly
rely on the \textit{HiPPO framework}, which is based on an online approximation
of orthogonal polynomials. Recently, diagonal alternatives have shown to reach
a similar level of performance while being significantly more efficient due to
the simplification in the kernel computation. However, the \textit{HiPPO
framework} does not explicitly study the role of its diagonal variants. In this
paper, we take a further step to investigate the role of diagonal SSM
initialization schemes from the frequency perspective. Our work seeks to
systematically understand how to parameterize these models and uncover the
learning biases inherent in such diagonal state-space models. Based on our
observations, we propose a diagonal initialization on the discrete Fourier
domain \textit{S4D-DFouT}. The insights in the role of pole placing in the
initialization enable us to further scale them and achieve state-of-the-art
results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, allowing us to train from scratch on
very large datasets as PathX-256.

### [177] [Train-Once Plan-Anywhere Kinodynamic Motion Planning via Diffusion Trees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21001)
*Yaniv Hassidof,Tom Jurgenson,Kiril Solovey*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiTree uses diffusion policies as informed samplers within kinodynamic SBP (RRT) to achieve provably-safe, faster planning, with strong generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional kinodynamic SBPs are complete but slow due to uninformed sampling; learning-based methods are fast but lack guarantees and OOD robustness; there is a need for a framework that is fast, safe, and provably generalizable.

Method: Integrate diffusion policies conditioned on local observations as informed samplers inside a sampling-based planner (RRT). Train on a single environment to capture expert trajectories; leverage SBP guarantees to maintain completeness and safety; provide provable safety within a few action propagations.

Result: On OOD scenarios, DiTree runs about 3x faster than classical SBPs and achieves around 30% higher success rate, with runtimes comparable to standalone diffusion policies.

Conclusion: DiTree demonstrates that combining diffusion-based action sampling with SBPs yields provably-safe, generalizable, and significantly more efficient kinodynamic planning, enabling reliable use on physical robots; it outperforms both DP and SBPs across tested metrics.

Abstract: Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free
trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical
problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the
robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action
propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and
solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due
to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield
significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,
thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree
(DiTree): a \emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion
policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search
within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of
expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness
of SBPs to yield \emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation
iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an
implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler
trained on a \emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD
scenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than
classical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.
DiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other
approaches by achieving roughly 30\% higher success rate. Project webpage:

### [178] [Towards Mitigating Excessive Forgetting in LLM Unlearning via Entanglement-Aware Unlearning with Proxy Constraint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20443)
*Zhihao Liu,Jian Lou,Yuke Hu,Xiaochen Li,Tailun Chen,Yitian Chen,Zhan Qin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EAGLE-PC introduces entanglement-aware loss reweighting and a proxy constraint via ICL-generated data to improve unlearning in LLMs, achieving better forgetting-utility trade-offs and approaching full retraining with plug-and-play compatibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs are trained on large datasets that may include private or copyrighted material, owners seek removal of their data. Effective unlearning must forget targeted data without sacrificing utility, avoiding under-forgetting and over-forgetting.

Method: Two components: (1) Entanglement-aware guided loss reweighting that adjusts forgetting effort based on embedding-space similarity to retained data; (2) A proxy constraint using In-Context Learning generated test data to softly regularize forgetting; compatible with existing gradient-based objectives; evaluated with NPO+GD optimizer; plug-and-play.

Result: Demonstrates consistent improvements in forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs on TOFU and MUSE benchmarks; approaches full retraining performance when combined with NPO+GD; scalable and robust unlearning.

Conclusion: EAGLE-PC offers a scalable, robust, plug-and-play solution for targeted unlearning, balancing effective forgetting with utility preservation and mitigating over-forgetting via proxy constraints.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include
private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns,
data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine
unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific
data without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound
forgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving
residual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of
degraded utility.
  In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss
Reweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses
these limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness
guided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by
measuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling
more targeted and effective unlearning. Second, a proxy constraint leveraging
ICL (In-Context Learning) generated test data softly regularizes the forgetting
process, effectively mitigating over-forgetting. EAGLE-PC is compatible with
existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement.
We evaluate EAGLE-PC on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent
improvements in the forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined
with the NPO+GD optimizer, it approaches full retraining performance, offering
a scalable and robust unlearning solution.

*Yidan Sun,Viktor Schlegel,Srinivasan Nandakumar,Iqra Zahid,Yuping Wu,Warren Del-Pinto,Goran Nenadic,Siew-Kei Lam,Jie Zhang,Anil A Bharath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unified benchmark for evaluating text data generated under Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees, focusing on utility and fidelity across domain-specific datasets; reveals degradation under strict privacy and gaps in current approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Privacy and regulatory barriers limit real-world data use in high-stakes domains. DP synthetic data offers a promising alternative, but robust, domain-relevant benchmarks are needed to assess utility, fidelity, and privacy-accounting under realistic budgets.

Method: Develop a unified benchmark that covers representative domain data, realistic DP budgets, accounts for pre-training effects, and uses multiple evaluation metrics. Evaluate state-of-the-art privacy-preserving text-generation methods across five domain-specific datasets.

Result: Current DP-based synthetic data methods show significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data, especially under strict privacy constraints.

Conclusion: The study highlights limitations of current approaches, calls for advanced privacy-preserving data sharing methods, and establishes a precedent for evaluating such methods in realistic scenarios.

Abstract: Generative AI offers transformative potential for high-stakes domains such as
healthcare and finance, yet privacy and regulatory barriers hinder the use of
real-world data. To address this, differentially private synthetic data
generation has emerged as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce a
unified benchmark to systematically evaluate the utility and fidelity of text
datasets generated under formal Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees. Our
benchmark addresses key challenges in domain-specific benchmarking, including
choice of representative data and realistic privacy budgets, accounting for
pre-training and a variety of evaluation metrics. We assess state-of-the-art
privacy-preserving generation methods across five domain-specific datasets,
revealing significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data,
especially under strict privacy constraints. These findings underscore the
limitations of current approaches, outline the need for advanced
privacy-preserving data sharing methods and set a precedent regarding their
evaluation in realistic scenarios.

### [180] [Structure-aware Hypergraph Transformer for Diagnosis Prediction in Electronic Health Records](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20500)
*Haiyan Wang,Ye Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) is proposed to model higher-order interactions among medical codes in EHRs using a hypergraph encoder and Transformer, with a hypergraph reconstruction loss, achieving superior diagnosis prediction over state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Graph-based methods in EHRs rely on pairwise relations and localized message passing, which fail to capture higher-order dependencies and global structure in clinical data. There is a need for models that can represent complex multi-code interactions and leverage global reasoning to improve predictive performance.

Method: 1) A hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order interactions among medical codes. 2) A Transformer-based module to perform global reasoning over the hypergraph. 3) A loss function augmented with hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original structure.

Result: Experiments on real-world EHR datasets show that SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models for diagnosis prediction.

Conclusion: SHGT effectively captures higher-order relationships and enables global reasoning over EHR data, yielding improved diagnostic prediction and preserving the hypergraph structure through reconstruction loss.

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) systematically organize patient health data
through standardized medical codes, serving as a comprehensive and invaluable
source for predictive modeling. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated
effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR.
However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on
pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in
clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits
representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel
Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold
ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order
interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture
to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function
incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original
structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction.

### [182] [MedGR$^2$: Breaking the Data Barrier for Medical Reasoning via Generative Reward Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20549)
*Weihai Zhi,Jiayan Guo,Shangyang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MedGR^2 introduces a self-improving data generation and reward modeling framework to enable data-efficient learning for medical vision-language models. It generates high-quality, multi-modal data for supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, achieving superior generalization and competitive performance with far larger models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Medical vision-language models suffer from data scarcity and annotation quality, causing poor generalization in supervised fine-tuning and unreliable rewards for reinforcement learning. A data-efficient approach that can autonomously generate training data and rewards is needed.

Method: Co-develop a data generator and a reward model (MedGR^2) to autonomously produce high-quality, multi-modal medical data. Use this data to drive supervised fine-tuning and RL with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Demonstrate that MedGR^2 data improves SFT beyond baselines on large human-curated datasets and enables state-of-the-art cross-modality and cross-task generalization in RL. Show that a compact model powered by MedGR^2 approaches the performance of much larger foundation models.

Result: SFT trained on MedGR^2-produced data outperforms baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated data. When used for RL via GRPO, the approach achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and cross-task generalization, outperforming specialized RL methods. A compact model empowered by MedGR^2 attains performance competitive with foundation models with over 10x more parameters.

Conclusion: MedGR^2 enables data-efficient learning in medical AI by transforming data scarcity into data generation, unlocking robust generalization for both SFT and RL and making RL viable for building genuinely generalizable medical AI.

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on
unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising
alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this
data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward
Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a
self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a
reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality,
multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT
and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data
already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets.
Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and
cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based
methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves
performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more
parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in
high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data
generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly
generalizable medical AI.

*Roman S. Kulshin,Anatoly A. Sidorov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a universal multi-criteria hyperparameter optimization framework for recommender systems, using an integral objective that aggregates accuracy, ranking quality, diversity, and computational cost; extensible to other ML tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single-metric optimization often misaligns with real-world objectives; a single composite criterion is needed to balance multiple desirable properties and resource usage in hyperparameter tuning.

Method: Proposes an integral (aggregate) assessment as a unified multi-criteria optimization tool, establishing a theoretical framework for balancing multiple performance indicators in hyperparametric optimization, with applicability beyond recommender systems.

Result: Provides a theoretical contribution: a universal multi-criteria optimization tool and justification for balancing multiple performance indicators; suggests broad applicability to ML and data analysis tasks.

Conclusion: A universal multi-criteria optimization tool is feasible and broadly applicable beyond recommender systems to ML/data analysis tasks.

Abstract: The article discusses the concept of hyperparametric optimization of
recommendation algorithms using an integral assessment that combines various
performance indicators into a single consolidated criterion. This approach is
opposed to traditional methods of setting up a single metric and allows you to
achieve a balance between accuracy, ranking quality, variety of output and the
resource intensity of algorithms. The theoretical significance of the research
lies in the development of a universal multi-criteria optimization tool that is
applicable not only in recommendation systems, but also in a wide range of
machine learning and data analysis tasks.

### [184] [MERIT: Maximum-normalized Element-wise Ratio for Language Model Large-batch Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20577)
*Yang Luo,Zangwei Zheng,Ziheng Qin,Zirui Zhu,Yong Liu,Yang You*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MERIT is a max-norm and element-wise trust ratio optimizer for large-batch training that constrains max attention logits, addressing limitations of AdamW/LAMB in attention layers. It improves training stability across GPT-2 scales, enabling very large batch sizes (e.g., GPT-2 Medium with 6k) without degradation; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large-batch training accelerates DL model development but worsens optimization and generalization. In language models, the max attention logit escalates with batch size, causing performance degradation with AdamW. LAMB’s l2-based trust ratios overlook interactions among weights and fail to control max logits. A more precise, fine-grained trust ratio targeting max attention is needed to stabilize training.

Method: Introduce MERIT optimizer that uses max-norm-based trust ratios to constrain the maximum attention logit. Additionally, develop element-wise trust ratios to capture local weight structure, providing robust update scaling. Validate through extensive large-batch training experiments on GPT-2 models, including GPT-2 Medium with up to 6k batch size. Provide code online.

Result: MERIT demonstrates superior large-batch training performance across GPT-2 model sizes, achieving stable training with very large batches (e.g., 6k) without performance loss compared to standard batch sizes. It improves training stability and suggests scalability to even larger batches.

Conclusion: Max-attention logits and fine-grained trust ratios are crucial for stable large-batch training. MERIT’s max-norm and element-wise trust ratios yield robust updates and enable faster development of large language models. Code is available for replication.

Abstract: Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of
deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and
generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation
during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck
in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While
the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still
face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are
less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.
Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks
relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm
to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more
effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to
provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures.
Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2
models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the
training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance
degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens.
This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and
finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves
the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling
faster development and iteration of large language models. Code is available at

### [185] [Unbiased Stochastic Optimization for Gaussian Processes on Finite Dimensional RKHS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20588)
*Neta Shoham,Haim Avron*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Exact stochastic inference for Gaussian Processes with finite-dimensional RKHS kernels; improves over biased stochastic gradients and inducing-point VI under memory constraints; extendable to infinite-dimensional RKHS with a trade-off in exactness.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current stochastic GP learning relies on approximations (biased gradients or inducing-point VI) that may not converge to the true marginal likelihood; there is a need for methods that guarantee convergence to a stationary point of the true marginal likelihood, especially when memory limits batch sizes and inducing points.

Method: Develops algorithms for exact stochastic inference when the GP kernel corresponds to an RKHS of moderate finite dimension; the approach can be extended to infinite-dimensional RKHSs at the cost of exactness; applicable to both finite and infinite RKHSs.

Result: Empirical results show better performance than existing methods under memory constraints on batch size and inducing points.

Conclusion: For finite-dimensional RKHS kernels, exact stochastic inference is feasible and yields practical gains; the framework can be extended to infinite-dimensional RKHSs with controlled loss of exactness, addressing convergence concerns in stochastic GP learning.

Abstract: Current methods for stochastic hyperparameter learning in Gaussian Processes
(GPs) rely on approximations, such as computing biased stochastic gradients or
using inducing points in stochastic variational inference. However, when using
such methods we are not guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the
true marginal likelihood. In this work, we propose algorithms for exact
stochastic inference of GPs with kernels that induce a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS) of moderate finite dimension. Our approach can also be
extended to infinite dimensional RKHSs at the cost of forgoing exactness. Both
for finite and infinite dimensional RKHSs, our method achieves better
experimental results than existing methods when memory resources limit the
feasible batch size and the possible number of inducing points.

### [186] [Local Virtual Nodes for Alleviating Over-Squashing in Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20597)
*Tuğrul Hasan Karabulut,İnci M. Baytaş*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings placed at central bottleneck regions to mitigate over-squashing in GNNs, preserving global topology while improving long-range communication; validated on benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Over-squashing hinders information flow across distant nodes in GNNs; existing remedies (graph rewiring, virtual nodes) alter global topology and may disrupt domain-specific structure. A topology-preserving mitigation is desirable.

Method: Identify bottleneck regions via node centrality; insert Local Virtual Nodes with trainable embeddings that are shared across selected central regions; integrate LVNs into the GNN to enhance connectivity without adding layers; aims to avoid significant alterations to input graph topology.

Result: Empirical evaluation on graph and node classification tasks shows improved performance and connectivity; code is released at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: LVNs offer a lightweight, topology-preserving approach to mitigate over-squashing, enabling better long-range communication and potentially complementing other remedies without substantially corrupting input structure.

Abstract: Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks
involving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field
should be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However,
gathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its
content into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable
to bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied
remedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate
over-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global
topology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph
structure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This
study presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate
the effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global
structure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the
node centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus,
the proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with
likely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across
selected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without
adding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve
performance on graph and node classification tasks. The code can be found at

*Debabrota Basu,Sourav Chakraborty,Debarshi Chanda,Buddha Dev Das,Arijit Ghosh,Arnab Ray*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A model-specific, task-based credibility test for survey data in regression contexts; introduces a regression-relevant distance metric and an algorithm whose sample complexity is independent of data dimension.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assessing whether sampled surveys credibly represent the population is crucial for downstream validity. General distribution-distance estimations are impractical in high dimensions, so a task-focused criterion aligned with regression analysis is desirable.

Method: Define a model-specific distance metric to quantify credibility and design an algorithm to verify credibility of survey data within regression settings; show that this approach avoids full distribution reconstruction.

Result: The proposed algorithm has sample complexity that is independent of data dimensionality; provides theoretical guarantees of correctness; numerical experiments demonstrate effective performance.

Conclusion: Efficient, dimension-agnostic credibility verification for surveys in regression tasks, enabling valid inferences without high-dimensional reconstruction.

Abstract: Assessing whether a sample survey credibly represents the population is a
critical question for ensuring the validity of downstream research. Generally,
this problem reduces to estimating the distance between two high-dimensional
distributions, which typically requires a number of samples that grows
exponentially with the dimension. However, depending on the model used for data
analysis, the conclusions drawn from the data may remain consistent across
different underlying distributions. In this context, we propose a task-based
approach to assess the credibility of sampled surveys. Specifically, we
introduce a model-specific distance metric to quantify this notion of
credibility. We also design an algorithm to verify the credibility of survey
data in the context of regression models. Notably, the sample complexity of our
algorithm is independent of the data dimension. This efficiency stems from the
fact that the algorithm focuses on verifying the credibility of the survey data
rather than reconstructing the underlying regression model. Furthermore, we
show that if one attempts to verify credibility by reconstructing the
regression model, the sample complexity scales linearly with the dimensionality
of the data. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithm and
numerically demonstrate our algorithm's performance.

TL;DR: A stochastic, supervised ICA algorithm that blends proximal-gradient updates on invertible matrices with joint predictor learning, achieving better optimization success and interpretability under multi-trial supervision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Independence-component analysis in scientific settings often involves multi-trial supervision. ICA is non-convex and hard to optimize; adding supervision can guide learning and improve interpretability.

Method: A stochastic algorithm combining a proximal-gradient-type update in the space of invertible matrices with end-to-end training of a prediction model via backpropagation to incorporate multi-trial supervision.

Result: Empirical experiments on synthetic and real data show increased success rates of the non-convex optimization and improved interpretability of the recovered independent components due to the supervision.

Conclusion: Incorporating multi-trial supervision into ICA via this hybrid optimization framework improves both optimization reliability and interpretability, suggesting broader applicability to supervised non-convex latent-variable learning.

Abstract: We develop a stochastic algorithm for independent component analysis that
incorporates multi-trial supervision, which is available in many scientific
contexts. The method blends a proximal gradient-type algorithm in the space of
invertible matrices with joint learning of a prediction model through
backpropagation. We illustrate the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real
data experiments. In particular, owing to the additional supervision, we
observe an increased success rate of the non-convex optimization and the
improved interpretability of the independent components.

### [189] [Masked Autoencoders for Ultrasound Signals: Robust Representation Learning for Downstream Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20622)
*Immanuel Roßteutscher,Klaus S. Drese,Thorsten Uphues*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAE-based self-supervised pretraining on synthetic 1D ultrasound signals with Vision Transformers yields robust representations that improve downstream Time-of-Flight (ToF) classification, outperforming training from scratch and CNN baselines; synthetic data enhances transfer to real signals; systematic analysis of model size, patch size, and masking ratio demonstrates efficiency and effectiveness for NDT/SHM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a scarcity of labeled ultrasound data in industrial settings (NDT/SHM), and 1D ultrasound signals require task-specific processing. While Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have succeeded in CV, their application to 1D signal analysis remains underexplored. Leveraging self-supervised learning on unlabeled synthetic signals can yield transferable representations that improve downstream tasks when labeled data are limited.

Method: Pre-train a Masked Autoencoder (MAE) on unlabeled synthetic 1D ultrasound signals using a Vision Transformer (ViT) backbone. Systematically vary hyperparameters including model size, patch size, and masking ratio. Evaluate on a downstream ToF classification task and compare against strong CNN baselines and training-from-scratch. Examine transferability by testing on real measured signals versus training solely on limited real data.

Result: Pre-trained MAE models significantly outperform models trained from scratch and strong CNN baselines on the ToF classification task. Pre-training on synthetic 1D ultrasound data improves transferability to real measured signals compared with training only on limited real data. The study also characterizes how model size, patch size, and masking ratio influence pre-training efficiency and downstream accuracy, highlighting the practical effectiveness of MAEs for 1D ultrasound signal analysis.

Conclusion: Masked Autoencoders with ViT backbones are effective for self-supervised learning on 1D ultrasound signals. Synthetic-data pretraining enables scalable, transferable representations that improve downstream tasks in NDT/SHM, offering a promising direction for ultrasound signal analysis and potentially other 1D signal domains.

Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)
with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation
learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have
demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their
use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely
unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as
non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where
labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We
propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic
ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that
enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)
classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model
size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream
accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform
models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)
baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on
synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured
signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study
underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis
through scalable, self-supervised learning.

TL;DR: Proposes GDS agent: a graph algorithm toolkit for LLMs via an MCP server, enabling grounded graph reasoning with benchmarking and case studies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs struggle with large-scale graph-structured data and often rely on generic retrieval or external tools. There is a need for a dedicated, reusable toolset of graph algorithms and an execution framework to enable algorithmic reasoning over graphs in LLM workflows.

Method: Introduce the GDS agent that exposes a comprehensive set of graph algorithms as tools, plus preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing of algorithm results, all orchestrated within a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server is plug-and-play with any modern LLM. A new benchmark evaluating intermediate tool calls as well as final responses is presented, along with detailed case studies and discussions of limitations and roadmap.

Result: The GDS agent enables solving a wide spectrum of graph tasks; benchmarking shows effectiveness; case studies illustrate strengths and some failure modes, highlighting practical grounding and areas for improvement.

Conclusion: GDS agent provides a scalable, extensible framework for grounded graph reasoning with LLMs, demonstrates broad applicability, and outlines remaining challenges and a roadmap for future work.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information
processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function
calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based
systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them.
However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale
graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this
technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph
algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing
of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can
be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any
question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning
about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also
introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as
final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide
spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more
open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we
discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes TV-HSGT, a time-varying hybrid stochastic gradient tracking algorithm for distributed online optimization on directed time-varying networks. It uses row- and column-stochastic communication, variance reduction, and avoids Perron-vector estimation; shows improved dynamic regret bounds without gradient boundedness and is effective on logistic regression tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As data sizes grow and networks become dynamic, there is a need for distributed online optimization methods that handle stochastic gradients and directed, time-varying communication without relying on gradient-boundedness or Perron-vector information.

Method: Introduce TV-HSGT: a time-varying hybrid stochastic gradient tracking algorithm that combines current and recursive stochastic gradients with variance reduction. It leverages mixed row- and column-stochastic communications over time-varying digraphs, eliminating Perron-vector estimation and out-degree knowledge.

Result: Theoretical analysis yields improved dynamic regret bounds without gradient boundedness. Empirical experiments on logistic regression demonstrate effectiveness in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: TV-HSGT effectively reduces gradient variance while accurately tracking global descent directions in time-varying directed networks, without requiring gradient boundedness or Perron-vector information, and is well-suited for dynamic settings.

Abstract: With the increasing scale and dynamics of data, distributed online
optimization has become essential for real-time decision-making in various
applications. However, existing algorithms often rely on bounded gradient
assumptions and overlook the impact of stochastic gradients, especially in
time-varying directed networks. This study proposes a novel Time-Varying Hybrid
Stochastic Gradient Tracking algorithm named TV-HSGT, based on hybrid
stochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction mechanisms. Specifically,
TV-HSGT integrates row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes
over time-varying digraphs, eliminating the need for Perron vector estimation
or out-degree information. By combining current and recursive stochastic
gradients, it effectively reduces gradient variance while accurately tracking
global descent directions. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that TV-HSGT can
achieve improved bounds on dynamic regret without assuming gradient
boundedness. Experimental results on logistic regression tasks confirm the
effectiveness of TV-HSGT in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: Introduces VarDiU, a variational diffusive upper bound that provides unbiased gradient estimates for diffusion distillation, improving one-step diffusion models over DSM-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DSM-based training yields biased gradients due to imperfect denoising score matching, limiting diffusion distillation performance.

Method: Develop a variational upper-bound objective (VarDiU) that yields an unbiased gradient estimator and integrates directly into diffusion distillation, enabling efficient and stable one-step student training and enabling comparison with Diff-Instruct.

Result: VarDiU achieves higher generation quality and enables more efficient and stable training compared to Diff-Instruct in diffusion distillation.

Conclusion: VarDiU offers unbiased gradient estimation for diffusion distillation, improving sample quality and training stability, and may become a preferred approach over DSM-based methods for one-step diffusion models.

Abstract: Recently, diffusion distillation methods have compressed thousand-step
teacher diffusion models into one-step student generators while preserving
sample quality. Most existing approaches train the student model using a
diffusive divergence whose gradient is approximated via the student's score
function, learned through denoising score matching (DSM). Since DSM training is
imperfect, the resulting gradient estimate is inevitably biased, leading to
sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose VarDiU (pronounced
/va:rdju:/), a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that admits an unbiased
gradient estimator and can be directly applied to diffusion distillation. Using
this objective, we compare our method with Diff-Instruct and demonstrate that
it achieves higher generation quality and enables a more efficient and stable
training procedure for one-step diffusion distillation.

### [194] [Self-Composing Neural Operators with Depth and Accuracy Scaling via Adaptive Train-and-Unroll Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20650)
*Juncai He,Xinliang Liu,Jinchao Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Self-composed neural operator via repeated single-block application with adaptive train-and-unroll; achieves SOTA on benchmarks and strong USCT results; reveals an accuracy-depth scaling law and substantial computational savings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To improve neural operators for PDEs with better efficiency and accuracy without adding architectural complexity, while providing theoretical guarantees and scalable training for large-scale scientific ML tasks.

Method: Introduce self-composition by repeatedly applying a single neural operator block to create deeper effective models without new blocks; use adaptive train-and-unroll to progressively increase depth during training; employ a multigrid-inspired backbone for challenging USCT problems; establish an accuracy scaling law with depth.

Result: State-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks; demonstrated effectiveness on high-frequency USCT with improved wave-resolution; substantial computational savings from the adaptive training strategy.

Conclusion: The framework offers a computationally tractable, accurate, and scalable approach for large-scale data-driven scientific ML, marrying theoretical guarantees with practical gains.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance the efficiency and
accuracy of neural operators through self-composition, offering both
theoretical guarantees and practical benefits. Inspired by iterative methods in
solving numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), we design a specific
neural operator by repeatedly applying a single neural operator block, we
progressively deepen the model without explicitly adding new blocks, improving
the model's capacity. To train these models efficiently, we introduce an
adaptive train-and-unroll approach, where the depth of the neural operator is
gradually increased during training. This approach reveals an accuracy scaling
law with model depth and offers significant computational savings through our
adaptive training strategy. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate its efficacy on a
challenging high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) problem, where
a multigrid-inspired backbone enables superior performance in resolving complex
wave phenomena. The proposed framework provides a computationally tractable,
accurate, and scalable solution for large-scale data-driven scientific machine
learning applications.

*Michael Hagmann,Michael Staniek,Stefan Riezler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Clinical time series may be generated by sequences of latent physiological states with systematic composition; the authors propose data-driven compositional reconstruction and domain-adaptation tests, finding compositionally synthesized data can match or surpass models trained on real data, and improves SOFA-prediction when trained on synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To determine whether clinical time series can be understood as being generated by ordered latent states and to leverage this compositionality to create synthetic data that mitigates sparse data issues in clinical forecasting, thereby deepening understanding of clinical data.

Method: Conceptualize compositionality for time series as a property of the data generation process; develop data-driven procedures to reconstruct elementary states and composition rules; evaluate via two empirical domain-adaptation tests that compare the similarity of original and synthetic distributions through expected-risk of forecasting models trained/tested on original and synthesized data; include downstream evaluation on SOFA score prediction.

Result: Two domain-adaptation tests show that training on compositionally synthesized data yields test performance comparable to training on original data; evaluating on compositionally synthesized test data yields results similar to evaluating on original test data; these results outperform randomization-based data augmentation; compositionally synthesized data provides significant SOFA-prediction gains when models are trained entirely on synthetic data.

Conclusion: The work supports that clinical time series can be generated by latent, systematically ordered states and that compositional synthesis is a viable approach to data augmentation and understanding in data-scarce clinical forecasting, with performance parity or gains demonstrated and potential benefit for SOFA prediction.

Abstract: This work investigates whether time series of natural phenomena can be
understood as being generated by sequences of latent states which are ordered
in systematic and regular ways. We focus on clinical time series and ask
whether clinical measurements can be interpreted as being generated by
meaningful physiological states whose succession follows systematic principles.
Uncovering the underlying compositional structure will allow us to create
synthetic data to alleviate the notorious problem of sparse and low-resource
data settings in clinical time series forecasting, and deepen our understanding
of clinical data. We start by conceptualizing compositionality for time series
as a property of the data generation process, and then study data-driven
procedures that can reconstruct the elementary states and composition rules of
this process. We evaluate the success of this methods using two empirical tests
originating from a domain adaptation perspective. Both tests infer the
similarity of the original time series distribution and the synthetic time
series distribution from the similarity of expected risk of time series
forecasting models trained and tested on original and synthesized data in
specific ways. Our experimental results show that the test set performance
achieved by training on compositionally synthesized data is comparable to
training on original clinical time series data, and that evaluation of models
on compositionally synthesized test data shows similar results to evaluating on
original test data, outperforming randomization-based data augmentation. An
additional downstream evaluation of the prediction task of sequential organ
failure assessment (SOFA) scores shows significant performance gains when model
training is entirely based on compositionally synthesized data compared to
training on original data.

*Weitao Feng,Lixu Wang,Tianyi Wei,Jie Zhang,Chongyang Gao,Sinong Zhan,Peizhuo Lv,Wei Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RL-based fine-tuning poses greater harmful risk than SFT; TokenBuncher mitigates RL-based misuse by reducing model response uncertainty with entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser, preserving benign utility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As LLMs scale, attackers can exploit RL-based fine-tuning to push models toward harmful behaviors; this risk may surpass supervised fine-tuning and existing defenses target mostly SFT.

Method: Propose TokenBuncher, a defense that suppresses response uncertainty—the foundation of RL—by using entropy-as-reward in RL and a Token Noiser to prevent escalation of domain-specific harm. Evaluate across multiple models and RL algorithms, showing mitigation of harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign performance and finetunability.

Result: TokenBuncher effectively mitigates harmful RL fine-tuning across different models and RL algorithms, with minimal impact on benign task performance and finetunability, indicating RL-based misuse is a greater systemic risk than SFT and that the defense generalizes.

Conclusion: RL-based harmful fine-tuning represents a significant systemic risk beyond SFT; TokenBuncher offers a general, effective defense by constraining uncertainty and disrupting reward-driven harm amplification.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the
risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume
that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we
systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries
to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task
assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging
threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically
targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation
on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty,
RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the
model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through
entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the
escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates
harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability.
Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater
systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general
defense.

### [197] [EEGDM: Learning EEG Representation with Latent Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20705)
*Shaocong Wang,Tong Liu,Ming Li,Minjing Yu,Yong-Jin Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A diffusion-based self-supervised EEG representation learning method (EEGDM) that uses an EEG encoder to condition a latent diffusion model for EEG generation, achieving high-quality reconstruction, robust representations, and competitive performance with limited pre-training data across tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG deep learning faces generalization challenges when data is scarce; existing representation learning often relies on simple masked reconstruction, which may miss semantic structure in EEG signals.

Method: Introduce EEGDM, a latent diffusion-based framework. An EEG encoder condenses signals and channel augmentations into a compact latent that guides a diffusion model to generate EEG signals. The latent space enables controllable generation and serves as a powerful representation for downstream tasks.

Result: EEGDM can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, learns robust representations, and achieves competitive performance with modest pre-training data across diverse downstream tasks, indicating good generalization.

Conclusion: EEGDM demonstrates effective diffusion-based self-supervised representation learning for EEG, with a compact latent conditioning scheme that yields practical generalization and utility.

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis using deep learning has
shown great promise, existing approaches still face significant challenges in
learning generalizable representations that perform well across diverse tasks,
particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning
methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked
reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic
information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we
propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based
on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a
self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong
representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates
an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a
compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the
diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a
compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative
process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results
show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively
learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with
modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its
generalizability and practical utility.

### [198] [Provable Benefits of In-Tool Learning for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20755)
*Sam Houliston,Ambroise Odonnat,Charles Arnal,Vivien Cabannes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tool use enables unbounded factual recall and scalability beyond memorization in model weights; the paper provides theoretical bounds showing memory is limited by parameter counts, while tools enable unbounded recall via a simple circuit; experiments confirm tool-using models outperform memorizing ones; for pretrained LMs, teaching tool use and general rules is more effective than embedding facts in memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To clarify the theoretical and empirical advantages of tool-augmented LMs, specifically whether external retrieval and tools offer benefits beyond memorizing facts in weights, and how they scale compared to in-weight learning.

Method: Theoretical analysis proving memory bounds tied to parameter count; construction of a simple circuit that achieves unbounded factual recall using tools; controlled experiments comparing tool-using vs memorizing models; evaluation on pretrained LMs to compare tool-use teaching versus finetuning facts into memory.

Result: Theoretically, the number of facts memorized in weights is limited by parameter count; tool-use yields unbounded recall via the proposed circuit. Empirically, tool-using models outperform memorizing models. For pretrained LMs, teaching tool-use and general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory.

Conclusion: Tool-augmented workflows are provably more scalable and effective than pure memorization, providing both theoretical justification and empirical validation for adopting tool use and external retrieval in language model design.

Abstract: Tool-augmented language models, equipped with retrieval, memory, or external
APIs, are reshaping AI, yet their theoretical advantages remain underexplored.
In this paper, we address this question by demonstrating the benefits of
in-tool learning (external retrieval) over in-weight learning (memorization)
for factual recall. We show that the number of facts a model can memorize
solely in its weights is fundamentally limited by its parameter count. In
contrast, we prove that tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via a simple
and efficient circuit construction. These results are validated in controlled
experiments, where tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing ones.
We further show that for pretrained large language models, teaching tool-use
and general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory. Our work
provides both a theoretical and empirical foundation, establishing why
tool-augmented workflows are not just practical, but provably more scalable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SAFEMax is an information-theoretic unlearning method for diffusion models that halts denoising on impermissible classes by maximizing output entropy, focusing on early diffusion steps to balance forgetting and retention, achieving improved efficiency over existing approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable reliable and efficient machine unlearning in diffusion models by removing class-specific information without retraining from scratch, while maintaining model utility for permissible tasks.

Method: SAFEMax maximizes the entropy of generated images conditioned on impermissible classes, causing the model to revert to Gaussian noise by halting the denoising process. It prioritizes early diffusion steps where class-specific cues are strongest to control the forgetting-retention trade-off.

Result: Experiments show SAFEMax effectively forgets impermissible classes and does so with substantial efficiency gains compared to state-of-the-art unlearning methods.

Conclusion: SAFEMax provides a principled, scalable framework for diffusion-model unlearning that achieves effective forgetting with reduced compute, validating the feasibility of entropy-based early-stop unlearning for diffusion processes.

Abstract: We introduce SAFEMax, a novel method for Machine Unlearning in diffusion
models. Grounded in information-theoretic principles, SAFEMax maximizes the
entropy in generated images, causing the model to generate Gaussian noise when
conditioned on impermissible classes by ultimately halting its denoising
process. Also, our method controls the balance between forgetting and retention
by selectively focusing on the early diffusion steps, where class-specific
information is prominent. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of SAFEMax
and highlight its substantial efficiency gains over state-of-the-art methods.

### [200] [cMALC-D: Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with Diversity-Based Context Blending](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20818)
*Anirudh Satheesh,Keenan Powell,Hua Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes cMALC-D, a contextual MARL training framework that uses LLM-generated curricula and diversity-based context blending to improve generalization and sample efficiency, validated on traffic signal control; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MARL policies trained in fixed environments are brittle in real-world, uncertain settings. Existing contextual MARL (cMARL) uses curriculum signals that are often unreliable due to noisy inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. LLMs can craft semantically meaningful curricula and provide robust evaluation signals; diversity blending helps exploration and prevents mode collapse.

Method: Introduce Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D). Use Large Language Models to generate curricula that cover semantic variations. Implement a diversity-based context blending mechanism to create new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts, promoting exploration and reducing mode collapse. Train a context-agnostic policy across configurations; evaluate in traffic signal control domains.

Result: cMALC-D significantly improves generalization and sample efficiency compared to existing curriculum learning baselines in traffic signal control experiments.

Conclusion: LLM-guided curricula coupled with diversity-based context blending offer a robust framework for training context-agnostic MARL policies, enhancing generalization and efficiency in uncertain environments; code is available for replication.

Abstract: Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in
fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world
scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL)
addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and
training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment
configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to
help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on
unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage
estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to
inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we
propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with
Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and
provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage
exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism
that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts.
Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D
significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to
existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at

*Yang Gao,Dongjie Wang,Scott Piersall,Ye Zhang,Liqiang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A transformer-based framework for automated feature transformation with four steps, achieving competitive accuracy while greatly improving efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the high computational costs and large parameter demands of sequential encoder-decoder feature transformation methods by introducing a compact, transformer-based, multi-objective pipeline.

Method: A four-step pipeline: (1) collection of transformation records; (2) embedding space construction using a revised GPT model; (3) gradient-ascent search within the embedding space; (4) autoregressive reconstruction. The revised GPT handles (a) sequence reconstruction and (b) estimation/enhancement of model performance for downstream tasks, enabling a multi-objective optimization that reduces parameters and speeds up transformation.

Result: Experiments on benchmark datasets show the framework matches or surpasses baseline performance with significantly improved computational efficiency, demonstrating the viability of transformer-based architectures for scalable automated feature transformation.

Conclusion: Transformer-based architectures can enable scalable, high-performance automated feature transformation with reduced parameter size and faster transformation processes.

Abstract: Feature transformation plays a critical role in enhancing machine learning
model performance by optimizing data representations. Recent state-of-the-art
approaches address this task as a continuous embedding optimization problem,
converting discrete search into a learnable process. Although effective, these
methods often rely on sequential encoder-decoder structures that cause high
computational costs and parameter requirements, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that
accomplishes automated feature transformation through four steps:
transformation records collection, embedding space construction with a revised
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, gradient-ascent search, and
autoregressive reconstruction. In our approach, the revised GPT model serves
two primary functions: (a) feature transformation sequence reconstruction and
(b) model performance estimation and enhancement for downstream tasks by
constructing the embedding space. Such a multi-objective optimization framework
reduces parameter size and accelerates transformation processes. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework matches or
exceeds baseline performance, with significant gains in computational
efficiency. This work highlights the potential of transformer-based
architectures for scalable, high-performance automated feature transformation.

*Zeyue Zhang,Lin Song,Erkang Bao,Xiaoling Lv,Xinyue Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ATM-GAD is an adaptive GNN for financial anomaly detection that leverages temporal motifs and adaptive time windows; outperforms baselines on four real datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial fraud detection is critical; contemporary graph-based detectors miss time-driven hallmarks: temporal motifs and per-account bursts; integrating both could improve detection.

Method: Temporal Motif Extractor condenses account histories into informative motifs; dual-attention blocks IntraA and InterA reason within and across motifs; differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner tailors observation windows per node; end-to-end graph neural network.

Result: On four real-world datasets, ATM-GAD outperforms seven strong anomaly-detection baselines and uncovers fraud patterns missed by prior methods.

Conclusion: Combining temporal motifs with adaptive time windows enables more accurate and robust financial fraud detection by capturing time-based and structural signals.

Abstract: Financial fraud detection is essential to safeguard billions of dollars, yet
the intertwined entities and fast-changing transaction behaviors in modern
financial systems routinely defeat conventional machine learning models. Recent
graph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks,
but they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal
motifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as
they unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when
fraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both
signals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages
temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor
condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs,
preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed
by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single
motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step
fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner
tailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus
precisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world
datasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong
anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A deep learning-based physical-layer CSI authentication method for mobile IoT in WLAN environments using a CNN-Siamese network, trained on synthetic TGn-channel-based data, validated with simulation and real experiments, achieving modest but notable AUC gains over baselines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoT devices suffer from authentication vulnerabilities due to the broadcast wireless medium. Dynamic channel variations make reliable PHY-layer authentication challenging, necessitating schemes that work in mobile scenarios and reduce data collection overhead.

Method: Generate a synthetic training dataset using WLAN TGn channel models and channel correlations ( autocorrelation and distance correlation) to reflect temporal/spatial channel characteristics. Train a CNN-based Siamese network to learn the similarity between CSI pairs and output a similarity score for authentication. Validate via both simulations and an experimental WiFi IoT testbed, comparing against FCN-based Siamese and a correlation-based benchmark.

Result: The approach demonstrates good generalization and strong authentication performance in both simulations and real experiments. In practical measurements, the AUC improves by 0.03 over a fully connected network–based Siamese model and by 0.06 over a correlation-based benchmark.

Conclusion: A DL-driven physical-layer CSI authentication method can effectively handle mobile dynamic channels in WLAN environments, leveraging synthetic data to reduce data collection overhead, and providing solid authentication performance in real-world tests.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is ubiquitous thanks to the rapid development of
wireless technologies. However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions
results in great vulnerability to device authentication. Physical layer
authentication emerges as a promising approach by exploiting the unique channel
characteristics. However, a practical scheme applicable to dynamic channel
variations is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based
physical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile
scenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation
using IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated
based on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance
correlation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of
manually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial
correlation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their
similarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and
experimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT
development kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered. Both
simulation and experimental evaluation demonstrated excellent generalization
performance of our proposed deep learning-based approach and excellent
authentication performance. Demonstrated by our practical measurement results,
our proposed scheme improved the area under the curve (AUC) by 0.03 compared to
the fully connected network-based (FCN-based) Siamese model and by 0.06
compared to the correlation-based benchmark algorithm.

TL;DR: Introduces LeMat-Traj, a 120M-configuration, standardized DFT trajectory dataset with a modular LeMaterial-Fetcher to enable training transferable MLIPs; improves force predictions and reproducibility.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DFT trajectory datasets are fragmented, inconsistently formatted, and costly to generate; standardization and accessibility are needed to accelerate MLIP development.

Method: Aggregate configurations from Materials Project, Alexandria, OQMD; standardize representations; harmonize functional results across PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN; filter high-quality data; complement MD/AL datasets; fine-tune models pre-trained on high-force data; develop LeMaterial-Fetcher library.

Result: Significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks when fine-tuning; dataset spans both relaxed low-energy and high-energy structures; publicly available; supports reproducible, scalable MLIP development.

Conclusion: LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher lower barriers to building transferrable MLIPs and promote ongoing evolution of large-scale materials datasets through open, standardized resources.

Abstract: The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs)
is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of
quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory
(DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to
variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we
introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic
configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the
Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data
representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations
across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It
significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs.
LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force
structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By
fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a
significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also
present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library
developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the
community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued
evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher

*Dmitry Eremeev,Gleb Bazhenov,Oleg Platonov,Artem Babenko,Liudmila Prokhorenkova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A graph foundation model (G2T-FM) uses a TabPFNv2 backbone with neighborhood aggregation and structural embeddings, enabling strong in-context performance and competitive finetuning—highlighting the viability of tabular foundation models for graphs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To handle diverse, arbitrary node features across graph datasets and extend foundation-model approaches to GFMs by leveraging the success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2.

Method: Create node representations by augmenting original features with neighborhood feature aggregation and structural embeddings, then apply TabPFNv2 as the backbone to process these representations.

Result: In-context performance surpasses publicly available GFMs and matches well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch; fine-tuning further surpasses strong GNN baselines.

Conclusion: Demonstrates a promising direction for graph ML: leveraging tabular foundation models to build effective GFMs across heterogeneous node features and datasets.

Abstract: While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language
processing and computer vision, their application and potential within graph
machine learning remain largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in
designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that
can vary across different graph datasets. Although many works on GFMs have been
focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling
arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed.
However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in
the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the
recent success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2, we propose G2T-FM, a
simple graph foundation model that employs TabPFNv2 as a backbone.
Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood
feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies TabPFNv2 to
the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our
model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available
GFMs and performing on par with well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover,
after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines, highlighting the
potential of the proposed approach. More broadly, our paper reveals a
previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for

### [206] [Finite-Time Guarantees for Multi-Agent Combinatorial Bandits with Nonstationary Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20923)
*Katherine B. Adams,Justin J. Boutilier,Qinyang He,Yonatan Mintz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for dynamic nonstationary combinatorial MAB in sequential resource allocation with habituation/recovery, providing dynamic regret guarantees and validated by a diabetes intervention case study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In population-scale interventions, intervention effects evolve over time and vary across heterogeneous agents. The work tackles learning under nonstationary rewards to optimize sequentially allocated resources without prior knowledge of individual-level effects.

Method: Develop a novel framework for nonstationary rewards within the combinatorial multi-armed bandit setting. Introduce algorithms with dynamic regret guarantees that account for habituation and recovery in individuals, balancing heterogeneous rewards with the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. Provide theoretical analysis and validate using a diabetes intervention case study."

Result: Theoretical guarantees on dynamic regret are established. Empirical validation shows practical efficacy, with the personalized community intervention algorithm achieving up to three times greater improvement in program enrollment compared to baseline approaches.

Conclusion: Bridges advances in adaptive learning with real-world population-change interventions, highlighting potential for scalable, personalized, time-adaptive interventions in health, advertising, and workforce programs.

Abstract: We study a sequential resource allocation problem where a decision maker
selects subsets of agents at each period to maximize overall outcomes without
prior knowledge of individual-level effects. Our framework applies to settings
such as community health interventions, targeted digital advertising, and
workforce retention programs, where intervention effects evolve dynamically.
Agents may exhibit habituation (diminished response from frequent selection) or
recovery (enhanced response from infrequent selection). The technical challenge
centers on nonstationary reward distributions that lead to changing
intervention effects over time. The problem requires balancing two key
competing objectives: heterogeneous individual rewards and the
exploration-exploitation tradeoff in terms of learning for improved future
decisions as opposed to maximizing immediate outcomes. Our contribution
introduces the first framework incorporating this form of nonstationary rewards
in the combinatorial multi-armed bandit literature. We develop algorithms with
theoretical guarantees on dynamic regret and demonstrate practical efficacy
through a diabetes intervention case study. Our personalized community
intervention algorithm achieved up to three times as much improvement in
program enrollment compared to baseline approaches, validating the framework's
potential for real-world applications. This work bridges theoretical advances
in adaptive learning with practical challenges in population-level behavioral
change interventions.

### [207] [InSQuAD: In-Context Learning for Efficient Retrieval via Submodular Mutual Information to Enforce Quality and Diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21003)
*Souradeep Nanda,Anay Majee,Rishabh Iyer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InSQuAD enhances In-Context Learning by enforcing quality and diversity of in-context exemplars via a learnable Submodular Mutual Information (SMI) framework, using targeted exemplar selection and paraphrase augmentation, achieving strong gains on nine benchmark datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL performance hinges on the relevance and diversity of retrieved in-context exemplars. Traditional retrieval models optimize query relevance but often neglect diversity, leading to suboptimal exemplars for few-shot tasks. A method that jointly optimizes quality and diversity can improve ICL.

Method: Formulate ICL as a targeted selection problem and introduce a unified selection strategy based on Submodular Mutual Information to capture relevant and diverse in-context exemplars. Develop a combinatorial training paradigm that learns the parameters of an SMI function via a likelihood-based loss to enforce both quality and diversity in retrieval. Augment a multi-hop QA dataset with synthetically generated paraphrases to aid learning. Evaluate the retriever trained with this strategy and the new targeted selection formulation on nine benchmark datasets.

Result: The approach yields significant improvements across nine benchmark datasets, validating the efficacy of SMI-based quality and diversity enforcement for ICL.

Conclusion: SMI-based targeted exemplar selection, combined with a learnable diversity-enforcing retrieval model and paraphrase augmentation, improves In-Context Learning, offering robust gains and generalization across tasks.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce InSQuAD, designed to enhance the performance of
In-Context Learning (ICL) models through Submodular Mutual Information} (SMI)
enforcing Quality and Diversity among in-context exemplars. InSQuAD achieves
this through two principal strategies: First, we model the ICL task as a
targeted selection problem and introduce a unified selection strategy based on
SMIs which mines relevant yet diverse in-context examples encapsulating the
notions of quality and diversity. Secondly, we address a common pitfall in
existing retrieval models which model query relevance, often overlooking
diversity, critical for ICL. InSQuAD introduces a combinatorial training
paradigm which learns the parameters of an SMI function to enforce both quality
and diversity in the retrieval model through a novel likelihood-based loss. To
further aid the learning process we augment an existing multi-hop question
answering dataset with synthetically generated paraphrases. Adopting the
retrieval model trained using this strategy alongside the novel targeted
selection formulation for ICL on nine benchmark datasets shows significant
improvements validating the efficacy of our approach.

### [208] [Inference-Time Alignment Control for Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21016)
*Luozhijie Jin,Zijie Qiu,Jie Liu,Zijie Diao,Lifeng Qiao,Ning Ding,Alex Lamb,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG) for diffusion models introduces an inference-time strategy that blends the base and RL-finetuned models with a geometric average in the CFG framework, tying the guidance scale to KL-regularization and enabling dynamic, training-free control of alignment strength.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion and related generative models struggle to align with complex downstream objectives (e.g., human preferences, compositional accuracy, compressibility). Traditional RL fine-tuning is suboptimal for diffusion models and lacks post-training control over alignment strength. RLG seeks a principled, inference-time solution with flexible control.

Method: Propose Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG): reinterpret RL fine-tuning via stochastic differential equations and implicit reward conditioning; apply a geometric-average combination of the base model and the RL-finetuned model outputs within the classifier-free guidance (CFG) framework; show that the RLG guidance scale mathematically corresponds to the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL objectives, enabling dynamic alignment control without retraining; supports interpolation and extrapolation.

Result: Empirical results show that RLG consistently improves the performance of RL-finetuned diffusion models across architectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including modeling human preferences, achieving compositional control, enhancing compressibility, and improving text rendering. RLG enables adjustable alignment strength at inference and is compatible with multiple RL setups; code is publicly available.

Conclusion: RLG provides a practical, theoretically grounded, inference-time mechanism to enhance and control diffusion-model alignment, bridging RL fine-tuning and CFG-based generation while offering flexible interpolation/extrapolation of alignment strength without additional training.

Abstract: Denoising-based generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching
algorithms, have achieved remarkable success. However, aligning their output
distributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences,
compositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While
reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL
from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to
these generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion
models and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after
fine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models
through the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward
conditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an
inference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining
the outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our
theoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically
equivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL
objectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off
without further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG
consistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various
architectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human
preferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering.
Furthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby
offering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment. Our
approach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing
and controlling diffusion model alignment at inference. The source code for RLG
is publicly available at the Github:

### [209] [Fast Convergence Rates for Subsampled Natural Gradient Algorithms on Quadratic Model Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21022)
*Gil Goldshlager,Jiang Hu,Lin Lin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SNGD and SPRING are analyzed in linear/quadratic settings, showing equivalence to (accelerated) regularized Kaczmarz in least-squares; they obtain fast convergence and guarantees, and extend the analysis to general strongly convex quadratic losses, illustrating how subsampling interacts with curvature-aware optimization via randomized linear algebra.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Explain the theoretical basis for SNGD’s empirical success and provide convergence guarantees (including acceleration) in idealized models to deepen understanding of subsampling-based natural gradient methods.

Method: Study idealized optimization with a linear model and strongly convex quadratic loss. In the LS case, prove SNGD is equivalent to regularized Kaczmarz and SPRING to accelerated regularized Kaczmarz; leverage existing analyses to derive convergence rates. Extend the approach to general strongly convex quadratic loss by analyzing the regularized Kaczmarz framework.

Result: First fast convergence rate established for SNGD; first convergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting; demonstration that SPRING can accelerate SNGD; for general quadratic loss, obtain fast convergence under stronger conditions, explaining SNGD’s effectiveness beyond LS.

Conclusion: Shows that randomized linear-algebra tools can illuminate the trade-offs between subsampling and curvature-aware optimization; situates SNGD and SPRING within the Kaczmarz family, offering theoretical grounding and pointing to broader applicability beyond LS.

Abstract: Subsampled natural gradient descent (SNGD) has shown impressive results for
parametric optimization tasks in scientific machine learning, such as neural
network wavefunctions and physics-informed neural networks, but it has lacked a
theoretical explanation. We address this gap by analyzing the convergence of
SNGD and its accelerated variant, SPRING, for idealized parametric optimization
problems where the model is linear and the loss function is strongly convex and
quadratic. In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard
linear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized
Kaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized
Kaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under
mild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first
convergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that
SPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic
loss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a
fast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first
explanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.
Overall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can
shed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware
optimization strategies.

### [210] [LoTUS: Large-Scale Machine Unlearning with a Taste of Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18314)
*Christoforos N. Spartalis,Theodoros Semertzidis,Efstratios Gavves,Petros Daras*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoTUS introduces a retrain-free machine unlearning method that reduces a model's memorized influence from training data by smoothing output predictions within an information-theoretic bound, and validates its effectiveness across architectures and datasets including ImageNet1k using a new RF-JSD metric.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Unlearning is often computationally expensive because it requires retraining or complex data removal procedures. There is a need for scalable, efficient MU methods that can handle large models and datasets (e.g., transformers, ImageNet) while providing meaningful evaluation metrics.

Method: LoTUS is a retrain-free MU technique that perturbs the model's prediction probabilities to erase influence of removed samples, constrained by an information-theoretic bound to curb overconfidence. The approach is evaluated on Transformer and ResNet18 across multiple datasets, compared to eight baselines, and introduces RF-JSD as a practical real-world unlearning metric.

Result: LoTUS outperforms eight baselines in both efficiency and effectiveness across multiple architectures and datasets. It enables unlearning on large-scale data like ImageNet1k where retraining is impractical and introduces RF-JSD for evaluation in real-world conditions.

Conclusion: LoTUS offers an effective, scalable retrain-free MU solution with a principled probabilistic smoothing mechanism and a new practical evaluation metric, demonstrating strong performance on diverse models and large datasets.

Abstract: We present LoTUS, a novel Machine Unlearning (MU) method that eliminates the
influence of training samples from pre-trained models, avoiding retraining from
scratch. LoTUS smooths the prediction probabilities of the model up to an
information-theoretic bound, mitigating its over-confidence stemming from data
memorization. We evaluate LoTUS on Transformer and ResNet18 models against
eight baselines across five public datasets. Beyond established MU benchmarks,
we evaluate unlearning on ImageNet1k, a large-scale dataset, where retraining
is impractical, simulating real-world conditions. Moreover, we introduce the
novel Retrain-Free Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RF-JSD) metric to enable
evaluation under real-world conditions. The experimental results show that
LoTUS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and
effectiveness. Code: https://github.com/cspartalis/LoTUS.
