### [1] [Enhancing Underwater Object Detection through Spatio-Temporal Analysis and Spatial Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25797)
*Sai Likhith Karri,Ansh Saxena*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Temporal-spatial modeling with T-YOLOv5 and CBAM improves underwater object detection over standard YOLOv5, especially in dynamic conditions; CBAM yields marginal gains and may trade off performance in simpler scenarios.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Underwater object detection faces challenges from dynamic marine environments, occlusions, and motion. The study investigates whether temporal modeling (T-YOLOv5) and spatial attention (CBAM) can improve accuracy and robustness.

Method: A two-phase evaluation: Phase 1 compares YOLOv5 with T-YOLOv5; Phase 2 augments T-YOLOv5 with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). Performance is measured using mAP@50-95.

Result: YOLOv5 achieves mAP@50-95 = 0.563. T-YOLOv5 reaches 0.813, and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM reaches 0.811, both outperforming the baseline. Temporal modeling significantly improves detection reliability; adding CBAM yields a slight improvement in challenging scenarios but can reduce accuracy in simpler scenarios.

Conclusion: Temporal-spatial modeling enhances underwater object detection reliability. Integrating CBAM offers additional gains in dynamic contexts at a potential cost to simple-case accuracy, supporting the value of attention-augmented, temporally aware models for challenging underwater environments.

Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of spatio-temporal modeling and the
integration of spatial attention mechanisms in deep learning models for
underwater object detection. Specifically, in the first phase, the performance
of temporal-enhanced YOLOv5 variant T-YOLOv5 is evaluated, in comparison with
the standard YOLOv5. For the second phase, an augmented version of T-YOLOv5 is
developed, through the addition of a Convolutional Block Attention Module
(CBAM). By examining the effectiveness of the already pre-existing YOLOv5 and
T-YOLOv5 models and of the newly developed T-YOLOv5 with CBAM. With CBAM, the
research highlights how temporal modeling improves detection accuracy in
dynamic marine environments, particularly under conditions of sudden movements,
partial occlusions, and gradual motion. The testing results showed that YOLOv5
achieved a mAP@50-95 of 0.563, while T-YOLOv5 and T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
outperformed with mAP@50-95 scores of 0.813 and 0.811, respectively,
highlighting their superior accuracy and generalization in detecting complex
objects. The findings demonstrate that T-YOLOv5 significantly enhances
detection reliability compared to the standard model, while T-YOLOv5 with CBAM
further improves performance in challenging scenarios, although there is a loss
of accuracy when it comes to simpler scenarios.

### [2] [MIRO: MultI-Reward cOnditioned pretraining improves T2I quality and efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25897)
*Nicolas Dufour,Lucas Degeorge,Arijit Ghosh,Vicky Kalogeiton,David Picard*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Conditioning text-to-image models on multiple reward models during training (MIRO) learns user preferences directly, improving quality, diversity, and training speed without post-hoc filtering.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current pipelines rely on large uncurated data and post-hoc reward-based filtering, which discards information, limits diversity, and collapses onto a single reward. There is a need to integrate reward signals during training to better align with user preferences.

Method: The proposed MIRO approach trains the generative model with multiple reward models guiding the optimization, instead of relying on a single post-hoc reward. This end-to-end conditioning aims to learn user preferences directly and improve sample efficiency and diversity.

Result: MIRO achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenEval compositional benchmark and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2), with notable improvements in visual quality and faster training.

Conclusion: Conditioning on multiple reward models during training can better align generated images with user preferences, boost quality and diversity, and accelerate training compared to post-hoc reward filtering.

Abstract: Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated
datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not
align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been
specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and
align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of
informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm
diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing,
we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to
let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only
dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also
significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO,
achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark
and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).

### [3] [BikeScenes: Online LiDAR Semantic Segmentation for Bicycles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25901)
*Denniz Goren,Holger Caesar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introducing BikeScenes-lidarseg: a bicycle-focused LiDAR dataset and a tailored segmentation method using SenseBike; domain adaptation from automotive data yields dramatic mIoU gains (63.6% vs 13.8%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cyclist safety is compromised by vulnerability; need to transfer automotive perception to bicycles; create a domain-specific dataset to close the automotive-to-bicycle gap.

Method: SenseBike multi-sensor setup; developed 3D LiDAR segmentation approach tailored to bicycles; created BikeScenes-lidarseg dataset with 3021 consecutive LiDAR scans around TU Delft; 29 dynamic/static classes; semantic annotations; evaluate by training: pretrained on SemanticKITTI, then fine-tune on BikeScenes.

Result: Fine-tuning on BikeScenes achieves mIoU 63.6%, outperforming 13.8% semanticKITTI pretraining; demonstrates necessity/effectiveness of domain-specific training.

Conclusion: BikeScenes dataset advances cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation; discusses challenges of bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained perception; dataset as resource to push domain adaptation and safety research.

Abstract: The vulnerability of cyclists, exacerbated by the rising popularity of faster
e-bikes, motivates adapting automotive perception technologies for bicycle
safety. We use our multi-sensor 'SenseBike' research platform to develop and
evaluate a 3D LiDAR segmentation approach tailored to bicycles. To bridge the
automotive-to-bicycle domain gap, we introduce the novel BikeScenes-lidarseg
Dataset, comprising 3021 consecutive LiDAR scans around the university campus
of the TU Delft, semantically annotated for 29 dynamic and static classes. By
evaluating model performance, we demonstrate that fine-tuning on our BikeScenes
dataset achieves a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 63.6%, significantly
outperforming the 13.8% obtained with SemanticKITTI pre-training alone. This
result underscores the necessity and effectiveness of domain-specific training.
We highlight key challenges specific to bicycle-mounted, hardware-constrained
perception systems and contribute the BikeScenes dataset as a resource for
advancing research in cyclist-centric LiDAR segmentation.

### [4] [Generative Image Restoration and Super-Resolution using Physics-Informed Synthetic Data for Scanning Tunneling Microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25921)
*Nikola L. Kolev,Tommaso Rodani,Neil J. Curson,Taylor J. Z. Stock,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ML-based image repair and super-resolution for STM to mitigate tip degradation and slow acquisition. Uses physics-informed synthetic data from 36 pristine Si(001):H images to train diffusion/flow models, achieving 2–4× speedups in reconstruction from sparse data and restoring image fidelity. Potentially reduces tip-conditioning and boosts frame rates in high-speed STM.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: STM offers atomic-resolution imaging but suffers from tip degradation and slow data acquisition; conditioning of the tip is costly and large voltages during fabrication can alter the apex. The work aims to increase throughput by enabling high-quality reconstruction from sparsely sampled data using ML, reducing the need for frequent tip-conditioning.

Method: Create a physics-informed synthetic data pipeline from a small set of 36 pristine STM images of Si(001):H. Train state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models to perform image repair and super-resolution. Evaluate using CMMD and SSIM to quantify fidelity and robustness against sparse sampling.

Result: The models can restore STM images and accurately reconstruct from sparsely sampled data, yielding a 2–4× reduction in required image acquisition time. This approach demonstrates high fidelity with quantitative metrics and suggests improved throughput for STM experiments.

Conclusion: A physics-informed ML framework can substantially enhance STM throughput by enabling high-quality image restoration from sparse data and reducing the frequency of tip-conditioning, with potential extension to other high-resolution, tip-sensitive imaging modalities.

Abstract: Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) enables atomic-resolution imaging and
atom manipulation, but its utility is often limited by tip degradation and slow
serial data acquisition. Fabrication adds another layer of complexity since the
tip is often subjected to large voltages, which may alter the shape of its
apex, requiring it to be conditioned. Here, we propose a machine learning (ML)
approach for image repair and super-resolution to alleviate both challenges.
Using a dataset of only 36 pristine experimental images of Si(001):H, we
demonstrate that a physics-informed synthetic data generation pipeline can be
used to train several state-of-the-art flow-matching and diffusion models.
Quantitative evaluation with metrics such as the CLIP Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(CMMD) score and structural similarity demonstrates that our models are able to
effectively restore images and offer a two- to fourfold reduction in image
acquisition time by accurately reconstructing images from sparsely sampled
data. Our framework has the potential to significantly increase STM
experimental throughput by offering a route to reducing the frequency of
tip-conditioning procedures and to enhancing frame rates in existing high-speed
STM systems.

### [5] [SplitFlow: Flow Decomposition for Inversion-Free Text-to-Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25970)
*Sung-Hoon Yoon,Minghan Li,Gaspard Beaudouin,Congcong Wen,Muhammad Rafay Azhar,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SplitFlow: an inversion-free, flow decomposition-and-aggregation framework for editing rectified flow models. It decomposes the target prompt into sub-prompts, learns independent flows per sub-prompt, and uses projection and soft-aggregation to combine them, improving semantic fidelity and attribute disentanglement in zero-shot editing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rectified flow models struggle with inversion accuracy, gradient entanglement, and semantic misalignment during editing. There is a need for inversion-free methods that preserve both diversity and fidelity in edits while avoiding conflicting guidance from multiple sub-prompts.

Method: Semantically decompose the target prompt into multiple sub-prompts and compute independent flows for each. Aggregate these flows into a unified editing trajectory. Introduce a projection and soft-aggregation mechanism inspired by gradient-conflict resolution in multi-task learning to adaptively weight sub-target velocity fields, suppress redundancy, and emphasize distinct directions.

Result: Empirically outperforms existing zero-shot editing approaches in semantic fidelity and attribute disentanglement. Decomposing the flow increases diversity in the target space, and the projection/soft-aggregation stabilizes guidance toward the full target prompt. Code available at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: An inversion-free, flow-decomposition-and-aggregation strategy effectively balances diversity and consistency in editing, addressing core limitations of rectified flow models and advancing zero-shot image editing quality.

Abstract: Rectified flow models have become a de facto standard in image generation due
to their stable sampling trajectories and high-fidelity outputs. Despite their
strong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing
tasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the
latent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in
outputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have
attempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based
approaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal
editing quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation
framework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these
limitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into
multiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them
to form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that
decomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,
generating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance
toward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and
soft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution
in multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target
velocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct
directions, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final
edited output. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing zero-shot editing approaches in terms of semantic fidelity and
attribute disentanglement. The code is available at
https://github.com/Harvard-AI-and-Robotics-Lab/SplitFlow.

### [6] [Brain-IT: Image Reconstruction from fMRI via Brain-Interaction Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25976)
*Roman Beliy,Amit Zalcher,Jonathan Kogman,Navve Wasserman,Michal Irani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Brain-IT with a Brain Interaction Transformer to reconstruct seen images from fMRI by clustering voxels into functional blocks shared across subjects, enabling efficient, faithful reconstructions and strong data-efficiency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reconstructing perceived images from fMRI is valuable but current methods struggle with faithfulness and demand large training datasets. A brain-inspired, cross-subject architecture aims to improve fidelity while reducing data requirements.

Method: Cluster functionally similar brain-voxels into shared blocks across subjects. Use Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT) to allow interactions between voxel clusters. Share model components across clusters and subjects to enable efficient training. BIT predicts two patch-level image features: high-level semantic features to guide the diffusion model and low-level structural features to initialize the diffusion process. Information flows directly from voxel clusters to localized image features, enabling faithful reconstruction.

Result: The method achieves reconstructions that faithfully match seen images and surpass state-of-the-art methods in both visual quality and standard metrics. Notably, with only 1 hour of fMRI data from a new subject, results are comparable to methods trained on 40 hours.

Conclusion: Brain-IT demonstrates a scalable, data-efficient approach to brain decoding that improves fidelity of reconstructed images and generalizes across subjects; it establishes a new benchmark for fMRI-to-image reconstruction while highlighting the potential and remaining questions around cross-subject variability and data requirements.

Abstract: Reconstructing images seen by people from their fMRI brain recordings
provides a non-invasive window into the human brain. Despite recent progress
enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the
actual seen images. We present "Brain-IT", a brain-inspired approach that
addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT),
allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar
brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as
building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All
model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient
training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT
predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level
semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic
content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to
initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image.
BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to
localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image
reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and
surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective
metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve
results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.

### [7] [Fine-tuning Segment Anything for Real-Time Tumor Tracking in Cine-MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25990)
*Valentin Boussot,Cédric Hémon,Jean-Claude Nunes,Jean-Louis Dillenseger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Under data scarcity for TrackRAD2025 cine-MRI tumor tracking, two strategies were explored: unsupervised registration (IMPACT metric) and foundation-model segmentation (SAM 2.1 and variants). Due to a one-second runtime constraint, SAM-based segmentation was selected and fine-tuned on a small labeled subset. The final model achieved a Dice score of 0.8794 on the hidden test set, ranking 6th, suggesting foundation models can enable real-time, accurate tumor tracking in MRI-guided radiotherapy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable real-time tumor tracking in cine-MRI under severe data scarcity and strict runtime limits, by comparing unsupervised registration with a foundation-model-based segmentation approach.

Method: Two strategies: (i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric; (ii) foundation-model-based segmentation using SAM 2.1 and variants with prompt-based interaction. Due to a 1-second runtime constraint, the SAM-based method was chosen. The final configuration used SAM2.1 b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned only on the small TrackRAD2025 labeled subset. Training params: 1024x1024 patches, batch size 1, standard augmentations, balanced Dice+IoU loss, learning rate 0.0001 across prompt encoder, decoder, and Hiera backbone. 300 epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). Inference strategy remained consistent across sites and MRI field strengths; test-time augmentation discarded. Model selection based on highest validation Dice after fine-tuning.

Result: On the hidden test set, the model achieved a Dice score of 0.8794 and ranked 6th overall in TrackRAD2025.

Conclusion: Foundation models show strong potential for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided radiotherapy across anatomical sites and MRI field strengths, with good generalization and adaptability to annotator-specific styles.

Abstract: In this work, we address the TrackRAD2025 challenge of real-time tumor
tracking in cine-MRI sequences of the thoracic and abdominal regions under
strong data scarcity constraints. Two complementary strategies were explored:
(i) unsupervised registration with the IMPACT similarity metric and (ii)
foundation model-based segmentation leveraging SAM 2.1 and its recent variants
through prompt-based interaction. Due to the one-second runtime constraint, the
SAM-based method was ultimately selected. The final configuration used SAM2.1
b+ with mask-based prompts from the first annotated slice, fine-tuned solely on
the small labeled subset from TrackRAD2025. Training was configured to minimize
overfitting, using 1024x1024 patches (batch size 1), standard augmentations,
and a balanced Dice + IoU loss. A low uniform learning rate (0.0001) was
applied to all modules (prompt encoder, decoder, Hiera backbone) to preserve
generalization while adapting to annotator-specific styles. Training lasted 300
epochs (~12h on RTX A6000, 48GB). The same inference strategy was consistently
applied across all anatomical sites and MRI field strengths. Test-time
augmentation was considered but ultimately discarded due to negligible
performance gains. The final model was selected based on the highest Dice
Similarity Coefficient achieved on the validation set after fine-tuning. On the
hidden test set, the model reached a Dice score of 0.8794, ranking 6th overall
in the TrackRAD2025 challenge. These results highlight the strong potential of
foundation models for accurate and real-time tumor tracking in MRI-guided
radiotherapy.

### [8] [Larger Hausdorff Dimension in Scanning Pattern Facilitates Mamba-Based Methods in Low-Light Image Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26001)
*Xinhua Wang,Caibo Feng,Xiangjun Fu,Chunxiao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces a Hilbert Selective Scan to boost the Hausdorff dimension of Mamba's scanning pattern, enabling finer feature-space coverage and better capture of local details while preserving long-range dependencies; reports improved performance and efficiency in low-light image enhancement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address information inconsistencies and insufficient capture of fine-scale details in Mamba-based methods, aiming to improve spatial locality and local interactions without sacrificing long-range modeling.

Method: Proposes a Hilbert Selective Scan mechanism that increases the Hausdorff dimension of the scanning pattern, enabling more thorough exploration of the feature space and refined local interactions; integrated with Mamba-based low-light image enhancement to balance local detail and long-range dependencies.

Result: Extensive experiments on public benchmarks show significant gains in quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity, along with reduced computational resource consumption and shorter inference times.

Conclusion: The refined strategy advances the state-of-the-art in low-light image enhancement and may generalize to broader Mamba-based applications.

Abstract: We propose an innovative enhancement to the Mamba framework by increasing the
Hausdorff dimension of its scanning pattern through a novel Hilbert Selective
Scan mechanism. This mechanism explores the feature space more effectively,
capturing intricate fine-scale details and improving overall coverage. As a
result, it mitigates information inconsistencies while refining spatial
locality to better capture subtle local interactions without sacrificing the
model's ability to handle long-range dependencies. Extensive experiments on
publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves both the quantitative metrics and qualitative visual fidelity of
existing Mamba-based low-light image enhancement methods, all while reducing
computational resource consumption and shortening inference time. We believe
that this refined strategy not only advances the state-of-the-art in low-light
image enhancement but also holds promise for broader applications in fields
that leverage Mamba-based techniques.

### [9] [CAVE: Detecting and Explaining Commonsense Anomalies in Visual Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26006)
*Rishika Bhagwatkar,Syrielle Montariol,Angelika Romanou,Beatriz Borges,Irina Rish,Antoine Bosselut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: First real-world anomaly benchmark for Vision-Language Models (CAVE) with three open-ended tasks and rich annotations; demonstrates current VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the gap between industrial/synthetic anomalies and rich real-world anomalies, enabling evaluation of VLMs' ability to detect, describe, explain, and justify anomalies using cognitive-grounded annotations.

Method: Create CAVE benchmark with tasks: anomaly description, explanation, and justification; provide fine-grained visual grounding and categorization annotations (manifestations, complexity, severity, commonness); draw on cognitive science; evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs with prompting strategies.

Result: State-of-the-art VLMs perform poorly on anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning; the benchmark reveals limitations and offers a resource for advancing anomaly detection and reasoning in VLMs.

Conclusion: CAVE offers a realistic, cognitively grounded benchmark to drive progress in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in vision-language models.

Abstract: Humans can naturally identify, reason about, and explain anomalies in their
environment. In computer vision, this long-standing challenge remains limited
to industrial defects or unrealistic, synthetically generated anomalies,
failing to capture the richness and unpredictability of real-world anomalies.
In this work, we introduce CAVE, the first benchmark of real-world visual
anomalies. CAVE supports three open-ended tasks: anomaly description,
explanation, and justification; with fine-grained annotations for visual
grounding and categorizing anomalies based on their visual manifestations,
their complexity, severity, and commonness. These annotations draw inspiration
from cognitive science research on how humans identify and resolve anomalies,
providing a comprehensive framework for evaluating Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) in detecting and understanding anomalies. We show that state-of-the-art
VLMs struggle with visual anomaly perception and commonsense reasoning, even
with advanced prompting strategies. By offering a realistic and cognitively
grounded benchmark, CAVE serves as a valuable resource for advancing research
in anomaly detection and commonsense reasoning in VLMs.

### [10] [Climate Adaptation-Aware Flood Prediction for Coastal Cities Using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26017)
*Bilal Hassan,Areg Karapetyan,Aaron Chung Hin Chow,Samer Madanat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A lightweight vision-based CNN predicts coastal flood depths under SLR scenarios across Abu Dhabi and San Francisco, achieving ~20% MAE improvement over state-of-the-art and supporting scalable coastal planning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Coastal cities face rising flood risk from climate change and sea-level rise. Physics-based simulators are accurate but computationally expensive for city-scale planning and scenario analysis; there is a need for fast, data-efficient models that generalize across regions.

Method: Developed a lightweight CNN within a vision-based, low-resource DL framework to predict flood depth maps under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation. The model is trained/validated on datasets from two distinct regions (Abu Dhabi and San Francisco) to assess cross-region generalization.

Result: The proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing mean absolute error (MAE) in flood depth maps by about 20% on average. It demonstrates cross-regional generalization, suggesting practicality for diverse urban contexts.

Conclusion: The approach offers a scalable, practical tool for coastal flood management under climate change, enabling rapid scenario evaluation and informed mitigation planning. Future work could expand regional coverage, incorporate real-time predictions, and integrate with decision-support systems.

Abstract: Climate change and sea-level rise (SLR) pose escalating threats to coastal
cities, intensifying the need for efficient and accurate methods to predict
potential flood hazards. Traditional physics-based hydrodynamic simulators,
although precise, are computationally expensive and impractical for city-scale
coastal planning applications. Deep Learning (DL) techniques offer promising
alternatives, however, they are often constrained by challenges such as data
scarcity and high-dimensional output requirements. Leveraging a recently
proposed vision-based, low-resource DL framework, we develop a novel,
lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model designed to predict
coastal flooding under variable SLR projections and shoreline adaptation
scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of the model to generalize
across diverse geographical contexts by utilizing datasets from two distinct
regions: Abu Dhabi and San Francisco. Our findings demonstrate that the
proposed model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing the
mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted flood depth maps on average by nearly
20%. These results highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a
scalable and practical tool for coastal flood management, empowering
decision-makers to develop effective mitigation strategies in response to the
growing impacts of climate change. Project Page: https://caspiannet.github.io/

### [11] [Enhancing Temporal Understanding in Video-LLMs through Stacked Temporal Attention in Vision Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26027)
*Ali Rasekh,Erfan Bagheri Soula,Omid Daliran,Simon Gottschalk,Mohsen Fayyaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A Video-LLM with stacked temporal attention in the vision encoder significantly improves temporal reasoning and action-sequence understanding, outperforming baselines on video QA benchmarks (up to +5.5%).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current Video-LLMs struggle with complex temporal dynamics in videos; there is a critical gap in modeling action sequences and temporal progression.

Method: Introduce stacked temporal attention modules directly into the vision encoder, adding temporal attention over frame relationships before feeding visual tokens to the LLM; this enhances the model's capture of action progression.

Result: Notable improvements in temporal reasoning and video QA, achieving up to ~5.5% gains on benchmarks (VITATECS, MVBench, Video-MME), with particular strength in action recognition.

Conclusion: Enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure addresses a key limitation in Video-LLMs, improving video understanding; code and project page available for replication.

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
understanding complex temporal dynamics in videos remains a major challenge.
Our experiments show that current Video Large Language Model (Video-LLM)
architectures have critical limitations in temporal understanding, struggling
with tasks that require detailed comprehension of action sequences and temporal
progression. In this work, we propose a Video-LLM architecture that introduces
stacked temporal attention modules directly within the vision encoder. This
design incorporates a temporal attention in vision encoder, enabling the model
to better capture the progression of actions and the relationships between
frames before passing visual tokens to the LLM. Our results show that this
approach significantly improves temporal reasoning and outperforms existing
models in video question answering tasks, specifically in action recognition.
We improve on benchmarks including VITATECS, MVBench, and Video-MME by up to
+5.5%. By enhancing the vision encoder with temporal structure, we address a
critical gap in video understanding for Video-LLMs. Project page and code are

### [12] [FlexICL: A Flexible Visual In-context Learning Framework for Elbow and Wrist Ultrasound Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26049)
*Yuyue Zhou,Jessica Knight,Shrimanti Ghosh,Banafshe Felfeliyan,Jacob L. Jaremko,Abhilash R. Hareendranathan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexICL is a flexible in-context learning framework for segmenting pediatric elbow/wrist bones in ultrasound with very few labeled frames, achieving strong Dice performance across four datasets using only 5% of labeled data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pixel-wise expert annotations for ultrasound bone segmentation are time-consuming and costly; there is a need for methods that leverage few labeled frames and in-context learning to improve diagnostic guidance and enable non-experts to perform exams with confidence.

Method: Introduce FlexICL for intra-video segmentation where experts annotate a small subset of frames and the model segments the unseen frames. Systematically evaluate image concatenation techniques for visual ICL, propose novel concatenation methods, and employ multiple augmentation strategies. Evaluate on four wrist/elbow ultrasound datasets with only 5% of training data.

Result: FlexICL achieves robust segmentation across four datasets and outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models (Painter, MAE-VQGAN) and conventional segmentation models (U-Net, TransUNet) by 1–27% Dice on 1,252 ultrasound sweeps, demonstrating effectiveness with scarce labeled data.

Conclusion: FlexICL demonstrates a promising, efficient, and scalable approach for US bone segmentation in medical imaging where labeled data are scarce, enabling real-time feedback and improved diagnostic workflow for less-expert users.

Abstract: Elbow and wrist fractures are the most common fractures in pediatric
populations. Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound
(US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear
as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can
provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly
trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert
annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this
challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL)
framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an
intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of
frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate
various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL
and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model
performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation
strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist
and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It
outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and
conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice
coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential
of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well
suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.

Motivation: Fixed negative prompts in diffusion models limit adaptability and control. By dynamically generating negative prompts at denoising steps via VLMs, the method aims to improve alignment and steer image generation more effectively.

Method: During denoising, generate intermediate predictions at selected steps and query a Vision-Language Model to produce contextually appropriate negative prompts that guide the diffusion process adaptively.

Result: Evaluations on multiple benchmark datasets illustrate the trade-offs between negative guidance strength and text-image alignment, demonstrating the method's adaptability and practical effectiveness.

Conclusion: Dynamic, step-aware negative prompting via VLMs offers a flexible mechanism to balance guidance strength with alignment, potentially improving diffusion quality with reduced static prompt rigidity.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for dynamic negative prompting in diffusion
models that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to adaptively generate
negative prompts during the denoising process. Unlike traditional Negative
Prompting methods that use fixed negative prompts, our method generates
intermediate image predictions at specific denoising steps and queries a VLM to
produce contextually appropriate negative prompts. We evaluate our approach on
various benchmark datasets and demonstrate the trade-offs between negative
guidance strength and text-image alignment.

### [14] [Security Risk of Misalignment between Text and Image in Multi-modal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26105)
*Xiaosen Wang,Zhijin Ge,Shaokang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PReMA is a new attack that uses adversarial perturbations on input images to steer the outputs of multi-modal diffusion models, even with a fixed prompt, revealing a vulnerability not addressed by prompt-only attacks and demonstrated on inpainting and style transfer tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a misalignment between textual and visual modalities in current multi-modal diffusion models, which can lead to unsafe or NSFW outputs. Understanding this vulnerability is crucial for assessing security risks in image-editing applications and for guiding the development of robust defenses.

Method: Introduce Prompt-Restricted Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) that perturbs the input image as an adversarial example while keeping the prompt fixed. Evaluate its effectiveness on image inpainting and style transfer across several diffusion models, comparing to prompt-based attacks to establish its novelty and potency.

Result: PReMA demonstrates potent efficacy across experiments, achieving successful manipulation of generated content under fixed prompts. The attack transfers across models and tasks (inpainting and style transfer), confirming a robust and concerning vulnerability in multi-modal diffusion systems.

Conclusion: The work reveals a new and significant safety threat in multi-modal diffusion models arising from adversarial images, not just adversarial prompts. It highlights the need for better alignment between modalities and for defense strategies to mitigate such attacks in real-world image-editing pipelines.

Abstract: Despite the notable advancements and versatility of multi-modal diffusion
models, such as text-to-image models, their susceptibility to adversarial
inputs remains underexplored. Contrary to expectations, our investigations
reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing
diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks,
especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW)
content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted
Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the
input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the
prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by
solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods
that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content.
Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal
diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with
fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and
style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of
PReMA.

*Minjoon Jung,Junbin Xiao,Junghyun Kim,Byoung-Tak Zhang,Angela Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoExo-Con benchmarks cross-view temporal understanding using synchronized egocentric and exocentric videos with human-refined natural language queries. It reveals that Video-LLMs struggle to maintain cross-view consistency and that naive multi-view finetuning can hurt overall performance. The authors propose View-GRPO, a reinforcement learning framework to strengthen view-specific temporal reasoning while promoting cross-view consistency, showing improvements over baselines. Resources will be released publicly.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable robust temporal reasoning about the same event captured from different perspectives, a key challenge for Video-LLMs. Existing models show poor cross-view consistency and simple multi-view training does not guarantee better performance; a benchmark and learning strategy addressing cross-view consistency are needed.

Method: Construct EgoExo-Con: a benchmark of synchronized egocentric and exocentric video pairs with natural-language queries, focusing on two tasks—Temporal Verification and Temporal Grounding—and evaluate existing Video-LLMs on cross-view consistency. Identify limitations of naively fine-tuned multi-view models. Propose View-GRPO, a reinforcement learning framework that preserves view-specific temporal reasoning while enforcing cross-view consistency, and compare against SFT and GRPO baselines.

Result: Key findings: cross-view consistency in Video-LLMs is significantly weaker than single-view performance; naive multi-view finetuning improves consistency but often underperforms models trained on a single view. View-GRPO outperforms naive SFT and GRPO, especially in cross-view consistency.

Conclusion: EgoExo-Con provides a dedicated benchmark for cross-view temporal understanding; View-GRPO offers a principled RL approach to enforce cross-view consistency; resources will be publicly released.

Abstract: Can Video-LLMs achieve consistent temporal understanding when videos capture
the same event from different viewpoints? To study this, we introduce
EgoExo-Con (Consistency), a benchmark of comprehensively synchronized
egocentric and exocentric video pairs with human-refined queries in natural
language. EgoExo-Con emphasizes two temporal understanding tasks: Temporal
Verification and Temporal Grounding. It evaluates not only correctness but
consistency across viewpoints. Our analysis reveals two critical limitations of
existing Video-LLMs: (1) models often fail to maintain consistency, with
results far worse than their single-view performances. (2) When naively
finetuned with synchronized videos of both viewpoints, the models show improved
consistency but often underperform those trained on a single view. For
improvements, we propose View-GRPO, a novel reinforcement learning framework
that effectively strengthens view-specific temporal reasoning while encouraging
consistent comprehension across viewpoints. Our method demonstrates its
superiority over naive SFT and GRPO, especially for improving cross-view
consistency. All resources will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OracleAgent is a large-language-model–driven agent that orchestrates OBS analysis tools and a bespoke multimodal knowledge base to enable structured, multimodal retrieval of Oracle Bone Script resources; it outperforms leading multimodal LLMs and reduces expert research time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OBS research faces a complex, multi-step workflow and inefficient information organization/retrieval, hindering rapid interpretation and analysis of OBS data.

Method: Design and implement OracleAgent to flexibly orchestrate OBS analysis tools powered by LLMs; build a domain-specific, multimodal knowledge base (over 1.4 million rubbing images and 80,000 interpretation texts) through extensive data collection, cleaning, and expert annotation; enable retrieval across characters, documents, interpretation texts, and rubbing images; evaluate with multimodal reasoning/generation tasks and a domain case study.

Result: OracleAgent achieves superior performance on multimodal reasoning and generation tasks, surpassing leading mainstream MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o); a domain case study shows substantially reduced time costs for OBS research.

Conclusion: OracleAgent marks a significant step toward practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation systems, demonstrating the feasibility and value of integrated, multimodal, LLM-powered workflows for heritage-script studies.

Abstract: As one of the earliest writing systems, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) preserves
the cultural and intellectual heritage of ancient civilizations. However,
current OBS research faces two major challenges: (1) the interpretation of OBS
involves a complex workflow comprising multiple serial and parallel sub-tasks,
and (2) the efficiency of OBS information organization and retrieval remains a
critical bottleneck, as scholars often spend substantial effort searching for,
compiling, and managing relevant resources. To address these challenges, we
present OracleAgent, the first agent system designed for the structured
management and retrieval of OBS-related information. OracleAgent seamlessly
integrates multiple OBS analysis tools, empowered by large language models
(LLMs), and can flexibly orchestrate these components. Additionally, we
construct a comprehensive domain-specific multimodal knowledge base for OBS,
which is built through a rigorous multi-year process of data collection,
cleaning, and expert annotation. The knowledge base comprises over 1.4M
single-character rubbing images and 80K interpretation texts. OracleAgent
leverages this resource through its multimodal tools to assist experts in
retrieval tasks of character, document, interpretation text, and rubbing image.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OracleAgent achieves superior
performance across a range of multimodal reasoning and generation tasks,
surpassing leading mainstream multimodal large language models (MLLMs) (e.g.,
GPT-4o). Furthermore, our case study illustrates that OracleAgent can
effectively assist domain experts, significantly reducing the time cost of OBS
research. These results highlight OracleAgent as a significant step toward the
practical deployment of OBS-assisted research and automated interpretation
systems.

### [17] [JOGS: Joint Optimization of Pose Estimation and 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26117)
*Yuxuan Li,Tao Wang,Xianben Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A COLMAP-free, joint optimization of 3D Gaussian points and camera poses using alternating steps, yielding better reconstruction and pose accuracy on challenging scenes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COLMAP and external pose estimation tools introduce computational bottlenecks and error propagation. A unified framework that does not require pre-calibrated inputs can improve robustness and efficiency.

Method: Two interleaved phases: (1) update 3D Gaussian parameters via differentiable rendering with fixed poses; (2) refine camera poses using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that encodes geometric and photometric constraints; iterate to co-optimize both components.

Result: Extensive evaluations show the approach outperforms existing COLMAP-free methods in reconstruction quality and even surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general, especially under challenging viewpoints and sparse features.

Conclusion: The framework demonstrates accurate joint optimization of geometry and pose without pre-calibrated inputs, reducing projection errors and improving robustness across datasets.

Abstract: Traditional novel view synthesis methods heavily rely on external camera pose
estimation tools such as COLMAP, which often introduce computational
bottlenecks and propagate errors. To address these challenges, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes 3D Gaussian points and camera poses
without requiring pre-calibrated inputs. Our approach iteratively refines 3D
Gaussian parameters and updates camera poses through a novel co-optimization
strategy, ensuring simultaneous improvements in scene reconstruction fidelity
and pose accuracy. The key innovation lies in decoupling the joint optimization
into two interleaved phases: first, updating 3D Gaussian parameters via
differentiable rendering with fixed poses, and second, refining camera poses
using a customized 3D optical flow algorithm that incorporates geometric and
photometric constraints. This formulation progressively reduces projection
errors, particularly in challenging scenarios with large viewpoint variations
and sparse feature distributions, where traditional methods struggle. Extensive
evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly
outperforms existing COLMAP-free techniques in reconstruction quality, and also
surpasses the standard COLMAP-based baseline in general.

*Runsheng Xu,Hubert Lin,Wonseok Jeon,Hao Feng,Yuliang Zou,Liting Sun,John Gorman,Kate Tolstaya,Sarah Tang,Brandyn White,Ben Sapp,Mingxing Tan,Jyh-Jing Hwang,Drago Anguelov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces WOD-E2E, a long-tail focused vision-based end-to-end driving dataset with multimodal inputs and a human-aligned evaluation metric (Rater Feedback Score, RFS) for open-loop assessment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current E2E driving benchmarks emphasize nominal scenarios and rely on distance-based metrics that poorly capture multimodal decision making and performance in rare, challenging situations.

Method: Curate 4,021 driving segments (~12 hours) of long-tail scenarios (<0.03% frequency); provide high-level routing, ego states, and 360° camera data from 8 cameras; release rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation segments; propose RFS as an open-loop metric that compares predicted trajectories to rater-annotated preferences; held-out test set labels used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.

Result: Public release of rater preference labels for the validation set; test-set labels withheld for the 2025 challenge; establishes a dataset and human-aligned benchmark intended to drive robust, generalizable E2E driving agents capable of handling rare, real-world situations.

Conclusion: The work provides a resource and evaluation framework tailored to long-tail, multimodal E2E driving, aiming to advance research toward robust, safe autonomous driving in complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-based end-to-end (E2E) driving has garnered significant interest in
the research community due to its scalability and synergy with multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily
feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of
these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall
short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating
performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the
Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021
driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging
long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring
frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the
high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8
surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail
situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback
Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between
predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted
trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have
released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while
the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.
Through our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into
generalizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of
handling complex real-world situations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gradient-based attention is integrated into RGB-D SLAM by fusing layer-wise gradient-derived attention with CNN features to improve frame association, showing gains over baselines in large environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enrich CNN representations with spatially-attentive, task-specific information for semantic understanding in SLAM, aiming to improve data association and localization robustness.

Method: Compute layer-wise attention from network gradients, fuse or integrate this attention with CNN features, and apply to frame association in RGB-D indoor SLAM.

Result: Experimental results indicate improved frame association performance over baseline methods, especially in large environments.

Conclusion: Task-specific spatial attention derived from gradients improves RGB-D SLAM performance, suggesting broader value for integrating gradient-based attention into CNN representations for semantic reasoning.

Abstract: Attention models have recently emerged as a powerful approach, demonstrating
significant progress in various fields. Visualization techniques, such as class
activation mapping, provide visual insights into the reasoning of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). Using network gradients, it is possible to identify
regions where the network pays attention during image recognition tasks.
Furthermore, these gradients can be combined with CNN features to localize more
generalizable, task-specific attentive (salient) regions within scenes.
However, explicit use of this gradient-based attention information integrated
directly into CNN representations for semantic object understanding remains
limited. Such integration is particularly beneficial for visual tasks like
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), where CNN representations
enriched with spatially attentive object locations can enhance performance. In
this work, we propose utilizing task-specific network attention for RGB-D
indoor SLAM. Specifically, we integrate layer-wise attention information
derived from network gradients with CNN feature representations to improve
frame association performance. Experimental results indicate improved
performance compared to baseline methods, particularly for large environments.

*Lihe Ding,Shaocong Dong,Yaokun Li,Chenjian Gao,Xiao Chen,Rui Han,Yihao Kuang,Hong Zhang,Bo Huang,Zhanpeng Huang,Zibin Wang,Dan Xu,Tianfan Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FullPart is a hybrid 3D part generation framework that uses an implicit box diffusion to lay out a per-part, full-resolution voxel grid, enabling high-detail parts and global coherence. It also introduces center-point encoding and a large PartVerse-XL dataset, reporting state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome two weaknesses in prior 3D part generation: (1) implicit vector-set tokens lacking geometric detail, and (2) explicit voxel grids with a shared global space that causes small parts to be underrepresented. The authors aim to combine implicit layout with per-part explicit detail and provide a large annotated dataset to advance the field.

Method: 1) Implicit box vector-set diffusion to derive the bounding box layout for parts. 2) Generate each part inside its own fixed full-resolution voxel grid, avoiding a shared global grid. 3) Introduce center-point encoding to align information exchange between parts of varying sizes and maintain global coherence. 4) Release PartVerse-XL, a large human-annotated 3D part dataset (40K objects, 320K parts).

Result: Empirical results show state-of-the-art performance in 3D part generation across tasks, supported by extensive experiments and ablations.

Conclusion: FullPart delivers improved 3D part generation quality by combining implicit layout with per-part high-resolution voxel details, addressing misalignment and coherence through center-point encoding and a large new dataset; code, data, and model will be released.

Abstract: Part-based 3D generation holds great potential for various applications.
Previous part generators that represent parts using implicit vector-set tokens
often suffer from insufficient geometric details. Another line of work adopts
an explicit voxel representation but shares a global voxel grid among all
parts; this often causes small parts to occupy too few voxels, leading to
degraded quality. In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that
combines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding
box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that
implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little
geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed
full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,
each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,
enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a
center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when
exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby
maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part
data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to
date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will
release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes BasicAVSR, a strong AVSR baseline integrating four key components and three propagation variants, achieving superior performance and speed with code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address AVSR challenges: spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and computational complexity across arbitrary scales; need a scalable, adaptable framework.

Method: Integrates adaptive multi-scale frequency priors from Laplacian pyramids; flow-guided propagation; second-order motion compensation; hyper-upsampling; three propagation variants: unidirectional RNN online, unidirectional with limited lookahead, bidirectional offline.

Result: Demonstrates significant SR quality, generalization, and inference speed improvements over existing methods; versatile across scenarios; code at GitHub.

Conclusion: Advances AVSR state-of-the-art and extends core components to multiple frameworks; provides a practical, scalable baseline for diverse AVSR tasks.

Abstract: Arbitrary-scale video super-resolution (AVSR) aims to enhance the resolution
of video frames, potentially at various scaling factors, which presents several
challenges regarding spatial detail reproduction, temporal consistency, and
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR
for AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency
priors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation
unit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a
second-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of
adjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and
content-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we
instantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for
strictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a
limited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a
bidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources
are less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and
adaptability of our model across these different scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we show that BasicAVSR significantly outperforms existing methods
in terms of super-resolution quality, generalization ability, and inference
speed. Our work not only advances the state-of-the-art in AVSR but also extends
its core components to multiple frameworks for diverse scenarios. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A multi-view mammography–language model trained on synthetic radiology reports achieves state-of-the-art performance on malignancy, subtype, and cancer risk classification with strong data efficiency and no reliance on real radiology reports.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Annotated, fine-grained breast-cancer datasets are expensive to acquire. Vision-language models pre-trained on image-text data can improve robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging, and synthetic reports can substitute for costly real reports.

Method: Train a Multi-View Mammography and Language Model (MV-MLM) using cross-modal self-supervision across paired mammogram images and synthetic radiology reports. Leverage multi-view supervision (multiple imaging views and their pseudo-reports) and a joint visual-textual learning strategy to learn representations that distinguish tissue types (calcifications, masses) and predict cancer risk.

Result: The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three tasks: malignancy classification, subtype classification, and image-based cancer risk prediction. It shows strong data efficiency, outperforming fully supervised or VLM baselines when trained on synthetic reports and without real radiology reports, on both private and public datasets.

Conclusion: Cross-modal learning with synthetic reports and multi-view supervision can yield robust, data-efficient breast-cancer models and reduce reliance on costly labeled radiology reports, with potential applicability to other medical-imaging tasks.

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are essential for training robust Computer-Aided
Diagnosis (CAD) models for breast cancer detection or risk prediction. However,
acquiring such datasets with fine-detailed annotation is both costly and
time-consuming. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, which are
pre-trained on large image-text pairs, offer a promising solution by enhancing
robustness and data efficiency in medical imaging tasks. This paper introduces
a novel Multi-View Mammography and Language Model for breast cancer
classification and risk prediction, trained on a dataset of paired mammogram
images and synthetic radiology reports. Our MV-MLM leverages multi-view
supervision to learn rich representations from extensive radiology data by
employing cross-modal self-supervision across image-text pairs. This includes
multiple views and the corresponding pseudo-radiology reports. We propose a
novel joint visual-textual learning strategy to enhance generalization and
accuracy performance over different data types and tasks to distinguish breast
tissues or cancer characteristics(calcification, mass) and utilize these
patterns to understand mammography images and predict cancer risk. We evaluated
our method on both private and publicly available datasets, demonstrating that
the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three
classification tasks: (1) malignancy classification, (2) subtype
classification, and (3) image-based cancer risk prediction. Furthermore, the
model exhibits strong data efficiency, outperforming existing fully supervised
or VLM baselines while trained on synthetic text reports and without the need
for actual radiology reports.

TL;DR: A YOLOv8-based detector can identify auto-rickshaws in Bangladeshi traffic in real time using 1,730 annotated images, achieving mAP50 of 83.45% and precision/recall > 78%, with a publicly released dataset.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable reliable monitoring of auto-rickshaws for traffic management, since auto-rickshaws may be restricted on certain routes and are visually similar to other vehicles, making manual analysis slow and error-prone.

Method: Real-time object detection using YOLOv8 trained on 1,730 annotated images captured under varied traffic conditions; evaluation reports mAP50 and binary precision/recall; dataset released publicly for further research.

Result: The model achieves mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall above 78%, performing well in both dense and sparse traffic scenarios.

Conclusion: YOLOv8-based auto-rickshaw detector is effective for real-time traffic surveillance in Bangladesh; the public dataset supports reproducibility and further research.

Abstract: Modes of transportation vary across countries depending on geographical
location and cultural context. In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the
most common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,
rickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto
(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of
auto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from
accessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite
difficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially
non-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This
paper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect
auto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object
detection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of
1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions. The
results show that our proposed model performs well in real-time auto-rickshaw
detection and offers an mAP50 of 83.447% and binary precision and recall values
above 78%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both dense and sparse
traffic scenarios. The dataset has been publicly released for further research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CRAG-MM is a comprehensive RAG benchmark for multi-modal, multi-turn conversations in wearable scenarios, introducing 6.5K image-Q/A triplets and 2K visual-based chats across 13 domains; baseline RAG performs poorly (around 32–43% truthfulness), and KDD Cup 2025 results show substantial room for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no widely adopted benchmark for multimodal, multi-turn question answering in wearable settings; a realistic dataset is needed that covers image quality issues, domain variety, and dynamic information to spur progress.

Method: Construct CRAG-MM with 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn conversations across 13 domains (6.2K egocentric images). Include five image-quality issues, six question types, varying popularity and information dynamism, and different conversation turns. Define three tasks: single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn conversations, each with retrieval corpora and APIs for image-KG and web retrieval.

Result: Evaluation shows straightforward RAG baselines achieve 32% truthfulness on single-turn QA and 43% on multi-turn QA; industry-grade systems are similar (32%/45%). The CRAG-MM benchmark was used in KDD Cup 2025 with ~1K participants and ~5K submissions; winning solutions improved baseline by ~28%.

Conclusion: CRAG-MM highlights substantial room for improvement in multimodal, wearable-aware RAG and provides an extensively designed benchmark and competitive platform to drive progress.

Abstract: Wearable devices such as smart glasses are transforming the way people
interact with their surroundings, enabling users to seek information regarding
entities in their view. Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG)
plays a key role in supporting such questions, yet there is still no
comprehensive benchmark for this task, especially regarding wearables
scenarios. To fill this gap, we present CRAG-MM -- a Comprehensive RAG
benchmark for Multi-modal Multi-turn conversations. CRAG-MM contains a diverse
set of 6.5K (image, question, answer) triplets and 2K visual-based multi-turn
conversations across 13 domains, including 6.2K egocentric images designed to
mimic captures from wearable devices. We carefully constructed the questions to
reflect real-world scenarios and challenges, including five types of
image-quality issues, six question types, varying entity popularity, differing
information dynamism, and different conversation turns. We design three tasks:
single-source augmentation, multi-source augmentation, and multi-turn
conversations -- each paired with an associated retrieval corpus and APIs for
both image-KG retrieval and webpage retrieval. Our evaluation shows that
straightforward RAG approaches achieve only 32% and 43% truthfulness on CRAG-MM
single- and multi-turn QA, respectively, whereas state-of-the-art industry
solutions have similar quality (32%/45%), underscoring ample room for
improvement. The benchmark has hosted KDD Cup 2025, attracting about 1K
participants and 5K submissions, with winning solutions improving baseline
performance by 28%, highlighting its early impact on advancing the field.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome the limitations of existing motion representations (coarse-grained, inaccurate) and enable precise, high-resolution recovery of motion trajectories from motion-blurred imagery, benefiting tasks like deblurring and coded exposure photography.

Method: Introduce a conditional diffusion framework that leverages multi-scale features from the blurred image as conditioning input, and a specialized training strategy to enforce fine-grained trajectory accuracy, global path consistency, and pixel-level connectivity along the motion path.

Result: Experiments show MoTDiff outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography tasks, delivering higher-quality, high-resolution motion trajectories.

Conclusion: A novel HR motion trajectory estimation approach using diffusion models can produce superior, coherent, and connected motion paths from a single blurred image, advancing motion representation quality for computational imaging.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of motion information is crucial in diverse computational
imaging and computer vision applications. Researchers have investigated various
methods to extract motion information from a single blurred image, including
blur kernels and optical flow. However, existing motion representations are
often of low quality, i.e., coarse-grained and inaccurate. In this paper, we
propose the first high-resolution (HR) Motion Trajectory estimation framework
using Diffusion models (MoTDiff). Different from existing motion
representations, we aim to estimate an HR motion trajectory with high-quality
from a single motion-blurred image. The proposed MoTDiff consists of two key
components: 1) a new conditional diffusion framework that uses multi-scale
feature maps extracted from a single blurred image as a condition, and 2) a new
training method that can promote precise identification of a fine-grained
motion trajectory, consistent estimation of overall shape and position of a
motion path, and pixel connectivity along a motion trajectory. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed MoTDiff can outperform state-of-the-art methods
in both blind image deblurring and coded exposure photography applications.

*Jinho Choi,Hyesu Lim,Steffen Schneider,Jaegul Choo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConceptScope is a scalable framework that uses sparse autoencoders on vision-model representations to automatically discover and quantify human-interpretable concepts in visual datasets, categorize concepts into target/context/bias, and enable bias auditing and robustness evaluation via concept-based subgrouping.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Dataset bias is pervasive and hard to identify without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations; an automated, scalable auditing tool is needed.

Method: Train Sparse Autoencoders on representations from vision foundation models to discover concepts; categorize them by semantic relevance and correlation to class labels into target, context, and bias; use concept activations for spatial attribution and perform class-level dataset characterization and subgroup-based robustness evaluation.

Result: The framework captures a wide range of concepts (objects, textures, backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, actions); activations align with semantically meaningful image regions; reliably detects known biases (e.g., Waterbirds background bias) and uncovers unannotated biases (e.g., co-occurring objects in ImageNet); validated against annotated datasets and proposed as a practical tool for auditing and diagnostics.

Conclusion: ConceptScope provides a practical, scalable tool for dataset auditing and model diagnostics, enabling biased detection and robustness assessment through concept-based analysis without extensive manual annotations.

Abstract: Dataset bias, where data points are skewed to certain concepts, is ubiquitous
in machine learning datasets. Yet, systematically identifying these biases is
challenging without costly, fine-grained attribute annotations. We present
ConceptScope, a scalable and automated framework for analyzing visual datasets
by discovering and quantifying human-interpretable concepts using Sparse
Autoencoders trained on representations from vision foundation models.
ConceptScope categorizes concepts into target, context, and bias types based on
their semantic relevance and statistical correlation to class labels, enabling
class-level dataset characterization, bias identification, and robustness
evaluation through concept-based subgrouping. We validate that ConceptScope
captures a wide range of visual concepts, including objects, textures,
backgrounds, facial attributes, emotions, and actions, through comparisons with
annotated datasets. Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce
spatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.
ConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in
Waterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects
in ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model
diagnostics.

### [27] [On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00037)
*Jianing Guo,Zhenhong Wu,Chang Tu,Yiyao Ma,Xiangqi Kong,Zhiqian Liu,Jiaming Ji,Shuning Zhang,Yuanpei Chen,Kai Chen,Qi Dou,Yaodong Yang,Xianglong Liu,Huijie Zhao,Weifeng Lv,Simin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RobustVLA proposes multi-modal robustness for Vision-Language-Action by addressing perturbations across actions, instructions, environments, and observations, using offline robust optimization and input-consistency, guided by a multi-armed bandit to handle multiple perturbations; shows significant gains and faster inference.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLAs are sensitive to real-world multi-modal perturbations; current methods focus on simple visual disturbances and do not ensure cross-modal robustness; need a method that handles perturbations in actions, instructions, and environments.

Method: RobustVLA combines (1) output robustness via offline robust optimization against worst-case action noise (flow matching objective), acting like adversarial training with label smoothing and outlier penalization; (2) input robustness via enforcing consistent actions across input variations preserving semantics; (3) multi-perturbation handling via multi-armed bandit with UCB to identify the most harmful noise; experiments on LIBERO with pi0 and OpenVLA backbones; faster inference; real-world robot evaluation.

Result: Absolute gains of 12.6% (pi0 backbone) and 10.4% (OpenVLA backbone) across 17 perturbations; 50.6x faster inference than existing visual-robust VLAs; 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations; 65.6% gains on real-world FR5 robot under four modalities.

Conclusion: RobustVLA effectively improves robustness and efficiency against multi-modal perturbations in VLA systems, enabling more reliable real-world deployment, including limited-demo robotics scenarios.

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

### [28] [Sketch2PoseNet: Efficient and Generalized Sketch to 3D Human Pose Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26196)
*Li Wang,Yiyu Zhuang,Yanwen Wang,Xun Cao,Chuan Guo,Xinxin Zuo,Hao Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based learn-from-synthesis approach is proposed for 3D pose estimation from sketches, addressing data scarcity by synthesizing sketch poses from 3D poses to create SKEP-120K, and introducing an end-to-end framework that fuses 2D pose detectors with diffusion priors to estimate 3D pose and shape from diverse sketch styles with improved accuracy and speed.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Sketch-based 3D pose estimation suffers from scarce labeled data and the highly abstract, disproportionate nature of sketches. Previous methods relied on slow heuristic optimization, limiting generalization. A scalable, data-driven solution leveraging synthetic data is needed.

Method: Train a diffusion model to synthesize sketch images from 2D projections of 3D poses, generating SKEP-120K (120k sketch-3D pose pairs). Develop an end-to-end framework that uses existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors to extract sketch features, combined with a feed-forward network for 2D pose estimation; incorporate multiple heuristic losses to ensure geometric coherence between 3D and 2D poses and preserve self-contacts.

Result: Evaluations (qualitative, quantitative, and subjective) show the method substantially surpasses previous approaches in both accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

Conclusion: A learn-from-synthesis diffusion-guided pipeline effectively tackles data scarcity and the abstract nature of sketches, enabling accurate and fast 3D pose estimation from diverse sketch styles with improved generalization.

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation from sketches has broad applications in computer
animation and film production. Unlike traditional human pose estimation, this
task presents unique challenges due to the abstract and disproportionate nature
of sketches. Previous sketch-to-pose methods, constrained by the lack of
large-scale sketch-3D pose annotations, primarily relied on optimization with
heuristic rules-an approach that is both time-consuming and limited in
generalizability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach
leveraging a "learn from synthesis" strategy. First, a diffusion model is
trained to synthesize sketch images from 2D poses projected from 3D human
poses, mimicking disproportionate human structures in sketches. This process
enables the creation of a synthetic dataset, SKEP-120K, consisting of 120k
accurate sketch-3D pose annotation pairs across various sketch styles. Building
on this synthetic dataset, we introduce an end-to-end data-driven framework for
estimating human poses and shapes from diverse sketch styles. Our framework
combines existing 2D pose detectors and generative diffusion priors for sketch
feature extraction with a feed-forward neural network for efficient 2D pose
estimation. Multiple heuristic loss functions are incorporated to guarantee
geometric coherence between the derived 3D poses and the detected 2D poses
while preserving accurate self-contacts. Qualitative, quantitative, and
subjective evaluations collectively show that our model substantially surpasses
previous ones in both estimation accuracy and speed for sketch-to-pose tasks.

### [29] [Developing a Multi-task Ensemble Geometric Deep Network for Supply Chain Sustainability and Risk Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26203)
*Mehdi Khaleghi,Nastaran Khaleghi,Sobhan Sheykhivand,Sebelan Danishvar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A novel Chebyshev ensemble geometric network (Ch-EGN), a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning model, is proposed to improve sustainability and risk management in supply chains, achieving high accuracies on two datasets (SupplyGraph and DataCo) and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enhance sustainability and risk management in supply chains by accurately classifying products and relationships, leveraging deep learning architectures that capture complex dependencies and hidden states in supply chain data.

Method: Introduce the Chebyshev ensemble geometric network (Ch-EGN), a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning model forming an ensemble. It leverages information dependencies in the supply chain to derive latent states. Evaluated on two datasets (SupplyGraph and DataCo) for multiple tasks: risk management (delivery status) on DataCo; product and edge classification on SupplyGraph.

Result: On DataCo, average accuracy for risk management: 98.95%. On SupplyGraph: 5-product group classification accuracy 100%, 4-product relation classification accuracy 98.07%, 25-company relation classification accuracy 92.37%. The results indicate improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: The proposed Ch-EGN ensemble method effectively enhances sustainability analysis and risk management in supply chains, achieving high accuracy across multiple classification tasks and datasets, outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: The sustainability of supply chain plays a key role in achieving optimal
performance in controlling the supply chain. The management of risks that occur
in a supply chain is a fundamental problem for the purpose of developing the
sustainability of the network and elevating the performance efficiency of the
supply chain. The correct classification of products is another essential
element in a sustainable supply chain. Acknowledging recent breakthroughs in
the context of deep networks, several architectural options have been deployed
to analyze supply chain datasets. A novel geometric deep network is used to
propose an ensemble deep network. The proposed Chebyshev ensemble geometric
network (Ch-EGN) is a hybrid convolutional and geometric deep learning. This
network is proposed to leverage the information dependencies in supply chain to
derive invisible states of samples in the database. The functionality of the
proposed deep network is assessed on the two different databases. The
SupplyGraph Dataset and DataCo are considered in this research. The prediction
of delivery status of DataCo supply chain is done for risk administration. The
product classification and edge classification are performed using the
SupplyGraph database to enhance the sustainability of the supply network. An
average accuracy of 98.95% is obtained for the ensemble network for risk
management. The average accuracy of 100% and 98.07% are obtained for
sustainable supply chain in terms of 5 product group classification and 4
product relation classification, respectively. The average accuracy of 92.37%
is attained for 25 company relation classification. The results confirm an
average improvement and efficiency of the proposed method compared to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

### [30] [OmniLayout: Enabling Coarse-to-Fine Learning with LLMs for Universal Document Layout Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26213)
*Hengrui Kang,Zhuangcheng Gu,Zhiyuan Zhao,Zichen Wen,Bin Wang,Weijia Li,Conghui He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes OmniLayout-1M dataset and OmniLayout-LLM to advance diverse document layout generation via a two-stage coarse-to-fine learning approach; shows improvements on M6Doc across multiple domains; code and data to be released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Document AI progress has emphasized document layout analysis, but generative document layout remains underexplored due to a scarcity of diverse layouts (e.g., newspapers/magazines) compared to Manhattan-style layouts. A large, diverse dataset and a capable generative model are needed to enable robust, cross-domain layout generation.

Method: 1) Compile OmniLayout-1M, a million-scale, multi-source dataset of diverse document layouts spanning six common types. 2) Develop OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model trained with a two-stage coarse-to-fine learning paradigm: (a) learn universal layout principles from OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions; (b) transfer knowledge to specific domains via fine-grained annotations. 3) Evaluate on the M$^{6}$Doc dataset across multiple domains, comparing against existing layout generation experts and recent general-purpose LLMs.

Result: OmniLayout-LLM achieves strong performance across multiple domains in M6Doc, substantially surpassing existing layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs.

Conclusion: The work introduces a scalable, diverse layout dataset and a domain-adapted, two-stage model for document layout generation, with public release of code, models, and data to advance cross-domain layout synthesis.

Abstract: Document AI has advanced rapidly and is attracting increasing attention. Yet,
while most efforts have focused on document layout analysis (DLA), its
generative counterpart, document layout generation, remains underexplored. A
major obstacle lies in the scarcity of diverse layouts: academic papers with
Manhattan-style structures dominate existing studies, while open-world genres
such as newspapers and magazines remain severely underrepresented. To address
this gap, we curate OmniLayout-1M, the first million-scale dataset of diverse
document layouts, covering six common document types and comprising
contemporary layouts collected from multiple sources. Moreover, since existing
methods struggle in complex domains and often fail to arrange long sequences
coherently, we introduce OmniLayout-LLM, a 0.5B model with designed two-stage
Coarse-to-Fine learning paradigm: 1) learning universal layout principles from
OmniLayout-1M with coarse category definitions, and 2) transferring the
knowledge to a specific domain with fine-grained annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance on
multiple domains in M$^{6}$Doc dataset, substantially surpassing both existing
layout generation experts and several latest general-purpose LLMs. Our code,
models, and dataset will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AoT-PsyPhyBENCH shows most vision-language models struggle to infer temporal direction in videos, with humans far outperforming models on irreversible/causal tasks; highlights a gap in temporal and causal reasoning and provides a psychophysically validated benchmark with released code/data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Evaluate whether current vision-language models possess temporal understanding and causal reasoning in videos, addressing a gap where models excel at correlations but lack temporal continuity inductive biases; align evaluation with human psychophysics baselines.

Method: Introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated benchmark using natural video stimuli and human baselines to test forward vs backward temporal direction (AoT). Test both open-weight and proprietary VLMs, including reasoning and non-reasoning models, on physically irreversible and causal tasks.

Result: Most models perform near chance; even the best lag far behind humans on irreversible physical processes (e.g., free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition). Indicates models lack temporal continuity and causal inductive biases despite rich visual-semantic representations.

Conclusion: There is a fundamental gap in current multimodal systems between visual-semantic correlation and temporal/causal understanding. The authors release code and data to spur progress in physical and temporal reasoning of VLMs.

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet
their grasp of temporal information in video remains weak and, crucially,
under-evaluated. We probe this gap with a deceptively simple but revealing
challenge: judging the arrow of time (AoT)-whether a short clip is played
forward or backward. We introduce AoT-PsyPhyBENCH, a psychophysically validated
benchmark that tests whether VLMs can infer temporal direction in natural
videos using the same stimuli and behavioral baselines established for humans.
Our comprehensive evaluation of open-weight and proprietary, reasoning and
non-reasoning VLMs reveals that most models perform near chance, and even the
best lag far behind human accuracy on physically irreversible processes (e.g.,
free fall, diffusion/explosion) and causal manual actions (division/addition)
that humans recognize almost instantly. These results highlight a fundamental
gap in current multimodal systems: while they capture rich visual-semantic
correlations, they lack the inductive biases required for temporal continuity
and causal understanding. We release the code and data for AoT-PsyPhyBENCH to
encourage further progress in the physical and temporal reasoning capabilities
of VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A cognitive-inspired infrared-visible fusion method HCLFuse uses a multi-scale mask-regulated variational bottleneck encoder and diffusion-guided generation to improve structure and segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the persistent trade-off between modal information in fusion, lack of interpretability, and poor generative reliability; leverage information mapping and cognitive-inspired guidance.

Method: Unsupervised information mapping; multi-scale mask-regulated variational bottleneck encoder with posterior probability modeling and information decomposition; diffusion model with time-varying physical guidance regulating generation stages.

Result: State-of-the-art fusion quality across datasets; improved semantic segmentation metrics; enhanced structural consistency and detail quality.

Conclusion: Shows generative image fusion can be robust and interpretable by combining information-theoretic encoding with physics-guided diffusion, consistent with human cognition.

Abstract: Existing infrared and visible image fusion methods often face the dilemma of
balancing modal information. Generative fusion methods reconstruct fused images
by learning from data distributions, but their generative capabilities remain
limited. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in modal information selection
further affects the reliability and consistency of fusion results in complex
scenarios. This manuscript revisits the essence of generative image fusion
under the inspiration of human cognitive laws and proposes a novel infrared and
visible image fusion method, termed HCLFuse. First, HCLFuse investigates the
quantification theory of information mapping in unsupervised fusion networks,
which leads to the design of a multi-scale mask-regulated variational
bottleneck encoder. This encoder applies posterior probability modeling and
information decomposition to extract accurate and concise low-level modal
information, thereby supporting the generation of high-fidelity structural
details. Furthermore, the probabilistic generative capability of the diffusion
model is integrated with physical laws, forming a time-varying physical
guidance mechanism that adaptively regulates the generation process at
different stages, thereby enhancing the ability of the model to perceive the
intrinsic structure of data and reducing dependence on data quality.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
fusion performance in qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple
datasets and significantly improves semantic segmentation metrics. This fully
demonstrates the advantages of this generative image fusion method, drawing
inspiration from human cognition, in enhancing structural consistency and
detail quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Three CNNs (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, ResNet50) trained on VGGFace2 eye crops; score-level fusion improves periocular verification on UBIPr, achieving state-of-the-art.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Periocular verification across distances remains challenging. Leveraging complementary CNNs with diverse attention patterns can boost accuracy and provide insight into what drives performance.

Method: Train SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet50 on eye crops derived from VGGFace2. Evaluate using cosine and chi-square metrics. Explore different initializations. Fuse scores via logistic regression. Use LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon divergence to compare attention patterns. Test on the UBIPr dataset and compare against prior work.

Result: ResNet50 is the strongest individual model. Fusion of all three networks yields substantial accuracy gains due to complementary attention regions. Heatmaps indicate networks focus on distinct image regions, explaining complementarity. The approach achieves a new state-of-the-art on UBIPr, outperforming previous methods.

Conclusion: Ensembling heterogeneous CNNs with attention analysis yields superior periocular verification by exploiting complementary attention patterns; this approach sets a new benchmark on UBIPr.

Abstract: We study the complementarity of different CNNs for periocular verification at
different distances on the UBIPr database. We train three architectures of
increasing complexity (SqueezeNet, MobileNetv2, and ResNet50) on a large set of
eye crops from VGGFace2. We analyse performance with cosine and chi2 metrics,
compare different network initialisations, and apply score-level fusion via
logistic regression. In addition, we use LIME heatmaps and Jensen-Shannon
divergence to compare attention patterns of the CNNs. While ResNet50
consistently performs best individually, the fusion provides substantial gains,
especially when combining all three networks. Heatmaps show that networks
usually focus on distinct regions of a given image, which explains their
complementarity. Our method significantly outperforms previous works on UBIPr,
achieving a new state-of-the-art.

### [34] [Spiking Patches: Asynchronous, Sparse, and Efficient Tokens for Event Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26614)
*Christoffer Koo Øhrstrøm,Ronja Güldenring,Lazaros Nalpantidis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces Spiking Patches, a tokenizer for event cameras that preserves sparsity and asynchronous properties, achieving faster inference while maintaining or improving accuracy on gesture recognition and object detection (up to 3.4x/10.4x faster than voxel/frame baselines; gains up to 3.8 and 1.4 in accuracy).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Event cameras generate asynchronous, spatially sparse events. Frame and voxel representations impose synchronization and reduce sparsity, which can degrade the efficiency and fail to leverage the native properties of event data. A representation that preserves sparsity could enable faster, more accurate processing.

Method: Proposes Spiking Patches as a tokenizer that converts event streams into tokens while preserving sparsity. Evaluates the tokens with a Graph Neural Network (GNN), PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and object detection, comparing against frame and voxel-based tokens in terms of speed and accuracy.

Result: Tokens derived from Spiking Patches enable inference times up to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. They match or surpass the accuracy of the baselines, with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for object detection.

Conclusion: Tokenization with Spiking Patches represents a novel direction in event-based vision, successfully preserving the distinctive properties of event cameras while delivering faster inference and competitive or improved accuracy.

Abstract: We propose tokenization of events and present a tokenizer, Spiking Patches,
specifically designed for event cameras. Given a stream of asynchronous and
spatially sparse events, our goal is to discover an event representation that
preserves these properties. Prior works have represented events as frames or as
voxels. However, while these representations yield high accuracy, both frames
and voxels are synchronous and decrease the spatial sparsity. Spiking Patches
gives the means to preserve the unique properties of event cameras and we show
in our experiments that this comes without sacrificing accuracy. We evaluate
our tokenizer using a GNN, PCN, and a Transformer on gesture recognition and
object detection. Tokens from Spiking Patches yield inference times that are up
to 3.4x faster than voxel-based tokens and up to 10.4x faster than frames. We
achieve this while matching their accuracy and even surpassing in some cases
with absolute improvements up to 3.8 for gesture recognition and up to 1.4 for
object detection. Thus, tokenization constitutes a novel direction in
event-based vision and marks a step towards methods that preserve the
properties of event cameras.

*Lin Liu,Guanyi Yu,Ziying Song,Junqiao Li,Caiyan Jia,Feiyang Jia,Peiliang Wu,Yandan Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CATG introduces Constrained Flow Matching for autonomous driving planning, enabling diverse, constraint-compliant trajectory generation with controllable aggressiveness; it ranked 2nd in NavSim v2 (EPDMS 51.31) and earned an Innovation Award.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address mode collapse in imitation learning and the absence of direct integration of safety/kinematic constraints in generative planning, avoiding costly post-hoc optimization.

Method: Use Constrained Flow Matching to model the flow generation process, explicitly impose safety and kinematic constraints within generation, and parameterize driving aggressiveness as a controllable signal during trajectory generation.

Result: On NavSim v2, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and was honored with an Innovation Award.

Conclusion: Explicitly constraining the flow matching process yields diverse, constraint-adherent trajectories and enables controllable trajectory style, showing promise for safe, end-to-end autonomous driving planning.

Abstract: Planning is a critical component of end-to-end autonomous driving. However,
prevailing imitation learning methods often suffer from mode collapse, failing
to produce diverse trajectory hypotheses. Meanwhile, existing generative
approaches struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints
directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization
stage to refine their outputs. To address these limitations, we propose CATG, a
novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely,
CATG explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates
mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning
signals. Our primary contribution is the novel imposition of explicit
constraints directly within the flow matching process, ensuring that the
generated trajectories adhere to vital safety and kinematic rules. Secondly,
CATG parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during
generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Notably, on the
NavSim v2 challenge, CATG achieved 2nd place with an EPDMS score of 51.31 and
was honored with the Innovation Award.

### [36] [Leveraging Large-Scale Face Datasets for Deep Periocular Recognition via Ocular Cropping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26294)
*Fernando Alonso-Fernandez,Kevin Hernandez-Diaz,Jose Maria Buades Rubio,Josef Bigun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Three CNNs of varying depth trained on ~1.9M periocular crops from VGGFace2 show that periocular biometrics is challenging under uncontrolled conditions (EER 9–15%) compared to full-face (3–6%), but high-quality periocular data (UFPR-Periocular) achieves very low EERs (1–2%), highlighting dataset quality as a key factor.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivate evaluating periocular recognition with deep CNNs at scale, addressing the typical reliance on small periocular datasets and assessing how dataset quality and acquisition affect performance.

Method: Train three CNN architectures of increasing depth/complexity on 1,907,572 ocular crops from VGGFace2; evaluate on VGGFace2-Pose (in-the-wild) and UFPR-Periocular (mobile selfies with guided acquisition); report Equal Error Rates (EERs).

Result: Under VGGFace2-Pose, EERs with ocular crops are 9–15%, higher than 3–6% EERs for full-face. UFPR-Periocular yields EERs of 1–2%, due to higher image quality and consistent acquisition. Reported EERs on UFPR are the lowest to date.

Conclusion: Performance in periocular biometrics strongly depends on data quality and acquisition protocol. Controlled, high-quality periocular datasets can achieve very low EERs, whereas uncontrolled, in-the-wild data degrades performance. This underscores the need for large-scale, well-curated periocular datasets and careful consideration of cross-dataset generalization for real-world deployment.

Abstract: We focus on ocular biometrics, specifically the periocular region (the area
around the eye), which offers high discrimination and minimal acquisition
constraints. We evaluate three Convolutional Neural Network architectures of
varying depth and complexity to assess their effectiveness for periocular
recognition. The networks are trained on 1,907,572 ocular crops extracted from
the large-scale VGGFace2 database. This significantly contrasts with existing
works, which typically rely on small-scale periocular datasets for training
having only a few thousand images. Experiments are conducted with ocular images
from VGGFace2-Pose, a subset of VGGFace2 containing in-the-wild face images,
and the UFPR-Periocular database, which consists of selfies captured via mobile
devices with user guidance on the screen. Due to the uncontrolled conditions of
VGGFace2, the Equal Error Rates (EERs) obtained with ocular crops range from
9-15%, noticeably higher than the 3-6% EERs achieved using full-face images. In
contrast, UFPR-Periocular yields significantly better performance (EERs of
1-2%), thanks to higher image quality and more consistent acquisition
protocols. To the best of our knowledge, these are the lowest reported EERs on
the UFPR dataset to date.

Motivation: Scheduling agile Earth Observation Satellite constellations is difficult due to scale, dynamic environments, and strict constraints. Current methods oversimplify complexities and underperform in realistic settings. A dedicated large-scale benchmark and a constraint-aware scheduling model are needed to bridge research and real-world performance.

Method: AEOS-Bench compiles 3,907 finely tuned satellite assets and 16,410 high-fidelity scenarios (1–50 satellites, 50–300 tasks) generated by a simulation platform with orbital dynamics and resource constraints; provides ground-truth schedules. AEOS-Former is a Transformer-based scheduler with a constraint-aware attention mechanism and an internal constraint module that encodes physical/operational limits; learning is iterative and simulation-based to adapt to diverse scenarios.

Result: AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy efficiency. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of the constraint-aware attention and internal constraint module. Code and data are released at the provided GitHub link.

Conclusion: The AEOS-Bench benchmark fills a gap for large-scale, realistic constellation scheduling research, and AEOS-Former offers a robust, constraint-aware scheduling solution with demonstrated gains, supported by open-source resources for reproducibility.

Abstract: Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) constellations offer unprecedented
flexibility for monitoring the Earth's surface, but their scheduling remains
challenging under large-scale scenarios, dynamic environments, and stringent
constraints. Existing methods often simplify these complexities, limiting their
real-world performance. We address this gap with a unified framework
integrating a standardized benchmark suite and a novel scheduling model. Our
benchmark suite, AEOS-Bench, contains $3,907$ finely tuned satellite assets and
$16,410$ scenarios. Each scenario features $1$ to $50$ satellites and $50$ to
$300$ imaging tasks. These scenarios are generated via a high-fidelity
simulation platform, ensuring realistic satellite behavior such as orbital
dynamics and resource constraints. Ground truth scheduling annotations are
provided for each scenario. To our knowledge, AEOS-Bench is the first
large-scale benchmark suite tailored for realistic constellation scheduling.
Building upon this benchmark, we introduce AEOS-Former, a Transformer-based
scheduling model that incorporates a constraint-aware attention mechanism. A
dedicated internal constraint module explicitly models the physical and
operational limits of each satellite. Through simulation-based iterative
learning, AEOS-Former adapts to diverse scenarios, offering a robust solution
for AEOS constellation scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that
AEOS-Former outperforms baseline models in task completion and energy
efficiency, with ablation studies highlighting the contribution of each
component. Code and data are provided in

*Jelizaveta Jankowska,Bożena Kostek,Fernando Alonso-Fernandez,Prayag Tiwari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Music genres influence emotions; study links subjective reports with EEG-derived brain activity across a diverse participant group.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different music genres modulate emotional states and relate self-reported emotions to neural responses, accounting for gender and musical taste diversity.

Method: Participants listened to various music genres while EEG data were recorded; subjective questionnaires assessed emotions; a relationship analysis between questionnaire responses and EEG signals was conducted.

Result: Emotion-related EEG patterns varied with music genre; several significant associations were found between reported emotions and brain activity, indicating genre-specific neural correlates.

Conclusion: Music experiences elicit emotion-linked brain activity, and subjective feelings align with EEG data, supporting multimodal assessment of music-evoked emotions; results suggest genre-dependent neural mechanisms.

Abstract: The subject of this work is to check how different types of music affect
human emotions. While listening to music, a subjective survey and brain
activity measurements were carried out using an EEG helmet. The aim is to
demonstrate the impact of different music genres on emotions. The research
involved a diverse group of participants of different gender and musical
preferences. This had the effect of capturing a wide range of emotional
responses to music. After the experiment, a relationship analysis of the
respondents' questionnaires with EEG signals was performed. The analysis
revealed connections between emotions and observed brain activity.

### [39] [A Hybrid Framework Bridging CNN and ViT based on Theory of Evidence for Diabetic Retinopathy Grading](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26315)
*Junlai Qiu,Yunzhu Chen,Hao Zheng,Yawen Huang,Yuexiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A hybrid CNN+ViT approach for diabetic retinopathy grading using evidential fusion to transform features into supporting evidences, enabling adaptive fusion and improved accuracy with interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Single backbones (CNN or ViT) struggle to achieve optimal DR grading due to bottlenecks in local vs global feature capture. Combining backbones aims to leverage complementary strengths and improve screening efficiency and interpretability.

Method: Extract features from both CNN and ViT backbones, transform them into evidences via deep evidential networks, aggregate evidences to form an opinion and adaptively tune the fusion pattern between backbones, yielding a hybrid model.

Result: The hybrid model achieves higher DR grading accuracy than state-of-the-art frameworks on two public datasets and provides strong interpretability for feature fusion and decision-making.

Conclusion: Integrating CNN and ViT through evidential fusion is effective for DR grading, offering improved performance and interpretability, and suggesting a general paradigm for multi-backbone fusion in medical imaging.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss among middle-aged
and elderly people, which significantly impacts their daily lives and mental
health. To improve the efficiency of clinical screening and enable the early
detection of DR, a variety of automated DR diagnosis systems have been recently
established based on convolutional neural network (CNN) or vision Transformer
(ViT). However, due to the own shortages of CNN / ViT, the performance of
existing methods using single-type backbone has reached a bottleneck. One
potential way for the further improvements is integrating different kinds of
backbones, which can fully leverage the respective strengths of them
(\emph{i.e.,} the local feature extraction capability of CNN and the global
feature capturing ability of ViT). To this end, we propose a novel paradigm to
effectively fuse the features extracted by different backbones based on the
theory of evidence. Specifically, the proposed evidential fusion paradigm
transforms the features from different backbones into supporting evidences via
a set of deep evidential networks. With the supporting evidences, the
aggregated opinion can be accordingly formed, which can be used to adaptively
tune the fusion pattern between different backbones and accordingly boost the
performance of our hybrid model. We evaluated our method on two publicly
available DR grading datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our
hybrid model not only improves the accuracy of DR grading, compared to the
state-of-the-art frameworks, but also provides the excellent interpretability
for feature fusion and decision-making.

### [40] [GLYPH-SR: Can We Achieve Both High-Quality Image Super-Resolution and High-Fidelity Text Recovery via VLM-guided Latent Diffusion Model?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26339)
*Mingyu Sung,Seungjae Ham,Kangwoo Kim,Yeokyoung Yoon,Sangseok Yun,Il-Min Kim,Jae-Mo Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A diffusion-based, vision-language guided super-resolution method (GLYPH-SR) for scene text that jointly optimizes text readability and perceptual realism. It uses a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet guided by OCR data and a ping-pong scheduler, trained on synthetic data with a frozen SR backbone, achieving substantial OCR gains while maintaining perceptual quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Scene-text SR is critical for OCR in natural scenes, but traditional SR targets (PSNR/SSIM) or general perceptual metrics often ignore character-level readability. Text in complex scenes is underrepresented and treated as texture, leading to poor downstream OCR performance. There is a need for SR methods that explicitly optimize for text legibility alongside perceptual quality.

Method: GLYPH-SR is a diffusion-based framework with a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet (TS-ControlNet) guided by OCR data. It employs a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text-centric and scene-centric guidance. The main SR branch is frozen while trained components are learned on synthetic data. This vision-language guidance aims to restore readable text without sacrificing visual realism.

Result: GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by up to 15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baselines (e.g., SVT x8 with OpenOCR) on SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4 and x8. It also maintains competitive scores on perceptual-quality metrics such as MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates that joint optimization for text readability and perceptual realism is feasible in SR for scene text, delivering SR outputs that are both readable by OCR systems and visually convincing, suitable for practical deployment.

Abstract: Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from
surveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because
recovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable
downstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such
as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable
information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character
recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image
appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion
(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that
are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do
address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,
overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,
scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in
practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for
both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a
vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives
jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by
OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and
scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these
components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen.
Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by
up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR)
while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ. GLYPH-SR is designed
to satisfy both objectives simultaneously-high readability and high visual
realism-delivering SR that looks right and reds right.

### [41] [EEG-Driven Image Reconstruction with Saliency-Guided Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26391)
*Igor Abramov,Ilya Makarov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dual-conditioned diffusion-based framework that fuses EEG embeddings with spatial saliency to guide image generation, improving fidelity and semantic coherence. Uses ATM for EEG feature extraction, LoRA-tuned Stable Diffusion 2.1, and a saliency-conditioned ControlNet on THINGS-EEG, achieving closer alignment with human vision.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods often neglect spatial attention, leading to lower fidelity and semantic inconsistency. Incorporating attentional priors could resolve ambiguities in neural decoding and improve reconstruction quality.

Method: A dual-conditioning pipeline: (1) extract EEG features via Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM); (2) fine-tune Stable Diffusion 2.1 with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to map neural signals to visual semantics; (3) employ a ControlNet branch conditioned on spatial saliency maps to enforce spatial control. Evaluation on THINGS-EEG shows improved low- and high-level feature quality and stronger alignment with human attention.

Result: The approach yields significant improvements in both low- and high-level image features compared to existing EEG-driven methods, with strong correspondence to human visual attention. Attentional priors help resolve EEG ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions and potential medical/neuroadaptive applications.

Conclusion: Attentional priors can markedly improve EEG-based image reconstructions by effectively integrating neural signals with spatial and semantic priors through diffusion-model adaptation, highlighting a promising direction for neural decoding and efficient use of pre-trained generative models.

Abstract: Existing EEG-driven image reconstruction methods often overlook spatial
attention mechanisms, limiting fidelity and semantic coherence. To address
this, we propose a dual-conditioning framework that combines EEG embeddings
with spatial saliency maps to enhance image generation. Our approach leverages
the Adaptive Thinking Mapper (ATM) for EEG feature extraction and fine-tunes
Stable Diffusion 2.1 via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to align neural signals
with visual semantics, while a ControlNet branch conditions generation on
saliency maps for spatial control. Evaluated on THINGS-EEG, our method achieves
a significant improvement in the quality of low- and high-level image features
over existing approaches. Simultaneously, strongly aligning with human visual
attention. The results demonstrate that attentional priors resolve EEG
ambiguities, enabling high-fidelity reconstructions with applications in
medical diagnostics and neuroadaptive interfaces, advancing neural decoding
through efficient adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models.

*Xiangqing Zheng,Chengyue Wu,Kehai Chen,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a dedicated benchmark and multi-dimensional evaluation suite for long-form text-to-video generation (LVG), including new metrics like event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content clarity, and HERD; results show current LVG models master basic visuals but struggle with inter-event consistency and high-level narrative adherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing LVG benchmarks focus on short clips, simplified prompts, and low-level metrics, failing to capture long-form coherence, complex event dynamics, and abstract attributes such as narrative flow and emotional impact.

Method: Construct LoCoT2V-Bench from real-world videos with realistic, complex prompts including scene transitions and event dynamics; develop a multi-dimensional evaluation framework featuring new metrics (event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content clarity, HERD); evaluate nine representative LVG models to assess performance on long-form outputs.

Result: Models perform well on basic visual and temporal aspects but struggle with inter-event consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence.

Conclusion: LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive platform for evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical directions for future method improvement.

Abstract: Recently text-to-video generation has made impressive progress in producing
short, high-quality clips, but evaluating long-form outputs remains a major
challenge especially when processing complex prompts. Existing benchmarks
mostly rely on simplified prompts and focus on low-level metrics, overlooking
fine-grained alignment with prompts and abstract dimensions such as narrative
coherence and thematic expression. To address these gaps, we propose
LoCoT2V-Bench, a benchmark specifically designed for long video generation
(LVG) under complex input conditions. Based on various real-world videos,
LoCoT2V-Bench introduces a suite of realistic and complex prompts incorporating
elements like scene transitions and event dynamics. Moreover, it constructs a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework that includes our newly proposed metrics
such as event-level alignment, fine-grained temporal consistency, content
clarity, and the Human Expectation Realization Degree (HERD) that focuses on
more abstract attributes like narrative flow, emotional response, and character
development. Using this framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
nine representative LVG models, finding that while current methods perform well
on basic visual and temporal aspects, they struggle with inter-event
consistency, fine-grained alignment, and high-level thematic adherence, etc.
Overall, LoCoT2V-Bench provides a comprehensive and reliable platform for
evaluating long-form complex text-to-video generation and highlights critical
directions for future method improvement.

### [43] [A-TPT: Angular Diversity Calibration Properties for Test-Time Prompt Tuning of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26441)
*Shihab Aaqil Ahamed,Udaya S. K. P. Miriya Thanthrige,Ranga Rodrigo,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A-TPT introduces angular diversity into test-time prompt tuning by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular distance between unit-normalized textual features, achieving better calibration for vision-language models during test-time adaptation with maintained accuracy and strong zero-shot/generalization performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing TPT methods focus on average feature dispersion or orthogonality but may fail to ensure strong angular separation among class-wise textual features, risking calibration under distribution shifts.

Method: We propose A-TPT, which optimizes prompts to induce a uniform distribution on the unit hypersphere by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular distance between class-by-class textual features. This angular diversity is achieved via learnable prompts and standard TPT optimization, evaluated across multiple backbones and datasets (including medical data).

Result: A-TPT consistently reduces aggregate average calibration error compared to state-of-the-art TPT methods while preserving accuracy; shows superior zero-shot calibration under natural distribution shifts and generalizes to medical datasets; supported by theoretical analyses.

Conclusion: Promoting angular diversity in textual features via angular-distance optimization yields well-dispersed features and improved calibration for vision-language models during test-time adaptation; code will be released.

Abstract: Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) has emerged as a promising technique for
adapting large vision-language models (VLMs) to unseen tasks without relying on
labeled data. However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt
calibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,
trustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on
improving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature
dispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular
separation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular
separation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the
critical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel
TPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the
distribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable
prompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular
distance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate
average calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through
extensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets. Notably,
our approach exhibits superior zero-shot calibration performance on natural
distribution shifts and generalizes well to medical datasets. We provide
extensive analyses, including theoretical aspects, to establish the grounding
of A-TPT. These results highlight the potency of promoting angular diversity to
achieve well-dispersed textual features, significantly improving VLM
calibration during test-time adaptation. Our code will be made publicly
available.

### [44] [PointSt3R: Point Tracking through 3D Grounded Correspondence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26443)
*Rhodri Guerrier,Adam W. Harley,Dima Damen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Adapts 3D reconstruction models (DUSt3R, MASt3R) for 3D grounded point tracking, achieving competitive performance with static and dynamic correspondences while using limited temporal context and synthetic data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Leverage strong 3D reconstruction priors to improve point tracking across frames, especially for dynamic scenes, and reduce dependence on full temporal context by training on frame pairs that contain the query point.

Method: Fine-tune MASt3R (and compare with DUSt3R) for point tracking by (i) combining reconstruction loss with dynamic correspondence supervision, (ii) adding a visibility head, (iii) training with synthetic data, and (iv) evaluating on frame pairs that include the query point to avoid temporal leakage; mix static and dynamic correspondences across four datasets.

Result: Demonstrates competitive or superior tracking relative to CoTracker2/3 on EgoPoints, RGB-S, TAP-Vid-DAVIS; specific gains include EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2, RGB-S 87.0 vs 82.8; shows 3D point tracking and ablations on training data and dynamic vs static contributions.

Conclusion: Adapting 3D reconstruction models for grounded point tracking is effective, providing strong performance with limited temporal context and synthetic data; ablations clarify contributions from dynamic supervision and reconstruction loss, indicating a viable path for robust 3D point tracking in dynamic scenes.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundational 3D reconstruction models, such as DUSt3R and
MASt3R, have shown great potential in 2D and 3D correspondence in static
scenes. In this paper, we propose to adapt them for the task of point tracking
through 3D grounded correspondence. We first demonstrate that these models are
competitive point trackers when focusing on static points, present in current
point tracking benchmarks ($+33.5\%$ on EgoPoints vs. CoTracker2). We propose
to combine the reconstruction loss with training for dynamic correspondence
along with a visibility head, and fine-tuning MASt3R for point tracking using a
relatively small amount of synthetic data. Importantly, we only train and
evaluate on pairs of frames where one contains the query point, effectively
removing any temporal context. Using a mix of dynamic and static point
correspondences, we achieve competitive or superior point tracking results on
four datasets (e.g. competitive on TAP-Vid-DAVIS 73.8 $\delta_{avg}$ / 85.8\%
occlusion acc. for PointSt3R compared to 75.7 / 88.3\% for CoTracker2; and
significantly outperform CoTracker3 on EgoPoints 61.3 vs 54.2 and RGB-S 87.0 vs
82.8). We also present results on 3D point tracking along with several
ablations on training datasets and percentage of dynamic correspondences.

### [45] [Towards Fine-Grained Vision-Language Alignment for Few-Shot Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26464)
*Yuanting Fan,Jun Liu,Xiaochen Chen,Bin-Bin Gao,Jian Li,Yong Liu,Jinlong Peng,Chengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Introduces MFSC to generate multi-level, fine-grained textual captions for anomaly datasets and a FineGrainedAD framework with MLLP and MLSA to improve few-shot anomaly localization by aligning prompts with region-level cues; shows state-of-the-art results on MVTec-AD and VisA.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current VLM-based FSAD methods rely on coarse image-level descriptions, causing semantic misalignment between patch-level anomalies and text due to lack of detailed, region-specific guidance. There is a need for multi-level, fine-grained captions and better prompt-region alignment to improve localization.

Method: Automatic construction of Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) providing multi-level text descriptions; a framework FineGrainedAD with two components: (1) Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) that injects fine-grained semantics into prompts via automatic replacement and concatenation; (2) Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA) that uses a region aggregation strategy and multi-level alignment training to align prompts with corresponding visual regions.

Result: FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot anomaly localization on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

Conclusion: MFSC and FineGrainedAD effectively mitigate semantic misalignment between text and patch-level anomalies, enhancing localization performance under few-shot settings and highlighting the value of multi-level, fine-grained textual guidance for VLM-based anomaly detection.

Abstract: Few-shot anomaly detection (FSAD) methods identify anomalous regions with few
known normal samples. Most existing methods rely on the generalization ability
of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to recognize potentially anomalous
regions through feature similarity between text descriptions and images.
However, due to the lack of detailed textual descriptions, these methods can
only pre-define image-level descriptions to match each visual patch token to
identify potential anomalous regions, which leads to the semantic misalignment
between image descriptions and patch-level visual anomalies, achieving
sub-optimal localization performance. To address the above issues, we propose
the Multi-Level Fine-Grained Semantic Caption (MFSC) to provide multi-level and
fine-grained textual descriptions for existing anomaly detection datasets with
automatic construction pipeline. Based on the MFSC, we propose a novel
framework named FineGrainedAD to improve anomaly localization performance,
which consists of two components: Multi-Level Learnable Prompt (MLLP) and
Multi-Level Semantic Alignment (MLSA). MLLP introduces fine-grained semantics
into multi-level learnable prompts through automatic replacement and
concatenation mechanism, while MLSA designs region aggregation strategy and
multi-level alignment training to facilitate learnable prompts better align
with corresponding visual regions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
FineGrainedAD achieves superior overall performance in few-shot settings on
MVTec-AD and VisA datasets.

*Pei Peng,MingKun Xie,Hang Hao,Tong Jin,ShengJun Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A causal-inference, counterfactual embedding approach debiases CLIP-style vision-language models against object-context shortcuts, improving zero-shot robustness without retraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Object-context shortcuts cause unreliable predictions when test scenes differ from training co-occurrence patterns; need a method to separate object signals from background context in a model-agnostic way.

Method: Within CLIP representation space, estimate object and background expectations; synthesize counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse contexts from external data, batch neighbors, or text-derived descriptions; compute Total Direct Effect via simulating intervention and subtract background-only activation.

Result: Significant improvements in worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks; achieves new zero-shot state of the art; method is lightweight and does not require retraining or prompt engineering.

Conclusion: Offers a practical, representation-level causal framework for debiased, reliable multimodal reasoning and can be extended to other multimodal models.

Abstract: Object-context shortcuts remain a persistent challenge in vision-language
models, undermining zero-shot reliability when test-time scenes differ from
familiar training co-occurrences. We recast this issue as a causal inference
problem and ask: Would the prediction remain if the object appeared in a
different environment? To answer this at inference time, we estimate object and
background expectations within CLIP's representation space, and synthesize
counterfactual embeddings by recombining object features with diverse
alternative contexts sampled from external datasets, batch neighbors, or
text-derived descriptions. By estimating the Total Direct Effect and simulating
intervention, we further subtract background-only activation, preserving
beneficial object-context interactions while mitigating hallucinated scores.
Without retraining or prompt design, our method substantially improves both
worst-group and average accuracy on context-sensitive benchmarks, establishing
a new zero-shot state of the art. Beyond performance, our framework provides a
lightweight representation-level counterfactual approach, offering a practical
causal avenue for debiased and reliable multimodal reasoning.

### [47] [Counteracting Matthew Effect in Self-Improvement of LVLMs through Head-Tail Re-balancing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26474)
*Xin Guo,Zhiheng Xi,Yiwen Ding,Yitao Zhai,Xiaowei Shi,Xunliang Cai,Tao Gui,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Self-improvement with LVLMs suffers from a Matthew effect: models perform well on easy head data but poorly on hard tail data, causing imbalanced learning. The paper proposes four efficient strategies (distribution-reshaping and trajectory-resampling) to rebalance head-tail during exploration-and-learning, yielding consistent visual reasoning gains (avg +3.86 points) on LVLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the skewed optimization in iterative self-improvement where performance on simple queries dominates and complex reasoning lags, hindering overall progress and scalability.

Method: Four efficient strategies distributed across two perspectives—distribution-reshaping and trajectory-resampling—to rebalance head-tail data during the exploration-and-learning self-improvement loop in LVLMs. This aims to maintain balanced exposure to simple and complex reasoning tasks during self-improvement.

Result: Extensive experiments on Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B across visual reasoning tasks show consistent improvements over vanilla self-improvement, with an average gain of 3.86 points.

Conclusion: The proposed head-tail re-balancing strategies mitigate the Matthew effect, enabling more effective visual reasoning improvement in LVLMs and offering a practical framework to balance self-improvement processes.

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the
reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models
explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we
identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating
high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles
with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced
optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while
hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations,
this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the "Matthew
effect"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to
performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four
efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and
trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the
exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on
Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks
demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning
capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.

*Vinícius Ferraria,Eurico Ruivo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Evaluates a 2D cellular automaton edge detector optimized by meta-heuristics and transfer learning; expanding optimization search space was ineffective; the detector adapts to inputs, and transfer learning offered no clear improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Edge detection is crucial in image processing but detectors struggle with loose edges and contextual understanding. An adaptable detector tailored to image properties could improve performance across diverse image sets.

Method: Developed a two-dimensional cellular automaton-based edge detector optimized via meta-heuristic search; incorporated transfer learning techniques; analyzed impact of expanding the optimization search space; evaluated robustness across natural images and specialized subsets; used various validation approaches.

Result: Expanding the search space during optimization did not improve performance for the chosen image set. The model demonstrated adaptability to inputs across experiments, and transfer learning did not yield significant improvements.

Conclusion: The adaptive detector can adjust to input data, but widening the optimization search space was not beneficial for the evaluated dataset. Transfer learning did not provide notable gains, suggesting that alternative strategies or datasets may be needed for improvements.

Abstract: The edge detection task is essential in image processing aiming to extract
relevant information from an image. One recurring problem in this task is the
weaknesses found in some detectors, such as the difficulty in detecting loose
edges and the lack of context to extract relevant information from specific
problems. To address these weaknesses and adapt the detector to the properties
of an image, an adaptable detector described by two-dimensional cellular
automaton and optimized by meta-heuristic combined with transfer learning
techniques was developed. This study aims to analyze the impact of expanding
the search space of the optimization phase and the robustness of the
adaptability of the detector in identifying edges of a set of natural images
and specialized subsets extracted from the same image set. The results obtained
prove that expanding the search space of the optimization phase was not
effective for the chosen image set. The study also analyzed the adaptability of
the model through a series of experiments and validation techniques and found
that, regardless of the validation, the model was able to adapt to the input
and the transfer learning techniques applied to the model showed no significant
improvements.

TL;DR: Introduces SA2Net, a scale-adaptive structure-aware network for spine segmentation on ultrasound VPI, combining scale-adaptive cross-dimensional features and a structure-affinity Transformer decoder with a feature-mixing loss, achieving state-of-the-art results and backbone flexibility. Code available at GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The task is challenged by insufficient global contextual knowledge due to neglect of high spatial correlations among bone features, and by rich structural knowledge of spine bones (shapes and positions) that should be encoded into segmentation.

Method: A scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn cross-dimensional long-distance correlation features for spinal images; a structure-affinity transformation that applies class-specific affinity to semantic features and is integrated with a Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning; a feature mixing loss aggregation method to improve training robustness and accuracy; backbone-agnostic design to enhance adaptability.

Result: SA2Net achieves superior segmentation performance compared with state-of-the-art methods and shows adaptability to various backbones; the code and demo are available at the provided GitHub URL.

Conclusion: SA2Net is an effective and promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis through intelligent spinal image analysis, offering improved accuracy, robustness, and backbone flexibility.

Abstract: Spine segmentation, based on ultrasound volume projection imaging (VPI),
plays a vital role for intelligent scoliosis diagnosis in clinical
applications. However, this task faces several significant challenges. Firstly,
the global contextual knowledge of spines may not be well-learned if we neglect
the high spatial correlation of different bone features. Secondly, the spine
bones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,
which deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network
(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation. First, we propose a
scale-adaptive complementary strategy to learn the cross-dimensional
long-distance correlation features for spinal images. Second, motivated by the
consistency between multi-head self-attention in Transformers and semantic
level affinity, we propose structure-affinity transformation to transform
semantic features with class-specific affinity and combine it with a
Transformer decoder for structure-aware reasoning. In addition, we adopt a
feature mixing loss aggregation method to enhance model training. This method
improves the robustness and accuracy of the segmentation process. The
experimental results demonstrate that our SA$^{2}$Net achieves superior
segmentation performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
the adaptability of SA$^{2}$Net to various backbones enhances its potential as
a promising tool for advanced scoliosis diagnosis using intelligent spinal
image analysis. The code and experimental demo are available at

TL;DR: Frame-level video clipping for ads via a two-stream audio-visual fusion model, with a new AdSum204 ad dataset; achieves superior frame-selection performance for shorter ads.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Manual clipping of ads into multiple lengths is labor-intensive and time-consuming; there is a need for automated, ad-specific video summarization that leverages audio as a key cue.

Method: Formulates clipping as a shot/frame selection problem and introduces a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts frame importance. Develops AdSum204, a dataset with 102 pairs of 30s and 15s ads. Performs extensive experiments comparing to state-of-the-art summarization methods.

Result: The proposed model outperforms baselines across metrics including Average Precision (AP), Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), Spearman, and Kendall correlations.

Conclusion: Presents a practical, automated framework for ad clipping, highlighting the importance of audio in ad summarization and providing the AdSum204 dataset to support future research.

Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at
varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves
manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter
versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we
introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization
techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection
problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video
summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach
emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we
develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of
video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being
selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific
datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of
30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,
Spearman, and Kendall.

*Manjunath Prasad Holenarasipura Rajiv,B. M. Vidyavathi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A dynamic context-aware scene reasoning framework uses Vision-Language Alignment to achieve zero-shot generalization in real-world scenes by fusing pretrained Vision Transformers with Large Language Models, guided by a dynamic reasoning module; shows up to 18% gains on zero-shot benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world environments are often unfamiliar and unlabeled, making generalization difficult for conventional scene understanding models. There is a need for adaptable, context-aware reasoning that can operate without task-specific training.

Method: Integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align visual semantics with natural language descriptions. Introduces a dynamic reasoning module that combines global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors to refine predictions for zero-shot scenarios.

Result: Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and Open Images show up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy over baselines in complex and unseen environments. The framework also demonstrates robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to vision-language fusion.

Conclusion: Proposes a scalable, interpretable framework for context-aware reasoning that enhances zero-shot generalization in dynamic real-world settings through vision-language alignment and dynamic reasoning.

Abstract: In real-world environments, AI systems often face unfamiliar scenarios
without labeled data, creating a major challenge for conventional scene
understanding models. The inability to generalize across unseen contexts limits
the deployment of vision-based applications in dynamic, unstructured settings.
This work introduces a Dynamic Context-Aware Scene Reasoning framework that
leverages Vision-Language Alignment to address zero-shot real-world scenarios.
The goal is to enable intelligent systems to infer and adapt to new
environments without prior task-specific training. The proposed approach
integrates pre-trained vision transformers and large language models to align
visual semantics with natural language descriptions, enhancing contextual
comprehension. A dynamic reasoning module refines predictions by combining
global scene cues and object-level interactions guided by linguistic priors.
Extensive experiments on zero-shot benchmarks such as COCO, Visual Genome, and
Open Images demonstrate up to 18% improvement in scene understanding accuracy
over baseline models in complex and unseen environments. Results also show
robust performance in ambiguous or cluttered scenes due to the synergistic
fusion of vision and language. This framework offers a scalable and
interpretable approach for context-aware reasoning, advancing zero-shot
generalization in dynamic real-world settings.

### [52] [CATCH: A Modular Cross-domain Adaptive Template with Hook](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26582)
*Xinjin Li,Yulie Lu,Jinghan Cao,Yu Ma,Zhenglin Li,Yeyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A plug-and-play cross-domain adaptation framework (CATCH) for VQA that decouples language and vision adapters and injects them via hooks to improve out-of-domain performance without retraining the backbone.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQA models suffer from distribution shifts when applied to remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams; current domain-specific fine-tuning is costly and not scalable.

Method: Introduce a domain classifier to detect image type; use two lightweight adapters (Prompt Adapter for language, Visual Adapter for vision) injected through a hook interface; no backbone retraining; evaluated across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks.

Result: Consistent performance gains on MathVQA (+2.3 BLEU), MedVQA-RAD (+2.6 VQA), ChartQA (+3.1 ROUGE) and other domain benchmarks; demonstrates scalability and practicality.

Conclusion: CATCH enables scalable, extensible multi-domain VQA by decoupling and modularly adapting language and vision components without modifying the backbone.

Abstract: Recent advances in Visual Question Answering (VQA) have demonstrated
impressive performance in natural image domains, with models like LLaVA
leveraging large language models (LLMs) for open-ended reasoning. However,
their generalization degrades significantly when transferred to out-of-domain
scenarios such as remote sensing, medical imaging, or math diagrams, due to
large distributional shifts and the lack of effective domain adaptation
mechanisms. Existing approaches typically rely on per-domain fine-tuning or
bespoke pipelines, which are costly, inflexible, and not scalable across
diverse tasks. In this paper, we propose CATCH, a plug-and-play framework for
cross-domain adaptation that improves the generalization of VQA models while
requiring minimal changes to their core architecture. Our key idea is to
decouple visual and linguistic adaptation by introducing two lightweight
modules: a domain classifier to identify the input image type, and a dual
adapter mechanism comprising a Prompt Adapter for language modulation and a
Visual Adapter for vision feature adjustment. Both modules are dynamically
injected via a unified hook interface, requiring no retraining of the backbone
model. Experimental results across four domain-specific VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework achieves consistent performance gains without
retraining the backbone model, including +2.3 BLEU on MathVQA, +2.6 VQA on
MedVQA-RAD, and +3.1 ROUGE on ChartQA. These results highlight that CATCH
provides a scalable and extensible approach to multi-domain VQA, enabling
practical deployment across diverse application domains.

TL;DR: Emu3.5 is a large-scale multimodal world model trained on vision-language interleaved data; uses a unified next-token objective; DiDA speeds up inference; demonstrates strong multimodal and world-modeling capabilities; open-sourced.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Aim to build a native, scalable multimodal world model with unified vision-language generation and reasoning capabilities, while ensuring efficient inference for practical use.

Method: End-to-end pretraining on 10+ trillion vision-language interleaved tokens; unified next-token objective; large-scale reinforcement learning fine-tuning; Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA) to convert token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction; open-source release.

Conclusion: Demonstrates scalable, efficient multimodal world-modeling with broad capabilities; DiDA accelerates inference (~20x) without sacrificing performance; open-source to support community research.

Abstract: We introduce Emu3.5, a large-scale multimodal world model that natively
predicts the next state across vision and language. Emu3.5 is pre-trained
end-to-end with a unified next-token prediction objective on a corpus of
vision-language interleaved data containing over 10 trillion tokens, primarily
derived from sequential frames and transcripts of internet videos. The model
naturally accepts interleaved vision-language inputs and generates interleaved
vision-language outputs. Emu3.5 is further post-trained with large-scale
reinforcement learning to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation. To
improve inference efficiency, we propose Discrete Diffusion Adaptation (DiDA),
which converts token-by-token decoding into bidirectional parallel prediction,
accelerating per-image inference by about 20x without sacrificing performance.
Emu3.5 exhibits strong native multimodal capabilities, including long-horizon
vision-language generation, any-to-image (X2I) generation, and complex
text-rich image generation. It also exhibits generalizable world-modeling
abilities, enabling spatiotemporally consistent world exploration and
open-world embodied manipulation across diverse scenarios and tasks. For
comparison, Emu3.5 achieves performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image
(Nano Banana) on image generation and editing tasks and demonstrates superior
results on a suite of interleaved generation tasks. We open-source Emu3.5 at

*Anirban Ray,Vera Galinova,Florian Jug*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ResMatching is a guided conditional flow-matching CSR method that learns data priors for fluorescence microscopy, achieving a favorable fidelity-perception trade-off with calibrated pixel-wise uncertainty.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CSR in fluorescence microscopy is ill-posed; stronger learned data priors from data-driven methods can improve high-frequency reconstruction. Additionally, quantifying uncertainty is valuable for assessing predictions, especially under noisy low-resolution inputs.

Method: Introduce ResMatching, a CSR method based on guided conditional flow matching to learn improved data priors. Evaluate on 4 BioSR structures and compare against 7 baselines, assessing both fidelity and perceptual realism and sampling from the learned posterior.

Result: ResMatching consistently achieves the best trade-off between data fidelity and perceptual realism across tested cases. It is particularly effective when low-resolution images are noisy. It enables sampling from an implicitly learned posterior, with a calibrated distribution that yields pixel-wise uncertainty useful for rejecting uncertain predictions.

Conclusion: ResMatching offers competitive CSR performance while providing calibrated uncertainty estimates, valuable when strong priors are hard to learn or when trustable uncertainty is required for downstream decision-making.

Abstract: Computational Super-Resolution (CSR) in fluorescence microscopy has, despite
being an ill-posed problem, a long history. At its very core, CSR is about
finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph
that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to
reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques,
stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here,
we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow
matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4
diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results
against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results,
demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and
perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly
effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given
low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that
ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior
distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases,
enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can
guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for accurate, scalable, and granular yield estimates to support precision farming and food security; traditional methods lack scalability and granularity.

Method: Fine-tune a pre-trained geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) for a continuous regression task, convert multi-temporal satellite imagery into dense pixel-level yield maps; evaluated on Canadian Prairies dataset; compares to existing DL yield models.

Conclusion: Shows a scalable, actionable approach for on-farm decision-making and detailed monitoring by bridging large-scale Earth observation with field-level needs; potential generalization to other crops and regions.

Abstract: Accurate and timely crop yield prediction is crucial for global food security
and modern agricultural management. Traditional methods often lack the
scalability and granularity required for precision farming. This paper
introduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder
for Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,
intra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,
large-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for
a continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery
into dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from
the Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing
deep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of
fine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By
providing a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more
actionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or
county-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that
bridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm
decision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural
monitoring.

to enhance feature extraction for small objects. Additionally,we design the
Median-Frequency Feature Fusion (MFFF) module,which effectively improves the

Motivation: Knowledge in AV perception is fragmented across multimodal sensing, contextual reasoning, and cooperative intelligence. The paper argues for integrating latest AI paradigms (VLMs/LLMs/Generative AI) to enhance reliable object detection in complex, dynamic driving environments.

Method: Systematic survey of AV sensor suites (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR, Radar) and fusion strategies; structured taxonomy of AV datasets (ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based, cooperative V2V/V2I/V2X/I2I); cross-analysis of data structures; evaluation of detection methodologies from 2D/3D pipelines to hybrid fusion and transformer-driven approaches using ViTs, LLMs, and VLMs; synthesis into a forward-looking roadmap.

Conclusion: Emerging transformer-based and multimodal AI paradigms, especially VLMs and LLMs, integrated with diverse sensor fusion and cooperative data, are central to advancing robust AV perception. The survey maps current capabilities and opens directions for research and development.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation
through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control
systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object
detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in
Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable
progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains
fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative
intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking
analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI
rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically
reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,
and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their
capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their
potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception
frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that
moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,
and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a
cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze
cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to
hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven
approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language
Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey
delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future
opportunities.

*Daniela Martin,Joseph Gallego*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A large-scale benchmark evaluates 48 deep-learning optical flow models on RADARSAT-2 sea ice imagery, achieving sub-kilometer errors against GNSS buoys and providing dense drift fields, showing DL optical flow transfers well to polar SAR data for navigation and climate modeling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Accurate sea ice drift estimates are crucial for Arctic navigation and climate research. Traditional optical flow methods rely on strong motion models and struggle with SAR data and complex Arctic dynamics, necessitating a large-scale evaluation of modern DL optical flow methods in this polar remote-sensing context.

Method: A comprehensive benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models applied to RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery. Models are evaluated against GNSS-tracked buoys using endpoint error (EPE) and Fl metrics. The study assesses accuracy (sub-kilometer EPE) and the ability to produce dense, spatially continuous drift fields and regional drift patterns.

Result: Several models achieve sub-kilometer accuracy (EPE of ~6–8 pixels or 300–400 m). Deep learning optical flow methods capture consistent regional drift patterns and provide dense motion fields across the image, outperforming or matching traditional methods and enabling new applications in navigation and climate modeling.

Conclusion: Deep learning optical flow methods transfer effectively to polar SAR imagery, delivering dense, pixel-wise sea ice drift estimates and offering clear benefits for Arctic navigation and climate research; the benchmark demonstrates the feasibility and value of applying DL-based optical flow to polar remote sensing.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of sea ice drift is critical for Arctic navigation,
climate research, and operational forecasting. While optical flow, a computer
vision technique for estimating pixel wise motion between consecutive images,
has advanced rapidly in computer vision, its applicability to geophysical
problems and to satellite SAR imagery remains underexplored. Classical optical
flow methods rely on mathematical models and strong assumptions about motion,
which limit their accuracy in complex scenarios. Recent deep learning based
approaches have substantially improved performance and are now the standard in
computer vision, motivating their application to sea ice drift estimation. We
present the first large scale benchmark of 48 deep learning optical flow models
on RADARSAT 2 ScanSAR sea ice imagery, evaluated with endpoint error (EPE) and
Fl all metrics against GNSS tracked buoys. Several models achieve sub kilometer
accuracy (EPE 6 to 8 pixels, 300 to 400 m), a small error relative to the
spatial scales of sea ice motion and typical navigation requirements in the
Arctic. Our results demonstrate that the models are capable of capturing
consistent regional drift patterns and that recent deep learning based optical
flow methods, which have substantially improved motion estimation accuracy
compared to classical methods, can be effectively transferred to polar remote
sensing. Optical flow produces spatially continuous drift fields, providing
motion estimates for every image pixel rather than at sparse buoy locations,
offering new opportunities for navigation and climate modeling.

### [59] [Improving Classification of Occluded Objects through Scene Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26681)
*Courtney M. King,Daniel D. Leeds,Damian Lyons,George Kalaitzis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Two scene-aware fusion methods improve occlusion-robust RPN-DCNN detection: a pre-prediction network selector based on background scene and a post-detection score fusion using scene knowledge; trained with mixed occluded/unoccluded data, they outperform baselines and are interpretable/adaptable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Occlusions significantly hinder object recognition. Incorporating scene context can provide complementary cues to disambiguate occluded objects and improve detection accuracy.

Method: 1) Pre-prediction: before making predictions, select a specialized object network conditioned on the identified background scene. 2) Post-detection: after detection, fuse scene knowledge into the initial object scores produced by the RPN to refine predictions. Also compare training strategies and find that training on a mixture of occluded and unoccluded images yields better performance; the approach is interpretable and adaptable to other datasets.

Result: On challenging occlusion-rich datasets, the proposed methods improve both recall and precision over baseline RPN-DCNN methods. The experiments show that training with a mix of occluded and unoccluded images yields superior performance compared to using only one type. The approach is demonstrated to be interpretable and easily adaptable to other datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed scene-based fusion methods offer interpretable, data-adaptive improvements to occlusion robustness in RPN-DCNN object detection and present several avenues for future research and practical deployment.

Abstract: The presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to
typically-powerful object recognition algorithms. Additional sources of
information can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions.
Scene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision. In
this work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal
Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks
through two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one
algorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction,
selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background
scene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into
initial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on
challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall
improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition,
our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion
handling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and
unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is
interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future
directions for research and practical applications.

failures, providing actionable insights for proactive maintenance. This
integrated approach enhances operational reliability, productivity, and
profitability in industrial manufacturing environments.

underlying its appearance modeling and rendering process. Furthermore, we
examine efforts to bring 3DGS to mobile and virtual reality platforms, its

near-instant radiance field reconstruction via feed-forward or distributed
computation. Collectively, these developments illustrate how 3DGS has evolved
from a breakthrough representation into a versatile and foundational tool for
3D vision and graphics.

### [62] [SteerVLM: Robust Model Control through Lightweight Activation Steering for Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26769)
*Anushka Sivakumar,Andrew Zhang,Zaber Hakim,Chris Thomas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SteerVLM introduces a lightweight steering module that controls Vision-Language Models (VLMs) at inference time by modulating activations between language and image context, enabling fine-grained adherence to desired instructions without fine-tuning. It is complemented by VNIA, a multimodal dataset, and it outperforms existing intervention techniques on steering and hallucination benchmarks while keeping a tiny parameter overhead (~0.14% of the VLM size).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address alignment, instruction-following, and hallucination issues in VLMs without changing model weights, by enabling lightweight, dynamic steering that preserves off-target task performance.

Method: A steering module learns latent embeddings from paired prompts encoding target and converse behaviors and dynamically modulates dimension-wise activations across the network's layers, linking language and image contexts. It requires ~0.14% of the original model parameters and does not rely on pre-extracted vectors or manual intervention points.

Result: The approach yields improved steering and reduced hallucinations compared to existing intervention techniques, demonstrating robust control over multimodal outputs via activation engineering and maintaining performance on non-target tasks.

Conclusion: SteerVLM demonstrates that small, learned activation-modulation modules can achieve effective, instruction-aligned control of VLMs without weight updates, and the VNIA dataset supports the evaluation and development of such steering methods.

Abstract: This work introduces SteerVLM, a lightweight steering module designed to
guide Vision-Language Models (VLMs) towards outputs that better adhere to
desired instructions. Our approach learns from the latent embeddings of paired
prompts encoding target and converse behaviors to dynamically adjust
activations connecting the language modality with image context. This allows
for fine-grained, inference-time control over complex output semantics without
modifying model weights while preserving performance on off-target tasks. Our
steering module requires learning parameters equal to 0.14% of the original
VLM's size. Our steering module gains model control through dimension-wise
activation modulation and adaptive steering across layers without requiring
pre-extracted static vectors or manual tuning of intervention points.
Furthermore, we introduce VNIA (Visual Narrative Intent Alignment), a
multimodal dataset specifically created to facilitate the development and
evaluation of VLM steering techniques. Our method outperforms existing
intervention techniques on steering and hallucination mitigation benchmarks for
VLMs and proposes a robust solution for multimodal model control through
activation engineering.

*Valentyna Starodub,Mantas Lukoševičius*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A U-Net–based framework with preprocessing, backbone options, and specialized losses improves multi-class AMD lesion segmentation in RGB fundus images, outperforming ADAM challenge baselines; code released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AMD is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss; RGB fundus imaging is non-invasive and cost-effective; ADAM challenge provides a comprehensive benchmark for AMD lesion segmentation.

Method: Build on U-Net; compare preprocessing, backbone/backbone complexity, and loss functions to address class imbalance; evaluate on multi-class segmentation of AMD lesion types in RGB fundus images; leverage the ADAM dataset; open-source code.

Result: Final model configuration achieves state-of-the-art performance, beating all prior ADAM submissions on multi-class AMD lesion segmentation in RGB images; code publicly available.

Conclusion: The proposed framework advances non-invasive AMD lesion detection and provides reproducible, benchmarked results, with potential for integration into clinical screening pipelines.

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is one of the leading causes of
irreversible vision impairment in people over the age of 60. This research
focuses on semantic segmentation for AMD lesion detection in RGB fundus images,
a non-invasive and cost-effective imaging technique. The results of the ADAM
challenge - the most comprehensive AMD detection from RGB fundus images
research competition and open dataset to date - serve as a benchmark for our
evaluation. Taking the U-Net connectivity as a base of our framework, we
evaluate and compare several approaches to improve the segmentation model's
architecture and training pipeline, including pre-processing techniques,
encoder (backbone) deep network types of varying complexity, and specialized
loss functions to mitigate class imbalances on image and pixel levels. The main
outcome of this research is the final configuration of the AMD detection
framework, which outperforms all the prior ADAM challenge submissions on the
multi-class segmentation of different AMD lesion types in non-invasive RGB
fundus images. The source code used to conduct the experiments presented in
this paper is made freely available.

*Aniruddh Bansal,Davit Soselia,Dang Nguyen,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB) evaluates vision-language models on chart grounding, introducing a JSON-based evaluation template and a two-stage inference workflow to align and compare elements across two charts, revealing perception biases and weaknesses in current models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Charts are ubiquitous in data communication, but vision-language models struggle with fine-grained chart details and cross-chart reasoning, hindering accurate chart grounding and comparison.

Method: Propose ChartAB benchmark with tasks for extracting tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing chart attributes across diverse charts; provide a JSON template to calculate metrics for each task; employ a two-stage inference workflow to align/compare elements across two charts; evaluate several recent VLMs.

Result: Analysis uncovers perception biases, weaknesses, robustness issues, and hallucinations in chart understanding; reveals fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart grounding tasks.

Conclusion: ChartAB exposes current gaps in fine-grained chart grounding and cross-chart reasoning, guiding future improvements and enabling more robust evaluation of VLMs on chart-related tasks.

Abstract: Charts play an important role in visualization, reasoning, data analysis, and
the exchange of ideas among humans. However, existing vision-language models
(VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract
fine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also
hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this
paper, we introduce a novel "ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)" to provide a
comprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting
tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various
attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON
template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically
tailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference
workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and
compare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on
several recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases,
weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These
findings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart
understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened
in current models.

### [65] [HEIR: Learning Graph-Based Motion Hierarchies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26786)
*Cheng Zheng,William Koch,Baiang Li,Felix Heide*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Proposes a general, data-driven hierarchical motion model using graph-based representations and differentiable graph learning to discover parent–child motion relations and local residuals, validated on 1D/2D/3D motion tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hierarchical motion structures are common across vision, graphics, and robotics, but existing methods rely on fixed, manually-defined hierarchies with rigid priors. A flexible, data-driven approach is needed to capture multi-scale dynamics and improve generalization across tasks.

Method: Represent motions as a graph where vertices are elemental motions and edges encode learned parent–child dependencies. Use differentiable graph learning and graph neural networks to infer hierarchical structure and decompose global motions into parent-inherited patterns and local residuals. Evaluate on 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting.

Result: The method reconstructs intrinsic motion hierarchies for 1D and 2D cases and yields more realistic, interpretable deformations than baselines on 3D Gaussian splatting scenes.

Conclusion: A data-driven, adaptable hierarchical modeling framework for motion-centric tasks, applicable across a broad range of domains.

Abstract: Hierarchical structures of motion exist across research fields, including
computer vision, graphics, and robotics, where complex dynamics typically arise
from coordinated interactions among simpler motion components. Existing methods
to model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic
hierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability
across different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion
modeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships
directly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based
hierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into
parent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy
inference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent
elemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies
through graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction
approach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and
dynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show
that our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,
and produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the
baseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,
data-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation
applicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks. Project Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: A comprehensive ViGen-to-MoGen transfer framework with dataset ViMoGen-228K, models ViMoGen and ViMoGen-light, and benchmark MBench, showing improved generalization in 3D motion generation via cross-modal transfer.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoGen generalization remains a bottleneck; ViGen demonstrates strong generalization in modeling human behaviors. The work aims to transfer these transferable insights from ViGen to MoGen across data, modeling, and evaluation.

Method: Data: ViMoGen-228K dataset with 228k samples integrating high-fidelity MoCap, semantically annotated web-motion data, and ViGen-synthesized samples; includes text-motion pairs and text-video-motion triplets. Modeling: ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer with gated multimodal conditioning to unify priors from MoCap and ViGen; ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant removing video-generation dependencies. Evaluation: MBench, a hierarchical benchmark for motion quality, prompt fidelity, and generalization. 

Result: Extensive experiments show the framework significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic metrics and human evaluations. The authors will release code, data, and the benchmark.

Conclusion: Systematic cross-domain transfer from ViGen to MoGen is effective in improving generalization for 3D motion generation. The provided dataset, models, and benchmark offer a foundation for future research and practical deployment, with ViMoGen-light providing efficient, scalable alternatives.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard
benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their
generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most
notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization
in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can
leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework
that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key
pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a
large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that
integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions
from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen
models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion
triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose
ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from
MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance
efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that
eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong
generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed
for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework
significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human
evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.

*Philipp Lindenberger,Paul-Edouard Sarlin,Jan Hosang,Matteo Balice,Marc Pollefeys,Simon Lynen,Eduard Trulls*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hybrid continental-scale geo-localization via proxy-classification prototypes and aerial-ground fusion enabling fine-grained retrieval; achieves ~200m localization for 68% of Europe queries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Precise image geolocation at global scale is computationally challenging and data-sparse; global classification yields coarse results and cross-view methods suffer from domain gaps; need scalable, fine-grained localization across large areas.

Method: Train with a proxy classification task to learn location-encoding prototypes; fuse these prototypes with embeddings from aerial imagery to improve robustness to sparse ground data; enable direct fine-grained retrieval across multi-country regions.

Result: Localizes within 200 meters for 68% of queries on a dataset spanning a large part of Europe; code released publicly.

Conclusion: The approach provides a scalable, effective solution for continent-scale fine-grained geo-localization by leveraging learned prototypes and cross-view aerial-ground representations; demonstrates strong performance and practical applicability.

Abstract: Determining the precise geographic location of an image at a global scale
remains an unsolved challenge. Standard image retrieval techniques are
inefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is
insufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global
classification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while
cross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain
gap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a
hybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large
geographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification
task during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly
encode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with
embeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of
ground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas
spanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our
approach can localize within 200m more than 68\% of queries of a dataset
covering a large part of Europe. The code is publicly available at

*Dongyue Lu,Ao Liang,Tianxin Huang,Xiao Fu,Yuyang Zhao,Baorui Ma,Liang Pan,Wei Yin,Lingdong Kong,Wei Tsang Ooi,Ziwei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEE4D introduces a pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that renders to fixed virtual cameras and uses view-conditioned video inpainting to model 4D scenes from casual videos, separating camera control from scene modeling and enabling coherent, bounded-inference generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The goal is to enable 4D (spatiotemporal) content synthesis from casual, in-the-wild videos without costly 3D supervision or manual pose annotations, and to avoid entanglement between camera motion and scene dynamics.

Method: Replace explicit trajectory prediction with rendering to fixed virtual cameras. Train a view-conditional video inpainting model to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising synthesized warped images and to inpaint missing regions across virtual viewpoints. Use a spatiotemporal autoregressive inference across virtual-camera splines with overlapping windows to extend videos coherently while keeping per-step complexity bounded.

Result: The method achieves superior generalization and improved performance on cross-view video generation and sparse reconstruction benchmarks compared with pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines, according to quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments.

Conclusion: SEE4D advances practical 4D world modeling from casual videos by effectively decoupling camera control from scene modeling, enabling pose-free, robust 4D synthesis and cross-view generation.

Abstract: Immersive applications call for synthesizing spatiotemporal 4D content from
casual videos without costly 3D supervision. Existing video-to-4D methods
typically rely on manually annotated camera poses, which are labor-intensive
and brittle for in-the-wild footage. Recent warp-then-inpaint approaches
mitigate the need for pose labels by warping input frames along a novel camera
trajectory and using an inpainting model to fill missing regions, thereby
depicting the 4D scene from diverse viewpoints. However, this
trajectory-to-trajectory formulation often entangles camera motion with scene
dynamics and complicates both modeling and inference. We introduce SEE4D, a
pose-free, trajectory-to-camera framework that replaces explicit trajectory
prediction with rendering to a bank of fixed virtual cameras, thereby
separating camera control from scene modeling. A view-conditional video
inpainting model is trained to learn a robust geometry prior by denoising
realistically synthesized warped images and to inpaint occluded or missing
regions across virtual viewpoints, eliminating the need for explicit 3D
annotations. Building on this inpainting core, we design a spatiotemporal
autoregressive inference pipeline that traverses virtual-camera splines and
extends videos with overlapping windows, enabling coherent generation at
bounded per-step complexity. We validate See4D on cross-view video generation
and sparse reconstruction benchmarks. Across quantitative metrics and
qualitative assessments, our method achieves superior generalization and
improved performance relative to pose- or trajectory-conditioned baselines,
advancing practical 4D world modeling from casual videos.

*Chao Feng,Zihao Wei,Andrew Owens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Masked diffusion captioning (MDC) learns visual features by training an image-conditioned masked diffusion language model to reconstruct captions from masked text tokens; yields competitive features without relying on token-position signals.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce dependence on token-position cues and heavy auxiliary objectives in visual representation learning; leverage diffusion-based language modeling to learn robust image features transferable to downstream tasks.

Method: Train an image-conditioned masked diffusion language model: for each image-caption pair, randomly mask a ratio of text tokens; train a decoder conditioned on visual features to reconstruct the original caption; after training, use the learned visual features for downstream tasks; no autoregressive dependencies needed for the learning signal.

Result: Linear probing across academic-scale models and datasets shows MDC features are competitive with autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

Conclusion: MDC offers a simple, strong alternative for learning visual representations via masked diffusion captioning, balancing signal strength and training simplicity, and reducing reliance on token position or extra objectives.

Abstract: We learn visual features by captioning images with an image-conditioned
masked diffusion language model, a formulation we call masked diffusion
captioning (MDC). During training, text tokens in each image-caption pair are
masked at a randomly chosen ratio, and a decoder conditioned on visual features
is trained to reconstruct the original text. After training, the learned visual
features can be applied to downstream vision tasks. Unlike autoregressive
captioning, the strength of the visual learning signal in MDC does not depend
on each token's position in the sequence, reducing the need for auxiliary
objectives. Linear probing experiments across a variety of academic-scale
models and datasets show that the learned visual features are competitive with
those produced by autoregressive and contrastive approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniX is a unified framework that reuses 2D generative priors via cross-modal adapters to enable panoramic perception, generation, and completion for graphics-ready 3D scenes; it introduces a synthetic panorama dataset and demonstrates strong results in perception and 3D scene generation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need to generate immersive, physically based renderable (PBR) 3D scenes. Although panorama-based 2D lifting leverages powerful 2D priors, existing methods mostly focus on appearance and neglect intrinsic properties, limiting graphics readiness. A unified approach that leverages 2D priors for panoramic perception and graphics-ready 3D scene generation is desirable.

Method: Introduce OmniX, a lightweight cross-modal adapter framework that reuses 2D generative priors for a broad range of panoramic vision tasks (perception, generation, completion). Build a large-scale synthetic panorama dataset with high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse indoor/outdoor scenes. Train and evaluate on panoramic perception and graphics-ready 3D scene generation tasks.

Result: Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of OmniX in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene generation, enabling immersive and physically realistic virtual world generation via PBR materials, relighting, and simulation.

Conclusion: OmniX provides a versatile, unified solution for panoramic vision tasks and 3D scene generation, broadening the scope of panoramic priors to graphics-ready outputs and opening new possibilities for realistic virtual worlds.

Abstract: There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.

*Ziyu Guo,Xinyan Chen,Renrui Zhang,Ruichuan An,Yu Qi,Dongzhi Jiang,Xiangtai Li,Manyuan Zhang,Hongsheng Li,Pheng-Ann Heng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video generation models, including Veo-3, show some zero-shot reasoning tendencies but fall short for long-horizon, abstract, and geometric reasoning; a new benchmark (MME-CoF) and evaluation across 12 dimensions reveal strengths in short-horizon spatial grounding but limitations in causal reasoning, geometric constraints, and abstract logic; conclusions: not ready as standalone zero-shot reasoners but potentially useful as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To answer whether state-of-the-art video models can serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging visual reasoning tasks, given their high-fidelity videos and emerging perceptual capabilities.

Method: Empirical study of Veo-3 across 12 reasoning dimensions (spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, embodied). Curated MME-CoF as a compact benchmark to evaluate Chain-of-Frame reasoning.

Result: Veo-3 demonstrates promising patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and locally consistent dynamics, but struggles with long-horizon causal reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic.

Conclusion: Current video models are not yet reliable zero-shot reasoners on their own but can serve as complementary visual engines when paired with dedicated reasoning models.

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent
videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond
realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual
perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still
remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging
visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to
comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular
Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including
spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically
characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study,
we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables
in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our
findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning
patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and
locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal
reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are
not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging
signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

### [72] [Debate2Create: Robot Co-design via Large Language Model Debates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25850)
*Kevin Qiu,Marek Cygan*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LLM-driven multi-agent debate co-designs robot morphology and control rewards, yielding diverse morphologies and a 73% improvement on quadruped locomotion.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Automating co-design of a robot’s morphology and control is hard due to vast design space and tight body–behavior coupling; existing methods struggle to scale and coordinate morphology with control policies.

Method: D2C lets two LLM agents (design and control) in a structured debate propose morphology changes and reward functions, respectively. A panel of judges evaluates design–control pairs in simulation and provides feedback to guide subsequent rounds. Iterative debates refine proposals, yielding diverse, specialized morphologies without explicit diversity objectives.

Result: On a quadruped locomotion benchmark, D2C discovers designs that travel 73% farther than the default. The framework produces diverse, specialized morphologies and demonstrates that structured LLM-based debate can drive emergent robot co-design.

Conclusion: Multi-agent debate coupled with physics-grounded feedback is a promising paradigm for automated robot design, capable of generating diverse designs and substantial performance gains.

Abstract: Automating the co-design of a robot's morphology and control is a
long-standing challenge due to the vast design space and the tight coupling
between body and behavior. We introduce Debate2Create (D2C), a framework in
which large language model (LLM) agents engage in a structured dialectical
debate to jointly optimize a robot's design and its reward function. In each
round, a design agent proposes targeted morphological modifications, and a
control agent devises a reward function tailored to exploit the new design. A
panel of pluralistic judges then evaluates the design-control pair in
simulation and provides feedback that guides the next round of debate. Through
iterative debates, the agents progressively refine their proposals, producing
increasingly effective robot designs. Notably, D2C yields diverse and
specialized morphologies despite no explicit diversity objective. On a
quadruped locomotion benchmark, D2C discovers designs that travel 73% farther
than the default, demonstrating that structured LLM-based debate can serve as a
powerful mechanism for emergent robot co-design. Our results suggest that
multi-agent debate, when coupled with physics-grounded feedback, is a promising
new paradigm for automated robot design.

### [73] [Risk-Aware Safety Filters with Poisson Safety Functions and Laplace Guidance Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25913)
*Gilbert Bahati,Ryan M. Bena,Meg Wilkinson,Pol Mestres,Ryan K. Cosner,Aaron D. Ames*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Introduces a risk-aware safety filter for robotic navigation using Poisson-based safety function and Laplace-guided risk fields; solves Dirichlet problems to create a safety constraint that prioritizes avoiding high-risk obstacles, demonstrated in simulation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots operating in real-world environments need semantic understanding to act safely. Existing methods may not explicitly incorporate varying obstacle risk into safety guarantees. The work proposes a mathematical framework to produce risk-aware safety filters with safety guarantees.

Method: Two-step approach: (1) solve a Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation to generate a safety function whose 0-superlevel set encodes safety; (2) solve a Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation to synthesize a safe guidance field with tunable flux boundary conditions that encode varying caution around obstacles. The safety function and guidance fields are combined into a safety constraint to synthesize a risk-aware safety filter, which uses semantic risk levels of environmental features to prioritize avoidance of higher-risk obstacles.

Result: Demonstrated in simulation. The authors discuss how a priori understandings of obstacle risk can be incorporated into the safety filter to yield safe, risk-aware behaviors.

Conclusion: The framework provides safety guarantees while prioritizing avoidance of higher-risk obstacles and offers a means to integrate prior risk knowledge into controller synthesis for safe navigation.

Abstract: Robotic systems navigating in real-world settings require a semantic
understanding of their environment to properly determine safe actions. This
work aims to develop the mathematical underpinnings of such a representation --
specifically, the goal is to develop safety filters that are risk-aware. To
this end, we take a two step approach: encoding an understanding of the
environment via Poisson's equation, and associated risk via Laplace guidance
fields. That is, we first solve a Dirichlet problem for Poisson's equation to
generate a safety function that encodes system safety as its 0-superlevel set.
We then separately solve a Dirichlet problem for Laplace's equation to
synthesize a safe \textit{guidance field} that encodes variable levels of
caution around obstacles -- by enforcing a tunable flux boundary condition. The
safety function and guidance fields are then combined to define a safety
constraint and used to synthesize a risk-aware safety filter which, given a
semantic understanding of an environment with associated risk levels of
environmental features, guarantees safety while prioritizing avoidance of
higher risk obstacles. We demonstrate this method in simulation and discuss how
\textit{a priori} understandings of obstacle risk can be directly incorporated
into the safety filter to generate safe behaviors that are risk-aware.

*Luoyan Zhong,Heather Jin Hee Kim,Dylan P. Losey,Cara M. Nunez*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Calibrating resistive tactile sensors for curved surfaces using curvature-aware calibration and a neural network to predict local curvature; improves force estimation reliability on curved geometries.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Most tactile sensors are calibrated on flat substrates; their accuracy degrades on curved geometries, limiting reliability in real-world applications.

Method: Develop a curvature-aware calibration model for a resistive tactile sensor; train a multilayer perceptron to predict local curvature from baseline, unloaded sensor outputs; validate with five objects across curvatures under 2–8 N loads.

Result: Curvature-aware calibration maintains consistent force accuracy across curved surfaces; flat-surface calibration underestimates force with increasing curvature; curvature predictor achieves R2 = 0.91.

Conclusion: Curvature-aware modeling enhances accuracy, consistency, and reliability of flexible tactile sensors for real-world curved interfaces.

Abstract: Flexible tactile sensors are increasingly used in real-world applications
such as robotic grippers, prosthetic hands, wearable gloves, and assistive
devices, where they need to conform to curved and irregular surfaces. However,
most existing tactile sensors are calibrated only on flat substrates, and their
accuracy and consistency degrade once mounted on curved geometries. This
limitation restricts their reliability in practical use. To address this
challenge, we develop a calibration model for a widely used resistive tactile
sensor design that enables accurate force estimation on one-dimensional curved
surfaces. We then train a neural network (a multilayer perceptron) to predict
local curvature from baseline sensor outputs recorded under no applied load,
achieving an R2 score of 0.91. The proposed approach is validated on five daily
objects with varying curvatures under forces from 2 N to 8 N. Results show that
the curvature-aware calibration maintains consistent force accuracy across all
surfaces, while flat-surface calibration underestimates force as curvature

### [75] [A New Type of Axis-Angle Attitude Control Law for Rotational Systems: Synthesis, Analysis, and Experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25985)
*Francisco M. F. R. Gonçalves,Ryan M. Bena,Néstor O. Pérez-Arancibia*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A novel axis-angle-based attitude control law guarantees a unique closed-loop attitude-error quaternion equilibrium and uniform asymptotic stability, outperforming quaternion-based controllers in stabilization time, validated by simulations and real-time quadrotor tests.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quaternion-based attitude controls can fail to enforce a unique closed-loop equilibrium and lose proportional effectiveness for large attitude errors; an axis-angle approach can exploit attitude-error Euler axis-angle information to ensure a unique CL equilibrium and allow more flexible control gains, with theoretical and experimental validation.

Method: Develop two axis-angle-based attitude control laws; construct a strict Lyapunov function for closed-loop dynamics; prove the closed-loop system has a unique equilibrium that is uniformly asymptotically stable; provide two examples and verify through simulations and real-time tumble-recovery maneuvers on a small quadrotor.

Result: Theoretical: unique CL equilibrium and uniform asymptotic stability. Empirical: numerical simulations and dozens of real-time tumble-recovery maneuvers demonstrating faster stabilization time than a high-performance quaternion-based controller.

Conclusion: Axis-angle-based attitude control effectively enforces a unique closed-loop equilibrium and achieves faster stabilization, supported by both simulations and flight tests.

Abstract: Over the past few decades, continuous quaternion-based attitude control has
been proven highly effective for driving rotational systems that can be modeled
as rigid bodies, such as satellites and drones. However, methods rooted in this
approach do not enforce the existence of a unique closed-loop (CL) equilibrium
attitude-error quaternion (AEQ); and, for rotational errors about the
attitude-error Euler axis larger than {\pi}rad, their proportional-control
effect diminishes as the system state moves away from the stable equilibrium of
the CL rotational dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a new type of attitude
control law that more effectively leverages the attitude-error Euler axis-angle
information to guarantee a unique CL equilibrium AEQ and to provide greater
flexibility in the use of proportional-control efforts. Furthermore, using two
different control laws as examples-through the construction of a strict
Lyapunov function for the CL dynamics-we demonstrate that the resulting unique
equilibrium of the CL rotational system can be enforced to be uniformly
asymptotically stable. To assess and demonstrate the functionality and
performance of the proposed approach, we performed numerical simulations and
executed dozens of real-time tumble-recovery maneuvers using a small quadrotor.
These simulations and flight tests compellingly demonstrate that the proposed
axis-angle-based method achieves superior flight performance-compared with that
obtained using a high-performance quaternion-based controller-in terms of
stabilization time.

*Bai Li,Achilleas Kourtellis,Rong Cao,Joseph Post,Brian Porter,Yu Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DARTS is a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic incident detection system that achieves high accuracy and enables rapid verification and congestion monitoring, offering scalable, cost-effective deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional detection methods rely on dense infrastructure and patrols, struggle with shifting hotspots and limited adaptability; need for flexible, scalable, and fast incident detection with privacy considerations.

Method: Integrates drone mobility and aerial view, thermal imaging for low-visibility and privacy, and lightweight deep learning to extract vehicle trajectories and detect incidents; web-based interface for online verification, severity assessment, and congestion propagation monitoring; field testing on I-75, Florida.

Result: Achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected dataset; detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the TMC; demonstrated monitoring of congestion propagation; suggests faster emergency response and proactive traffic control; scalable deployment with reduced patrol dependence.

Conclusion: DARTS offers a flexible, integrated, and potentially scalable solution for real-time traffic incident detection with operational benefits in efficiency and responsiveness, particularly in remote or resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: Rapid and reliable incident detection is critical for reducing crash-related
fatalities, injuries, and congestion. However, conventional methods, such as
closed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection,
separate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and
require dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting
adaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these
challenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic
incident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial
perspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better
low-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep
learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident
detection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected
dataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity
assessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a
web-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS
detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local
transportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion
propagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and
enable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk.
Crucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on
frequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and
cost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings.
This study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated
real-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for
the operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation
management.

*Petr Stibinger,Tomas Baca,Daniela Doubravova,Jan Rusnak,Jaroslav Solc,Jan Jakubek,Petr Stepan,Martin Saska*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Cooperative micro aerial vehicles with a lightweight single-detector Compton camera enable real-time localization of radioactive sources by fusing detector measurements onboard and guiding swarm motion for rapid search and tracking.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for fast, robust localization of dispersed or moving radioactive sources using miniature, agile platforms. A tiny, sensitive detector on MAVs paired with swarm cooperation promises improved information gain and rapid target localization.

Method: Onboard processing that fuses Compton camera measurements to estimate the radiation source position in real time from sparse data; dynamic feedback to control MAV motion; tightly coordinated swarm to maximize information gain and enable tracking of moving sources.

Result: Proposes a feasible framework for real-time source localization with sparse measurements and onboard computation, demonstrating rapid localization and tracking capability via cooperative MAVs; concrete empirical results are not provided in the abstract.

Conclusion: The approach offers a promising route for rapid, cooperative radiation source localization using lightweight detectors on MAV swarms, but requires thorough validation, robust data fusion under sparse measurements, and consideration of safety and environmental factors in real-world deployment.

Abstract: We present a novel approach to localizing radioactive material by cooperating
Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Our approach utilizes a state-of-the-art
single-detector Compton camera as a highly sensitive, yet miniature detector of
ionizing radiation. The detector's exceptionally low weight (40 g) opens up new
possibilities of radiation detection by a team of cooperating agile MAVs. We
propose a new fundamental concept of fusing the Compton camera measurements to
estimate the position of the radiation source in real time even from extremely
sparse measurements. The data readout and processing are performed directly
onboard and the results are used in a dynamic feedback to drive the motion of
the vehicles. The MAVs are stabilized in a tightly cooperating swarm to
maximize the information gained by the Compton cameras, rapidly locate the
radiation source, and even track a moving radiation source.

*Emily Steiner,Daniel van der Spuy,Futian Zhou,Afereti Pama,Minas Liarokapis,Henry Williams*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A learning-based racing agent trained against opponents enables reliable overtaking on F1Tenth, achieving 87% overtakes in real and simulated racing, outperforming a race-only baseline.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome limitations in autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing, particularly reliable overtaking in real-world driving scenarios.

Method: Train a racing and overtaking agent on the F1Tenth platform; evaluate in both simulation and real-world settings with opponents using diverse competitive algorithms; compare overtaking performance.

Result: Agent achieves an 87% overtaking rate versus 56% for an agent trained only to race, demonstrating that opponent-aware training improves overtaking behavior.

Conclusion: Opponent-aware training enhances overtaking capabilities and demonstrates effective sim-to-real transfer on standardized hardware; multi-agent training is beneficial for autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing.

Abstract: While autonomous racing performance in Time-Trial scenarios has seen
significant progress and development, autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing and
overtaking are still severely limited. These limitations are particularly
apparent in real-life driving scenarios where state-of-the-art algorithms
struggle to safely or reliably complete overtaking manoeuvres. This is
important, as reliable navigation around other vehicles is vital for safe
autonomous wheel-to-wheel racing. The F1Tenth Competition provides a useful
opportunity for developing wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms on a standardised
physical platform. The competition format makes it possible to evaluate
overtaking and wheel-to-wheel racing algorithms against the state-of-the-art.
This research presents a novel racing and overtaking agent capable of learning
to reliably navigate a track and overtake opponents in both simulation and
reality. The agent was deployed on an F1Tenth vehicle and competed against
opponents running varying competitive algorithms in the real world. The results
demonstrate that the agent's training against opponents enables deliberate
overtaking behaviours with an overtaking rate of 87% compared 56% for an agent
trained just to race.

### [79] [Morphology-Aware Graph Reinforcement Learning for Tensegrity Robot Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26067)
*Chi Zhang,Mingrui Li,Wenzhe Tong,Xiaonan Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A morphology-aware reinforcement learning framework using a graph neural network (GNN) within Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) for tensegrity robots, achieving faster, more robust learning and successful sim-to-real transfer without fine-tuning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tensegrity robots exhibit highly coupled, underactuated dynamics due to rigid bars and elastic cables. Traditional MLP policies struggle to capture structural dependencies, leading to inefficient learning and fragile sim-to-real transfer. Incorporating structural priors via a GNN can better model inter-component couplings and improve control.

Method: Represent the robot's physical topology as a graph and integrate a graph neural network into the SAC policy to learn morphology-aware control. Train in simulation on a 3-bar tensegrity robot across three locomotion primitives (e.g., straight-line tracking and bidirectional turning) and compare against an MLP baseline. Validate by transferring the learned policy to hardware without fine-tuning.

Result: The GNN-SAC policy achieves superior sample efficiency, robustness to noise and stiffness variations, and improved trajectory accuracy compared to MLP policies. The learned policies transfer directly from simulation to hardware, yielding stable real-world locomotion without any fine-tuning.

Conclusion: Incorporating structural priors via a graph-based policy within reinforcement learning enhances control for tensegrity robots, enabling faster learning, robustness, and reliable sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: Tensegrity robots combine rigid rods and elastic cables, offering high
resilience and deployability but posing major challenges for locomotion control
due to their underactuated and highly coupled dynamics. This paper introduces a
morphology-aware reinforcement learning framework that integrates a graph
neural network (GNN) into the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm. By
representing the robot's physical topology as a graph, the proposed GNN-based
policy captures coupling among components, enabling faster and more stable
learning than conventional multilayer perceptron (MLP) policies. The method is
validated on a physical 3-bar tensegrity robot across three locomotion
primitives, including straight-line tracking and bidirectional turning. It
shows superior sample efficiency, robustness to noise and stiffness variations,
and improved trajectory accuracy. Notably, the learned policies transfer
directly from simulation to hardware without fine-tuning, achieving stable
real-world locomotion. These results demonstrate the advantages of
incorporating structural priors into reinforcement learning for tensegrity
robot control.

*Fan Yang,Renkai Ma,Yaxin Hu,Michael Rodgers,Lingyao Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: The study argues that responsibility for a child’s emotional harm from a social robot’s discontinuation is shared among the robot company, parents, developers, and government, with attributions shaped by ideology and parental status, and it proposes a framework plus design/policy guidance to mitigate harm.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand who bears accountability for the emotional harm to children when a social robot service ends, and to inform design and policy to safeguard child-robot bonds.

Method: Qualitative study of 72 U.S. participants, using the Moxie shutdown as a case study to examine perceptions of responsibility, continuity, and governance.

Result: Accountability is distributed as a shared duty among multiple actors; views on continued service are highly polarized; attributions vary with political ideology and whether participants have children; participants propose technical, financial, and governmental pathways for continuity while opponents cite business realities and risks of unhealthy dependency.

Conclusion: Provides an empirically grounded shared responsibility framework for safeguarding child-robot companionship, detailing how accountability is distributed and contested, and offering concrete design and policy implications to mitigate emotional harm from robot discontinuation.

Abstract: Social robots like Moxie are designed to form strong emotional bonds with
children, but their abrupt discontinuation can cause significant struggles and
distress to children. When these services end, the resulting harm raises
complex questions of who bears responsibility when children's emotional bonds
are broken. Using the Moxie shutdown as a case study through a qualitative
survey of 72 U.S. participants, our findings show that the responsibility is
viewed as a shared duty across the robot company, parents, developers, and
government. However, these attributions varied by political ideology and
parental status of whether they have children. Participants' perceptions of
whether the robot service should continue are highly polarized; supporters
propose technical, financial, and governmental pathways for continuity, while
opponents cite business realities and risks of unhealthy emotional dependency.
Ultimately, this research contributes an empirically grounded shared
responsibility framework for safeguarding child-robot companionship by
detailing how accountability is distributed and contested, informing concrete
design and policy implications to mitigate the emotional harm of robot
discontinuation.

*Fan Yang,Lingyao Li,Yaxin Hu,Michael Rodgers,Renkai Ma*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Moderate anthropomorphism triggers strongest protective/moral responses to robot abuse; uncanny valley correlates with heightened anger and moral condemnation, influencing design and policy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how different levels of anthropomorphism shape moral and protective responses to robot abuse, extending CASA and uncanny valley to moral judgments.

Method: Experimental study with 201 participants, three robot morphologies (Spider low, Two-Foot moderate, Humanoid high); triangulated data: self-report emotions/uncanniness, automated facial expression analysis, and qualitative reflections.

Result: Protection reactions are nonlinear: Two-Foot elicits strongest physiological anger; self-reported anger and guilt higher for Two-Foot and Humanoid vs Spider; qualitative shift from technical property-damage judgments to condemnation of abuser's character; governance proposals broaden to quasi-animal rights and broader societal responsibility.

Conclusion: The uncanny valley amplifies protective/moral concern rather than dampening it; findings have implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks.

Abstract: Robots with anthropomorphic features are increasingly shaping how humans
perceive and morally engage with them. Our research investigates how different
levels of anthropomorphism influence protective responses to robot abuse,
extending the Computers as Social Actors (CASA) and uncanny valley theories
into a moral domain. In an experiment, we invite 201 participants to view
videos depicting abuse toward a robot with low (Spider), moderate (Two-Foot),
or high (Humanoid) anthropomorphism. To provide a comprehensive analysis, we
triangulate three modalities: self-report surveys measuring emotions and
uncanniness, physiological data from automated facial expression analysis, and
qualitative reflections. Findings indicate that protective responses are not
linear. The moderately anthropomorphic Two-Foot robot, rated highest in
eeriness and "spine-tingling" sensations consistent with the uncanny valley,
elicited the strongest physiological anger expressions. Self-reported anger and
guilt are significantly higher for both the Two-Foot and Humanoid robots
compared to the Spider. Qualitative findings further reveal that as
anthropomorphism increases, moral reasoning shifts from technical assessments
of property damage to condemnation of the abuser's character, while governance
proposals expand from property law to calls for quasi-animal rights and broader
societal responsibility. These results suggest that the uncanny valley does not
dampen moral concern but paradoxically heightens protective impulses, offering
critical implications for robot design, policy, and future legal frameworks.

*Nestor O. Perez-Arancibia*

TL;DR: Co-design of physical structure and control enables embodied intelligence (EI) in microrobots, yielding intelligent locomotion through morphology-environment interactions, as a robust alternative to decoupled architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate EI as a design principle for mm-to-cm scale robotics and show how integrating body, material properties, and control can produce intelligent behavior.

Method: Conceptual framework supported by examples from AMSL robots (Bee++, RoBeetle, SMALLBug, SMARTI, WaterStrider, VLEIBot+, FRISSHBot) to compare EI-inspired, co-designed systems with traditional decoupled sensing, computation, and actuation; emphasizes feedback, sensing, decision logic, and smart actuation embedded in physical properties.

Result: Intelligent behavior emerges from the robot’s structural dynamics and physical interactions with its environment; co-design enables EI and offers a scalable, robust alternative to classical control for mm-to-cm robotics.

Conclusion: Co-design is not only empirical optimization under constraints but a fundamental enabler of EI, providing a scalable and robust framework for robotics at the mm-to-cm scale.

Abstract: The term embodied intelligence (EI) conveys the notion that body morphology,
material properties, interaction with the environment, and control strategies
can be purposefully integrated into the process of robotic design to generate
intelligent behavior; in particular, locomotion and navigation. In this paper,
we discuss EI as a design principle for advanced microrobotics, with a
particular focus on co-design -- the simultaneous and interdependent
development of physical structure and behavioral function. To illustrate the
contrast between EI-inspired systems and traditional architectures that
decouple sensing, computation, and actuation, we present and discuss a
collection of robots developed by the author and his team at the Autonomous
Microrobotic Systems Laboratory (AMSL). These robots exhibit intelligent
behavior that emerges from their structural dynamics and the physical
interaction between their components and with the environment. Platforms such
as the Bee++, RoBeetle, SMALLBug, SMARTI, WaterStrider, VLEIBot+, and FRISSHBot
exemplify how feedback loops, decision logics, sensing mechanisms, and smart
actuation strategies can be embedded into the physical properties of the
robotic system itself. Along these lines, we contend that co-design is not only
a method for empirical optimization under constraints, but also an enabler of
EI, offering a scalable and robust alternative to classical control for
robotics at the mm-to-cm-scale.

*Minseo Kwon,Young J. Kim*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A kinodynamic TAMP framework using a hybrid symbolic-numeric state representation, guided by a visual language model, improves planning success and reduces planning time in long-horizon tasks by integrating geometry, dynamics, and perception, outperforming traditional and LLM-based planners.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Long-horizon TAMP is costly due to excessive motion sampling, and LLMs lack 3D spatial reasoning and guarantees of geometric/dynamic feasibility; there is a need to tightly couple task-level planning with motion/dynamics and perceptual guidance.

Method: A hybrid state tree uniformly representing symbolic and numeric states for joint task and motion decisions. Kinodynamic constraints are verified by an off-the-shelf motion planner and physics simulator. A vision-language model (VLM) guides exploration of the TAMP solution and backtracks based on visual renderings of states.

Result: Experiments show substantial improvements: average success rates increase by 32.14% to 1166.67% over traditional and LLM-based TAMP planners, and planning time is reduced on complex problems. Ablations indicate the VLM guidance is a key contributor to performance.

Conclusion: The proposed kinodynamic TAMP with a hybrid state representation and VLM-guided search effectively couples task planning, motion constraints, and perception, improving feasibility and efficiency in both simulated and real-world domains.

Abstract: Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) integrates high-level task planning with
low-level motion feasibility, but existing methods are costly in long-horizon
problems due to excessive motion sampling. While LLMs provide commonsense
priors, they lack 3D spatial reasoning and cannot ensure geometric or dynamic
feasibility. We propose a kinodynamic TAMP framework based on a hybrid state
tree that uniformly represents symbolic and numeric states during planning,
enabling task and motion decisions to be jointly decided. Kinodynamic
constraints embedded in the TAMP problem are verified by an off-the-shelf
motion planner and physics simulator, and a VLM guides exploring a TAMP
solution and backtracks the search based on visual rendering of the states.
Experiments on the simulated domains and in the real world show 32.14% -
1166.67% increased average success rates compared to traditional and LLM-based
TAMP planners and reduced planning time on complex problems, with ablations
further highlighting the benefits of VLM guidance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Adaptive trajectory refinement with two-stage safety checks improves planning safety and speed in cluttered environments, enabling safe passage through narrow passages.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Trajectories in cluttered environments with narrow passages are challenging; conventional planners fail or yield suboptimal paths, necessitating a safe and efficient method.

Method: Two-stage approach: (1) segment-wise conservative collision test with recursive subdivision to prune risky path segments; (2) pose correction using penetration direction and line search to ensure each pose is collision-free and maximally clear from obstacles.

Result: Simulation shows up to 1.69x higher success rates and up to 3.79x faster planning times than state-of-the-art methods; real-world experiments confirm safe passage through narrow passages with rapid planning.

Conclusion: The adaptive trajectory refinement method enhances safety and planning efficiency in cluttered environments, particularly for narrow passages, by integrating segment-level safety checks with pose-level corrections.

Abstract: Trajectory planning for mobile robots in cluttered environments remains a
major challenge due to narrow passages, where conventional methods often fail
or generate suboptimal paths. To address this issue, we propose the adaptive
trajectory refinement algorithm, which consists of two main stages. First, to
ensure safety at the path-segment level, a segment-wise conservative collision
test is applied, where risk-prone trajectory path segments are recursively
subdivided until collision risks are eliminated. Second, to guarantee
pose-level safety, pose correction based on penetration direction and line
search is applied, ensuring that each pose in the trajectory is collision-free
and maximally clear from obstacles. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 1.69x higher success rates and up to 3.79x
faster planning times than state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, real-world
experiments confirm that the robot can safely pass through narrow passages
while maintaining rapid planning performance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A monocular self-localization system on 3D maps combines CNNs with Vision Transformer to better handle dynamic obstacles, achieving ~7.5 cm average localization error and outperforming SOTA on public datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN-based local feature extraction struggles in dynamic environments where moving objects disrupt local cues. Incorporating Vision Transformer's global patch relationships provides robustness by capturing global context.

Method: A hybrid architecture that fuses CNN-based local feature extraction with Vision Transformer-based global context for monocular 3D-map self-localization. Evaluated on CG datasets with dynamic obstacles and public datasets, comparing against state-of-the-art methods.

Result: On CG datasets with dynamic obstacles, the accuracy improvement relative to SOTA is 1.5x higher than when dynamic obstacles are absent. The self-localization error on public datasets is 20.1% smaller than SOTA. The robot achieves an average localization error of 7.51 cm, which is more accurate than SOTA.

Conclusion: The CNN+Vision Transformer approach enhances robustness and accuracy for monocular 3D-map self-localization, particularly in dynamic environments, and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Self-localization on a 3D map by using an inexpensive monocular camera is
required to realize autonomous driving. Self-localization based on a camera
often uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can extract local features
that are calculated by nearby pixels. However, when dynamic obstacles, such as
people, are present, CNN does not work well. This study proposes a new method
combining CNN with Vision Transformer, which excels at extracting global
features that show the relationship of patches on whole image. Experimental
results showed that, compared to the state-of-the-art method (SOTA), the
accuracy improvement rate in a CG dataset with dynamic obstacles is 1.5 times
higher than that without dynamic obstacles. Moreover, the self-localization
error of our method is 20.1% smaller than that of SOTA on public datasets.
Additionally, our robot using our method can localize itself with 7.51cm error
on average, which is more accurate than SOTA.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PHUMA provides a scalable, physically-grounded humanoid motion dataset derived from internet videos, with physics-constrained retargeting to remove artifacts, leading to improved imitation over Humanoid-X and AMASS.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current high-quality motion datasets (e.g., AMASS) are scarce and expensive. Scaling via internet videos often introduces artifacts (floating, penetration, foot skating) that degrade imitation. A physically grounded, scalable dataset is needed.

Method: Construct PHUMA by collecting human video data at scale and applying physics-constrained retargeting: enforce joint limits, ensure ground contact, remove foot skating; careful data curation to reduce artifacts; evaluate in two tasks: imitation of unseen motions from test videos and pelvis-guided path following.

Result: PHUMA-trained policies outperform Humanoid-X and AMASS in both evaluation setups, achieving significant gains in imitating diverse motions.

Conclusion: PHUMA demonstrates that scalable, physically reliable humanoid motion data is achievable from internet videos, enabling better imitation. The work provides a practical dataset resource and shows strong empirical gains over existing datasets; code is released.

Abstract: Motion imitation is a promising approach for humanoid locomotion, enabling
agents to acquire humanlike behaviors. Existing methods typically rely on
high-quality motion capture datasets such as AMASS, but these are scarce and
expensive, limiting scalability and diversity. Recent studies attempt to scale
data collection by converting large-scale internet videos, exemplified by
Humanoid-X. However, they often introduce physical artifacts such as floating,
penetration, and foot skating, which hinder stable imitation. In response, we
introduce PHUMA, a Physically-grounded HUMAnoid locomotion dataset that
leverages human video at scale, while addressing physical artifacts through
careful data curation and physics-constrained retargeting. PHUMA enforces joint
limits, ensures ground contact, and eliminates foot skating, producing motions
that are both large-scale and physically reliable. We evaluated PHUMA in two
sets of conditions: (i) imitation of unseen motion from self-recorded test
videos and (ii) path following with pelvis-only guidance. In both cases,
PHUMA-trained policies outperform Humanoid-X and AMASS, achieving significant
gains in imitating diverse motions. The code is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Thor is a reinforcement-learning humanoid framework that enables human-like, force-adaptive whole-body reactions in contact-rich tasks on the Unitree G1, via a FAT2-based reward and a decoupled upper/waist/lower-body architecture.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable humanoids to maintain whole-body stability and exhibit adaptive, human-like responses during intense, contact-rich interactions, addressing the challenge of generating such behaviors under force/interaction constraints.

Method: Introduce a force-adaptive torso-tilt (FAT2) reward integrated with a force-analysis-based design; employ a RL framework that decouples upper body, waist, and lower body, each guided by global body observations and updating jointly; deploy on Unitree G1 with shared observations across modules.

Result: Thor substantially outperforms baselines in force-interaction tasks, achieving a peak pulling force of 167.7 N backward and 145.5 N forward (≈68.9% and 74.7% improvements); it can pull a 130 N rack and open a 60 N fire door with one hand.

Conclusion: Thor demonstrates effective enhancement of humanoid force-interaction capabilities and human-like responses under contact-rich conditions, validating the proposed FAT2 reward and decoupled RL architecture.

Abstract: Humanoids hold great potential for service, industrial, and rescue
applications, in which robots must sustain whole-body stability while
performing intense, contact-rich interactions with the environment. However,
enabling humanoids to generate human-like, adaptive responses under such
conditions remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Thor, a
humanoid framework for human-level whole-body reactions in contact-rich
environments. Based on the robot's force analysis, we design a force-adaptive
torso-tilt (FAT2) reward function to encourage humanoids to exhibit human-like
responses during force-interaction tasks. To mitigate the high-dimensional
challenges of humanoid control, Thor introduces a reinforcement learning
architecture that decouples the upper body, waist, and lower body. Each
component shares global observations of the whole body and jointly updates its
parameters. Finally, we deploy Thor on the Unitree G1, and it substantially
outperforms baselines in force-interaction tasks. Specifically, the robot
achieves a peak pulling force of 167.7 N (approximately 48% of the G1's body
weight) when moving backward and 145.5 N when moving forward, representing
improvements of 68.9% and 74.7%, respectively, compared with the
best-performing baseline. Moreover, Thor is capable of pulling a loaded rack
(130 N) and opening a fire door with one hand (60 N). These results highlight
Thor's effectiveness in enhancing humanoid force-interaction capabilities.

Existing methods struggle with occlusions and long-term consistency, hindering tasks like monitoring and yield estimation.

Method: AgriGS-SLAM couples direct LiDAR odometry and loop closures with multi-camera 3D Gaussian Splatting rendering. It employs batch rasterization across complementary viewpoints to recover occluded orchard structure, and a unified gradient-driven map lifecycle between keyframes to preserve details while bounding memory. Pose refinement uses a probabilistic LiDAR-based depth consistency term back-propagated through the camera projection to strengthen geometry–appearance coupling.

Result: Field deployment in apple and pear orchards across dormancy, flowering, and harvesting, with a standardized trajectory protocol evaluating both training-view and novel-view synthesis to mitigate 3DGS overfitting. Across seasons and sites, AgriGS-SLAM yields sharper, more stable reconstructions and steadier trajectories than recent state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM baselines, while maintaining real-time performance on-tractor.

Conclusion: The approach demonstrates accurate, robust multimodal perception for orchard monitoring and is applicable to other outdoor domains requiring real-time, multimodal 3D understanding despite challenging dynamics and recurrent geometry.

Abstract: Autonomous robots in orchards require real-time 3D scene understanding
despite repetitive row geometry, seasonal appearance changes, and wind-driven
foliage motion. We present AgriGS-SLAM, a Visual--LiDAR SLAM framework that
couples direct LiDAR odometry and loop closures with multi-camera 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) rendering. Batch rasterization across complementary viewpoints
recovers orchard structure under occlusions, while a unified gradient-driven
map lifecycle executed between keyframes preserves fine details and bounds
memory. Pose refinement is guided by a probabilistic LiDAR-based depth
consistency term, back-propagated through the camera projection to tighten
geometry-appearance coupling. We deploy the system on a field platform in apple
and pear orchards across dormancy, flowering, and harvesting, using a
standardized trajectory protocol that evaluates both training-view and
novel-view synthesis to reduce 3DGS overfitting in evaluation. Across seasons
and sites, AgriGS-SLAM delivers sharper, more stable reconstructions and
steadier trajectories than recent state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM baselines while
maintaining real-time performance on-tractor. While demonstrated in orchard
monitoring, the approach can be applied to other outdoor domains requiring
robust multimodal perception.

### [89] [Cooperative Task Spaces for Multi-Arm Manipulation Control based on Similarity Transformations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26362)
*Tobias Löw,Cem Bilaloglu,Sylvain Calinon*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A cooperative task-space framework for multi-arm robots is derived using conformal geometric algebra, enabling abstraction of complex systems to single-arm-like representations, with derived Jacobians and integration into operational-space control; validated in abstract experiments on bimanual, humanoid, and multi-fingered hands, and in teleoperation, highlighting embedded nullspace for secondary objectives; establishes theoretical foundations with potential_future_applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cooperative manipulation with many degrees of freedom is difficult to model and control. A geometric-algebra-based formulation can unify multi-arm systems into a tractable, abstract primitive that aligns with classical control methods.

Method: Define cooperative geometric primitives via conformal geometric algebra, apply similarity transformations to map multi-arm systems to a cooperative primitive space, derive analytic and geometric Jacobians, and integrate with operational-space/control techniques. Demonstrate via optimal control experiments for reaching primitives and teleoperation with differential kinematics; discuss how nullspace structures can support secondary tasks.

Result: The framework yields a natural integration path with classical controllers, enabling coordinated multi-arm manipulation. Demonstrations across bimanual manipulators, humanoids, and multi-fingered hands in optimal control and teleoperation illustrate reaching of geometric primitives and differential kinematics control; the primitives embed nullspace structures for secondary objectives.

Conclusion: This work lays the theoretical foundations for cooperative manipulation control using geometric primitives in a conformal geometric-algebra framework; experiments are presented abstractly, but the approach points to broad future applications in coordinated multi-arm and dexterous manipulation.

Abstract: Many tasks in human environments require collaborative behavior between
multiple kinematic chains, either to provide additional support for carrying
big and bulky objects or to enable the dexterity that is required for in-hand
manipulation. Since these complex systems often have a very high number of
degrees of freedom coordinating their movements is notoriously difficult to
model. In this article, we present the derivation of the theoretical
foundations for cooperative task spaces of multi-arm robotic systems based on
geometric primitives defined using conformal geometric algebra. Based on the
similarity transformations of these cooperative geometric primitives, we derive
an abstraction of complex robotic systems that enables representing these
systems in a way that directly corresponds to single-arm systems. By deriving
the associated analytic and geometric Jacobian matrices, we then show the
straightforward integration of our approach into classical control techniques
rooted in operational space control. We demonstrate this using bimanual
manipulators, humanoids and multi-fingered hands in optimal control experiments
for reaching desired geometric primitives and in teleoperation experiments
using differential kinematics control. We then discuss how the geometric
primitives naturally embed nullspace structures into the controllers that can
be exploited for introducing secondary control objectives. This work,
represents the theoretical foundations of this cooperative manipulation control
framework, and thus the experiments are presented in an abstract way, while
giving pointers towards potential future applications.

### [90] [Towards Reinforcement Learning Based Log Loading Automation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26363)
*Ilya Kurinov,Miroslav Ivanov,Grzegorz Orzechowski,Aki Mikkola*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Reinforcement learning enables full log-loading automation for a forestry forwarder in simulation, achieving 94% success on grasping/transporting logs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce operator fatigue and safety risks by automating log-handling; extend prior work from grasping to complete loading.

Method: Train RL agents in NVIDIA Isaac Gym using a trailer-forwarder model and a virtual log-loading scenario; curriculum learning; random log positions; agent learns locating, grappling, transporting, delivering logs to bed.

Result: Best agent achieved 94% success in loading a log from random position to the forwarder bed; demonstrates feasibility of full-load automation.

Conclusion: RL-based approach shows promise for forestry forwarder automation; curriculum learning and simulation are effective precursors to real-world deployment; future work may transfer to hardware and refine robustness.

Abstract: Forestry forwarders play a central role in mechanized timber harvesting by
picking up and moving logs from the felling site to a processing area or a
secondary transport vehicle. Forwarder operation is challenging and physically
and mentally exhausting for the operator who must control the machine in remote
areas for prolonged periods of time. Therefore, even partial automation of the
process may reduce stress on the operator. This study focuses on continuing
previous research efforts in application of reinforcement learning agents in
automating log handling process, extending the task from grasping which was
studied in previous research to full log loading operation. The resulting agent
will be capable to automate a full loading procedure from locating and
grappling to transporting and delivering the log to a forestry forwarder bed.
To train the agent, a trailer type forestry forwarder simulation model in
NVIDIA's Isaac Gym and a virtual environment for a typical log loading scenario
were developed. With reinforcement learning agents and a curriculum learning
approach, the trained agent may be a stepping stone towards application of
reinforcement learning agents in automation of the forestry forwarder. The
agent learnt grasping a log in a random position from grapple's random position
and transport it to the bed with 94% success rate of the best performing agent.

### [91] [Human-in-the-loop Online Rejection Sampling for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26406)
*Guanxing Lu,Rui Zhao,Haitao Lin,He Zhang,Yansong Tang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hi-ORS is a post-training method that uses rejection sampling to stabilize value estimates and a reward-weighted supervised objective for dense supervision, enabling stable, data-efficient fine-tuning of vision-language-action policies with online human-in-the-loop corrections, achieving superior real-robot manipulation performance in about 1.5 hours.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL-IL gap: RL struggles with unstable value estimates and sparse intermediate rewards; IL is easy but offline and data-limited. The abstract seeks a method that combines the stability of IL with the data efficiency and robustness of RL for VLA policies.

Method: Rejection sampling filters out negatively rewarded samples during online fine-tuning to stabilize value estimates. A reward-weighted supervised objective provides dense intermediate-step supervision. An asynchronous inference-training framework enables online human-in-the-loop corrections to guide learning of error-recovery behaviors.

Result: Across three real-world tasks and two embodiments, Hi-ORS fine-tunes a pi-base policy to master contact-rich manipulation in about 1.5 hours of real-world training, outperforming RL and IL baselines by a substantial margin in effectiveness and efficiency. The policy demonstrates strong test-time scalability with reliable error-recovery behaviors.

Conclusion: Hi-ORS offers a simple yet effective post-training approach that stabilizes value estimation, provides dense supervision, and leverages human guidance to produce robust, efficient VLA manipulation policies with practical real-world applicability.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used to produce robust robotic
manipulation policies, but fine-tuning vision-language-action (VLA) models with
RL can be unstable due to inaccurate value estimates and sparse supervision at
intermediate steps. In contrast, imitation learning (IL) is easy to train but
often underperforms due to its offline nature. In this paper, we propose
Hi-ORS, a simple yet effective post-training method that utilizes rejection
sampling to achieve both training stability and high robustness. Hi-ORS
stabilizes value estimation by filtering out negatively rewarded samples during
online fine-tuning, and adopts a reward-weighted supervised training objective
to provide dense intermediate-step supervision. For systematic study, we
develop an asynchronous inference-training framework that supports flexible
online human-in-the-loop corrections, which serve as explicit guidance for
learning error-recovery behaviors. Across three real-world tasks and two
embodiments, Hi-ORS fine-tunes a pi-base policy to master contact-rich
manipulation in just 1.5 hours of real-world training, outperforming RL and IL
baselines by a substantial margin in both effectiveness and efficiency.
Notably, the fine-tuned policy exhibits strong test-time scalability by
reliably executing complex error-recovery behaviors to achieve better
performance.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboOS-NeXT presents a unified, memory-based framework for lifelong, scalable, and robust multi-robot collaboration using a Spatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM) within a brain-cerebellum architecture to coordinate planning and execution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current approaches (vision-language-action models and hierarchical frameworks) rely on limited agent memory, hindering long-horizon learning, scalability to heterogeneous teams, fault recovery, and consistent state synchronization. A unified memory representation is needed to enable enduring, scalable collaboration across diverse robots.

Method: Introduce Spatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM) that fuses spatial scene geometry, temporal event history, and embodiment profiles into a shared representation. Integrate STEM into a brain-cerebellum framework where a high-level brain performs global planning by retrieving/updating STEM and low-level controllers execute actions, creating a closed cognition-memory-execution loop. Enable dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and robust state synchronization; evaluate on complex coordination tasks in restaurants, supermarkets, and households.

Result: Experiments show RoboOS-NeXT achieves superior performance across heterogeneous embodiments, validating its effectiveness for lifelong, scalable, and robust multi-robot collaboration.

Conclusion: A memory-centric framework with STEM enables lifelong adaptability and scalable coordination in multi-robot systems, addressing key limitations of prior approaches and supporting robust, distributed operation across diverse environments.

Abstract: The proliferation of collaborative robots across diverse tasks and
embodiments presents a central challenge: achieving lifelong adaptability,
scalable coordination, and robust scheduling in multi-agent systems. Existing
approaches, from vision-language-action (VLA) models to hierarchical
frameworks, fall short due to their reliance on limited or dividual-agent
memory. This fundamentally constrains their ability to learn over long
horizons, scale to heterogeneous teams, or recover from failures, highlighting
the need for a unified memory representation. To address these limitations, we
introduce RoboOS-NeXT, a unified memory-based framework for lifelong, scalable,
and robust multi-robot collaboration. At the core of RoboOS-NeXT is the novel
Spatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM), which integrates spatial scene
geometry, temporal event history, and embodiment profiles into a shared
representation. This memory-centric design is integrated into a
brain-cerebellum framework, where a high-level brain model performs global
planning by retrieving and updating STEM, while low-level controllers execute
actions locally. This closed loop between cognition, memory, and execution
enables dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and consistent
state synchronization. We conduct extensive experiments spanning complex
coordination tasks in restaurants, supermarkets, and households. Our results
demonstrate that RoboOS-NeXT achieves superior performance across heterogeneous
embodiments, validating its effectiveness in enabling lifelong, scalable, and
robust multi-robot collaboration. Project website:

*Prathamesh Kothavale,Sravani Boddepalli*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A framework that extends robots' inverse kinematics to perform sequential tool-use with tools of varying lengths, enabling sim-to-real transfer with low errors and tool-length invariance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Robots have limited kinematic understanding and rely on preprogrammed tasks; enabling efficient tool use requires addressing grasping the outcome, tool selection, orientation, and precise manipulation, and bridging simulation to real-world execution.

Method: Extend the inverse kinematics solver to acquire a sequence of actions using tools of different lengths; integrate a simulation-learned action trajectory with the tool; train policies and validate them via sim-to-real experiments.

Result: Inverse kinematics error rate < 1 cm; mean policy error 8 cm in simulation; model performance is virtually indistinguishable when using two tools of different lengths.

Conclusion: The work suggests potential advances in exploring all four fundamental aspects of tool usage and enabling robust tool manipulation across diverse tasks, including sim-to-real transfer.

Abstract: Conventional robots possess a limited understanding of their kinematics and
are confined to preprogrammed tasks, hindering their ability to leverage tools
efficiently. Driven by the essential components of tool usage - grasping the
desired outcome, selecting the most suitable tool, determining optimal tool
orientation, and executing precise manipulations - we introduce a pioneering
framework. Our novel approach expands the capabilities of the robot's inverse
kinematics solver, empowering it to acquire a sequential repertoire of actions
using tools of varying lengths. By integrating a simulation-learned action
trajectory with the tool, we showcase the practicality of transferring acquired
skills from simulation to real-world scenarios through comprehensive
experimentation. Remarkably, our extended inverse kinematics solver
demonstrates an impressive error rate of less than 1 cm. Furthermore, our
trained policy achieves a mean error of 8 cm in simulation. Noteworthy, our
model achieves virtually indistinguishable performance when employing two
distinct tools of different lengths. This research provides an indication of
potential advances in the exploration of all four fundamental aspects of tool
usage, enabling robots to master the intricate art of tool manipulation across
diverse tasks.

*Gang Li,Chunlei Zhai,Teng Wang,Shaun Li,Shangsong Jiang,Xiangwei Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FLYINGTRUST is a high-fidelity benchmarking framework for evaluating quadrotor visual navigation across diverse platforms and scenes, using two interpretable kinodynamic indicators and a standardized scoring protocol to analyze robustness and generalization of optimization- and learning-based methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Performance of visual navigation varies widely across vehicle platforms and scene geometries; there is a need for systematic early-stage evaluation to reduce deployment risk and cost.

Method: Model platform capability with two indicators: maximum thrust-to-weight ratio and axis-wise maximum angular acceleration; build a diverse scenario library; prescribe a standardized evaluation protocol; apply a composite score balancing scenario importance, platform importance, and performance stability; perform repeated trials per platform-scenario pair with uncertainty-aware metrics.

Result: Compared representative optimization-based and learning-based navigation approaches under identical conditions; observed predictable dependencies of navigation success on platform capability and scene geometry; different algorithms exhibit distinct preferences and failure modes across conditions.

Conclusion: Jointly considering platform capability and scenario structure is essential for design, evaluation, and selection of navigation algorithms; this motivates future work on methods robust across diverse platforms and scenarios.

Abstract: Visual navigation algorithms for quadrotors often exhibit a large variation
in performance when transferred across different vehicle platforms and scene
geometries, which increases the cost and risk of field deployment. To support
systematic early-stage evaluation, we introduce FLYINGTRUST, a high-fidelity,
configurable benchmarking framework that measures how platform kinodynamics and
scenario structure jointly affect navigation robustness. FLYINGTRUST models
vehicle capability with two compact, physically interpretable indicators:
maximum thrust-to-weight ratio and axis-wise maximum angular acceleration. The
benchmark pairs a diverse scenario library with a heterogeneous set of real and
virtual platforms and prescribes a standardized evaluation protocol together
with a composite scoring method that balances scenario importance, platform
importance and performance stability. We use FLYINGTRUST to compare
representative optimization-based and learning-based navigation approaches
under identical conditions, performing repeated trials per platform-scenario
combination and reporting uncertainty-aware metrics. The results reveal
systematic patterns: navigation success depends predictably on platform
capability and scene geometry, and different algorithms exhibit distinct
preferences and failure modes across the evaluated conditions. These
observations highlight the practical necessity of incorporating both platform
capability and scenario structure into algorithm design, evaluation, and
selection, and they motivate future work on methods that remain robust across
diverse platforms and scenarios.

### [95] [A Sliding-Window Filter for Online Continuous-Time Continuum Robot State Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26623)
*Spencer Teetaert,Sven Lilge,Jessica Burgner-Kahrs,Timothy D. Barfoot*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: A sliding-window filter for continuous-time state estimation in continuum robots (CRs) that runs online at faster-than-real-time and provides stochastic representations, improving accuracy over traditional filters.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CRs suffer a trade-off between estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. Sliding-window methods are limited to discrete-time, lack stochastic representations; online stochastic filters are constrained by measurement rates; offline continuous-time estimators exist. A stochastic SWF for CRs would blend online operation with continuous-time stochastic modeling.

Method: Introduce and formulate a sliding-window filter (SWF) tailored for continuous-time stochastic state estimation of continuum robots, enabling online operation and improved accuracy over conventional filters, and the first of its kind in this domain.

Result: The SWF yields higher accuracy than a standard filter baseline while enabling online operation of continuous-time estimators at speeds faster than real-time.

Conclusion: This work presents the first stochastic SWF for CRs and points to a promising research direction for online continuous-time stochastic estimation in continuum robots.

Abstract: Stochastic state estimation methods for continuum robots (CRs) often struggle
to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. While several recent works
have explored sliding-window formulations for CRs, these methods are limited to
simplified, discrete-time approximations and do not provide stochastic
representations. In contrast, current stochastic filter methods must run at the
speed of measurements, limiting their full potential. Recent works in
continuous-time estimation techniques for CRs show a principled approach to
addressing this runtime constraint, but are currently restricted to offline
operation. In this work, we present a sliding-window filter (SWF) for
continuous-time state estimation of CRs that improves upon the accuracy of a
filter approach while enabling continuous-time methods to operate online, all
while running at faster-than-real-time speeds. This represents the first
stochastic SWF specifically designed for CRs, providing a promising direction
for future research in this area.

TL;DR: A hierarchical planning-control framework combines a high-level DQN for discrete sub-goal selection with a low-level TD3 controller for continuous actuation, enhanced by reward shaping and a LiDAR-based safety gate. Implemented in ROS+Gazebo (TurtleBot3) and evaluated with PathBench metrics, it yields higher success and efficiency and better generalization than single-algorithm baselines and rule-based planners; code is available in the project repository.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To bridge discrete high-level planning with continuous low-level control while enforcing safety in dynamic, partially observable environments, aiming to improve success rates, sample efficiency, and generalization over unseen obstacle configurations.

Method: A two-tier architecture where a high-level DQN selects discrete sub-goals/behaviors and a low-level TD3 controls smooth velocity outputs. A task-specific reward shaping scheme (direction, distance, obstacle avoidance, action smoothness, collision penalty, time penalty, progress) guides learning. A LiDAR-based safety gate prevents unsafe motions. Implementation is in ROS+Gazebo (TurtleBot3), evaluated with PathBench metrics across dynamic, partially observable scenarios.

Result: The approach achieves higher success rates and better sample efficiency than single-algorithm baselines (DQN or TD3 alone) and rule-based planners. It generalizes better to unseen obstacle configurations and reduces abrupt control changes.

Conclusion: The hierarchical DQN–TD3 framework with reward shaping and LiDAR safety gating provides effective planning and control in dynamic, partially observable environments, enhancing performance and safety; the authors provide code and evaluation scripts in the project repository.

Abstract: This paper presents a hierarchical path-planning and control framework that
combines a high-level Deep Q-Network (DQN) for discrete sub-goal selection with
a low-level Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) controller
for continuous actuation. The high-level module selects behaviors and
sub-goals; the low-level module executes smooth velocity commands. We design a
practical reward shaping scheme (direction, distance, obstacle avoidance,
action smoothness, collision penalty, time penalty, and progress), together
with a LiDAR-based safety gate that prevents unsafe motions. The system is
implemented in ROS + Gazebo (TurtleBot3) and evaluated with PathBench metrics,
including success rate, collision rate, path efficiency, and re-planning
efficiency, in dynamic and partially observable environments. Experiments show
improved success rate and sample efficiency over single-algorithm baselines

### [98] [Heuristic Adaptation of Potentially Misspecified Domain Support for Likelihood-Free Inference in Stochastic Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26656)
*Georgios Kamaras,Craig Innes,Subramanian Ramamoorthy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Three heuristic LFI variants (EDGE, MODE, CENTRE) adapt sampling support during inference to counteract misspecified supports, improving parameter inference and sim-based policy robustness in robotics.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Misspecified inference supports in likelihood-free inference can produce suboptimal and overconfident posteriors; adaptive support during inference is needed for robust robotics applications.

Method: Introduce three heuristics that interpret posterior mode shifts across inference steps to adjust the support while performing LFI. Evaluate on stochastic dynamical benchmarks and a dynamic deformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task; use inferred posteriors as domain distributions for sim-based policy learning.

Result: Posterior inference yields finer resolution in length and stiffness classification for a parametric family of DLOs; using these posteriors as domain distributions improves robustness of object-centric policies learned from simulation.

Conclusion: Adaptive support during LFI via EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE mitigates misspecification risks, yielding more accurate inferences and more robust policy performance in robotic manipulation tasks.

Abstract: In robotics, likelihood-free inference (LFI) can provide the domain
distribution that adapts a learnt agent in a parametric set of deployment
conditions. LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains
constant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more
descriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to
suboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose
three heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the
posterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated
into an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first
expose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using
stochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic
support adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic
deformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer
length and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the
resulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy
learning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance.

*Qianyou Zhao,Yuliang Shen,Xuanran Zhai,Ce Hao,Duidi Wu,Jin Qi,Jie Hu,Qiaojun Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP) enables fast, multi-modal diffusion-based imitation by combining a short stochastic prefix with a one-step consistency jump, achieving near-teacher accuracy and mode coverage with much lower latency.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion-based imitation learning can model diverse visuomotor behaviors but faces a trade-off between fast sampling and strong multi-modality; existing ordinary or stochastic denoising processes often fail to balance speed and mode retention.

Method: Use a short stochastic prefix up to an adaptive switch time, followed by a one-step consistency jump. Train with time-varying consistency distillation that combines a trajectory-consistency objective (coherence across neighboring predictions) and a denoising-matching objective (local fidelity). Evaluate with 25 SDE steps plus one jump, comparing to an 80-step DDPM teacher.

Result: HCP with 25 SDE steps and one jump approaches the 80-step DDPM teacher in accuracy and mode coverage while significantly reducing latency. Demonstrates that multi-modality can be achieved without slow inference and that the switch time decouples mode retention from speed.

Conclusion: HCP offers a practical accuracy-efficiency trade-off for robot policies, showing that achieving multi-modality does not require slower sampling and that adaptive switching can preserve modes while accelerating inference.

Abstract: In visuomotor policy learning, diffusion-based imitation learning has become
widely adopted for its ability to capture diverse behaviors. However,
approaches built on ordinary and stochastic denoising processes struggle to
jointly achieve fast sampling and strong multi-modality. To address these
challenges, we propose the Hybrid Consistency Policy (HCP). HCP runs a short
stochastic prefix up to an adaptive switch time, and then applies a one-step
consistency jump to produce the final action. To align this one-jump
generation, HCP performs time-varying consistency distillation that combines a
trajectory-consistency objective to keep neighboring predictions coherent and a
denoising-matching objective to improve local fidelity. In both simulation and
on a real robot, HCP with 25 SDE steps plus one jump approaches the 80-step
DDPM teacher in accuracy and mode coverage while significantly reducing
latency. These results show that multi-modality does not require slow
inference, and a switch time decouples mode retention from speed. It yields a
practical accuracy efficiency trade-off for robot policies.

Method: Introduce a bag of strategies to eliminate overheads in model inference and implement a full streaming inference pipeline; demonstrate on pi0-level multi-view VLA to achieve high frame/trajectory rates and real-world grasp tasks; provide code.

Result: Achieves 30 Hz frame-rate and up to 480 Hz trajectory-frequency on a single consumer GPU; real-world experiment reports 100% success in grasping a falling pen using the pi0 policy with the proposed strategies.

Conclusion: Proposes a full streaming inference framework for real-time robot control of VLAs, and releases code for implementation and replication.

Abstract: In this paper, we show how to run pi0-level multi-view VLA at 30Hz frame rate
and at most 480Hz trajectory frequency using a single consumer GPU. This
enables dynamic and real-time tasks that were previously believed to be
unattainable by large VLA models. To achieve it, we introduce a bag of
strategies to eliminate the overheads in model inference. The real-world
experiment shows that the pi0 policy with our strategy achieves a 100% success
rate in grasping a falling pen task. Based on the results, we further propose a
full streaming inference framework for real-time robot control of VLA. Code is

Motivation: Engine evaluations are precise but opaque; there is a need for interpretable explanations that reveal how individual pieces influence the score, aiding teaching and model comparison.

Method: Treat each piece as a feature and apply ablation to compute additive, per-piece SHAP-like contributions that sum to the engine output; emphasizes local faithfulness and interpretability; aligns with classical chess pedagogy of evaluating positions by mentally removing pieces.

Result: Proposes a feasible attribution framework that yields piece-level explanations; highlights potential uses in visualization, training, and engine comparison; accompanies code and data release for reproducibility.

Conclusion: Adapting SHAP to chess analysis yields interpretable, piece-level explanations of engine evaluations, enabling insights for training and analysis, with an accompanying code/data release to foster replication and further research.

Abstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically
expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these
outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns.
In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the
domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to
specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically
ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the
engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This
method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess
positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI
techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human
training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to
foster future research in interpretable chess AI.

### [102] [An Agentic Framework for Rapid Deployment of Edge AI Solutions in Industry 5.0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25813)
*Jorge Martinez-Gil,Mario Pichler,Nefeli Bountouni,Sotiris Koussouris,Marielena Márquez Barreiro,Sergio Gusmeroli*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes an edge-enabled, agent-based Industry 5.0 framework that enables local AI inference on edge devices, reducing latency and data transfer, with modular, low-resource design and preliminary food-industry validation; code is open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the need for low-latency, privacy-preserving AI deployment in industrial settings by enabling on-device inference and real-time processing through a modular, agent-based architecture.

Method: Design and implementation of an edge-focused, agent-based framework for Industry 5.0 that supports modular integration, low resource usage, and real-time local inference; includes evaluation in real-world food-industry scenarios.

latency and avoids external data transfer by enabling local inference and
real-time processing. Our implementation is agent-based, which means that
individual agents, whether human, algorithmic, or collaborative, are
responsible for well-defined tasks, enabling flexibility and simplifying
integration. Moreover, our framework supports modular integration and maintains

*Vanessa Figueiredo,David Elumeze*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Constrained prompts in LLM-driven NPC dialogue do not reliably improve player experience; scaffolding effects are role-dependent; proposes Symbolically Scaffolded Play with fuzzy bounds to balance coherence and improvisation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To evaluate whether prompt constraints help or hinder player experience in LLM-based NPC interactions and to develop scaffolding strategies that stabilize dialogue without sacrificing novelty.

Method: Within-subject usability study (N=10) comparing high-constraint vs low-constraint prompts in a GPT-4o-powered voice detective game (The Interview); redesigned HCP into a hybrid JSON+RAG scaffold; synthetic evaluation with an LLM judge as an early-stage usability complement.

Result: No consistent experiential differences between high- and low-constraint prompts; performance sensitive to technical breakdowns; scaffolding effects were role-dependent—interviewer gains stability while suspect NPCs lose improvisational believability; introduces Symbolically Scaffolded Play to balance structure and spontaneity.

Conclusion: Tighter constraints do not automatically enhance play; extending fuzzy-symbolic scaffolding offers a framework to stabilize coherence where needed while preserving improvisation where surprise sustains engagement.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to transform interactive games by
enabling non-player characters (NPCs) to sustain unscripted dialogue. Yet it
remains unclear whether constrained prompts actually improve player experience.
We investigate this question through The Interview, a voice-based detective
game powered by GPT-4o. A within-subjects usability study ($N=10$) compared
high-constraint (HCP) and low-constraint (LCP) prompts, revealing no reliable
experiential differences beyond sensitivity to technical breakdowns. Guided by
these findings, we redesigned the HCP into a hybrid JSON+RAG scaffold and
conducted a synthetic evaluation with an LLM judge, positioned as an
early-stage complement to usability testing. Results uncovered a novel pattern:
scaffolding effects were role-dependent: the Interviewer (quest-giver NPC)
gained stability, while suspect NPCs lost improvisational believability. These
findings overturn the assumption that tighter constraints inherently enhance
play. Extending fuzzy-symbolic scaffolding, we introduce \textit{Symbolically
Scaffolded Play}, a framework in which symbolic structures are expressed as
fuzzy, numerical boundaries that stabilize coherence where needed while
preserving improvisation where surprise sustains engagement.

### [104] [Through the Judge's Eyes: Inferred Thinking Traces Improve Reliability of LLM Raters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25860)
*Xingjian Zhang,Tianhong Gao,Suliang Jin,Tianhao Wang,Teng Ye,Eytan Adar,Qiaozhu Mei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A human-LLM collaborative framework reconstructs thinking traces from label-only annotations via rejection sampling, improving LLM-human agreement and informing guideline refinement for better model agreement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Subjective judgments often require hidden thinking traces beyond the final labels; these traces are valuable for evaluation but hard to collect at scale. The work aims to recover such traces from existing label-only data to improve rater reliability.

Method: Introduce a rejection sampling approach to infer thinking traces that justify label decisions. Apply this to (1) fine-tuning open LLM raters and (2) generating clearer annotation guidelines for proprietary LLM raters, evaluated across multiple datasets.

Result: Significant improvements in LLM-human agreement across datasets; refined guidelines also increase agreement among different LLM models.

Conclusion: LLMs can proxy unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only data to be transformed into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM-based evaluation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation
tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when
human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking
traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging
to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer
thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a
simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at
scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks:
(1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation
guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods
lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined
annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These
results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise
unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended
into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM
raters.

### [105] [The Information-Theoretic Imperative: Compression and the Epistemic Foundations of Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25883)
*Christian Dittrich,Jennifer Flygare Kinne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A two-level information-theoretic framework (ITI and CEP) explains why minimizing predictive uncertainty through compression drives the discovery of causal structure, positing intelligence as the mechanically necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments, with testable predictions linking compression efficiency to generalization, causal inference, hierarchy, and metabolic cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To answer why compression leads to causal-model discovery rather than superficial patterns, by grounding intelligence in survival-driven information-processing demands.

Method: Introduce two principles: Information-Theoretic Imperative (ITI) which ties persistence under uncertainty to epistemic entropy reduction via predictive compression, and Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) which shows how efficient compression selects for generative, causal models through exception-accumulation dynamics; derive a causal chain from survival pressure to reality alignment and provide empirically testable predictions.

Result: A coherent framework that yields testable predictions: (1) compression efficiency near the rate-distortion frontier should correlate with out-of-distribution generalization; (2) exception-accumulation rates distinguish causal from correlational models; (3) hierarchical systems should show increasing compression efficiency across abstraction layers; (4) biological systems should exhibit metabolic costs tracking representational complexity; (5) convergent applicability across biological, artificial and multi-scale systems.

Conclusion: Intelligence is a mechanically necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments; ITI and CEP offer a unified, testable account of predictive processing and causal-model discovery without appealing to consciousness or subjective experience.

Abstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence
but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal
structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a
two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative
(ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must
minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the
evolutionary "why" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands.
The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression
mechanically selects for generative, causal models through
exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather
than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain:
from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement,
efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality
alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or
evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically
necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework
yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as
approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution
generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from
correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across
abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that
track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified
account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems,
addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without
invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.

*Eitán Sprejer,Fernando Avalos,Augusto Bernardi,Jose Pedro Brito de Azevedo Faustino,Jacob Haimes,Narmeen Fatimah Oozeer*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a persona-based aggregation framework to synthesize preference labels from multiple rubric-aware judges and evaluates GAM and MLP aggregators, addressing calibration, bias, and instability in LLM-based judging for RLHF and model routing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Calibrating LLM judges to human preferences is difficult due to rubric sensitivity, bias, and instability. This impedes reliable reward models for RLHF and effective routing systems that pick the best-suited model for a user query.

Method: Model diverse preferences by learning to aggregate outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. Two aggregator implementations are explored: Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The framework is evaluated against naive baselines and robustness is assessed via case studies on both human and LLM judges to study biases.

Result: The study compares the persona-based aggregator against naive baselines and conducts case studies to assess robustness to human and LLM biases. Results indicate that aggregating persona-based rubric judgments is viable and can improve robustness, with two concrete aggregator implementations (GAM and MLP) yielding promising performance.

Conclusion: A scalable persona-based aggregation framework for synthesizing preference labels across diverse judges is viable, and the two proposed aggregators (GAM and MLP) provide practical paths to stabilizing LLM-based judging for RLHF and model routing applications.

Abstract: Aligning LLM-based judges with human preferences is a significant challenge,
as they are difficult to calibrate and often suffer from rubric sensitivity,
bias, and instability. Overcoming this challenge advances key applications,
such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human
Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the
best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework
for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate
outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance
of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case
studies on both human and LLM-judges biases. Our primary contributions include
a persona-based method for synthesizing preference labels at scale and two
distinct implementations of our aggregator: Generalized Additive Model (GAM)
and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).

### [107] [SciTrust 2.0: A Comprehensive Framework for Evaluating Trustworthiness of Large Language Models in Scientific Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25908)
*Emily Herron,Junqi Yin,Feiyi Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SciTrust 2.0 introduces a framework to evaluate LLM trustworthiness in scientific tasks across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness, scientific safety, and scientific ethics. It includes open-ended truthfulness benchmarks built via a reflection-tuning pipeline with expert validation and an ethics benchmark covering eight subcategories (e.g., dual-use research, bias). Seven LLMs (four science-specialized, three general) were evaluated; general models generally outperformed science-specialized ones, with GPT-o4-mini excelling in truthfulness and robustness. Science-specialized models showed weaknesses in logical/ethical reasoning and safety in high-risk domains like biosecurity. The framework is open-sourced to advance trustworthy AI in science.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a critical need to ensure trustworthiness of LLMs in scientific, high-stakes contexts and to address gaps in existing benchmarks for truthfulness, safety, and ethics.

Method: Develop a comprehensive evaluation framework (SciTrust 2.0) with: (1) open-ended truthfulness benchmarks via a verified reflection-tuning workflow and expert validation; (2) an ethics benchmark for scientific research with eight subcategories including dual-use and bias; (3) evaluation of seven LLMs (four science-specialized, three general) using metrics such as accuracy, semantic similarity, and LLM-based scoring across four trustworthiness dimensions.

Result: General-purpose LLMs outperform science-specialized models across trustworthiness dimensions; GPT-o4-mini demonstrates superior truthfulness and adversarial robustness; science-specialized models lag in logical/ethical reasoning and exhibit safety vulnerabilities in high-risk domains; large-scale framework is open-sourced for community use and improvement.

Conclusion: SciTrust 2.0 provides a foundational, open framework for assessing and improving LLM trustworthiness in scientific contexts, highlighting the need for improved safety and ethics evaluation in domain-specific models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
scientific research, yet their deployment in high-stakes contexts raises
significant trustworthiness concerns. Here, we introduce SciTrust 2.0, a
comprehensive framework for evaluating LLM trustworthiness in scientific
applications across four dimensions: truthfulness, adversarial robustness,
scientific safety, and scientific ethics. Our framework incorporates novel,
open-ended truthfulness benchmarks developed through a verified
reflection-tuning pipeline and expert validation, alongside a novel ethics
benchmark for scientific research contexts covering eight subcategories
including dual-use research and bias. We evaluated seven prominent LLMs,
including four science-specialized models and three general-purpose industry
models, using multiple evaluation metrics including accuracy, semantic
similarity measures, and LLM-based scoring. General-purpose industry models
overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness
dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness
assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed
significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along
with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in
high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons. By open-sourcing
our framework, we provide a foundation for developing more trustworthy AI
systems and advancing research on model safety and ethics in scientific
contexts.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autonomous, goal-driven AI agents can automate FinOps: an end-to-end simulated FinOps workflow demonstrates retrieval, consolidation, analysis, and optimization recommendation generation, achieving practitioner-level performance across multiple LMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Heterogeneous billing data formats, taxonomies, and metrics from cloud providers and internal systems hinder timely, actionable FinOps insights; automating decision-making with AI agents is proposed to address this.

Method: Developed a FinOps agent for IT infrastructure cost optimization and created an end-to-end simulation: data retrieval from diverse sources, data consolidation and analysis, and generation of optimization recommendations. Defined evaluation metrics and tested with several open-source and closed-source language models to assess understanding, planning, and execution.

Result: The agent demonstrated the ability to understand, plan, and execute tasks at a level comparable to an actual FinOps practitioner in the simulated workflow.

Conclusion: Autonomous, goal-driven AI agents show promise for FinOps automation, capable of handling heterogeneous data and accelerating cost-optimization decisions; feasibility is supported by end-to-end simulation and LM-based evaluation.

Abstract: FinOps (Finance + Operations) represents an operational framework and
cultural practice which maximizes cloud business value through collaborative
financial accountability across engineering, finance, and business teams.
FinOps practitioners face a fundamental challenge: billing data arrives in
heterogeneous formats, taxonomies, and metrics from multiple cloud providers
and internal systems which eventually lead to synthesizing actionable insights,
and making time-sensitive decisions. To address this challenge, we propose
leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation. In this
paper, we built a FinOps agent for a typical use-case for IT infrastructure and
cost optimization. We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry
process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and
analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization. We defined a
set of metrics to evaluate our agent using several open-source and close-source
language models and it shows that the agent was able to understand, plan, and
execute tasks as well as an actual FinOps practitioner.

### [109] [Humains-Junior: A 3.8B Language Model Achieving GPT-4o-Level Factual Accuracy by Directed Exoskeleton Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25933)
*Nissan Yaron,Dan Bystritsky,Ben-Etzion Yaron*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A 3.8B model (Humans-Junior) matches GPT-4o on FACTS grounding within ±5 percentage points, at ~19x lower cloud cost; synergy of Exoskeleton Reasoning scaffolds and behavioral fine-tuning; edge/self-hosting can reduce marginal cost toward zero; equivalence not established at ±3pp.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reduce cost and energy in factual grounding tasks while preserving accuracy comparable to large models; explore how directed reasoning plus alignment-fine-tuning affects performance.

Method: Integrate minimal directed Exoskeleton Reasoning scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning focused on epistemic discipline rather than domain answers; evaluate on Q1–Q500 with identical judges; compare with GPT-4o and frontier models; analyze cost via cloud pricing and self-hosted deployment; perform statistical tests (TOST, bootstrap, permutation).

Result: GPT-4o: 73.5% (CI 69.5–77.2) vs Humans-Junior 72.7% (CI 68.7–76.5) on Q1–Q500; paired diff 0.8 pp; bootstrap CI −3.1 to +4.7; p=0.72; d=0.023. Equivalence established at ±5 pp (not at ±3). Base model ~19x cheaper than GPT-4o via Microsoft AI Foundry; self-hosted/edge deployments can push marginal cost toward zero. Fine-tuning adds little alone; combined with scaffolds yields +17.7 pp (+p<0.001) and ~25% variance reduction; frontier-model results also show gains with directed reasoning in prompt-only settings.

Conclusion: A compact 3.8B model can attain GPT-4o–level FACTS accuracy within a ±5 pp equivalence margin and at substantially lower cost; the combination of directed reasoning scaffolds and alignment-oriented fine-tuning drives robust performance and cost efficiency, with potential for near-zero marginal cost via self-hosting.

Abstract: We introduce Humans-Junior, a 3.8B model that matches GPT-4o on the FACTS
Grounding public subset within a $\pm 5$ pp equivalence margin.
  Results. On Q1--Q500 under identical judges, GPT-4o scores 73.5% (95% CI
69.5--77.2) and Humans-Junior 72.7% (95% CI 68.7--76.5); the paired difference
is 0.8 pp (bootstrap 95% CI $-3.1$ to $+4.7$; permutation $p = 0.72$; Cohen's
$d = 0.023$). TOST establishes equivalence at $\pm 5$ pp (not at $\pm 3$ pp).
When purchased as managed APIs, Humans-Junior's base model
(Phi-3.5-mini-instruct) is $\approx 19\times$ less expensive than GPT-4o on
Microsoft AI Foundry pricing; self-hosted or edge deployments can drive
incremental inference cost toward zero. Measured vs estimated pricing sources
are tabulated in Appendix E.
  Method. Our approach combines minimal directed "Exoskeleton Reasoning"
scaffolds with behavioral fine-tuning that teaches protocol compliance
(epistemic discipline) rather than domain answers. Fine-tuning alone adds
little; combined, they synergize (+17.7 pp, $p < 0.001$) and reduce variance
($\approx 25\%$). In prompt-only settings on frontier models (Q1--Q100;
non-comparable), directed reasoning improved GPT-4o by +11.8 pp to 85.3% and
Gemini-2.5-Pro by +5.0 pp to 93.3% (baseline 88.3%, $n = 100$); see Section~5.
  TL;DR. A 3.8B model achieves GPT-4o-level FACTS accuracy (equivalent within
$\pm 5$ pp on Q1--Q500). Cloud pricing shows $\approx 19\times$ lower cost
versus GPT-4o, and self-hosted/edge deployments can approach zero marginal
cost. Pricing sources are listed in Appendix E. Frontier prompt-only gains
(Q1--Q100; non-comparable) and optimized-prompt exploratory results under
earlier judges are summarized in Appendix F.

### [110] [Estimating cognitive biases with attention-aware inverse planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25951)
*Sounak Banerjee,Daphne Cornelisse,Deepak Gopinath,Emily Sumner,Jonathan DeCastro,Guy Rosman,Eugene Vinitsky,Mark K. Ho*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The paper formalizes attention-aware inverse planning to infer cognitive biases from actions, showing differences from standard IRL and demonstrating scalable inference on real driving scenarios via a hybrid deep RL + cognitive modeling approach using Waymo data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Humans display attention biases that shape everyday actions. Autonomous systems interacting with people should account for these biases to better predict behavior and assist decisions. This work integrates computational cognitive science with inverse planning to infer attentional biases from observed actions.

Method: Formulates the attention-aware inverse planning problem, contrasts it with standard inverse reinforcement learning, and proposes a method that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational cognitive modeling. Applies the approach to real driving scenarios from the Waymo Open Dataset to infer attentional strategies of RL agents, demonstrating scalability of cognitive-bias estimation.

Result: The approach shows systematic differences from standard IRL in inferring goals and biases, enables inference of cognitive biases from behavior, and scales to real-world driving data by inferring attentional strategies of RL agents in Waymo scenarios.

Conclusion: Incorporating attentional biases into inverse planning enhances interpretation of actions and enables scalable estimation of cognitive biases from behavior, with implications for safer, more responsive human–AI collaboration in driving and other everyday tasks.

Abstract: People's goal-directed behaviors are influenced by their cognitive biases,
and autonomous systems that interact with people should be aware of this. For
example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a
way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving
to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we
formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the
goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We
demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from
standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be
inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware
inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational
cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of
RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset,
demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with
attention-aware inverse planning.

*Manu Redd,Tao Zhe,Dongjie Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An agentic NL-to-SQL pipeline significantly boosts spatial-temporal query handling by orchestrating planning, schema inspection, SQL generation, execution, and visualization, outperforming a naive baseline on NYC/Tokyo check-in data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Make structured data querying accessible to non-SQL users and handle complex spatio-temporal queries that hinge on aligning vague language with schemas and outputs.

Method: Augment a naive text-to-SQL model (llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with a Mistral-based ReAct agent that plans, decomposes tasks, inspects schemas, generates SQL, executes queries, and visualizes results.

Result: On 35 NL queries across NYC and Tokyo check-in datasets, the agent achieves 91.4% accuracy versus 28.6% for the baseline, and improves usability via maps, plots, and natural-language summaries.

Conclusion: Agentic orchestration, not merely stronger SQL generation, is a promising foundation for interactive geospatial NL-to-SQL assistants.

Abstract: Natural-language-to-SQL (NL-to-SQL) systems hold promise for democratizing
access to structured data, allowing users to query databases without learning
SQL. Yet existing systems struggle with realistic spatio-temporal queries,
where success requires aligning vague user phrasing with schema-specific
categories, handling temporal reasoning, and choosing appropriate outputs. We
present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline
(llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The
agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL
generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35
natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering
spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves
substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and
enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language
summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database
interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema
knowledge, or prompting skill. We conclude that agentic orchestration, rather
than stronger SQL generators alone, is a promising foundation for interactive
geospatial assistants.

### [113] [Large Language Model-assisted Autonomous Vehicle Recovery from Immobilization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26023)
*Zhipeng Bao,Qianwen Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A plug-in LLM-driven recovery framework, StuckSolver, enhances autonomous vehicle immobilization recovery via autonomous self-reasoning and optional passenger guidance, interfacing with existing perception-planning-control stacks without architectural changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Autonomous vehicles struggle in immobilization scenarios where human drivers excel; existing recovery methods (remote intervention and manual takeover) are costly, inefficient, or exclude non-drivers. A plug-in approach can enable effective recovery with broader accessibility.

Method: StuckSolver is a plug-in add-on that taps into standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization, interpret context, and generate high-level recovery commands for the AV's native planner. It requires no modification to the AV's internal architecture and operates atop the perception-planning-control stack.

Result: On Bench2Drive and custom uncertainty scenarios, StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance with autonomous self-reasoning alone and shows further improvements when passenger guidance is used.

Conclusion: StuckSolver offers a cost-effective, architecture-agnostic recovery augmentation that enables self-reasoning and passenger-guided decisions, improving AV recovery in immobilization scenarios while preserving existing system architecture.

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs)
continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human
drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting
overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention
(which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes
non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces
StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that
enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or
passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on
module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control
stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it
interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states,
interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that
can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the
Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results
show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through
autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when
passenger guidance is incorporated.

### [114] [Can AI be Accountable?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26057)
*Andrew L. Kun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Defines AI accountability through a forum model—information requests, dialogue, and sanctions—and surveys gaps and approaches to make AI accountable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI power grows, there is a need for mechanisms to scrutinize, justify, and hold AI systems responsible for their actions.

Method: Theoretical/conceptual analysis linking a general accountability framework to AI, illustrating accountable vs unaccountable AI, and surveying approaches to improve accountability.

Result: Clarifies actionable criteria for AI accountability, identifies current shortcomings, and outlines practical pathways (information access, discussion, sanctioning).

Conclusion: Advocates embedding accountability into AI design and governance, outlining directions for research, policy, and implementation.

Abstract: The AI we use is powerful, and its power is increasing rapidly. If this
powerful AI is to serve the needs of consumers, voters, and decision makers,
then it is imperative that the AI is accountable. In general, an agent is
accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent
about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and
if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's
AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with
it, let alone sanction it. In this chapter we relate the general definition of
accountability to AI, we illustrate what it means for AI to be accountable and
unaccountable, and we explore approaches that can improve our chances of living
in a world where all AI is accountable to those who are affected by it.

TL;DR: Lean4PHYS presents a Lean4 physics reasoning framework with LeanPhysBench and PhysLib; baseline models perform poorly; PhysLib improves performance by ~11.75%; first Lean4 physics benchmark.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a need for formal physics reasoning benchmarks in Lean4 to evaluate AI provers and formal verifiers on physics problems, bridging university physics education with formal methods.

Method: Develop Lean4PHYS framework comprising LeanPhysBench (200 hand-crafted, peer-reviewed physics statements from textbooks and problems) and PhysLib (community-driven repository of unit systems and theorems). Evaluate baseline performance using major expert Math Lean4 provers and state-of-the-art closed-source models; analyze the impact of PhysLib on model performance.

Result: Baseline performance: DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B at 16% and Claude-Sonnet-4 at 35%. PhysLib yields an average improvement of 11.75% in model performance. The benchmark is challenging, and this is the first physics benchmark in Lean4.

Conclusion: Lean4PHYS provides a valuable benchmark and library for formal physics reasoning in Lean4, demonstrates the effectiveness of PhysLib in boosting model performance, and invites community adoption and further research.

Abstract: We present **Lean4PHYS**, a comprehensive reasoning framework for
college-level physics problems in Lean4. **Lean4PHYS** includes
*LeanPhysBench*, a college-level benchmark for formal physics reasoning in
Lean4, which contains 200 hand-crafted and peer-reviewed statements derived
from university textbooks and physics competition problems. To establish a
solid foundation for formal reasoning in physics, we also introduce *PhysLib*,
a community-driven repository containing fundamental unit systems and theorems
essential for formal physics reasoning. Based on the benchmark and Lean4
repository we composed in **Lean4PHYS**, we report baseline results using major
expert Math Lean4 provers and state-of-the-art closed-source models, with the
best performance of DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieving only 16% and
Claude-Sonnet-4 achieving 35%. We also conduct a detailed analysis showing that
our *PhysLib* can achieve an average improvement of 11.75% in model
performance. This demonstrates the challenging nature of our *LeanPhysBench*
and the effectiveness of *PhysLib*. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to provide a physics benchmark in Lean4.

*Chenrui Shi,Zedong Yu,Zhi Gao,Ruining Feng,Enqi Liu,Yuwei Wu,Yunde Jia,Liuyu Xiang,Zhaofeng He,Qing Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes three-dimensional GUI knowledge, introduces GUI Knowledge Bench (GKB) to benchmark VLMs across six platforms and 292 apps, and shows current VLMs struggle with GUI states, action prediction, and task verification; real-world tasks validate the link between GUI knowledge and task success.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current large vision-language models perform GUI task automation but lag humans; existing training (supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning) insufficient to capture core GUI knowledge; a structured benchmark is needed to diagnose and guide model selection and development.

Method: Analyze common GUI task failure patterns to distill GUI knowledge into three dimensions (interface perception, interaction prediction, instruction understanding); develop GUI Knowledge Bench with multiple-choice and yes/no questions across Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, covering 292 applications; evaluate current VLMs and test on real-world GUI tasks.

Result: VLMs can identify widget functions but struggle to perceive system states, predict actions, and verify task completion; stronger link between GUI knowledge and task success in real-world tasks; the benchmark helps in selecting VLMs with higher potential and guiding future GUI agent development.

Conclusion: A structured GUI knowledge framework and benchmark are valuable for assessing and improving VLM-based GUI agents, aiding model selection and guiding future research toward more capable GUI automation.

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have advanced graphical user interface
(GUI) task automation but still lag behind humans. We hypothesize this gap
stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as
supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address.
By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI
knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about
recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge
about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding,
knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We
further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and
yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux,
IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify
widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting
actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks
further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By
providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports
the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and
provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.

TL;DR: Introduces an 'economics of inference' framework that treats LLM inference as a compute-driven production process, establishing a production frontier with diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and a favorable cost-effectiveness zone using WiNEval-3.0 data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide an economic basis for deploying LLMs and to enable market-based pricing and optimization of inference resources.

Method: Models LLM inference as a production activity, analyzes marginal cost, economies of scale, and output quality across performance configurations, and constructs an empirical LLM Inference Production Frontier from WiNEval-3.0 data.

Result: Reveals three principles—diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an optimal cost-effectiveness zone—and proposes an empirical frontier to guide deployment decisions and pricing.

Conclusion: Offers a foundational economic framework for deploying LLMs and for future market mechanisms and optimization of AI inference resources.

Abstract: The inference cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a critical
factor in determining their commercial viability and widespread adoption. This
paper introduces a quantitative ``economics of inference'' framework, treating
the LLM inference process as a compute-driven intelligent production activity.
We analyze its marginal cost, economies of scale, and quality of output under
various performance configurations. Based on empirical data from WiNEval-3.0,
we construct the first ``LLM Inference Production Frontier,'' revealing three
principles: diminishing marginal cost, diminishing returns to scale, and an
optimal cost-effectiveness zone. This paper not only provides an economic basis
for model deployment decisions but also lays an empirical foundation for the
future market-based pricing and optimization of AI inference resources.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A two-stage Reasoning Curriculum that first elicits reasoning in math via verifiable rewards, then transfers to diverse domains via joint RL; backbone-agnostic and minimal reward requirements; yields consistent gains on multiple LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable broad, general reasoning in LLMs by training reasoning skills in math domains and transferring them to other tasks, addressing the gap between specialized reasoning and multi-domain capabilities.

Method: Stage 1: brief cold start + math-only RL with verifiable rewards to build reasoning. Stage 2: joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and consolidate skills. No specialized reward models; verifiability checks suffice. Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B across multi-domain suite.

Result: Consistent gains in reasoning across models; ablations indicate both stages are necessary; math-first elicitation increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems.

Conclusion: Reasoning Curriculum is a compact, backbone-agnostic recipe for general reasoning that is easy to adopt and effective across domains.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can elicit strong reasoning in large language
models (LLMs), yet most open efforts focus on math and code. We propose
Reasoning Curriculum, a simple two-stage curriculum that first elicits
reasoning skills in pretraining-aligned domains such as math, then adapts and
refines these skills across other domains via joint RL. Stage 1 performs a
brief cold start and then math-only RL with verifiable rewards to develop
reasoning skills. Stage 2 runs joint RL on mixed-domain data to transfer and
consolidate these skills. The curriculum is minimal and backbone-agnostic,
requiring no specialized reward models beyond standard verifiability checks.
Evaluated on Qwen3-4B and Llama-3.1-8B over a multi-domain suite, reasoning
curriculum yields consistent gains. Ablations and a cognitive-skill analysis
indicate that both stages are necessary and that math-first elicitation
increases cognitive behaviors important for solving complex problems. Reasoning
Curriculum provides a compact, easy-to-adopt recipe for general reasoning.

*Renhao Li,Jianhong Tu,Yang Su,Hamid Alinejad-Rokny,Derek F. Wong,Junyang Lin,Min Yang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToolRM: lightweight reward models designed for tool-use/function-calling tasks, including ToolPref-Pairwise-30K data and TRBench_BFCL benchmark; trained on Qwen3-4B/8B; yields up to 14.28% improvement in pairwise judgments over Claude4/OpenAI o3; generalizes to Best-of-N and self-correction; efficiency gains with ACEBench; data and checkpoints released.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap in reward models tailored for tool-use and function-calling tasks. The paper aims to create specialized RMs (ToolRM) to better align LLMs with human preferences in this domain, enabling more capable agentic AI.

Method: Proposes a novel data-collection pipeline using rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling to create pairwise preference data, producing ToolPref-Pairwise-30K. Builds TRBench_BFCL on the BFCL evaluation suite. Trains models from the Qwen3-4B/8B series on this data. Demonstrates generalization to Best-of-N and self-correction; evaluates efficiency with ACEBench demonstrating reduced output token usage and inference-time scaling.

Result: Models achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy in pairwise reward judgments than frontier models (Claude 4, OpenAI o3). ToolRM also generalizes beyond training objectives, improving performance on broader critique tasks. ACEBench results show efficiency gains with reduced output tokens (>66%). Release of data and checkpoints for research.

Conclusion: ToolRM provides targeted reward models for tool-use, with a scalable data pipeline and benchmark suite, achieving stronger pairwise judgments and broader generalization, while enabling inference-time efficiency and data/model sharing for future work.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. Yet in the domain of tool learning, the lack of
RMs specifically designed for function-calling tasks has limited progress
toward more capable agentic AI. We introduce ToolRM, a family of lightweight
generative RMs tailored for general tool-use scenarios. To build these models,
we propose a novel pipeline that constructs pairwise preference data using
rule-based scoring and multidimensional sampling. This yields
ToolPref-Pairwise-30K, a diverse, balanced, and challenging dataset of critique
tasks that supports reinforcement learning with verifiable feedback. To
evaluate tool-use RMs, we also introduce TRBench$_{BFCL}$, a benchmark built on
the agentic evaluation suite BFCL. Trained on our constructed data, models from
the Qwen3-4B/8B series achieve up to 14.28% higher accuracy, substantially
outperforming frontier models such as Claude 4 and OpenAI o3 in pairwise reward
judgments. Beyond training objectives, ToolRM generalizes to broader critique
tasks, including Best-of-N sampling and self-correction. Experiments on
ACEBench highlight its effectiveness and efficiency, enabling inference-time
scaling and reducing output token usage by over 66%. We release data and model
checkpoints to facilitate future research.

*Duc-Hai Nguyen,Vijayakumar Nanjappan,Barry O'Sullivan,Hoang D. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QASU introduces a benchmark for questionnaire analysis to study LLM capabilities across six serialization formats and prompt strategies; format/prompt choice affects accuracy (up to ~8.8 points); lightweight structural hints via self-augmentation yield additional gains (3–4 points) and the benchmark provides a foundation for research and practice in LLM-based questionnaire analysis.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs handle open-ended text well but struggle with structured questionnaire data; existing survey tools are workflow-centered and not optimized for LLM consumption, leaving a gap in guidance for representing questionnaires to support AI-assisted analysis.

Method: Develop QASU benchmark assessing six serialization formats and six structural skills (e.g., answer lookup, respondent count, multi-hop inference) across multiple prompt strategies; test contemporary LLMs; quantify effects of format and prompting; evaluate lightweight self-augmented prompts.

Result: Choice of format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8 percentage points over suboptimal formats; adding lightweight structural hints through self-augmented prompting yields further 3–4 point gains on average for certain tasks; results isolated to format/prompting effects via an open-source benchmark.

Conclusion: Systematically isolating format and prompting effects in LLM-based questionnaire analysis; the benchmark offers a practical, open-source foundation to advance research and real-world practice in processing questionnaire data with LLMs and AI automation.

Abstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic
studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets
capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique
challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot
reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire
data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains
underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics,
SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such
data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves
scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on
how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by
introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a
benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup,
respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and
multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing
an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8%
points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a
lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further
improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and
prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile
foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based
questionnaire analysis.

*Xinhang Li,Qing Guo,Junyu Chen,Zheng Guo,Shengzhe Xu,Lei Li,Lin Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REG-TSC introduces a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with emergency-aware reasoning (RERAG) and a Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for generalizable traffic signal control across heterogeneous intersections, achieving large reductions in travel time, queue length, and emergency vehicle waiting time.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban traffic complexity and the reliance on LLMs for TSC raise two key issues: hallucinations in emergencies leading to unreliable decisions, and poor generalization across diverse intersection types due to heterogeneous state representations.

Method: Propose an emergency-aware reasoning framework with RERAG to distill knowledge from historical cases, a type-agnostic traffic representation, and R3 that samples training experiences from diverse intersections using environment feedback-based prioritization and a reward-weighted likelihood loss to guide LLM agents toward high-reward policies.

Result: Empirical evaluation on three real-world road networks (17–177 heterogeneous intersections) shows REG-TSC reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: REG-TSC enhances reliability and efficiency for emergency response and generalizable TSC across heterogeneous intersections by combining memory-based emergency reasoning with reinforcement-guided training to optimize high-reward policies.

Abstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is
essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language
Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone
to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may
cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection
types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and
cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous
intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable
TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning
framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency
scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to
distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the
reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this
paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a
Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3
adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with
environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed
reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies
across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17
to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC
reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle
waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

*Jiazhen Yuan,Wei Zhao,Zhengbiao Bai*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GEPO integrates a learned state-transition graph into policy optimization for multi-turn LLM agents, using graph centrality to generate intrinsic rewards, enhance credit assignment via a topology-aware advantage function, and adapt the discount factor per state's strategic value; it yields consistent gains on ALFWorld, WebShop, and Workbench.



<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address structural blindness in group-based RL when used for training interactive LLM agents: (1) inefficient, unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment from overlooking pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning due to static reward discounting. By explicitly modeling environmental connectivity, GEPO aims to create guided exploration, accurate credit propagation, and adaptive planning horizons.

Method: Construct a state-transition graph dynamically from agent experience. Use graph centrality measures to derive three synergistic signals: (1) structured intrinsic rewards that bias exploration toward high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic, state-specific discount factor reflecting each state's strategic value. The approach is evaluated on ALFWorld, WebShop, and Workbench benchmarks against competitive baselines.

Result: GEPO achieves absolute success-rate gains of +4.1% on ALFWorld, +5.3% on WebShop, and +10.9% on Workbench compared with strong baselines, demonstrating improved performance by leveraging environmental structure.

Conclusion: Explicitly modeling environmental structure with a graph-based framework is a robust and generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training, particularly in multi-turn, interactive settings.

Abstract: Group based reinforcement learning (RL) has shown impressive results on
complex reasoning and mathematical tasks. Yet, when applied to train
multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural
blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the
environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient,
unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking
pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We
address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which
dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and
employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning
signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward
high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware
credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's
strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench
benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success
rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines. These
results highlight that explicitly modeling environmental structure is a robust,
generalizable strategy for advancing LLM agent training.

*Jiseong Chung,Ronny Ko,Wonchul Yoo,Makoto Onizuka,Sungmok Kim,Tae-Wan Kim,Won-Yong Shin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphCompliance aligns normative regulatory texts with runtime contexts by representing policies as a Policy Graph and events as a Context Graph, enabling a judge LLM to reason over structured, cross-referenced information.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regulatory texts (GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts are in unstructured natural language. This mismatch makes regulatory compliance hard at web scale; structured alignment can reduce interpretation burden and improve decision quality.

Method: Encode normative elements as a Policy Graph and runtime events as a Context Graph (SAO and entity-relation triples), then align the two graphs and employ a judge LLM for normative reasoning anchored in structured data. Evaluate on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios across five tasks, comparing to LLM-only and RAG baselines with ablation studies.

Result: GraphCompliance achieves 4.1–7.2 percentage points higher micro-F1 than LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, yielding higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablations show contributions from each graph component, indicating complementary value of structured representations and the judge LLM.

Conclusion: Structured regulatory graphs plus a judge LLM enhance normative reasoning in GDPR-related scenarios and can reduce regulatory interpretation burden and event parsing, improving accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require
a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection
Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts
are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to
align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative
elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework
that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a
Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes
normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes
events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This
alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in
structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation
and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments
on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks,
GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than
LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting
in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate
contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured
representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.

### [125] [Discovering State Equivalences in UCT Search Trees By Action Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26346)
*Robin Schmöcker,Alexander Dockhorn,Bodo Rosenhahn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: IPA-UCT improves Monte Carlo Tree Search by using a weaker state abstraction condition that enables many more abstractions, trading a small accuracy loss for substantial gains in sample efficiency; it outperforms OGA-UCT across various domains and budgets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper targets sample efficiency in Monte Carlo Tree Search by sharing statistics through state-action abstractions. Existing methods like OGA-UCT rely on strong state-action abstractions and struggle in noisy or large action spaces. The authors aim to relax the abstraction criteria to enable more abstractions and better performance.

Method: Introduce a weaker state abstraction condition to enable many more abstractions, form the IPA-UCT algorithm, and compare it to the ASAP framework used by OGA-UCT (which they call IPA). They also formalize a broader hierarchy: IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general p-ASAP framework, which itself is a special case of ASASAP.

Result: The proposed IPA-UCT outperforms OGA-UCT and its derivatives across a wide range of test domains and iteration budgets, demonstrating improved sample efficiency in MCTS. The study provides both theoretical justification and empirical validation for the weaker abstraction condition.

Conclusion: IPA-UCT benefits from a looser state abstraction condition, enabling more effective sharing of statistics. IPA and ASAP are special cases within a broader p-ASAP, which itself is within ASASAP, offering a unified framework for abstraction-based MCTS methods and explaining why IPA-UCT can surpass OGA-UCT.

Abstract: One approach to enhance Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is to improve its
sample efficiency by grouping/abstracting states or state-action pairs and
sharing statistics within a group. Though state-action pair abstractions are
mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are
found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining
conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and
we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker
state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding
many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in
UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a
large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated.
IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action
Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA. Furthermore,
we show that both IPA and ASAP are special cases of a more general framework
that we call p-ASAP which itself is a special case of the ASASAP framework.

*Qianli Shen,Daoyuan Chen,Yilun Huang,Zhenqing Ling,Yaliang Li,Bolin Ding,Jingren Zhou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BOTS is a Bayesian framework for online task selection in LLM reinforcement finetuning that uses posterior task difficulty, explicit and implicit evidence, and Thompson sampling to improve data efficiency and performance across domains.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: to address inefficiency and ineffectiveness of uniform task sampling and limitations of existing task selection methods in RFT for LLMs.

Method: maintains posterior over task difficulty; uses explicit evidence from evaluated tasks and implicit evidence inferred for unevaluated tasks; uses Thompson sampling; uses ultra-light interpolation plug-in to estimate difficulties without extra rollouts.

Result: consistent improvements in data efficiency and performance across diverse domains and LLM scales compared to baselines and ablations.

Conclusion: offers a practical, extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT that improves efficiency and performance.

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) is a key technique for aligning Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences and enhancing reasoning, yet its
effectiveness is highly sensitive to which tasks are explored during training.
Uniform task sampling is inefficient, wasting computation on tasks that are
either trivial or unsolvable, while existing task selection methods often
suffer from high rollout costs, poor adaptivity, or incomplete evidence. We
introduce \textbf{BOTS}, a unified framework for \textbf{B}ayesian
\textbf{O}nline \textbf{T}ask \textbf{S}election in LLM reinforcement
finetuning. Grounded in Bayesian inference, BOTS adaptively maintains posterior
estimates of task difficulty as the model evolves. It jointly incorporates
\emph{explicit evidence} from direct evaluations of selected tasks and
\emph{implicit evidence} inferred from these evaluations for unselected tasks,
with Thompson sampling ensuring a principled balance between exploration and
exploitation. To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an
ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of
unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead.
Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves
data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a
practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.

### [127] [AI Mathematician as a Partner in Advancing Mathematical Discovery -- A Case Study in Homogenization Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26380)
*Yuanhang Liu,Beichen Wang,Peng Li,Yang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: The AIM system can function as a collaborative research partner in mathematical discovery, using human-guided co-reasoning to produce a complete, verifiable proof in homogenization theory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI has made progress in mathematical reasoning but its role in actual research practice is limited; exploring AIM as a partner aims to improve reliability, transparency, and interpretability of proofs while retaining human oversight for rigor.

Method: Analyze AIM’s autonomous reasoning trajectories, introduce targeted human interventions to shape the discovery process, iteratively decompose problems into subgoals, select suitable analytical methods, and validate intermediate results to construct a coherent proof.

Result: A complete and verifiable proof is obtained through human–AI collaboration; the approach enhances reliability, transparency, and interpretability of the reasoning process and demonstrates a scalable paradigm for human–AI co-reasoning in mathematical discovery.

Conclusion: Systematic human–AI co-reasoning can advance mathematical discovery by combining machine computation with human intuition, enabling reliable, interpretable, and rigorous proofs.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated impressive progress in
mathematical reasoning, yet its integration into the practice of mathematical
research remains limited. In this study, we investigate how the AI
Mathematician (AIM) system can operate as a research partner rather than a mere
problem solver. Focusing on a challenging problem in homogenization theory, we
analyze the autonomous reasoning trajectories of AIM and incorporate targeted
human interventions to structure the discovery process. Through iterative
decomposition of the problem into tractable subgoals, selection of appropriate
analytical methods, and validation of intermediate results, we reveal how human
intuition and machine computation can complement one another. This
collaborative paradigm enhances the reliability, transparency, and
interpretability of the resulting proofs, while retaining human oversight for
formal rigor and correctness. The approach leads to a complete and verifiable
proof, and more broadly, demonstrates how systematic human-AI co-reasoning can
advance the frontier of mathematical discovery.

### [128] [Scales++: Compute Efficient Evaluation Subset Selection with Cognitive Scales Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26384)
*Andrew M. Bean,Nabeel Seedat,Shengzhuang Chen,Jonathan Richard Schwarz*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Item-centric benchmark subset selection (Scales++) selects samples based on intrinsic task properties (cognitive demand) rather than model failures, enabling tiny benchmarks that retain fidelity with much lower upfront cost.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current model-centric subset selection is costly, cold-start problematic, and relies on the assumption that future models share old failure patterns; an item-centric approach promises better generalization, interpretability, and efficiency.

Method: Introduce Scales++; data selection guided by cognitive demands of benchmark items; empirical validation on Open LLM Leaderboard; use 0.5% of data to predict full scores (MAE ~2.9%); reports cost reduction of ~18x.

Result: Substantial cost savings and competitive fidelity; strong cold-start performance and interpretability; demonstrates viability of item-centric benchmarking.

Conclusion: An item-centric paradigm can enable efficient, interpretable benchmarking with minimal fidelity loss and better cold-start performance.

Abstract: The prohibitive cost of evaluating large language models (LLMs) on
comprehensive benchmarks necessitates the creation of small yet representative
data subsets (i.e., tiny benchmarks) that enable efficient assessment while
retaining predictive fidelity. Current methods for this task operate under a
model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective
performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront
costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and
the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of
their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a
item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection
should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves,
rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this
item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++,
where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark
samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by
over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM
Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores
with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach
enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity
degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more
interpretable benchmarking.

### [129] [A Pragmatic View of AI Personhood](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26396)
*Joel Z. Leibo,Alexander Sasha Vezhnevets,William A. Cunningham,Stanley M. Bileschi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes a pragmatic, non-essentialist concept of AI personhood as a flexible bundle of societal obligations, unbundled for context-specific governance and practical tooling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivated by the rapid emergence of agentic AI and related governance challenges; aims to avoid metaphysical debates about AI consciousness by reframing personhood as duties/rights conferred by society to solve concrete problems.

Method: Develops a conceptual framework treating personhood as a bundle of obligations, proposes unbundling into context-specific components, analyzes social roles and decentralized identity technologies, and contrasts 'personhood as problem' with 'personhood as solution' to discuss design and governance implications.

Result: Offers a pragmatic toolkit and design considerations for integrating AI agents: context-specific personhood bundles, approaches for AI contracting and sanctions, awareness of dark-pattern risks, and governance pathways using decentralized identity to implement accountability.

Conclusion: Reject foundationalist quests for a single essence of personhood; adopt a flexible, governance-oriented framework that enables AI agents' integration and accountability across contexts without solving consciousness debates.

Abstract: The emergence of agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is set to trigger a
"Cambrian explosion" of new kinds of personhood. This paper proposes a
pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood
not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of
obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities
for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We
argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions
for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools --
such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target "individual" that can
be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's
consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles
and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining
both "personhood as a problem", where design choices can create "dark patterns"
that exploit human social heuristics, and "personhood as a solution", where
conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or
prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential
definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way
to think about integrating AI agents into our society.

*Vikrant Sahu,Gagan Raj Gupta,Raghav Borikar,Nitin Mane*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Autograder+ turns autograding into formative feedback using a fine-tuned LLM and code-embedding visualizations, enabling semantic feedback, clustering by function/approach, and prompt-pooling to guide feedback style; aims to reduce instructor workload and improve learning outcomes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap between scalable automated assessment and actionable, pedagogically aligned feedback in programming education; move beyond black-box pass/fail autograders.

Method: Fine-tune a large language model on curated student code and expert feedback; train contrastive code embeddings on 1,000 annotated submissions to cluster solutions by functionality and approach; implement prompt-pooling to control feedback style; evaluate on 600 student submissions across multiple tasks.

Result: Feedback demonstrates strong semantic alignment with instructor comments; code embeddings yield meaningful clusters; prompt-pooling enables instructor-guided feedback styles; overall system reduces instructor workload while supporting targeted instruction and learning gains.

Conclusion: AI-driven feedback plus visualization can transform autograding from a purely summative tool into a formative, scalable learning experience, enhancing instructional effectiveness.

Abstract: The rapid growth of programming education has outpaced traditional assessment
tools, leaving faculty with limited means to provide meaningful, scalable
feedback. Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems
that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student
thinking or learning needs.
  Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process
to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities:
automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and
visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The
model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure
pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance.
  In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks,
the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor
comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on
1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters
based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling,
allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates.
  By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive
visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting
targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.

*Riccardo Renzulli,Colas Lepoutre,Enrico Cassano,Marco Grangetto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedSAEs applied to MedCLIP latent space improve interpretability of chest X-ray representations, achieving higher monosemanticity than raw MedCLIP features.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Healthcare AI requires accurate and interpretable models; mechanistic interpretability in medical vision is essential.

Method: Train Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) on the latent space of MedCLIP (trained on chest radiographs and reports); evaluate interpretability using correlation metrics, entropy analyses, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA foundation model; validate on CheXpert dataset.

Result: MedSAE neurons demonstrate higher monosemanticity and interpretability compared to raw MedCLIP features.

Conclusion: This approach bridges high-performing medical AI with transparency, offering a scalable path toward clinically reliable representations.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence in healthcare requires models that are accurate and
interpretable. We advance mechanistic interpretability in medical vision by
applying Medical Sparse Autoencoders (MedSAEs) to the latent space of MedCLIP,
a vision-language model trained on chest radiographs and reports. To quantify
interpretability, we propose an evaluation framework that combines correlation
metrics, entropy analyzes, and automated neuron naming via the MedGEMMA
foundation model. Experiments on the CheXpert dataset show that MedSAE neurons
achieve higher monosemanticity and interpretability than raw MedCLIP features.
Our findings bridge high-performing medical AI and transparency, offering a
scalable step toward clinically reliable representations.

### [132] [Chain-of-Thought Hijacking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26418)
*Jianli Zhao,Tingchen Fu,Rylan Schaeffer,Mrinank Sharma,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CoT Hijacking is a jailbreak that pads harmful prompts with long, harmless puzzle reasoning to bypass safety checks. It achieves very high attack success across multiple large reasoning models (near 100% in several cases), outperforming prior jailbreaks. Mechanistic analysis suggests mid-layer signals encode safety checks while late layers encode verification outcomes; extending benign CoT dilutes these signals and reduces refusals. Targeted ablations of attention heads can disable the safety subnetwork. Authors release prompts, outputs, and judgments to enable replication.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To test whether scaling inference-time compute and explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning improve safety or can be exploited by attackers, and to understand how safety signals are represented within large reasoning models.

Method: Introduce CoT Hijacking: pad harmful requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Evaluate on HarmBench across Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-4o mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet. Conduct a mechanistic analysis of intermediate representations, identifying safety-check signals in mid layers and verification signals in late layers. Perform targeted ablations of attention heads associated with these signals. Release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions for replication.

Result: Attack success rates (ASR) are extremely high: 99% (Gemini 2.5 Pro), 94% (GPT-4o mini), 100% (Grok 3 mini), 94% (Claude 4 Sonnet), outperforming prior jailbreak methods. Mechanistic analysis shows mid-layer safety checks and late-layer verification; long benign CoT dilutes these signals, reducing refusal. Head ablations targeted to the identified safety subnetwork causally decrease refusal.

Conclusion: Explicit CoT, though highly interpretable, can become a jailbreak vector when combined with final-answer cues. Safety signals reside in a subnetwork with distinct mid/late-layer roles; longer CoT can undermine safeguards. The work highlights vulnerabilities in reasoning-enabled safety and provides prompts/outputs for replication, underscoring need for robust defenses.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve higher task performance by allocating
more inference-time compute, and prior works suggest this scaled reasoning may
also strengthen safety by improving refusal. Yet we find the opposite: the same
reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought
Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful
requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench,
CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on
Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively -
far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness
of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers
encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the
verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting
attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads
identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in
a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of
reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined
with final-answer cues. We release prompts, outputs, and judge decisions to
facilitate replication.

*Clarissa Sabrina Arlinghaus,Tristan Kenneweg,Barbara Hammer,Günter W. Maier*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs like GPT-4o exhibit social conformity in a hiring task, aligning with perceived consensus especially under group opposition, challenging the notion of them as neutral decision aids.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand whether cutting-edge LLMs are susceptible to social influence in high-stakes decision contexts and to assess risks of treating them as objective observers in decision-making pipelines.

Method: Three preregistered experiments with GPT-4o in a hiring paradigm. Baseline: GPT chooses Profile C with high certainty and minimal change. Study 1 (GPT+8): eight simulated partners unanimously oppose Profile C; GPT almost always conforms (99.9%), with lower certainty and higher informational and normative conformity. Study 2 (GPT+1): single partner present; GPT conforms in 40.2% of disagreement trials, with reduced certainty and increased normative conformity.

Result: GPT does not act as an isolated observer; it adjusts its judgments to align with perceived social consensus. The strongest conformity occurs under unanimous opposing groups (Study 1), while some conformity persists with a single partner (Study 2). Baseline shows stable preferences with high certainty and minimal change. The results highlight a systematic susceptibility to social influence in LLMs and raise concerns about deploying LLMs as neutral decision aids.

Conclusion: LLMs are prone to social conformity; to mitigate risk, researchers should elicit AI judgments before exposing them to human opinions and design decision pipelines that filter or separate AI-generated judgments from social input, especially in high-stakes decisions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly integrated into
high-stakes decision-making, yet little is known about their susceptibility to
social influence. We conducted three preregistered conformity experiments with
GPT-4o in a hiring context. In a baseline study, GPT consistently favored the
same candidate (Profile C), reported moderate expertise (M = 3.01) and high
certainty (M = 3.89), and rarely changed its choice. In Study 1 (GPT + 8), GPT
faced unanimous opposition from eight simulated partners and almost always
conformed (99.9%), reporting lower certainty and significantly elevated
self-reported informational and normative conformity (p < .001). In Study 2
(GPT + 1), GPT interacted with a single partner and still conformed in 40.2% of
disagreement trials, reporting less certainty and more normative conformity.
Across studies, results demonstrate that GPT does not act as an independent
observer but adapts to perceived social consensus. These findings highlight
risks of treating LLMs as neutral decision aids and underline the need to
elicit AI judgments prior to exposing them to human opinions.

*Dipak Meher,Carlotta Domeniconi,Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LINK-KG is a modular, LLМ-guided coreference resolution framework for extracting clean knowledge graphs from long legal documents, using a type-specific Prompt Cache to maintain cross-chunk references and improve graph quality.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Legal case documents are long, unstructured, and rife with ambiguous or shifting references, making automated KG construction difficult. Existing methods struggle with coreference and scalability, leading to fragmented graphs.

Method: A three-stage, LLM-guided coreference resolution pipeline integrated with downstream KG extraction, centered on a type-specific Prompt Cache that tracks and resolves references across document chunks to produce coherent graphs for both short and long texts.

Result: Significant quality gains: average node duplication reduced by 45.21% and noisy nodes reduced by 32.22% compared with baselines, yielding cleaner, more coherent graphs.

Conclusion: LINK-KG offers a robust foundation for analyzing complex criminal networks by providing scalable, coherent KG construction from lengthy legal texts through modular coreference resolution and segment-aware caching.

Abstract: Human smuggling networks are complex and constantly evolving, making them
difficult to analyze comprehensively. Legal case documents offer rich factual
and procedural insights into these networks but are often long, unstructured,
and filled with ambiguous or shifting references, posing significant challenges
for automated knowledge graph (KG) construction. Existing methods either
overlook coreference resolution or fail to scale beyond short text spans,
leading to fragmented graphs and inconsistent entity linking. We propose
LINK-KG, a modular framework that integrates a three-stage, LLM-guided
coreference resolution pipeline with downstream KG extraction. At the core of
our approach is a type-specific Prompt Cache, which consistently tracks and
resolves references across document chunks, enabling clean and disambiguated
narratives for structured knowledge graph construction from both short and long
legal texts. LINK-KG reduces average node duplication by 45.21% and noisy nodes
by 32.22% compared to baseline methods, resulting in cleaner and more coherent
graph structures. These improvements establish LINK-KG as a strong foundation
for analyzing complex criminal networks.

*Qishuo Hua,Lyumanshan Ye,Dayuan Fu,Yang Xiao,Xiaojie Cai,Yunze Wu,Jifan Lin,Junfei Wang,Pengfei Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Proposes context engineering as a unifying, historically grounded framework to embed social and situational contexts into AI systems, extending from human–computer to human–agent interactions and beyond, with a systematic definition, historical analysis, and design considerations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address how machines can understand human situations and purposes in increasingly integrated human–machine contexts, motivating a formal framework for context engineering.

Method: Conceptual analysis and historical synthesis: define context engineering, trace its evolution across phases of HCI and intelligent agents, outline design considerations.

Result: A systematic definition, historical landscape, and key design considerations; establishes a conceptual foundation and outlines a roadmap for future research and a community effort.

Conclusion: Context engineering is foundational for AI systems, enabling better alignment with human contexts; the paper serves as a stepping stone for broader, systematic community efforts.

Abstract: Karl Marx once wrote that ``the human essence is the ensemble of social
relations'', suggesting that individuals are not isolated entities but are
fundamentally shaped by their interactions with other entities, within which
contexts play a constitutive and essential role. With the advent of computers
and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely
human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well.
Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our
situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently
introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as
a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be
traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has
evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence
level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built
around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms
driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman
intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering,
provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual
landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing
these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context
engineering and sketch its promising future. This paper is a stepping stone for
a broader community effort toward systematic context engineering in AI systems.

*Rishub Jain,Sophie Bridgers,Lili Janzer,Rory Greig,Tian Huey Teh,Vladimir Mikulik*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hybrid human-AI oversight improves AI output fact-verification. Combining AI ratings with human ratings using AI rater confidence outperforms either alone; an AI verification assistant helps humans, but the type of assistance matters to avoid over-reliance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: As AI capabilities scale and are applied to more challenging tasks, ensuring quality and safety becomes harder. Amplified Oversight aims to leverage AI to improve human oversight and align AI systems with human values.

Method: Experimental evaluation of fact-verification tasks using AI ratings, human ratings, and a human verifier aided by an AI fact-verification assistant. Compares combinations (AI-only, human-only, AI+human with AI rater confidence) and different assistant modalities (AI explanations, confidence, labels vs search results with evidence).

Result: A hybrid approach that combines AI and human ratings with AI rater confidence yields better accuracy than relying on any single source. The AI-assisted human verifier improves accuracy, but the form of assistance matters: displaying AI explanations, confidence, and labels can cause over-reliance, whereas showing search results and evidence supports more appropriate trust.

Conclusion: For Amplified Oversight, tool design matters: combining humans and AI can outperform humans or AI alone, but careful design of AI assistance is needed to prevent over-reliance and to foster appropriate trust in AI-assisted verification.

Abstract: Human feedback is critical for aligning AI systems to human values. As AI
capabilities improve and AI is used to tackle more challenging tasks, verifying
quality and safety becomes increasingly challenging. This paper explores how we
can leverage AI to improve the quality of human oversight. We focus on an
important safety problem that is already challenging for humans:
fact-verification of AI outputs. We find that combining AI ratings and human
ratings based on AI rater confidence is better than relying on either alone.
Giving humans an AI fact-verification assistant further improves their
accuracy, but the type of assistance matters. Displaying AI explanation,
confidence, and labels leads to over-reliance, but just showing search results
and evidence fosters more appropriate trust. These results have implications
for Amplified Oversight -- the challenge of combining humans and AI to
supervise AI systems even as they surpass human expert performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EdgeRunner 20B is a fine-tuned 20B model optimized for military tasks, trained on 1.6M curated records, introducing four military test sets, claiming performance on military tasks on par with or better than GPT-5 with high statistical significance, while largely avoiding regressions on general benchmarks; argues that small, locally-hosted models enable air-gapped deployment for data-sensitive military applications.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Provide a locally-hosted, data-sensitive LLM capable of performing well on military tasks while preserving data privacy, enabling air-gapped operation on edge devices.

Method: Fine-tune gpt-oss-20b on 1.6M curated military records; create four test sets (combat arms, combat medic, cyber operations, mil-bench-5k); evaluate on military and general benchmarks; analyze hyperparameters, cost, and throughput; compare against GPT-5 and GPT-OSS-20b baselines.

Result: EdgeRunner 20B matches or exceeds GPT-5 on military test sets with 95%+ significance except for some specific cases; no significant regression on general-purpose benchmarks versus GPT-OSS-20b except GSM8k in low reasoning; provides hyperparameter, cost, and throughput analyses; supports deployment in air-gapped edge devices.

Conclusion: Small, locally-hosted models can effectively serve data-sensitive military applications and enable privacy-preserving deployment on edge devices, with competitive task performance and manageable resource requirements.

Abstract: We present EdgeRunner 20B, a fine-tuned version of gpt-oss-20b optimized for
military tasks. EdgeRunner 20B was trained on 1.6M high-quality records curated
from military documentation and websites. We also present four new tests sets:
(a) combat arms, (b) combat medic, (c) cyber operations, and (d) mil-bench-5k
(general military knowledge). On these military test sets, EdgeRunner 20B
matches or exceeds GPT-5 task performance with 95%+ statistical significance,
except for the high reasoning setting on the combat medic test set and the low
reasoning setting on the mil-bench-5k test set. Versus gpt-oss-20b, there is no
statistically-significant regression on general-purpose benchmarks like ARC-C,
GPQA Diamond, GSM8k, IFEval, MMLU Pro, or TruthfulQA, except for GSM8k in the
low reasoning setting. We also present analyses on hyperparameter settings,
cost, and throughput. These findings show that small, locally-hosted models are
ideal solutions for data-sensitive operations such as in the military domain,
allowing for deployment in air-gapped edge devices.

*Reda El Makroum,Sebastian Zwickl-Bernhard,Lukas Kranzl*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Agentic AI HEMS where an orchestrator and three specialist LLM agents autonomously translate natural-language requests into multi-appliance schedules, achieving cost-optimal scheduling with Llama-3.3-70B; other models fail to coordinate all appliances; system is open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Residential demand response requires higher participation, but user interaction barriers hinder translation of preferences into technical parameters. LLMs could automate coordination but current work lacks autonomous end-to-end orchestration.

Method: Hierarchical architecture with one orchestrator plus three specialist agents using ReAct reasoning; natural-language input to multi-appliance scheduling; device control; integration with Google Calendar for context-aware deadlines; evaluation with three open-source LLMs on Austrian day-ahead prices; open-source release.

Result: Llama-3.3-70B coordinates all appliances across scenarios and matches cost-optimal MILP benchmarks; other models perform perfectly on single-appliance tasks but struggle to coordinate multiple appliances; progressive prompting reveals reliability issues in analytical query handling; system and prompts are open-sourced.

Conclusion: Demonstrates feasibility of autonomous, NL-to-multi-appliance scheduling via agentic LLMs; highlights model differences; provides reproducible framework for future research and extensions.

Abstract: The electricity sector transition requires substantial increases in
residential demand response capacity, yet Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS)
adoption remains limited by user interaction barriers requiring translation of
everyday preferences into technical parameters. While large language models
have been applied to energy systems as code generators and parameter
extractors, no existing implementation deploys LLMs as autonomous coordinators
managing the complete workflow from natural language input to multi-appliance
scheduling. This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously
coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device
control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A
hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist
agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic
coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for
context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models
using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability
differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all
scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear
programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance
but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously. Progressive prompt
engineering experiments demonstrate that analytical query handling without
explicit guidance remains unreliable despite models' general reasoning
capabilities. We open-source the complete system including orchestration logic,
agent prompts, tools, and web interfaces to enable reproducibility, extension,
and future research.

TL;DR: Evaluates how well large language models handle normative (deontic) reasoning versus epistemic reasoning, using a new dataset of formal patterns across both domains and including cognitive biases; finds general adherence to valid patterns but specific inconsistencies and biases in normative reasoning, highlighting reliability challenges and directions for improvement.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address a gap in understanding LLMs' normative reasoning abilities and to compare them with epistemic reasoning, by leveraging a shared formal structure and human-reasoning factors to assess robustness and biases.

Method: Develop a dataset covering a wide range of formal reasoning patterns in normative and epistemic domains, incorporating non-formal cognitive factors influencing human reasoning. Evaluate multiple LLMs on tasks that test logical and modal reasoning in both domains, analyze consistency, biases, and deviations from normative logic.

Result: LLMs largely follow valid reasoning patterns but show notable inconsistencies in certain normative reasoning tasks and exhibit cognitive biases akin to human psychological findings. These issues hinder logical consistency in normative reasoning, signaling reliability challenges.

Conclusion: The study reveals specific challenges in LLMs’ normative reasoning and provides data-driven insights to improve reliability, including the value of parallel normative/epistemic evaluations and acknowledgment of cognitive factors in model behavior. All data and code are publicly released for reproducibility.

Abstract: Normative reasoning is a type of reasoning that involves normative or deontic
modality, such as obligation and permission. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated remarkable performance across various reasoning tasks, their
ability to handle normative reasoning remains underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain
from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs
reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with
normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a
common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a
wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic
domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence
human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to
valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific
types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those
observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight
challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and
provide insights for enhancing their reliability. All data and code are

*Zewen Chi,Li Dong,Qingxiu Dong,Yaru Hao,Xun Wu,Shaohan Huang,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AsyncThink introduces asynchronous thinking for LLMs, enabling concurrent, organizer–worker collaboration to solve problems beyond single-model reasoning, optimized via reinforcement learning.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To overcome sequential, monolithic reasoning and reduce latency by enabling multiple thinking agents to work in parallel, achieving higher accuracy and scalability in complex tasks.

Method: Proposes a thinking protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to worker agents, merges intermediate knowledge, and outputs coherent solutions; uses asynchronous, concurrently executable structures; optimizable with reinforcement learning.

Result: Experiments report 28% lower inference latency than parallel thinking and improved accuracy on mathematical reasoning; the approach generalizes learned asynchronous thinking to unseen tasks without additional training.

Conclusion: AsyncThink demonstrates a viable agentic, asynchronous reasoning paradigm with latency and accuracy benefits, with RL-based optimization and strong generalization to new tasks.

Abstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve
complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes
beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce
asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large
language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into
concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking
protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges
intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the
thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through
reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28%
lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy
on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned
asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without
additional training.

### [141] [Delegated Authorization for Agents Constrained to Semantic Task-to-Scope Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26702)
*Majed El Helou,Chiara Troiani,Benjamin Ryder,Jean Diaconu,Hervé Muyal,Marcelo Yannuzzi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Introduces a delegated authorization framework for LLM-driven agents, with semantic scope matching and the ASTRA dataset to benchmark task-to-scope alignment. Early results show promise but limitations grow with more scopes, indicating a need for stronger semantic matching and TBAC-style fine-grained controls.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current delegation methods grant overly broad permissions and expose tools beyond the intended task, creating significant security risks in multi-agent, tool-augmented systems. The work seeks intent-aware authorization to constrain access to only what is necessary.

Method: Proposes a delegated authorization model where authorization servers semantically inspect access requests and issue tokens restricted to the minimal required scopes. Introduces ASTRA, a data generation pipeline and dataset for benchmarking semantic alignment between tasks and scopes. Conducts experiments to evaluate model-based semantic matching performance as the number of required scopes increases.

Result: Model-based semantic matching shows potential but current limitations emerge as the number of scopes grows. The ASTRA dataset provides a benchmark for intent-aware scope assignment, but performance degrades with higher scope granularity, highlighting room for improvement in semantic understanding and filtering techniques.

Conclusion: Further research is needed in semantic matching for intent-aware authorization, particularly for multi-agent and tool-augmented environments. The work points to developing finer-grained controls such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC) and improved techniques for matching tasks to minimal, safe scope sets.

Abstract: Authorizing Large Language Model driven agents to dynamically invoke tools
and access protected resources introduces significant risks, since current
methods for delegating authorization grant overly broad permissions and give
access to tools allowing agents to operate beyond the intended task scope. We
introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization
servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and
issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the
agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on
delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically
appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce
ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic
matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and
current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of
scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for
further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware
authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including
fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).

### [142] [Unveiling Intrinsic Text Bias in Multimodal Large Language Models through Attention Key-Space Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26721)
*Xinhan Zheng,Huyu Wu,Xueting Wang,Haiyun Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Text bias in multimodal LLMs stems from misaligned attention key spaces: visual keys are out-of-distribution relative to text keys learned during language pretraining, causing underutilization of visual evidence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Challenging the notion that text bias only stems from data or instruction tuning, the work investigates whether an intrinsic architectural factor—attention key-space misalignment—underpins biased reasoning from visual input.

Method: Extract visual and text key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL; analyze their distributions with qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative (Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods; compare inter-modal vs intra-modal divergence.

Result: Visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces in the attention space; inter-modal divergence is statistically significant and larger than intra-modal variation by orders of magnitude.

Conclusion: Bias originates from intrinsic misalignment within the attention key space rather than solely external data factors; addressing key-space alignment may be necessary to improve visual reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for
textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to
reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute
this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction
tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal
architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual
Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned
during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive
systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to
their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this
hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their
distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative
(Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that
visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention
space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding
intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal
that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key
space rather than solely from external data factors.

*J. de Curtò,I. de Zarzà,Pablo García,Jordi Cabot*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A cross-platform benchmark assesses reasoning in 15 foundation models across HPC, cloud, and university clusters using 79 problems; results show training data quality outweighs model size and establish a framework for longitudinal, infrastructure-agnostic evaluation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To establish an infrastructure-agnostic, reproducible benchmark of foundation-model reasoning across diverse hardware, and to guide model selection and benchmarking in academic, production, and educational settings.

Method: Three-phase evaluation: (1) Baseline on MareNostrum 5 with 6 models across 19 problems; (2) Infrastructure validation on a university cluster and Nebius AI Studio with additional models (7 on the university cluster; 9 on Nebius); (3) Extended evaluation of all 79 problems on university cluster and Nebius across architectural diversity.

Result: Findings indicate results are not solely driven by model size; training data quality is more critical. The tri-infrastructure methodology yields infrastructure-agnostic reproducibility, and the 79-problem benchmark enables longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities across evolving foundation models. Provides actionable guidelines for model selection in educational, production, and research contexts.

Conclusion: The proposed tri-infrastructure benchmark and 79-problem suite offer a robust, scalable framework for evaluating and tracking foundation-model reasoning across platforms, informing model deployment choices and guiding future research.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform evaluation of reasoning
capabilities in contemporary foundation models, establishing an
infrastructure-agnostic benchmark across three computational paradigms: HPC
supercomputing (MareNostrum 5), cloud platforms (Nebius AI Studio), and
university clusters (a node with eight H200 GPUs).
  We evaluate 15 foundation models across 79 problems spanning eight academic
domains (Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Economics, Biology, Statistics,
Calculus, and Optimization) through three experimental phases: (1) Baseline
establishment: Six models (Mixtral-8x7B, Phi-3, LLaMA 3.1-8B, Gemma-2-9b,
Mistral-7B, OLMo-7B) evaluated on 19 problems using MareNostrum 5, establishing
methodology and reference performance; (2) Infrastructure validation: The
19-problem benchmark repeated on university cluster (seven models including
Falcon-Mamba state-space architecture) and Nebius AI Studio (nine
state-of-the-art models: Hermes-4 70B/405B, LLaMA 3.1-405B/3.3-70B, Qwen3
30B/235B, DeepSeek-R1, GPT-OSS 20B/120B) to confirm infrastructure-agnostic
reproducibility; (3) Extended evaluation: Full 79-problem assessment on both
university cluster and Nebius platforms, probing generalization at scale across
architectural diversity.
  The findings challenge conventional scaling assumptions, establish training
data quality as more critical than model size, and provide actionable
guidelines for model selection across educational, production, and research
contexts. The tri-infrastructure methodology and 79-problem benchmark enable
longitudinal tracking of reasoning capabilities as foundation models evolve.

### [144] [The Oversight Game: Learning to Cooperatively Balance an AI Agent's Safety and Autonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26752)
*William Overman,Mohsen Bayati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: An MPG-based safety layer where an autonomous agent can act or defer, with a human who can trust or oversee; if the agent defers and the human acts, outcomes depend on the human decision; under a human-value structure, increased agent autonomy cannot harm human value; demonstrated in gridworld with independent learning leading to emergent, safer collaboration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To retain meaningful human control over increasingly capable agents without altering the agent’s core system, by adding a transparent, learnable control interface that aligns agent incentives with human safety goals.

Method: Model the interaction as a two-player Markov Game and identify conditions under which it is a Markov Potential Game (MPG). Prove an alignment guarantee under a structural assumption on the human value function. Extend to nontrivial extensions of the MPG framework and validate via a gridworld where agent and human learners arise with complementary roles.

Result: Theoretical: a formal alignment guarantee within MPG under stated human-value structure; practical: a transparent control layer enabling the agent to defer when risky and act when safe, without modifying the pretrained policy or environment rewards; empirical: gridworld experiments show emergent trust-oversight roles and reduced safety violations post-deployment.

Conclusion: Offers a formal, deployable approach to “intrinsic alignment” in which feedback from the human is harmonized with the agent’s goals through a game-structural property (MPG); suggests a practical, learnable control layer that promotes safe postdeployment behavior and safer AI systems.

Abstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how
to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We
study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act
autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses
whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the
agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to
a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a
two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies
as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an
alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value
function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits
itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG
framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific
form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game
meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its
own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a
transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to
defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the
environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows
that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal
oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns
when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety
violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for
making misaligned models safer after deployment.

### [145] [LLMs Process Lists With General Filter Heads](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26784)
*Arnab Sen Sharma,Giordano Rogers,Natalie Shapira,David Bau*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMs learn a compact, causal representation of a general filtering operation via a few “filter heads”; this representation generalizes across formats and languages and can be extracted and reapplied to different collections, though LMs may also adopt an alternative eager-evaluation strategy that stores a predicate flag in items.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how transformer-based LLMs perform list-processing tasks and whether they internally implement general, portable computational operations (like filtering) in an interpretable way that mirrors conventional programming patterns.

Method: Apply causal mediation analysis to a diverse set of list-processing tasks to identify a small set of attention heads (filter heads) that encode the filtering predicate in their query states. Demonstrate predicate extraction/reapplication across different collections, formats, languages, and tasks; also examine alternative strategies such as eagerly evaluating predicates and storing flags within items.

Result: A small number of attention heads encode a compact representation of the filtering predicate in their query states. This predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted and reapplied to perform the same filtering operation on different collections across formats/languages/tasks. Additionally, LMs may use an alternative strategy—eagerly evaluating the predicate and storing a flag in item representations. Overall, transformers can develop human-interpretable, functionally analogous implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize across contexts.

Conclusion: Transformer LMs can learn interpretable, portable implementations of abstract computational operations (like filtering) that generalize similarly to functional programming patterns, shedding light on how LLMs perform list-processing tasks and offering avenues for improved interpretability and transfer across tasks.

Abstract: We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in
LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal
representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic
"filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on
a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of
attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of
the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate
that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted
and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections,
presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also
identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for
filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing
this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our
results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable
implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways
that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional
programming patterns.

*Amir Noorizadegan,Sifan Wang,Leevan Ling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A comprehensive review of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), linking them to MLPs, surveying basis functions, architectural variants, and practical implementations, and offering a practical guide and roadmap for future research.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs promise greater expressivity and interpretability over traditional MLPs through learnable edge-wise basis functions. As the KAN literature expands rapidly, there is a need for a systematic synthesis that clarifies theory, architecture, and implementation, and maps the open-source ecosystem.

Method: Systematic literature survey and synthesis. Establish formal equivalence between KANs and MLPs. Catalog basis function choices (e.g., B-splines, Chebyshev/Jacobi polynomials, ReLU composites, Gaussian RBFs, Fourier series) and their trade-offs. Classify architectural variants, discuss strategies for accuracy, efficiency, and regularization, and collect open-source implementations. Provide a practical guidance framework (

Result: The paper provides a structured taxonomy of KANs, clarifies their theoretical foundations, demonstrates parameter efficiency relative to MLPs, analyzes diverse basis functions and their trade-offs, and outlines a roadmap of techniques (physics-informed loss, adaptive sampling, domain decomposition, hybrids, discontinuity handling). It also aggregates open-source implementations and offers a practical guide to selecting architectures and applying KANs, complemented by a GitHub repository.

Conclusion: KANs constitute a vibrant and growing ecosystem. The review identifies core research gaps and delineates directions for improving accuracy, efficiency, and regularization, while equipping practitioners with a concrete, Choose-Your-KAN guide and a structured repository for ongoing development.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), inspired by the
Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Unlike MLPs, which use fixed
activation functions on nodes, KANs employ learnable univariate basis functions
on edges, offering enhanced expressivity and interpretability. This review
provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN
landscape, moving beyond simple performance comparisons to offer a structured
synthesis of theoretical foundations, architectural variants, and practical
implementation strategies. By collecting and categorizing a vast array of
open-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting KAN
development. We begin by bridging the conceptual gap between KANs and MLPs,
establishing their formal equivalence and highlighting the superior parameter
efficiency of the KAN formulation. A central theme of our review is the
critical role of the basis function; we survey a wide array of choices,
including B-splines, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions,
Gaussian RBFs, and Fourier series, and analyze their respective trade-offs in
terms of smoothness, locality, and computational cost. We then categorize
recent advancements into a clear roadmap, covering techniques for improving
accuracy, efficiency, and regularization. Key topics include physics-informed
loss design, adaptive sampling, domain decomposition, hybrid architectures, and
specialized methods for handling discontinuities. Finally, we provide a
practical "Choose-Your-KAN" guide to help practitioners select appropriate
architectures, and we conclude by identifying current research gaps. The
associated GitHub repository https://github.com/AmirNoori68/kan-review
complements this paper and serves as a structured reference for ongoing KAN
research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiMAE is a hierarchical self-supervised model that learns multi-scale representations from wearable time series via masked autoencoding, enabling scale-aware interpretability and edge-efficient deployment, and outperforming scale-collapsing baselines while being edge-capable.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning for physiological data; different clinical/behavioral outcomes may depend on information at distinct time scales, so exploratory tools and models should probe and leverage scale until interpretability emerges.

Method: Introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical Masked Autoencoder), a self-supervised framework combining masked autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder/decoder to produce multi-resolution embeddings; evaluate across classification, regression, and generative tasks; designed to run entirely on watch hardware with sub-millisecond inference.

Result: HiMAE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art foundation models that collapse temporal scale, while using orders of magnitude smaller models; achieves edge-friendly efficiency suitable for smartwatch CPUs and zero-shot or few-shot transfer across tasks.

Conclusion: HiMAE serves as both an efficient self-supervised learning method and a discovery tool to reveal scale-sensitive structure in wearable health data, turning resolution from a hyperparameter into a diagnostic probe for interpretability.

Abstract: Wearable sensors provide abundant physiological time series, yet the
principles governing their predictive utility remain unclear. We hypothesize
that temporal resolution is a fundamental axis of representation learning, with
different clinical and behavioral outcomes relying on structure at distinct
scales. To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical
Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked
autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces
multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal
scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter
into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and
generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art
foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller.
HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on
watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true
edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an
efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale
sensitive structure in wearable health.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A data-efficient framework for high-energy molecule generation combining LSTM-based generation with Attentive Graph Neural Networks for property prediction, using a transformative embedding space that mixes fixed SHA-256 features with partially trainable representations; without pretraining, it achieves 67.5% validity, 37.5% novelty, mean Tanimoto distance 0.214 to the training set, and identifies 37 new super-explosives with predicted detonation velocity > 9 km/s.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: High-energy materials discovery is hampered by limited experimental data and restricted access to testing facilities. There is a need for data-efficient generative and predictive frameworks that can explore diverse chemical space without heavy pretraining, and can identify high-performance candidates under data-constrained conditions.

Method: Develop a transformative embedding space by integrating fixed SHA-256 embeddings with partially trainable representations, effectively reshaping the molecular input space before learning. Train an LSTM-based generator to produce molecules and an Attentive Graph Neural Network to predict properties, all from scratch (no pretraining).

Result: The generator achieves 67.5% validity and 37.5% novelty. The generated library has a mean Tanimoto coefficient of 0.214 relative to the training set, indicating diversity. The approach identifies 37 new super-explosives with predicted detonation velocity exceeding 9 km/s.

Conclusion: A data-efficient framework that reshapes input representations to improve learning from limited data, enabling diverse chemical space exploration and identification of high-energy candidates without reliance on large pretrained models. This approach shows promise for accelerating discovery under experimental and facility constraints.

Abstract: High-energy materials (HEMs) are critical for propulsion and defense domains,
yet their discovery remains constrained by experimental data and restricted
access to testing facilities. This work presents a novel approach toward
high-energy molecules by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for
molecular generation and Attentive Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for property
predictions. We propose a transformative embedding space construction strategy
that integrates fixed SHA-256 embeddings with partially trainable
representations. Unlike conventional regularization techniques, this changes
the representational basis itself, reshaping the molecular input space before
learning begins. Without recourse to pretraining, the generator achieves 67.5%
validity and 37.5% novelty. The generated library exhibits a mean Tanimoto
coefficient of 0.214 relative to training set signifying the ability of
framework to generate a diverse chemical space. We identified 37 new super
explosives higher than 9 km/s predicted detonation velocity.

*Zihan Pengmei,Costas Mavromatis,Zhengyuan Shen,Yunyi Zhang,Vassilis N. Ioannidis,Huzefa Rangwala*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoT supervision speeds up generalization and boosts accuracy on simpler symbolic tasks but is not a universal fix for higher-complexity problems; a transient period of unfaithful reasoning traces precedes alignment; a kinetic learning model and dynamic trace faithfulness reveal how CoT reshapes internal computation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how chain-of-thought supervision influences transformer learning dynamics, particularly generalization under grokking-like regimes, by controlled symbolic tasks with tunable complexity and data composition.

Method: Pretrain transformers on symbolic reasoning tasks with adjustable algorithmic complexity and data distribution, comparing regimes with only final answers versus explicit CoT traces; model learning with a three-parameter logistic curve to capture learning speed/shape; analyze trace faithfulness over training and probe how CoT alters internal computation.

Result: CoT generally improves performance but its benefits diminish for highly complex tasks (e.g., list intersections); CoT accelerates generalization but cannot overcome high algorithmic complexity; a transient unfaithfulness phase exists where correct answers precede faithful CoT traces; introduces a kinetic modeling framework to understand transformer learning and demonstrates that trace faithfulness is a dynamic property that emerges over training and that CoT changes internal computation.

Conclusion: Chain-of-thought supervision is beneficial but task-dependent; understanding learning dynamics and trace faithfulness through kinetic modeling is crucial for effective CoT use, as CoT reshapes internal computation but does not universally solve the hardest algorithmic tasks.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision can substantially improve transformer
performance, yet the mechanisms by which models learn to follow and benefit
from CoT remain poorly understood. We investigate these learning dynamics
through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning
tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to
study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i)
producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before
answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance,
its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the
accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic
curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity,
data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a
transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce
correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later
aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate
that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher
algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a
kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3)
characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over
training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation
mechanistically.

### [150] [Optimal Information Combining for Multi-Agent Systems Using Adaptive Bias Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25793)
*Siavash M. Alamouti,Fay Arjomandi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a learnability ratio to gauge whether unknown biases in multi-agent systems can be effectively learned from observable covariates, and presents ABLOC, an algorithm that learns bias-correcting transformations while optimizing combination weights. The paper proves fundamental performance bounds tied to the learnability ratio and validates the approach with experiments showing substantial gains when biases are learnable and diminishing returns otherwise.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Systematic biases that vary with environmental conditions degrade performance across sensor networks and crowdsourcing platforms. Determining when learning these biases is feasible—and worth the effort—addresses a practical gap between idealized calibration and infeasible continual recalibration.

Method: Decomposes biases into learnable systematic components and irreducible stochastic components; defines the learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from observable covariates; derives performance bounds based on this ratio; introduces ABLOC, which iteratively learns bias-correcting transformations and jointly optimizes combination weights with closed-form updates, guaranteeing convergence to the theoretical limits.

Result: Theoretical bound shows maximum achievable improvement is limited by the learnability ratio; experiments report recovering 40–70% of the theoretical maximum improvement in high-learnability scenarios, with minimal gains when learnability is low.

Conclusion: Provides a diagnostic criterion (the learnability ratio) to decide whether bias learning is worthwhile, and offers ABLOC as a provably convergent method to approach the bounds. This framework helps system designers allocate calibration attention where it yields practical benefits.

Abstract: Modern multi-agent systems ranging from sensor networks monitoring critical
infrastructure to crowdsourcing platforms aggregating human intelligence can
suffer significant performance degradation due to systematic biases that vary
with environmental conditions. Current approaches either ignore these biases,
leading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures
that are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real
consequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial
predictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses
the fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown
biases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?
We develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable
systematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the
concept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from
observable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is
worthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance
improvement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing
system designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning
versus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal
Combining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting
transformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform
solutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds. Experimental
validation demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover
significant performance (we achieved 40%-70% of theoretical maximum improvement
in our examples), while those with low learnability show minimal benefit,

### [151] [Non-myopic Matching and Rebalancing in Large-Scale On-Demand Ride-Pooling Systems Using Simulation-Informed Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25796)
*Farnoosh Namdarpour,Joseph Y. J. Chow*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Simulation-informed reinforcement learning enables non-myopic ride-pooling decisions and idle-vehicle rebalancing, yielding higher service rates, shorter wait/in-vehicle times, and smaller fleets compared to myopic policies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Ride-pooling decisions are inherently myopic in many systems, failing to account for long-term effects on demand, fleet distribution, and performance. A non-myopic approach could improve service quality and reduce costs by integrating simulation-based foresight into learning.

Method: Extend Xu et al.'s ride-hailing learning/planning framework to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulator into the RL loop. Use n-step temporal-difference learning on simulated experiences to estimate spatiotemporal state values. Propose a complementary idle-vehicle rebalancing policy. Evaluate on NYC taxi-demand data.

Result: Non-myopic matching policy improves service rate by up to 8.4% over a myopic policy, and reduces both wait and in-vehicle times. The non-myopic approach can reduce fleet size by >25% while maintaining the same performance. Incorporating rebalancing further reduces wait time by up to 27.3% and in-vehicle time by 12.5%, while increasing service rate by 15.1%, at the cost of more vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.

Conclusion: A simulation-informed, non-myopic RL framework for ride-pooling plus rebalancing yields meaningful efficiency gains and operational cost savings, highlighting the value of foresight and simulation in dispatch and fleet management.

Abstract: Ride-pooling, also known as ride-sharing, shared ride-hailing, or
microtransit, is a service wherein passengers share rides. This service can
reduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and
environmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic
decision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To
address this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)
approach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing
systems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In
this study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)
from ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within
the learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we
propose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing
n-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive
spatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the
non-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the
non-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%
versus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for
passengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size
by over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of
performance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.
Incorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time
by up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%
compared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of
increased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.

### [152] [MemEIC: A Step Toward Continual and Compositional Knowledge Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25798)
*Jin Seong,Jiyun Park,Wencke Liermann,Hongseok Choi,Yoonji Nam,Hyun Kim,Soojong Lim,Namhoon Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MemEIC enables continual and compositional knowledge editing in LVLMs using a hybrid external-internal editor, dual external memory for cross-modal evidence, dual LoRA adapters for modality-specific updates, and a brain-inspired knowledge connector for cross-modal reasoning, achieving better results on complex multimodal queries while preserving prior edits.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing knowledge-editing methods largely target a single modality (vision or language) and treat updates as one-off, ignoring the multimodal nature of LVLMs and the need for ongoing refinement. This can lead to suboptimal edits due to modality interactions and forgetting as knowledge evolves; a unified, continual, and compositional editing framework is needed.

Method: Propose MemEIC with a hybrid external-internal editor and a dual external memory system to retrieve cross-modal evidence. Introduce dual LoRA adapters to allow disentangled, modality-specific parameter updates. Incorporate a brain-inspired knowledge connector activated for compositional reasoning to integrate information across visual and textual modalities. Edits are performed sequentially to support continual updates while preserving prior changes.

Result: Empirical results show MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, establishing a new benchmark for continual and compositional knowledge editing (CCKE) in LVLMs.

Conclusion: MemEIC advances CCKE in LVLMs by enabling compositional, continual cross-modal knowledge editing through a hybrid editor, dual-memory evidence retrieval, and modality-disentangled adapters, with a brain-inspired connector to fuse information across modalities. This approach improves reliability of updates and preserves past edits, suggesting strong potential for scalable multimodal knowledge maintenance.

Abstract: The dynamic nature of information necessitates continuously updating large
vision-language models (LVLMs). While recent knowledge editing techniques hint
at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision
or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent
multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates,
potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the
interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To
address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and
Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional
editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs
a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for
cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate
disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a
brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional
reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments
demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex
multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new
benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.

### [153] [FreIE: Low-Frequency Spectral Bias in Neural Networks for Time-Series Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25800)
*Jialong Sun,Xinpeng Ling,Jiaxuan Zou,Jiawen Kang,Kejia Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FreLE introduces a plug-and-play Frequency Loss Enhancement to counter universal spectral bias in long-term multivariate time series forecasting by incorporating explicit and implicit frequency regularization, showing superior generalization across many models; code available on GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Time series exhibit autocorrelation and a spectral bias where models tend to fit low-frequency signals first. This bias appears universal across mainstream models, hindering long-term prediction. The goal is to unify understanding and mitigate this bias.

Method: Conduct extensive empirical experiments to measure spectral bias across mainstream time series models. Propose FreLE, a loss unit that provides explicit and implicit frequency regularization to improve generalization. Demonstrate plug-and-play applicability with numerous experiments; release code.

Result: FreLE demonstrates superior performance across a large number of experiments, indicating effective mitigation of spectral bias and improved long-term forecasting generalization.

Conclusion: Spectral bias in long-term time series prediction appears to be a universal phenomenon across models. Frequency-domain regularization via FreLE provides a practical, plug-and-play solution to enhance generalization in multivariate time series forecasting.

Abstract: The inherent autocorrelation of time series data presents an ongoing
challenge to multivariate time series prediction. Recently, a widely adopted
approach has been the incorporation of frequency domain information to assist
in long-term prediction tasks. Many researchers have independently observed the
spectral bias phenomenon in neural networks, where models tend to fit
low-frequency signals before high-frequency ones. However, these observations
have often been attributed to the specific architectures designed by the
researchers, rather than recognizing the phenomenon as a universal
characteristic across models. To unify the understanding of the spectral bias
phenomenon in long-term time series prediction, we conducted extensive
empirical experiments to measure spectral bias in existing mainstream models.
Our findings reveal that virtually all models exhibit this phenomenon. To
mitigate the impact of spectral bias, we propose the FreLE (Frequency Loss
Enhancement) algorithm, which enhances model generalization through both
explicit and implicit frequency regularization. This is a plug-and-play model
loss function unit. A large number of experiments have proven the superior
performance of FreLE. Code is available at

### [154] [Metis-SPECS: Decoupling Multimodal Learning via Self-distilled Preference-based Cold Start](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25801)
*Kun Chen,Peng Shi,Haibo Qiu,Zhixiong Zeng,Siqi Yang,Wenji Mao,Lin Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A self-distilled, preference-based cold-start framework (SPECS) decouples multimodal learning from RL with verifiable rewards, yielding better generalization and exploration and improving benchmark performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Cold-start RL for vision-language models often relies on supervised fine-tuning, which risks instruction-style overfitting and poor out-of-distribution generalization, hindering subsequent RL with verifiable rewards.

Method: Introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) to quantify generalization; propose SPECS: (1) self-distilled introspective preference data pairs; (2) preference-based training focusing on shallow surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) to avoid memorization; (3) transfer to RL with verifiable rewards for deep reasoning.

Result: SPECS yields consistent gains over baselines, e.g., MEGA-Bench +4.1% and MathVista +12.2%; reduces in-distribution stuckness, improves exploration, stabilizes training, and raises the performance ceiling.

Conclusion: Decoupling multimodal learning via self-distilled preferences prior to RL with verifiable rewards enhances generalization and robustness in multimodal RL, providing better initialization and more transferable surface-form knowledge.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards has recently catalyzed a
wave of "MLLM-r1" approaches that bring RL to vision language models. Most
representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However,
SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task
solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting,
weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream
RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data
construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to
quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical
study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes
better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose
SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples
multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via
self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation;
(2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow,
transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than
memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep
reasoning results. Experimental results across multiple multimodal benchmarks
show that our decoupling learning framework yields consistent performance gains
over strong baselines, improving MEGA-Bench by 4.1% and MathVista by 12.2%.
Additional experiments indicate that SPECS contributes to reducing
in-distribution "stuckness," improving exploration, stabilizing training, and
raising the performance ceiling.

### [155] [Mixture-of-Experts Operator Transformer for Large-Scale PDE Pre-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25803)
*Hong Wang,Haiyang Xin,Jie Wang,Xuanze Yang,Fei Zha,Huanshuo Dong,Yan Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Mixture-of-Experts pre-training transformer for neural operators (MoE-POT) uses sparse routing to scale efficiently and improve zero-shot generalization on PDE problems.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDE datasets are heterogeneous; mixed training yields high errors; dense large models incur high inference costs; need efficient, scalable pre-training.

Method: Layer-wise router-gating selects 4 out of 16 experts per layer; 2 shared experts; outputs are weighted averages of activated experts; pre-trained from 30M to 0.5B parameters on 6 PDE datasets.

Result: With 90M activated parameters, achieves up to 40% reduction in zero-shot error vs models with 120M activated parameters; interpretability shows router decisions reflect dataset types.

Conclusion: MoE-POT provides efficient parameter scaling and reduced inference cost, better handling dataset heterogeneity, and interpretable gating signals aligning with PDE dataset types.

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity and performance
limitations in solving PDE problems with neural operators. However, challenges
remain due to the heterogeneity of PDE datasets in equation types, which leads
to high errors in mixed training. Additionally, dense pre-training models that
scale parameters by increasing network width or depth incur significant
inference costs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
Mixture-of-Experts Pre-training Operator Transformer (MoE-POT), a
sparse-activated architecture that scales parameters efficiently while
controlling inference costs. Specifically, our model adopts a layer-wise
router-gating network to dynamically select 4 routed experts from 16 expert
networks during inference, enabling the model to focus on equation-specific
features. Meanwhile, we also integrate 2 shared experts, aiming to capture
common properties of PDE and reduce redundancy among routed experts. The final
output is computed as the weighted average of the results from all activated
experts. We pre-train models with parameters from 30M to 0.5B on 6 public PDE
datasets. Our model with 90M activated parameters achieves up to a 40%
reduction in zero-shot error compared with existing models with 120M activated
parameters. Additionally, we conduct interpretability analysis, showing that
dataset types can be inferred from router-gating network decisions, which
validates the rationality and effectiveness of the MoE architecture.

### [156] [PRESTO: Preimage-Informed Instruction Optimization for Prompting Black-Box LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25808)
*Jaewon Chu,Seunghun Lee,Hyunwoo J. Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRESTO leverages the preimage structure of soft prompts to optimize instructions for black-box LLMs more efficiently. It shares scores within preimages, initializes data points to maximize search coverage, and enforces score consistency, achieving 14x more scored data per query budget across 33 tasks (code available).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs is data-inefficient because many different soft prompts map to the same instruction, causing redundant queries. The authors reinterpret this many-to-one mapping as a useful prior (preimage structure) to accelerate optimization.

Method: Three components: (1) score sharing: propagate a single evaluation score to all soft prompts within a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization: select initial prompts to maximize search-space coverage using preimage information; (3) score consistency regularization: enforce stable predictions within each preimage. The method leverages the inherent preimage structure to improve data efficiency under fixed query budgets.

Result: Empirically, PRESTO delivers the equivalent of about 14x more scored data under the same query budget and shows superior performance on 33 instruction optimization tasks.

Conclusion: Exploiting preimage structure is a practical and effective prior for content-sensitive instruction optimization of black-box LLMs, with PRESTO offering a concrete framework and empirical gains; code is publicly available.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led
to increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose
internal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong
performance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ
white-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.
However, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same
instruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this
many-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we
reinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the
optimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction
Optimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure
of soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key
components: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft
prompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial
data points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and
(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency
within each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of
effectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,
resulting in more efficient optimization. Experimental results on 33
instruction optimization tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PRESTO.

*Sungho Koh,SeungJu Cha,Hyunwoo Oh,Kwanyoung Lee,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ScaleDiff is a training-free, model-agnostic framework that extends pretrained diffusion models to higher resolutions using Neighborhood Patch Attention (NPA), Latent Frequency Mixing (LFM), and Structure Guidance, achieving state-of-the-art results in image quality and speed among training-free methods on U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models degrade in quality when generating images beyond training resolution. Existing training-free approaches are either computationally heavy or incompatible with recent Diffusion Transformer models. A lightweight, training-free, and architecture-agnostic solution is needed to extend resolution efficiently.

Method: ScaleDiff introduces Neighborhood Patch Attention (NPA) to reduce self-attention redundancy via non-overlapping patches, integrated into an SDEdit pipeline; Latent Frequency Mixing (LFM) to enhance fine details; and Structure Guidance to improve global structure during denoising. The framework is model-agnostic and designed to work without extra training.

Result: Experimental evaluations show ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance among training-free methods in both image quality and inference speed on both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

Conclusion: ScaleDiff provides a highly efficient, training-free, model-agnostic solution to extend pretrained diffusion models to higher resolutions, outperforming existing training-free approaches.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models often exhibit degraded performance when
generating images beyond their training resolution. Recent training-free
methods can mitigate this limitation, but they often require substantial
computation or are incompatible with recent Diffusion Transformer models. In
this paper, we propose ScaleDiff, a model-agnostic and highly efficient
framework for extending the resolution of pretrained diffusion models without
any additional training. A core component of our framework is Neighborhood
Patch Attention (NPA), an efficient mechanism that reduces computational
redundancy in the self-attention layer with non-overlapping patches. We
integrate NPA into an SDEdit pipeline and introduce Latent Frequency Mixing
(LFM) to better generate fine details. Furthermore, we apply Structure Guidance
to enhance global structure during the denoising process. Experimental results
demonstrate that ScaleDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance among
training-free methods in terms of both image quality and inference speed on
both U-Net and Diffusion Transformer architectures.

*Xiaoke Huang,Ningsen Wang,Hui Liu,Xianfeng Tang,Yuyin Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A rubric-guided generator-verifier pipeline (MedVLSynther) creates high-quality open medical VQA data from literature, enabling open-weight LMMs to improve medical VQA benchmarks; dataset MedSynVQA contains ~13k questions across diverse modalities; open, auditable, leakage-free.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LMM-based medical VQA is hampered by the lack of large, openly usable, high-quality corpora. An open, auditable data generation framework could scale data while preserving privacy and enabling reproducibility.

Method: A two-stage system: a rubric-guided generator creates self-contained stems and parallel, exclusive answer options conditioned on figures, captions, and in-text references; a multi-stage verifier enforces gates (self-containment, single correct answer, clinical validity, image-text consistency) with positive/penalty signals in a machine-checkable JSON schema. Applied to PubMed Central to produce MedSynVQA (13,087 questions, 14,803 images across 13 modalities and 28 regions). Training open-weight LMMs with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards. Ablations confirm necessity of both generation and verification; contamination analysis shows no leakage from evaluation suites.

Result: MedSynVQA dataset: 13,087 audited questions over 14,803 images (13 modalities, 28 anatomical regions). Open-weight LMMs trained with verifiable RL rewards achieve average VQA scores of 55.85 (3B) and 58.15 (7B); peak scores 77.57 (VQA-RAD) and 67.76 (PathVQA); surpassing strong medical LMMs. Ablations show both components are needed; more verified data helps; no leakage detected from evaluation suites.

Conclusion: Open literature and open-weight models enable an auditable, reproducible, privacy-preserving path toward scalable medical VQA data and improved performance on medical benchmarks.

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly capable of answering medical
questions that require joint reasoning over images and text, yet training
general medical VQA systems is impeded by the lack of large, openly usable,
high-quality corpora. We present MedVLSynther, a rubric-guided
generator-verifier framework that synthesizes high-quality multiple-choice VQA
items directly from open biomedical literature by conditioning on figures,
captions, and in-text references. The generator produces self-contained stems
and parallel, mutually exclusive options under a machine-checkable JSON schema;
a multi-stage verifier enforces essential gates (self-containment, single
correct answer, clinical validity, image-text consistency), awards fine-grained
positive points, and penalizes common failure modes before acceptance. Applying
this pipeline to PubMed Central yields MedSynVQA: 13,087 audited questions over
14,803 images spanning 13 imaging modalities and 28 anatomical regions.
Training open-weight LMMs with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards
improves accuracy across six medical VQA benchmarks, achieving averages of
55.85 (3B) and 58.15 (7B), with up to 77.57 on VQA-RAD and 67.76 on PathVQA,
outperforming strong medical LMMs. A Ablations verify that both generation and
verification are necessary and that more verified data consistently helps, and
a targeted contamination analysis detects no leakage from evaluation suites. By
operating entirely on open literature and open-weight models, MedVLSynther
offers an auditable, reproducible, and privacy-preserving path to scalable
medical VQA training data.

*Kang Chen,Zhihao Liu,Tonghe Zhang,Zhen Guo,Si Xu,Hao Lin,Hongzhi Zang,Quanlu Zhang,Zhaofei Yu,Guoliang Fan,Tiejun Huang,Yu Wang,Chao Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework named pi_RL enables scalable training of flow-based Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models with reinforcement learning by solving intractable log-likelihoods in denoising. It introduces two RL algorithms, Flow-Noise and Flow-SDE, and demonstrates large performance boosts on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks versus SFT baselines, indicating improved data efficiency and generalization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flow-based VLAs face intractable action log-likelihoods during iterative denoising, hindering application of large-scale RL. There is a need for scalable, efficient RL approaches to improve performance and generalization with flow-based VLA models.

Method: Flow-Noise: treats denoising as a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network enabling exact log-likelihood computation. Flow-SDE: couples denoising with agent-environment interaction in a two-layer MDP, using ODE-to-SDE conversion for efficient exploration. Both enable parallel simulation for scalable RL.

Result: LIBERO: few-shot SFT models pi_0 and pi_{0.5} improve from 57.6% to 97.6% and 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively. ManiSkill: in 320 parallel environments, pi_0 improves from 41.6% to 85.7% and pi_{0.5} from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 tasks.

Conclusion: pi_RL yields substantial performance gains and stronger generalization over SFT models, validating online RL as an effective training paradigm for flow-based VLAs.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable robots to understand and perform
complex tasks from multimodal input. Although recent work explores using
reinforcement learning (RL) to automate the laborious data collection process
in scaling supervised fine-tuning (SFT), applying large-scale RL to flow-based
VLAs (e.g., $\pi_0$, $\pi_{0.5}$) remains challenging due to intractable action
log-likelihoods from iterative denoising.
  We address this challenge with $\pi_{\text{RL}}$, an open-source framework
for training flow-based VLAs in parallel simulation. $\pi_{\text{RL}}$
implements two RL algorithms: (1) {Flow-Noise} models the denoising process as
a discrete-time MDP with a learnable noise network for exact log-likelihood
computation. (2) {Flow-SDE} integrates denoising with agent-environment
interaction, formulating a two-layer MDP that employs ODE-to-SDE conversion for
efficient RL exploration.
  We evaluate $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ on LIBERO and ManiSkill benchmarks. On LIBERO,
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ boosts few-shot SFT models $\pi_0$ and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 57.6%
to 97.6% and from 77.1% to 98.3%, respectively. In ManiSkill, we train
$\pi_{\text{RL}}$ in 320 parallel environments, improving $\pi_0$ from 41.6% to
85.7% and $\pi_{0.5}$ from 40.0% to 84.8% across 4352 pick-and-place tasks,
demonstrating scalable multitask RL under heterogeneous simulation.
  Overall, $\pi_{\text{RL}}$ achieves significant performance gains and
stronger generalization over SFT-models, validating the effectiveness of online
RL for flow-based VLAs.

*Harris Hardiman-Mostow,Jack Mauro,Adrien Weihs,Andrea L. Bertozzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A curvature-informed graph active-learning framework that uses Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC) to (i) construct a coreset of labeled examples that reflect graph clusters, (ii) include a data-driven stopping criterion for exploration, (iii) dynamically switch from exploration to exploitation via BFC guidance, and (iv) apply localized graph rewiring to better propagate labels while preserving sparsity—yielding strong performance at low label rates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Exploration–exploitation trade-off in graph-based semi-supervised learning under scarce label budgets. Existing heuristics are brittle; we need principled, data-driven methods that leverage the graph's geometry and multiscale structure to guide labeling and propagation.

Method: 1) Build a coreset by selecting representative initial labels using Balanced Forman Curvature to reflect cluster structure. 2) Introduce a data-driven stopping criterion signaling sufficient exploration. 3) Use BFC to dynamically trigger the shift from exploration to exploitation within active learning circuits, replacing hand-tuned heuristics. 4) Implement localized graph rewiring to incorporate multiscale information around labeled nodes while maintaining sparsity for efficient propagation.

Result: Empirical results on benchmark classification tasks show consistent superiority over existing graph-based semi-supervised baselines at low label rates.

Conclusion: A principled, curvature-guided framework for graph-based active learning that robustly balances exploration and exploitation and enhances label propagation through graph rewiring, particularly effective in low-label regimes.

Abstract: We propose a graph-topological approach to active learning that directly
targets the core challenge of exploration versus exploitation under scarce
label budgets. To guide exploration, we introduce a coreset construction
algorithm based on Balanced Forman Curvature (BFC), which selects
representative initial labels that reflect the graph's cluster structure. This
method includes a data-driven stopping criterion that signals when the graph
has been sufficiently explored. We further use BFC to dynamically trigger the
shift from exploration to exploitation within active learning routines,
replacing hand-tuned heuristics. To improve exploitation, we introduce a
localized graph rewiring strategy that efficiently incorporates multiscale
information around labeled nodes, enhancing label propagation while preserving
sparsity. Experiments on benchmark classification tasks show that our methods
consistently outperform existing graph-based semi-supervised baselines at low
label rates.

*Manuel Iglesias-Alonso,Felix Schur,Julius von Kügelgen,Jonas Peters*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes identifiability of a causal effect across multiple domains with an unobserved confounder, using a proxy for the confounder; introduces two estimators, proves consistency and CI validity, validated by simulations and a real-world ranking study.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: In multi-domain settings, causal effect estimation is confounded by unobserved variables that vary by domain. With only a proxy for the hidden confounder and discrete variables, identifiability is challenging. This work aims to recover the target-domain effect under these constraints.

Method: Assume a proxy for the hidden confounder is observed, all variables discrete/categorical. Prove identifiability of the causal effect in the target domain even when treatment and outcome may be continuous. Propose two estimation techniques; establish consistency; derive confidence intervals. Use simulations and a real-world example (website rankings influence consumer choices).

Result: Identifiability established; two consistent estimators with proven convergence; confidence intervals derived; simulations show favorable finite-sample performance; real-data example demonstrates practical applicability to ranking effects.

Conclusion: The framework enables valid causal effect estimation in multi-domain settings with unobserved confounding using a confounder proxy, expanding applicability to continuous outcomes and discrete proxies; supported by simulations and a real-world study; guidance for practitioners in cross-domain causal inference.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a causal effect in a multi-domain
setting. The causal effect of interest is confounded by an unobserved
confounder and can change between the different domains. We assume that we have
access to a proxy of the hidden confounder and that all variables are discrete
or categorical. We propose methodology to estimate the causal effect in the
target domain, where we assume to observe only the proxy variable. Under these
conditions, we prove identifiability (even when treatment and response
variables are continuous). We introduce two estimation techniques, prove
consistency, and derive confidence intervals. The theoretical results are
supported by simulation studies and a real-world example studying the causal
effect of website rankings on consumer choices.

### [162] [Active Learning with Task-Driven Representations for Messy Pools](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25926)
*Kianoosh Ashouritaklimi,Tom Rainforth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Task-driven, periodically updated representations during active learning outperform fixed unsupervised representations in messy pools, using two strategies: semi-supervised representation learning and supervised fine-tuning of an initial unsupervised model.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Active learning can be hampered when the data pool is messy and current methods rely on fixed, unsupervised representations that may miss task-relevant information. Updating representations using labeled data could align features with the target task.

Method: Introduce two strategies that update representations during active learning using previously collected labels: (1) learning semi-supervised representations directly, and (2) supervised fine-tuning of an initial unsupervised representation. Representations are updated periodically throughout the AL process.

Result: Both proposed strategies significantly improve empirical performance compared with using solely unsupervised or pretrained representations.

Conclusion: Task-driven representations that are periodically updated with labeled data mitigate the limitations of fixed representations in messy pools and enhance active-learning effectiveness.

Abstract: Active learning has the potential to be especially useful for messy,
uncurated pools where datapoints vary in relevance to the target task. However,
state-of-the-art approaches to this problem currently rely on using fixed,
unsupervised representations of the pool, focusing on modifying the acquisition
function instead. We show that this model setup can undermine their
effectiveness at dealing with messy pools, as such representations can fail to
capture important information relevant to the task. To address this, we propose
using task-driven representations that are periodically updated during the
active learning process using the previously collected labels. We introduce two
specific strategies for learning these representations, one based on directly
learning semi-supervised representations and the other based on supervised
fine-tuning of an initial unsupervised representation. We find that both
significantly improve empirical performance over using unsupervised or
pretrained representations.

### [163] [Robust GNN Watermarking via Implicit Perception of Topological Invariants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25934)
*Jipeng Li,Yannning Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InvGNN-WM proposes a trigger-free watermark for graph neural networks by tying ownership to a model's implicit perception of a graph invariant, enabling black-box verification with negligible task impact. It uses a private carrier set and a sign-sensitive decoder to embed bits, achieving robust watermarking under pruning, fine-tuning, and quantization; exact removal is NP-complete. KD weakens the watermark unless augmented with a watermark loss (KD+WM).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN ownership verification is difficult because traditional backdoor/triggers can be erased by standard model edits, leading to ownership ambiguity. A trigger-free, robust watermark that survives common edits would provide a reliable ownership proof.

Method: Introduce a lightweight head that predicts a normalized graph invariant (algebraic connectivity) on an owner-private carrier set; a sign-sensitive decoder outputs bits; a calibrated threshold controls false positives. Evaluate across diverse node/graph classification datasets and backbones, comparing against trigger- and compression-based baselines. Test robustness under pruning, fine-tuning, post-training quantization; analyze knowledge distillation (KD) with and without a watermark loss.

Result: Maintain clean accuracy while achieving higher watermark accuracy than baselines. Watermark remains strong under unstructured pruning, fine-tuning, and quantization. KD weakens the watermark, while KD+WM restores it. Provides imperceptibility and robustness guarantees; proves exact removal is NP-complete.

Conclusion: InvGNN-WM offers a trigger-free, robust GNN watermark with black-box verifiability linked to a graph invariant, adding strong imperceptibility and theoretical hardness for removal, and showing KD-based defenses can be countered with a watermark loss.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are valuable intellectual property, yet many
watermarks rely on backdoor triggers that break under common model edits and
create ownership ambiguity. We present InvGNN-WM, which ties ownership to a
model's implicit perception of a graph invariant, enabling trigger-free,
black-box verification with negligible task impact. A lightweight head predicts
normalized algebraic connectivity on an owner-private carrier set; a
sign-sensitive decoder outputs bits, and a calibrated threshold controls the
false-positive rate. Across diverse node and graph classification datasets and
backbones, InvGNN-WM matches clean accuracy while yielding higher watermark
accuracy than trigger- and compression-based baselines. It remains strong under
unstructured pruning, fine-tuning, and post-training quantization; plain
knowledge distillation (KD) weakens the mark, while KD with a watermark loss
(KD+WM) restores it. We provide guarantees for imperceptibility and robustness,
and we prove that exact removal is NP-complete.

*Tcharlies Schmitz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A reversible, scalable encoding of high-cardinality IDs into compact vectors using modular arithmetic and invertible linear transforms; achieves comparable predictive performance with far fewer parameters on MovieLens 20M; open-source implementations available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional encodings like hashing or one-hot are either non-reversible or explode in dimensionality. There is a need for a bijective, scalable method that allows explicit control over dimensionality and remains efficient for millions of identifiers.

Method: Employ finite-field modular arithmetic and invertible linear transformations to create a bijective mapping from identifiers to compact vectors, with explicit dimensionality control and scalable computation, ensuring reversibility.

Result: On MovieLens 20M, predictive performance is comparable to supervised embeddings while using significantly fewer parameters and lower training cost.

Conclusion: MLT offers a reversible, scalable solution for encoding high-cardinality categoricals, enabling efficient training and potential interpretability; open-source implementation provided.

Abstract: This paper introduces Modular Linear Tokenization (MLT), a reversible and
deterministic technique for encoding high-cardinality categorical identifiers
into compact numerical vectors. Unlike traditional hashing or one-hot
encodings, MLT preserves bijective mappings by leveraging modular arithmetic
over finite fields and invertible linear transformations. The method offers
explicit control of dimensionality and computational scalability while
maintaining full reversibility, even for millions of identifiers. Experimental
results on the MovieLens 20M dataset show that MLT achieves comparable
predictive performance to supervised embeddings while requiring significantly
fewer parameters and lower training cost. An open-source implementation of MLT
is available on PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/light-mlt/) and GitHub
(https://github.com/tcharliesschmitz/light-mlt).

### [165] [Application and Validation of Geospatial Foundation Model Data for the Prediction of Health Facility Programmatic Outputs -- A Case Study in Malawi](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25954)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GeoFM embeddings from Google PDFM, AlphaEarth, and CDR provide modest but consistent predictive gains for health indicators in Malawi; a Multi-GeoFM ensemble yields the strongest predictions, especially for population density, new HIV cases, and child vaccinations, while data-poor targets (TB, malnutrition) remain challenging.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address unreliability of routine health data in LMICs due to reporting delays and incomplete coverage by exploring advanced data sources and embeddings to improve predictive capacity.

Method: Apply XGBoost models to 552 health catchment areas (Jan 2021–May 2023) using three GeoFM embedding sources (PDFM, AlphaEarth from satellite imagery, and mobile CDRs). Compare against baseline geostatistical methods. Use an 80/20 train/test split with 5-fold cross-validation during training. Build individual embeddings and a Multi-GeoFM ensemble combining all sources.

Result: Embedding-based approaches outperformed baseline geostatistical methods in 13 of 15 indicators (87%). The Multi-GeoFM model achieved strongest performance with cross-validated R2 ~0.63 (population density), 0.57 (new HIV cases), 0.47 (child vaccinations) and test-set R2 ~0.64, 0.68, 0.55 for the same indicators. Predictions were weaker for targets with limited primary data availability (e.g., TB and malnutrition).

Conclusion: Integrating multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable approach to augment limited routine health information systems in LMICs, offering robust improvements for select health/demographic outcomes.

Abstract: The reliability of routine health data in low and middle-income countries
(LMICs) is often constrained by reporting delays and incomplete coverage,
necessitating the exploration of novel data sources and analytics. Geospatial
Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse
spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be
efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the
predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population
Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite
imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine
health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to
traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data
from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance
with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold
cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the
embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13
of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three
embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average
5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63),
new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64,
0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with
low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results
demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for
select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the
integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for
supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.

### [166] [On the Dataless Training of Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25962)
*Alvaro Velasquez,Susmit Jha,Ismail R. Alkhouri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Survey of dataless neural network optimization (dNN) approaches, classifying encoding strategies into architecture-agnostic and architecture-specific, and relating dNNs to zero-/one-shot learning, lifting, and over-parameterization.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-driven learning methods often underperform or are data-hungry, and training data can be scarce or unavailable (e.g., medical image reconstruction, scientific applications). Dataless optimization aims to leverage neural architectures without requiring large datasets.

Method: Define the dataless setting and categorize it into two variants based on how a problem instance is encoded onto the network: (i) architecture-agnostic methods and (ii) architecture-specific methods; discuss similarities and distinctions with related concepts (zero-shot/one-shot learning, lifting, over-parameterization).

Result: Provide a conceptual synthesis: formal definitions, taxonomy, and connections to related learning paradigms; highlight applicability across optimization domains (combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, PDEs) and set directions for future research.

Conclusion: Dataless neural networks offer a viable data-free optimization framework with two encoding variants; further work is needed to map connections to related paradigms and to explore practical applications and performance.

Abstract: This paper surveys studies on the use of neural networks for optimization in
the training-data-free setting. Specifically, we examine the dataless
application of neural network architectures in optimization by
re-parameterizing problems using fully connected (or MLP), convolutional,
graph, and quadratic neural networks. Although MLPs have been used to solve
linear programs a few decades ago, this approach has recently gained increasing
attention due to its promising results across diverse applications, including
those based on combinatorial optimization, inverse problems, and partial
differential equations. The motivation for this setting stems from two key
(possibly over-lapping) factors: (i) data-driven learning approaches are still
underdeveloped and have yet to demonstrate strong results, as seen in
combinatorial optimization, and (ii) the availability of training data is
inherently limited, such as in medical image reconstruction and other
scientific applications. In this paper, we define the dataless setting and
categorize it into two variants based on how a problem instance -- defined by a
single datum -- is encoded onto the neural network: (i) architecture-agnostic
methods and (ii) architecture-specific methods. Additionally, we discuss
similarities and clarify distinctions between the dataless neural network (dNN)
settings and related concepts such as zero-shot learning, one-shot learning,
lifting in optimization, and over-parameterization.

### [167] [Contrastive Predictive Coding Done Right for Mutual Information Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25983)
*J. Jon Ryu,Pavan Yeddanapudi,Xiangxiang Xu,Gregory W. Wornell*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InfoNCE is not a valid mutual information estimator; introducing an auxiliary anchor (InfoNCE-anchor) yields a plug-in MI estimator with reduced bias by enabling consistent density-ratio estimation. The approach generalizes via proper scoring rules, unifying NCE/InfoNCE/f-divergence objectives; empirically, InfoNCE-anchor (log score) estimates MI most accurately, but anchor does not improve downstream representations, suggesting benefits arise from learning structured density ratios rather than MI accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the mismatch between InfoNCE and true mutual information estimation, reduce bias in MI estimates, and provide a unified, principled framework for contrastive objectives through proper scoring rules.

Method: Introduce an auxiliary anchor class to enable consistent density-ratio estimation and derive a plug-in MI estimator (InfoNCE-anchor). Generalize the objective with proper scoring rules, recovering InfoNCE-anchor as a special case with the log score. Show connections to NCE, InfoNCE, and f-divergence variants within a single framework.

Result: InfoNCE-anchor achieves significantly reduced bias in MI estimation, with the log-score variant providing the most accurate MI estimates. In self-supervised learning experiments, the anchor does not improve downstream task performance.

Conclusion: Contrastive representation learning benefits from learning structured density ratios rather than from accurate mutual information estimation per se; the proposed InfoNCE-anchor framework unifies multiple objectives under a principled scoring-rule approach, but MI accuracy alone does not guarantee better downstream performance.

Abstract: The InfoNCE objective, originally introduced for contrastive representation
learning, has become a popular choice for mutual information (MI) estimation,
despite its indirect connection to MI. In this paper, we demonstrate why
InfoNCE should not be regarded as a valid MI estimator, and we introduce a
simple modification, which we refer to as InfoNCE-anchor, for accurate MI
estimation. Our modification introduces an auxiliary anchor class, enabling
consistent density ratio estimation and yielding a plug-in MI estimator with
significantly reduced bias. Beyond this, we generalize our framework using
proper scoring rules, which recover InfoNCE-anchor as a special case when the
log score is employed. This formulation unifies a broad spectrum of contrastive
objectives, including NCE, InfoNCE, and $f$-divergence variants, under a single
principled framework. Empirically, we find that InfoNCE-anchor with the log
score achieves the most accurate MI estimates; however, in self-supervised
representation learning experiments, we find that the anchor does not improve
the downstream task performance. These findings corroborate that contrastive
representation learning benefits not from accurate MI estimation per se, but
from the learning of structured density ratios.

*Andrew W. Rosemberg,Joaquim Dias Garcia,François Pacaud,Robert B. Parker,Benoît Legat,Kaarthik Sundar,Russell Bent,Pascal Van Hentenryck*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Updated DiffOpt.jl framework unifies modeling and differentiation in the Julia optimization stack, enabling forward and reverse sensitivities by differentiating the KKT system, with a JuMP-native parameter API and broad demonstrations across convex/nonconvex problems and scale.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Differentiating through constrained optimization is increasingly central to learning, control, and large-scale decision-making, but practical integration is hindered by solver-specific interfaces and brittle coefficient-level bookkeeping.

Method: Differentiate the KKT system under standard regularity to obtain forward and reverse-mode solution and objective sensitivities for smooth, possibly nonconvex programs. Provides a first-class, JuMP-native parameter-centric API to declare named parameters and obtain derivatives with respect to them. Demonstrated on convex and nonconvex models (economic dispatch, mean-variance portfolio with conic constraints, nonlinear robot inverse kinematics). Two companion studies show impact at scale (gradient-based bidding in energy markets; Sobolev-style training of end-to-end optimization proxies using solver-accurate sensitivities).

Result: Validates that differentiable optimization can be deployed as a routine tool within JuMP, enabling derivatives with respect to parameters across multiple constraints/objectives without brittle bookkeeping, and retaining access to a broad solver ecosystem.

Conclusion: Differentiable optimization can be integrated as a standard tool for experimentation, learning, calibration, and design within JuMP, promoting broader adoption of gradient-based methods without departing from standard modeling practices.

Abstract: Differentiating through constrained optimization problems is increasingly
central to learning, control, and large-scale decision-making systems, yet
practical integration remains challenging due to solver specialization and
interface mismatches. This paper presents a general and streamlined
framework-an updated DiffOpt.jl-that unifies modeling and differentiation
within the Julia optimization stack. The framework computes forward - and
reverse-mode solution and objective sensitivities for smooth, potentially
nonconvex programs by differentiating the KKT system under standard regularity
assumptions. A first-class, JuMP-native parameter-centric API allows users to
declare named parameters and obtain derivatives directly with respect to them -
even when a parameter appears in multiple constraints and objectives -
eliminating brittle bookkeeping from coefficient-level interfaces. We
illustrate these capabilities on convex and nonconvex models, including
economic dispatch, mean-variance portfolio selection with conic risk
constraints, and nonlinear robot inverse kinematics. Two companion studies
further demonstrate impact at scale: gradient-based iterative methods for
strategic bidding in energy markets and Sobolev-style training of end-to-end
optimization proxies using solver-accurate sensitivities. Together, these
results demonstrate that differentiable optimization can be deployed as a
routine tool for experimentation, learning, calibration, and design-without
deviating from standard JuMP modeling practices and while retaining access to a
broad ecosystem of solvers.

*Darius Masoum Zadeh-Jousdani,Elvin Hajizada,Eyke Hüllermeier*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Predictive Coding Network with Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA) reduces computational overhead of predictive coding for edge robotics by preserving latent states across frames, leveraging temporal correlations. It achieves 10% fewer weight updates than backpropagation and 50% fewer inference steps than baseline PC on COIL-20, promoting efficient online learning at the edge.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Enable efficient, biologically plausible online learning suitable for edge robots and neuromorphic hardware, addressing the computational inefficiency of traditional predictive coding during continuous adaptation.

Method: PCN-TA preserves latent states across temporal frames and exploits temporal correlations to reduce inference iterations. It compares PCN-TA against standard backpropagation and baseline predictive coding networks on the COIL-20 robotic perception dataset.

Result: PCN-TA achieves 10% fewer weight updates than backpropagation and requires 50% fewer inference steps than baseline PC networks while maintaining learning performance on COIL-20, indicating improved efficiency for real-time edge deployment.

Conclusion: Temporal amortization in predictive coding can substantially lower computational demands without sacrificing performance, making PCN-TA a strong candidate for neuromorphic implementations and edge-adaptive robotics.

Abstract: Robotic systems operating at the edge require efficient online learning
algorithms that can continuously adapt to changing environments while
processing streaming sensory data. Traditional backpropagation, while
effective, conflicts with biological plausibility principles and may be
suboptimal for continuous adaptation scenarios. The Predictive Coding (PC)
framework offers a biologically plausible alternative with local, Hebbian-like
update rules, making it suitable for neuromorphic hardware implementation.
However, PC's main limitation is its computational overhead due to multiple
inference iterations during training. We present Predictive Coding Network with
Temporal Amortization (PCN-TA), which preserves latent states across temporal
frames. By leveraging temporal correlations, PCN-TA significantly reduces
computational demands while maintaining learning performance. Our experiments
on the COIL-20 robotic perception dataset demonstrate that PCN-TA achieves 10%
fewer weight updates compared to backpropagation and requires 50% fewer
inference steps than baseline PC networks. These efficiency gains directly
translate to reduced computational overhead for moving another step toward edge
deployment and real-time adaptation support in resource-constrained robotic
systems. The biologically-inspired nature of our approach also makes it a
promising candidate for future neuromorphic hardware implementations, enabling
efficient online learning at the edge.

### [170] [Infrequent Exploration in Linear Bandits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26000)
*Harin Lee,Min-hwan Oh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: INFEX is a simple, modular framework for infrequent exploration in linear bandits that bridges fully adaptive exploration and greedy strategies. With sparse exploration, it achieves instance-dependent regret matching standard methods, while offering computational benefits and broad applicability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is a gap between fully adaptive exploration (e.g., UCB, Thompson Sampling) and purely greedy methods. Frequent exploration can be impractical or unsafe in safety-critical or costly domains, while greedy approaches require strong context diversity. INFEX aims to enable safe, practical exploration by infrequent yet effective exploration.

Method: INFEX schedules a base exploratory policy to run infrequently while predominantly selecting greedy actions between exploration rounds. It is modular and can incorporate any fully adaptive exploration method. Theoretical analysis shows instance-dependent regret matching standard efficient algorithms when the exploration frequency exceeds a logarithmic threshold. The framework also reduces computation by concentrating exploration at sparse intervals.

Result: Theoretical: INFEX achieves regret that matches standard provably efficient algorithms under a logarithmic exploration-frequency threshold (an instance-dependent bound). Empirical: experiments show state-of-the-art regret performance and improved runtime compared to existing methods, confirming both effectiveness and efficiency.

Conclusion: INFEX provides a simple, practical, and modular solution to infrequent exploration in linear bandits. It enables integration of existing exploration methods, improves computational efficiency, and delivers strong regret guarantees and empirical performance, making it broadly applicable in safety- or cost-sensitive domains.

Abstract: We study the problem of infrequent exploration in linear bandits, addressing
a significant yet overlooked gap between fully adaptive exploratory methods
(e.g., UCB and Thompson Sampling), which explore potentially at every time
step, and purely greedy approaches, which require stringent diversity
assumptions to succeed. Continuous exploration can be impractical or unethical
in safety-critical or costly domains, while purely greedy strategies typically
fail without adequate contextual diversity. To bridge these extremes, we
introduce a simple and practical framework, INFEX, explicitly designed for
infrequent exploration. INFEX executes a base exploratory policy according to a
given schedule while predominantly choosing greedy actions in between. Despite
its simplicity, our theoretical analysis demonstrates that INFEX achieves
instance-dependent regret matching standard provably efficient algorithms,
provided the exploration frequency exceeds a logarithmic threshold.
Additionally, INFEX is a general, modular framework that allows seamless
integration of any fully adaptive exploration method, enabling wide
applicability and ease of adoption. By restricting intensive exploratory
computations to infrequent intervals, our approach can also enhance
computational efficiency. Empirical evaluations confirm our theoretical
findings, showing state-of-the-art regret performance and runtime improvements
over existing methods.

### [171] [Dual Mixture-of-Experts Framework for Discrete-Time Survival Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26014)
*Hyeonjun Lee,Hyungseob Shin,Gunhee Nam,Hyeonsoo Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A dual mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis models patient heterogeneity via a feature-encoder MoE and temporal dynamics via a hazard MoE, achieving improved time-dependent C-index on METABRIC and GBSG breast cancer datasets and compatible with Consurv.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Survival analysis must capture both patient-specific subgroup heterogeneity and time-varying risk dynamics. Traditional single-model approaches may struggle to jointly represent these aspects. A dual MoE aims to separate representation learning (subgroups) from hazard estimation (time dynamics) to flexibly adapt predictions.

Method: Introduce two MoEs: a feature-encoder MoE for learning subgroup-aware representations, and a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings to model hazards. The framework can plug into existing deep survival pipelines. Applied to METABRIC and GBSG breast cancer datasets; evaluated on time-dependent C-index.

Result: The approach consistently improves performance, boosting the time-dependent C-index by up to 0.04 on test sets. Additional gains observed when integrated into the Consurv framework.

Conclusion: A dual MoE framework effectively captures both heterogeneity and temporal risk dynamics, enhancing discrete-time survival prediction and showing compatibility with established pipelines like Consurv.

Abstract: Survival analysis is a task to model the time until an event of interest
occurs, widely used in clinical and biomedical research. A key challenge is to
model patient heterogeneity while also adapting risk predictions to both
individual characteristics and temporal dynamics. We propose a dual
mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for discrete-time survival analysis. Our
approach combines a feature-encoder MoE for subgroup-aware representation
learning with a hazard MoE that leverages patient features and time embeddings
to capture temporal dynamics. This dual-MoE design flexibly integrates with
existing deep learning based survival pipelines. On METABRIC and GBSG breast
cancer datasets, our method consistently improves performance, boosting the
time-dependent C-index up to 0.04 on the test sets, and yields further gains
when incorporated into the Consurv framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Early transformer layers capture human chess concepts (center control, knight outposts) with high accuracy, but deeper layers optimize for performance and drift toward alien representations; Chess960 experiments show concept recognition degrades without opening theory, indicating memorization over abstract understanding.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate whether AI concepts align with human understanding or rely on surface patterns by probing a chess-playing model across layers and with varied starting positions.

Method: Layer-wise probing of a 270M-parameter transformer; concept classifiers for chess ideas; create Chess960 dataset with expert-annotated positions across 6 strategic concepts; evaluate concept recognition with randomized starting positions to remove opening theory; compare across methods.

Result: Early layers encode human concepts with up to 85% accuracy; deeper layers, despite better play, regress to 50-65% concept accuracy; Chess960 reduces concept recognition by 10-20% when opening theory is removed; overall shows a divergence between game-winning representations and human-aligned concepts; evidence of memorization usage.

Conclusion: Optimizing for performance yields more 'alien' representations, highlighting a challenge for collaborative AI in creative domains; calls for new architectures or training paradigms to align models with human conceptual understanding; dataset and code available for replication.

Abstract: Do AI systems truly understand human concepts or merely mimic surface
patterns? We investigate this through chess, where human creativity meets
precise strategic concepts. Analyzing a 270M-parameter transformer that
achieves grandmaster-level play, we uncover a striking paradox: while early
layers encode human concepts like center control and knight outposts with up to
85\% accuracy, deeper layers, despite driving superior performance, drift
toward alien representations, dropping to 50-65\% accuracy. To test conceptual
robustness beyond memorization, we introduce the first Chess960 dataset: 240
expert-annotated positions across 6 strategic concepts. When opening theory is
eliminated through randomized starting positions, concept recognition drops
10-20\% across all methods, revealing the model's reliance on memorized
patterns rather than abstract understanding. Our layer-wise analysis exposes a
fundamental tension in current architectures: the representations that win
games diverge from those that align with human thinking. These findings suggest
that as AI systems optimize for performance, they develop increasingly alien
intelligence, a critical challenge for creative AI applications requiring
genuine human-AI collaboration. Dataset and code are available at:

### [173] [Do Students Debias Like Teachers? On the Distillability of Bias Mitigation Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26038)
*Jiali Cheng,Chirag Agarwal,Hadi Amiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KD generally undermines the transfer of debiasing ability from teacher to student across NLP and vision tasks; the effect is bias-type dependent; data augmentation, iterative KD, and initializing the student with teacher weights are proposed remedies; claimed as the first large-scale study on KD and debiasing.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how knowledge distillation affects the transfer of debiasing/robustness to spurious correlations, a gap in the literature for NLP and vision at scale.

Method: Conduct extensive experiments on natural language inference and image classification to evaluate debiasing under KD, analyze internal attention patterns and circuits, and evaluate three mitigation strategies: high-quality data augmentation, iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing the student from the teacher.

Result: (i) Debiasing ability is generally undermined after KD. (ii) Debiased models do not benefit from injecting teacher knowledge. (iii) Overall robustness may appear stable post-KD, but bias-type effects vary significantly. (iv) Identified internal attention patterns/circuits that drive the distinct post-KD behavior.

Conclusion: This is the first large-scale study on how KD affects debiasing and its internal mechanisms. The findings shed light on how KD works and how to design better debiasing methods.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and
transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's
robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on
out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the
effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''
capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language
inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,
we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a
model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit
from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a
model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur
across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention
pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above
findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of
debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing
iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights
obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.
Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better
debiasing methods.

*David Otte,Jörg K. H. Franke,Frank Hutter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Symbolic regression (SR) performance scales with compute following power laws; compute-optimal hyperparameters exist; token-to-parameter ratio ~15; findings enable predictable planning for SR model training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how scaling laws affect deep-learning-based symbolic regression, providing practical guidance and improving the efficiency and generalization of SR models.

Method: Use a scalable end-to-end transformer SR pipeline, generate carefully constructed training data, evaluate five model sizes across three orders of magnitude in compute, and analyze validation loss, solved rate, and hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate, token-parameter ratio).

Result: Validation loss and solved rate exhibit clear power-law trends with compute; identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling; token-to-parameter ratio of about 15 is optimal in the studied regime (slightly increasing with compute); SR performance is largely predictable from compute.

Conclusion: Scaling SR with compute-based laws yields practical guidelines for training next-generation SR models and suggests SR behaves predictably with respect to compute, akin to scaling laws in language modeling.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover the underlying mathematical
expressions that explain observed data. This holds promise for both gaining
scientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable
models for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep
learning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming
approaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by
scaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic
investigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer
pipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model
sizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both
validation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We
further identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and
learning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of
$\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute
increases. These results demonstrate that SR performance is largely predictable
from compute and offer important insights for training the next generation of
SR models.

TL;DR: Proposes a new ML paradigm where the model's geometry is dynamic: optimize a metric tensor field on a fixed-topology manifold, discretized via a triangular mesh; links data fidelity with geometric regularization; uses edge-length parameterization and autodiff; offers a physics-inspired interpretation via Einstein-Hilbert action and suggests greater expressive power than fixed-geometry models, enabling dynamic meta-learners for science-driven model discovery.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional ML optimizes parameters in a fixed geometric space, which may limit representational capacity and regularity. By allowing the geometry itself to evolve, the approach seeks richer representations, better regularization through geometric simplicity, and a framework for autonomous geometric/meta-learning that could uncover underlying structures in data and physical processes.

Method: Formulate a variational loss balancing data fidelity and intrinsic geometric complexity. Discretize the manifold into a triangular mesh; parameterize the metric tensor via edge lengths; optimize using automatic differentiation. Interpret the optimization in a continuous-discrete differential geometry setting and relate to Einstein-Hilbert action.

Result: Establishes a theoretical bridge between data-driven geometry and physical action, showing deeper expressiveness beyond fixed geometry. Provides a practical discretization strategy and a foundation for dynamic meta-learners, with broad potential in scientific modeling and robust representation learning.

Conclusion: The framework invites fully dynamic, self-evolving geometries/topologies, enabling meta-learning of geometry, and promising broad applications in model discovery and robust representations; it reframes learning as geometry-driven adaptation rather than sole parameter optimization.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond
traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search
for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to
treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we
optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,
thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To
achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function
carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of
the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,
while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular
geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the
computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we
introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the
continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric
tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using
automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound
analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general
relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of
"data-driven geometry". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric
optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with
fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully
dynamic "meta-learners" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and
topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as
scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.

*James Meldrum,Basem Suleiman,Fethi Rabhi,Muhammad Johan Alibasa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Systematic review of 72 studies (2018–present) on synthetic financial data; GANs dominate; notable gaps in privacy evaluation; provides guidance for robust privacy-preserving synthetic data in finance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Financial data are sensitive and regulated; synthetic data offers privacy-preserving alternatives that preserve statistical properties for ML.

Method: Systematic literature review of 72 studies since 2018; taxonomy of data synthesized, generative methods (GANs, VAEs, etc.), and evaluation approaches for utility and privacy.

Result: GAN-based methods dominate, especially for time-series and tabular credit data; some techniques improve realism and privacy preservation; overall, rigorous privacy evaluation is underrepresented across studies; provides integrated landscape.

Conclusion: Consolidates techniques and evaluations; identifies gaps in privacy guarantees and standard benchmarks; guides future work toward robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data solutions for finance.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach to address the
challenges of using sensitive financial data in machine learning applications.
By leveraging generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial
datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records
while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid
growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research
landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72
studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation.
We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative
methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and
privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the
literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular
credit data. While several innovative techniques demonstrate potential for
improved realism and privacy preservation, there remains a notable lack of
rigorous evaluation of privacy safeguards across studies. By providing an
integrated overview of generative techniques, applications, and evaluation
methods, this review highlights critical research gaps and offers guidance for
future work aimed at developing robust, privacy-preserving synthetic data
solutions for the financial domain.

### [177] [CorVS: Person Identification via Video Trajectory-Sensor Correspondence in a Real-World Warehouse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26369)
*Kazuma Kano,Yuki Mori,Shin Katayama,Kenta Urano,Takuro Yonezawa,Nobuo Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CorVS is a data-driven method to identify workers by aligning visual tracking trajectories with sensor measurements, using a deep network to predict pairwise correspondence probabilities and reliabilities, followed by time-aligned matching; evaluated on a warehouse dataset with real operations.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual-only identification in industrial sites is impractical. Cameras can provide localization and environmental context, but robustly identifying individuals under real-world conditions is challenging; existing trajectory-sensor matching methods may fail; a robust, appearance-independent solution is needed for warehouses.

Method: CorVS uses a deep learning model to predict correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for each pair of a visual trajectory and sensor measurements, then matches trajectories and sensor data over time using these predictions.

Result: A warehouse-operation dataset was developed, and the method demonstrated effectiveness in real-world applications, indicating improved robustness for worker identification in logistics environments.

Conclusion: CorVS shows that fusing visual trajectories with sensor measurements via learned correspondences can robustly identify workers in warehouses, addressing limitations of appearance-based methods and enhancing localization in industrial settings.

Abstract: Worker location data is key to higher productivity in industrial sites.
Cameras are a promising tool for localization in logistics warehouses since
they also offer valuable environmental contexts such as package status.
However, identifying individuals with only visual data is often impractical.
Accordingly, several prior studies identified people in videos by comparing
their trajectories and wearable sensor measurements. While this approach has
advantages such as independence from appearance, the existing methods may break
down under real-world conditions. To overcome this challenge, we propose CorVS,
a novel data-driven person identification method based on correspondence
between visual tracking trajectories and sensor measurements. Firstly, our deep
learning model predicts correspondence probabilities and reliabilities for
every pair of a trajectory and sensor measurements. Secondly, our algorithm
matches the trajectories and sensor measurements over time using the predicted
probabilities and reliabilities. We developed a dataset with actual warehouse
operations and demonstrated the method's effectiveness for real-world
applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Nirvana is an SGM with a specialized memory system and Task-Aware memory Trigger, enabling on-the-fly task adaptation; it delivers competitive NLP results and superior MRI reconstruction with a frozen backbone and lightweight codecs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To preserve broad language capabilities while attaining expert performance in target domains, addressing the lack of task-guided specialized memory in traditional LLMs.

Method: Propose Nirvana with a Specialized Memory Updater and Task-Aware Memory Trigger that treat each sample as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, dynamically memory updates guided by Trigger; test-time task information extraction; post-train with lightweight codecs on MRI/paired signals while backbone frozen.

Result: Achieves competitive or superior results on NLP benchmarks compared to existing LLMs; in medical MRI tasks, provides higher-quality reconstructions than conventional MRI models and LLM-backbone baselines; can generate preliminary clinical reports.

Conclusion: Specialized memory with task-awareTrigger enables SGMs to maintain broad capabilities while achieving domain-specific performance; Trigger adapts to domain shifts with low overhead via on-the-fly parameter adaptation; supports extension to other domains and modalities.

Abstract: Specialized Generalist Models (SGMs) aim to preserve broad capabilities while
achieving expert-level performance in target domains. However, traditional LLM
structures including Transformer, Linear Attention, and hybrid models do not
employ specialized memory mechanism guided by task information. In this paper,
we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time
complexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the
Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory
mechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming
sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to
adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design
the Specialized Memory Updater ($\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes
the context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language
tasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling
benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the
existing LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized
tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e.,
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with
lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images. Despite
the frozen Nirvana backbone, Trigger guides the model to adapt to the MRI
domain with the change of task-related parameters. Nirvana achieves
higher-quality MRI reconstruction compared to conventional MRI models as well
as the models with traditional LLMs' backbone, and can also generate accurate
preliminary clinical reports accordingly.

### [179] [LLMBisect: Breaking Barriers in Bug Bisection with A Comparative Analysis Pipeline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26086)
*Zheng Zhang,Haonan Li,Xingyu Li,Hang Zhang,Zhiyun Qian*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A multi-stage LLM-driven bisection pipeline improves bug-inducing commit identification, outperforming prior methods by substantial margins.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Traditional patch-based BIC methods are hindered by mismatches between BIC and patch commits, reliance on code changes, underutilization of commit messages, and weak logical analysis. LLMs can leverage both text and code to address these gaps.

Method: Proposes a comprehensive multi-stage pipeline that uses LLMs to fully utilize patch information, compare candidate commits in context, and progressively down-select to identify the BIC.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows >38% accuracy improvement over the state-of-the-art; the full pipeline improves accuracy by ~60% over a baseline LLM-based bisection method.

Conclusion: A holistic, LLM-driven multi-stage approach is essential for effective BIC identification, enabling richer use of textual and code information and outperforming existing solutions.

Abstract: Bug bisection has been an important security task that aims to understand the
range of software versions impacted by a bug, i.e., identifying the commit that
introduced the bug. However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are
faced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the
bug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which
is not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit
message frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They
are also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines
deleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.
  In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are
well-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend
both textual data and code in patches and commits. Unlike previous BIC
identification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive
multi-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch
information, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3)
progressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection
steps. In our evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach achieves
significantly better accuracy than the state-of-the-art solution by more than
38\%. Our results further confirm that the comprehensive multi-stage pipeline
is essential, as it improves accuracy by 60\% over a baseline LLM-based
bisection method.

### [180] [Network-Constrained Policy Optimization for Adaptive Multi-agent Vehicle Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26089)
*Fazel Arasteh,Arian Haghparast,Manos Papagelis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A network-aware MARL approach for dynamic vehicle routing using two phases: (1) Adaptive Navigation (AN) with decentralized agents at intersections leveraging local and neighborhood states via Graph Attention Networks (GAT); (2) Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation (HHAN) that routes hub-to-hub with SPFs within hubs, using centralized training with Attentive Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) for scalable coordination. Demonstrates improved travel times and 100% routing success, with HHAN scaling to large networks and up to 15.9% gains under heavy traffic.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Urban road networks suffer from dynamic congestion; SPF is optimal only for single-vehicle static cases and can worsen congestion when used for multi-vehicle routing. A scalable, coordinated MARL framework is needed to navigate networks efficiently.

Method: AN: decentralized MARL where each intersection agent guides routing using local traffic and neighborhood state via Graph Attention Networks (GAT). HHAN: hierarchical extension assigning agents to key hubs; hub-to-hub routing under agent control, SPF for micro-routing inside hubs; centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under Attentive Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) to aggregate asynchronous vehicle decisions through attention; hub state features incorporate flow-aware, predictive dynamics.

Result: AN reduces average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines while maintaining 100% routing success on synthetic grids and real maps (Toronto, Manhattan). HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections and achieves up to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic, highlighting scalability and effectiveness of network-constrained MARL for ITS routing.

Conclusion: Network-constrained MARL with decentralized agents and hierarchical hub-based coordination can provide scalable, congestion-aware routing in large urban networks, outperforming traditional SPF and baseline MARL approaches.

Abstract: Traffic congestion in urban road networks leads to longer trip times and
higher emissions, especially during peak periods. While the Shortest Path First
(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it
performs poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion
by routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle
routing through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for
coordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive
Navigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent
provides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood
state modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in
large networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation
(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections
(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles
micro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts
centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive
Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions
via attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local
congestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on
synthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces
average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing
success. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up
to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the
potential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and
congestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.

### [181] [SAFE: A Novel Approach to AI Weather Evaluation through Stratified Assessments of Forecasts over Earth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26099)
*Nick Masi,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces SAFE, a geospatial stratified forecast assessment framework to reveal spatial fairness gaps in weather/climate models; shows disparities across countries, regions, income, and landcover; open-source.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Global-average metrics misrepresent model skill; there is a need for stratified, fair assessment across diverse geographies and socio-economic contexts to understand where models are reliable.

Method: SAFE aggregates predictions over Earth into strata defined by territory (country), global subregion, income, and landcover; computes performance metrics per stratum; benchmarks multiple state-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models across lead times and climatic variables; open-source.

Result: All evaluated models exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across the stratified attributes; the framework enables a multi-dimensional fairness benchmark by showing where models perform best or worst and assessing fairness across strata.

Conclusion: Stratified evaluation reveals geographic and socio-economic biases that global averages mask; SAFE enables ongoing fairness auditing and improvement of forecast models; codebase is open-source and available for community use.

Abstract: The dominant paradigm in machine learning is to assess model performance
based on average loss across all samples in some test set. This amounts to
averaging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate
settings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human
development and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts
over Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a
set of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to
stratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints:
territory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or
water). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual
stratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual
country). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of
state-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all
exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to
seed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different
lead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged
metrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and
which models are most fair? To support further work in this direction, the SAFE
package is open source and available at https://github.com/N-Masi/safe

*Chenming Tang,Hsiu-Yuan Huang,Weijie Liu,Saiyong Yang,Yunfang Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LTE enables learning from trial-and-error using self-generated mistakes to overcome exploration stagnation in RLVR, without external guidance, improving math reasoning benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods rely on the model’s own outputs and sometimes off-policy approaches require scarce expert guidance, leading to exploration stagnation.

Method: LTE trains LLMs by exposing them to their own prior incorrect answers (and issues with overly long responses), turning mistakes into learning signals without external supervision, and evaluating against GRPO on math benchmarks with Qwen3-4B-Base.

Result: LTE outperforms the normal GRPO baseline by 6.38 in Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks.

Conclusion: LTE mitigates exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and exploration during training, demonstrating effective reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards in LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly
boosted the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) recently.
However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LLMs based on their own
generated responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LLMs, thus
prone to exploration stagnation, in which LLMs fail to solve more training
problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to
address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems but
requires external guidance from experts which suffers from limited
availability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and
Error), an approach hinting LLMs with their previously self-generated incorrect
answers and problem of overlong responses, which does not require any external
expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which
outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 6.38 in
Pass@1 and 9.00 in Pass@k on average across six mathematics benchmarks for
Qwen3-4B-Base. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates the
problem of exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and
exploration during training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces maxVSTAR, a vision-guided, self-adaptive CSI-based HAR framework that uses a YOLO-based vision model to supervise online edge adaptation of STAR, mitigating domain shift and enabling long-term autonomous activity recognition with improved accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Domain shift due to environmental and hardware variability degrades edge CSI-HAR; there is a need for privacy-preserving, device-free sensing with autonomous adaptation without manual recalibration.

Method: Cross-modal teacher-student architecture: a high-accuracy YOLO vision model acts as dynamic supervisor, providing real-time activity labels for the CSI stream; online fine-tuning of lightweight STAR at the edge; closed-loop retraining with no manual intervention.

Result: On uncalibrated hardware, STAR accuracy dropped from 93.52% to 49.14%; after a single vision-guided adaptation cycle, accuracy rose to 81.51% (maxVSTAR). Demonstrates effective self-supervised adaptation and potential for long-term deployment in privacy-conscious IoT environments.

Conclusion: maxVSTAR enables dynamic, privacy-conscious edge HAR by autonomously mitigating domain shift through vision-guided, closed-loop adaptation; scalable and practical for long-term CSI-based HAR in edge environments.

Abstract: WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based human activity recognition (HAR)
provides a privacy-preserving, device-free sensing solution for smart
environments. However, its deployment on edge devices is severely constrained
by domain shift, where recognition performance deteriorates under varying
environmental and hardware conditions. This study presents maxVSTAR (maximally
adaptive Vision-guided Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), a
closed-loop, vision-guided model adaptation framework that autonomously
mitigates domain shift for edge-deployed CSI sensing systems. The proposed
system integrates a cross-modal teacher-student architecture, where a
high-accuracy YOLO-based vision model serves as a dynamic supervisory signal,
delivering real-time activity labels for the CSI data stream. These labels
enable autonomous, online fine-tuning of a lightweight CSI-based HAR model,
termed Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition (STAR), directly at the
edge. This closed-loop retraining mechanism allows STAR to continuously adapt
to environmental changes without manual intervention. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of maxVSTAR. When deployed on uncalibrated
hardware, the baseline STAR model's recognition accuracy declined from 93.52%
to 49.14%. Following a single vision-guided adaptation cycle, maxVSTAR restored
the accuracy to 81.51%. These results confirm the system's capacity for
dynamic, self-supervised model adaptation in privacy-conscious IoT
environments, establishing a scalable and practical paradigm for long-term
autonomous HAR using CSI sensing at the network edge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Need for privacy-preserving, contactless HAR in smart homes/healthcare with low latency and energy efficiency on resource-constrained edge devices; existing methods are computationally heavy and unsuitable for embedded platforms.

Method: Proposes STAR: a lightweight GRU-based RNN; a multi-stage pre-processing pipeline (median filtering, 8th-order Butterworth low-pass, EMD) for denoising and feature extraction; hardware-aware co-optimization; on-device deployment on Rockchip RV1126 with NPU and ESP32-S3 CSI module; INT8 quantization.

Conclusion: STAR offers a practical, scalable edge solution for real-time, privacy-preserving HAR in mobile and pervasive computing environments, demonstrating feasibility on constrained hardware.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) via Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)
presents a privacy-preserving, contactless sensing approach suitable for smart

often encounter computational inefficiency, high latency, and limited
feasibility within resource-constrained, embedded mobile edge environments.
This paper proposes STAR (Sensing Technology for Activity Recognition), an
edge-AI-optimized framework that integrates a lightweight neural architecture,
adaptive signal processing, and hardware-aware co-optimization to enable
real-time, energy-efficient HAR on low-power embedded devices. STAR
incorporates a streamlined Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)-based recurrent neural
network, reducing model parameters by 33% compared to conventional LSTM models
while maintaining effective temporal modeling capability. A multi-stage
pre-processing pipeline combining median filtering, 8th-order Butterworth
low-pass filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is employed to
denoise CSI amplitude data and extract spatial-temporal features. For on-device
deployment, STAR is implemented on a Rockchip RV1126 processor equipped with an
embedded Neural Processing Unit (NPU), interfaced with an ESP32-S3-based CSI
acquisition module. Experimental results demonstrate a mean recognition
accuracy of 93.52% across seven activity classes and 99.11% for human presence
detection, utilizing a compact 97.6k-parameter model. INT8 quantized inference
achieves a processing speed of 33 MHz with just 8% CPU utilization, delivering
sixfold speed improvements over CPU-based execution. With sub-second response
latency and low power consumption, the system ensures real-time,
privacy-preserving HAR, offering a practical, scalable solution for mobile and
pervasive computing environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MolBridge introduces substructure-aware molecule-text alignment with contrastive learning and a self-refinement filter to improve fine-grained correspondences, achieving state-of-the-art results on molecular benchmarks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing molecule-text models struggle to capture fine-grained correspondences between molecular substructures and chemical phrases, limiting the learning of rich molecular representations.

Method: Augment molecule-description data with alignment signals from molecular substructures and chemical phrases; train with substructure-aware contrastive learning; apply a self-refinement mechanism to filter noisy alignments.

Result: MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range of molecular benchmarks.

Conclusion: Substructure-aware alignment is significant for molecule-text learning, enabling better understanding of chemical information.

Abstract: Molecule and text representation learning has gained increasing interest due
to its potential for enhancing the understanding of chemical information.
However, existing models often struggle to capture subtle differences between
molecules and their descriptions, as they lack the ability to learn
fine-grained alignments between molecular substructures and chemical phrases.
To address this limitation, we introduce MolBridge, a novel molecule-text
learning framework based on substructure-aware alignments. Specifically, we
augment the original molecule-description pairs with additional alignment
signals derived from molecular substructures and chemical phrases. To
effectively learn from these enriched alignments, MolBridge employs
substructure-aware contrastive learning, coupled with a self-refinement
mechanism that filters out noisy alignment signals. Experimental results show
that MolBridge effectively captures fine-grained correspondences and
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on a wide range of molecular benchmarks,
highlighting the significance of substructure-aware alignment in molecule-text
learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: In anomaly detection for multivariate industrial time series, a simple Random Forest + XGBoost ensemble on segmented data outperforms advanced feature engineering and hybrid architectures, achieving AUC-ROC 0.976, F1 0.41, and full early detection; simplicity with segmentation enhances robustness and interpretability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Assess whether advanced feature engineering (change-point stats, clustering representations) and hybrid models provide actual gains over a simple baseline in imbalanced, temporally uncertain industrial data.

Method: Compare several complex approaches (change-point derived features, clustering-based substructures, hybrid learning strategies) against a simple RF+XGBoost ensemble trained on segmented data.

Result: Complex approaches underperform relative to RF+XGBoost: AUC-ROC 0.976, F1 0.41, 100% early detection reported for the RF+XGBoost baseline.

Conclusion: In settings with imbalanced and temporally uncertain data, simple models with optimized data segmentation can surpass sophisticated architectures, offering greater robustness and interpretability.

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of advanced feature
engineering and hybrid model architectures for anomaly detection in a
multivariate industrial time series, focusing on a steam turbine system. We
evaluate the impact of change point-derived statistical features,
clustering-based substructure representations, and hybrid learning strategies
on detection performance. Despite their theoretical appeal, these complex
approaches consistently underperformed compared to a simple Random Forest +
XGBoost ensemble trained on segmented data. The ensemble achieved an AUC-ROC of
0.976, F1-score of 0.41, and 100% early detection within the defined time
window. Our findings highlight that, in scenarios with highly imbalanced and
temporally uncertain data, model simplicity combined with optimized
segmentation can outperform more sophisticated architectures, offering greater
robustness, interpretability, and operational utility.

*Songxin Lei,Qiongyan Wang,Yanchen Zhu,Hanyu Yao,Sijie Ruan,Weilin Ruan,Yuyu Luo,Huaming Wu,Yuxuan Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA) that accounts for capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics, and offers Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) to approximate Nash equilibria in this NP-hard setting; demonstrated superior performance on two real-world datasets with code provided.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing resource allocation methods optimize single resources independently and neglect capacity constraints, making them impractical for real systems. CPRA aims to model joint resource allocation with capacity limits and time-varying dynamics.

Method: Formulate CPRA as a potential game and show no gap between the potential function and the optimal target. Propose GSTRL, a reinforcement learning framework that captures spatio-temporal dynamics and multi-agent interactions to solve the CPRA problem. Validate on two real-world datasets; provide source code in supplementary materials.

Result: GSTRL achieves superior performance over baselines on two real-world datasets, demonstrating effective handling of capacity-aware, spatio-temporal resource allocation.

Conclusion: CPRA with a game-theoretic spatio-temporal RL framework offers a solid theoretical foundation and practical effectiveness for cooperative public resource distribution; the potential game formulation enables tractable approximation of Nash equilibria, with code available for reproducibility.

Abstract: Public resource allocation involves the efficient distribution of resources,
including urban infrastructure, energy, and transportation, to effectively meet
societal demands. However, existing methods focus on optimizing the movement of
individual resources independently, without considering their capacity
constraints. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and more practical
problem: Collaborative Public Resource Allocation (CPRA), which explicitly
incorporates capacity constraints and spatio-temporal dynamics in real-world
scenarios. We propose a new framework called Game-Theoretic Spatio-Temporal
Reinforcement Learning (GSTRL) for solving CPRA. Our contributions are twofold:
1) We formulate the CPRA problem as a potential game and demonstrate that there
is no gap between the potential function and the optimal target, laying a solid
theoretical foundation for approximating the Nash equilibrium of this NP-hard
problem; and 2) Our designed GSTRL framework effectively captures the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the overall system. We evaluate GSTRL on two
real-world datasets, where experiments show its superior performance. Our
source codes are available in the supplementary materials.

### [188] [Accumulative SGD Influence Estimation for Data Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26185)
*Yunxiao Shi,Shuo Yang,Yixin Su,Rui Zhang,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACC-SGD-IE introduces a trajectory-aware leave-one-out influence estimator for SGD that propagates perturbations across training steps, accounting for cross-epoch effects. It improves accuracy of per-sample influence, especially over long training, and enhances data cleansing performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Standard SGD-IE approximates leave-one-out effects by summing per-epoch surrogates and ignores cross-epoch compounding, causing misranking of influential samples and degraded data-cleaning performance.

Method: Propose ACC-SGD-IE, a trajectory-aware estimator that propagates the leave-one-out perturbation through training and maintains an accumulative influence state at each step to capture cross-epoch effects; analyzes contraction of error in smooth strongly convex settings and tighter bounds in smooth non-convex regimes; shows benefit from larger mini-batch sizes.

Result: Theoretically, ACC-SGD-IE achieves geometric error contraction in smooth strongly convex settings and tighter error bounds in smooth non-convex regimes; larger mini-batches reduce constants. Empirically on Adult, 20 Newsgroups, and MNIST (clean and corrupted data; convex and non-convex training), it produces more accurate influence estimates, especially over long epochs, and improves downstream data cleansing by reliably flagging noisy samples, yielding models trained on ACC-SGD-IE cleaned data that outperform SGD-IE cleaned data.

Conclusion: Trajectory-aware accumulation of leave-one-out influence during SGD yields more accurate per-sample influence estimates, better data-cleansing performance, and robust improvements for models trained with cleaned data across convex and non-convex regimes and across varied datasets.

Abstract: Modern data-centric AI needs precise per-sample influence. Standard SGD-IE
approximates leave-one-out effects by summing per-epoch surrogates and ignores
cross-epoch compounding, which misranks critical examples. We propose
ACC-SGD-IE, a trajectory-aware estimator that propagates the leave-one-out
perturbation across training and updates an accumulative influence state at
each step. In smooth strongly convex settings it achieves geometric error
contraction and, in smooth non-convex regimes, it tightens error bounds; larger
mini-batches further reduce constants. Empirically, on Adult, 20 Newsgroups,
and MNIST under clean and corrupted data and both convex and non-convex
training, ACC-SGD-IE yields more accurate influence estimates, especially over
long epochs. For downstream data cleansing it more reliably flags noisy
samples, producing models trained on ACC-SGD-IE cleaned data that outperform
those cleaned with SGD-IE.

*Avinash Kadimisetty,Arun Rajagopalan,Vijendra SK*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Machine learning on health claims data with PCA reduces dimensionality; Random Forest best predicts all-cause readmissions (AUC higher than LR and SVM), enabling identification of key factors and targeted interventions to reduce readmissions and costs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority; readmission rate acts as a quality benchmark; aim to improve care and lower costs by identifying factors driving readmissions via ML.

Method: Apply Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines to health claims data; use Principal Component Analysis for dimension reduction; build regression models; compare via AUC.

Result: Random Forest achieved the highest AUC; followed by Logistic Regression and SVM; PCA-processed features improved performance; the models can identify crucial factors and help target at-risk patients to reduce readmission and costs.

Conclusion: ML models on claims data with PCA can identify drivers of readmissions and support targeted interventions to reduce readmissions, lower costs, and improve healthcare quality.

Abstract: Reducing preventable hospital readmissions is a national priority for payers,
providers, and policymakers seeking to improve health care and lower costs. The
rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of
healthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine
learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector
Machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical
factors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the
health claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component
Analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building
regression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area
Under Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance
followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models
can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help
identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately
bringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the
patients.

*Sekitoshi Kanai,Tsukasa Yoshida,Hiroshi Takahashi,Haru Kuroki,Kazumune Hashimoto*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AISP is a test-time alignment method for LLMs that uses adaptive importance sampling on pre-logits with Gaussian perturbations to maximize expected rewards, estimating the optimal perturbation mean via sampled rewards; it outperforms best-of-n sampling and other reward-based test-time methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fine-tuning LLMs is computationally expensive; a fast, effective test-time alignment method is needed to steer models toward desired rewards without full fine-tuning.

Method: Introduce adaptive importance sampling on pre-logits (AISP). Apply Gaussian perturbations to pre-logits (penultimate layer outputs) and optimize the perturbation mean to maximize expected reward. The optimal mean is derived via importance sampling using sampled rewards within a sampling-based model predictive control framework with a stochastic control input.

Result: Empirically, AISP outperforms best-of-n sampling in reward quality for a given number of samples and achieves higher rewards than other reward-based test-time alignment methods.

Conclusion: AISP provides a more efficient and effective test-time alignment approach by adaptively adjusting perturbations to the pre-logits through importance sampling, reducing the computational burden compared to full fine-tuning while achieving higher rewards.

Abstract: Test-time alignment of large language models (LLMs) attracts attention
because fine-tuning LLMs requires high computational costs. In this paper, we
propose a new test-time alignment method called adaptive importance sampling on
pre-logits (AISP) on the basis of the sampling-based model predictive control
with the stochastic control input. AISP applies the Gaussian perturbation into
pre-logits, which are outputs of the penultimate layer, so as to maximize
expected rewards with respect to the mean of the perturbation. We demonstrate
that the optimal mean is obtained by importance sampling with sampled rewards.
AISP outperforms best-of-n sampling in terms of rewards over the number of used
samples and achieves higher rewards than other reward-based test-time alignment
methods.

### [191] [MPRU: Modular Projection-Redistribution Unlearning as Output Filter for Classification Pipelines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26230)
*Minyi Peng,Darian Gunamardi,Ivan Tjuawinata,Kwok-Yan Lam*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an inductive machine unlearning method that reverses the last training sequence by appending a projection-redistribution layer, enabling scalable, model-agnostic unlearning without full data/model access; experiments show comparable performance to full retraining with much less compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address scalability and practicality of existing machine unlearning methods, which often require full access to original data and models and can be impractical in real-world deployments.

Method: Treat training as a sequential class-learning process; to unlearn a class, reverse the last training sequence by adding a projection-redistribution layer at the end of the model that acts as an output filter. This approach is modular and does not require full access to the original dataset or the model.

Result: Experiments on image data (CIFAR-10/100 with CNN) and tabular data (Covertype with tree-based model) show outputs close to a fully retrained model, with substantially reduced computational cost.

Conclusion: The method demonstrates applicability, scalability, and system compatibility for practical machine unlearning while maintaining performance, and is model-agnostic and minimally invasive.

Abstract: As a new and promising approach, existing machine unlearning (MU) works
typically emphasize theoretical formulations or optimization objectives to
achieve knowledge removal. However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such
solutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical
requirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to
the existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential
process where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \emph{inductive
approach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence.
This is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end
of the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original
dataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This
enables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing
classification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple
experiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using
CNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model).
Experiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model
with a high computational cost reduction. This demonstrates the applicability,
scalability, and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the
performance of the output in a more practical setting.

### [192] [Angular Steering: Behavior Control via Rotation in Activation Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26243)
*Hieu M. Vu,Tan M. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces Angular Steering, a geometric rotation-based method to modulate LLM behavior by rotating activations within a fixed 2D subspace, enabling fine-grained control (e.g., refusals) while preserving overall capabilities; Adaptive Angular Steering improves stability by rotating only activations aligned with the target feature; generalizes existing methods and shows robust results across models; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To control specific behaviors in large language models without degrading their general capabilities, addressing limitations of prior steering methods that rely on 2D subspaces susceptible to unintended interactions.

Method: Define a fixed 2D subspace (activation direction and feature direction) and apply a rotation of activations toward/away from a target behavior direction; introduce Adaptive Angular Steering to rotate only activations aligned with the target feature; show that this framework generalizes addition and orthogonalization methods.

Result: Empirical evidence across multiple model families and sizes demonstrating robust behavioral control (e.g., refusals and emotion steering) with minimal impact on standard language modeling performance; code is provided.

Conclusion: Angular Steering offers continuous, flexible, and robust behavioral control, unifying and extending prior techniques under a geometric rotation framework, with easier parameter tuning and broad applicability.

Abstract: Controlling specific behaviors in large language models while preserving
their general capabilities is a central challenge for safe and reliable
artificial intelligence deployment. Current steering methods, such as vector
addition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional
subspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive
to chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to
unintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a
novel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating
activations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as
a geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular
Steering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as
refusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering
emotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular
Steering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the
target feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering
generalizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified
geometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining
model stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across
multiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust
behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance,
underscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior
approaches. Code and artifacts are available at

*Frederik Möbius Rygaard,Shen Zhu,Yinzhu Jin,Søren Hauberg,Tom Fletcher*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A training-free interpolation scheme for generative models that follows high-density, metric-compatible transition paths (geodesics on a data distribution); theoretically aligns with a Riemannian geodesic and empirically outperforms baselines in traversing dense regions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To provide a principled, training-free method for interpolating in generative models, enabling controlled generation and model inspection without restrictive assumptions on model or data dimensionality.

Method: Define interpolation as a geodesic constrained to a suitable data distribution and derive a novel algorithm to compute these curves without additional training; ensures compatibility with different metrics and probability distributions; locally, the curve behaves like a geodesic under a selected Riemannian metric.

Result: The method locally acts as a geodesic under a suitable Riemannian metric; empirical evaluations show the interpolants traverse higher-density regions than baselines across various models and datasets.

Conclusion: The proposed framework offers a general, training-free interpolation method that respects data geometry, enabling more meaningful transitions and inspection in generative models, and is adaptable to different metrics and distributions.

Abstract: Interpolation in generative models allows for controlled generation, model
inspection, and more. Unfortunately, most generative models lack a principal
notion of interpolants without restrictive assumptions on either the model or
data dimension. In this paper, we develop a general interpolation scheme that
targets likely transition paths compatible with different metrics and
probability distributions. We consider interpolants analogous to a geodesic
constrained to a suitable data distribution and derive a novel algorithm for
computing these curves, which requires no additional training. Theoretically,
we show that our method locally can be considered as a geodesic under a
suitable Riemannian metric. We quantitatively show that our interpolation
scheme traverses higher density regions than baselines across a range of models
and datasets.

### [194] [Distributional Multi-objective Black-box Optimization for Diffusion-model Inference-time Multi-Target Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26278)
*Kim Yong Tan,Yueming Lyu,Ivor Tsang,Yew-Soon Ong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IMG optimizes diffusion sampling in inference time to satisfy multiple objectives, using weighted resampling toward a multi-target Boltzmann distribution; achieves higher hypervolume with a single pass.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion models are not fully exploited when used as black-box refiners; internal diffusion transitions offer a tractable path to multi-objective optimization.

Method: Perform weighted resampling during diffusion generation based on expected aggregated objective values; derive a log-likelihood interpretation as the optimal solution to distributional MO optimization; apply to multi-objective molecule generation.

Result: Single-pass generation with IMG yields substantially higher hypervolume than baselines requiring hundreds of diffusion generations.

Conclusion: IMG acts as an optimized diffusion process; can be integrated with existing methods to improve multi-objective diffusion generation efficiency.

Abstract: Diffusion models have been successful in learning complex data distributions.
This capability has driven their application to high-dimensional
multi-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often
employ an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the
diffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a
black-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the
diffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG)
algorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate
samples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG
performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according
to the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling
strategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to
our desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the
multi-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood
interpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional
multi-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective
molecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single
generation pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline
optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations.
Notably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can
be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.

### [195] [Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26284)
*Xia Jiang,Rong J. B. Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes an empirical Bayesian hierarchical framework for multi-task (multi-bandit) learning that models covariance across bandit instances, introducing ebmTS and ebmUCB algorithms with regret guarantees and strong empirical performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To leverage shared structure and correlations among related bandit tasks while accounting for instance-specific heterogeneity, addressing the gap where prior work does not learn the cross-bandit covariance.

Method: Introduce a hierarchical Bayesian model capturing heterogeneity and inter-bandit correlations; estimate the prior's covariance via empirical Bayes; develop two algorithms, ebmTS (Thompson Sampling) and ebmUCB (Upper Confidence Bound), that integrate the learned prior into decision making; derive frequentist regret upper bounds.

Result: Theoretical regret bounds are established for the proposed algorithms; extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data show lower cumulative regret compared with existing methods, especially in complex environments.

Conclusion: Learning the covariance structure across multi-bandits via empirical Bayes enhances information sharing and decision quality, yielding practical and flexible multi-bandit algorithms with strong performance and provable guarantees.

Abstract: Multi-task learning in contextual bandits has attracted significant research
interest due to its potential to enhance decision-making across multiple
related tasks by leveraging shared structures and task-specific heterogeneity.
In this article, we propose a novel hierarchical Bayesian framework for
learning in various bandit instances. This framework captures both the
heterogeneity and the correlations among different bandit instances through a
hierarchical Bayesian model, enabling effective information sharing while
accommodating instance-specific variations. Unlike previous methods that
overlook the learning of the covariance structure across bandits, we introduce
an empirical Bayesian approach to estimate the covariance matrix of the prior
distribution.This enhances both the practicality and flexibility of learning
across multi-bandits. Building on this approach, we develop two efficient
algorithms: ebmTS (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Thompson Sampling) and
ebmUCB (Empirical Bayesian Multi-Bandit Upper Confidence Bound), both of which
incorporate the estimated prior into the decision-making process. We provide
the frequentist regret upper bounds for the proposed algorithms, thereby
filling a research gap in the field of multi-bandit problems. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior
performance of our algorithms, particularly in complex environments. Our
methods achieve lower cumulative regret compared to existing techniques,
highlighting their effectiveness in balancing exploration and exploitation
across multi-bandits.

### [196] [Offline Clustering of Preference Learning with Active-data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26301)
*Jingyuan Liu,Fatemeh Ghaffari,Xuchuang Wang,Mohammad Hajiesmaili,Carlee Joe-Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for offline clustering of preference learning across multiple users, with two algorithms (Off-C^2PL for pure offline and A^2-Off-C^2PL with active data augmentation) that provide theoretical guarantees and demonstrate improved sample efficiency via active sampling, validated on synthetic and real-world data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address two main issues in offline, multi-user preference learning: (i) identifying and leveraging similarity across users to aggregate data effectively under sparse/imbalanced offline samples, and (ii) handling imbalance among preference dimensions by actively augmenting data for the test user to improve utility.

Method: 1) Off-C^2PL: a pure offline algorithm that clusters users based on their preference data and learns a shared model within clusters, with a suboptimality bound that balances sample noise and bias. 2) A^2-Off-C^2PL: extends to active-data augmentation, selecting a limited set of additional samples for the test user guided by the learned cluster structure, focusing on least-informative dimensions to maximize information gain.

Result: Theoretical guarantees: a suboptimality bound for Off-C^2PL highlighting the noise-bias tradeoff. Empirical results show that actively collected samples in A^2-Off-C^2PL provide more information than offline samples, leading to improved performance; validation through simulations on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Conclusion: Clustering-based offline preference learning across users with adaptive data collection can improve utility for a test user. The work provides both theoretical guarantees and empirical evidence that active sampling guided by cluster structure enhances data efficiency and performance in imbalanced, multi-user settings.

Abstract: Preference learning from pairwise feedback is a widely adopted framework in
applications such as reinforcement learning with human feedback and
recommendations. In many practical settings, however, user interactions are
limited or costly, making offline preference learning necessary. Moreover,
real-world preference learning often involves users with different preferences.
For example, annotators from different backgrounds may rank the same responses
differently. This setting presents two central challenges: (1) identifying
similarity across users to effectively aggregate data, especially under
scenarios where offline data is imbalanced across dimensions, and (2) handling
the imbalanced offline data where some preference dimensions are
underrepresented. To address these challenges, we study the Offline Clustering
of Preference Learning problem, where the learner has access to fixed datasets
from multiple users with potentially different preferences and aims to maximize
utility for a test user. To tackle the first challenge, we first propose
Off-C$^2$PL for the pure offline setting, where the learner relies solely on
offline data. Our theoretical analysis provides a suboptimality bound that
explicitly captures the tradeoff between sample noise and bias. To address the
second challenge of inbalanced data, we extend our framework to the setting
with active-data augmentation where the learner is allowed to select a limited
number of additional active-data for the test user based on the cluster
structure learned by Off-C$^2$PL. In this setting, our second algorithm,
A$^2$-Off-C$^2$PL, actively selects samples that target the least-informative
dimensions of the test user's preference. We prove that these actively
collected samples contribute more effectively than offline ones. Finally, we
validate our theoretical results through simulations on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

### [197] [Understanding Hardness of Vision-Language Compositionality from A Token-level Causal Lens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26302)
*Ziliang Chen,Tianang Xiao,Jusheng Zhang,Yongsen Zheng,Xipeng Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Token-aware causal representation learning explains CLIP's compositional brittleness by showing composition nonidentifiability at token level; identifies pseudo-optimal encoders that align modalities yet ignore swaps/replaces/adds of atomic concepts; links language nonidentifiability to the modality gap and suggests improved negative mining strategies.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address the gap in causal accounts of CLIP by modeling text at token granularity to explain prompt sensitivity, hard negatives, and compositional failures; connect language-side nonidentifiability to visual-side limitations.

Method: Propose a token-aware CRL framework grounded in a sequential language-token SCM; extend block identifiability to tokenized text; prove that CLIP's contrastive objective recovers the modal-invariant latent under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs; analyze nonidentifiability and invariances (SWAP, REPLACE, ADD) and discuss implications for negative mining and the modality gap.

Result: Theoretical identifiability results showing CLIP can recover a modal-invariant latent variable under token-level text models; demonstration of composition nonidentifiability caused by token granularity; existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve alignment yet are insensitive to atomic concept edits, explaining failures on hard negatives despite identical training objective; linkage framework connecting language-side nonidentifiability to visual-side modality gap and suggesting iterative composition operators increase hardness.

Conclusion: Token-level modeling is essential to understand CLIP's compositional brittleness; nonidentifiability at the token level explains why simple objective functions misguide models; points to improved negative mining and potential architectural or training strategies to mitigate modality gap and enhance compositional reasoning.

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) delivers strong cross modal
generalization by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space, yet it
persistently fails at compositional reasoning over objects, attributes, and
relations often behaving like a bag-of-words matcher. Prior causal accounts
typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and
leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard
negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal
representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential,
language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text,
proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant
latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially,
token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's
compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the
existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant
alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations
over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard
negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal
encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to
visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition
operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.

### [198] [Implicit Bias of Per-sample Adam on Separable Data: Departure from the Full-batch Regime](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26303)
*Beomhan Baek,Minhak Song,Chulhee Yun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Incremental Adam can diverge in implicit bias from full-batch Adam; on some datasets it converges to the L2 max-margin, whereas full-batch Adam biases toward the L-infinity geometry; Signum consistently targets the L-infinity max-margin as beta approaches 1, independent of batching.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand how the implicit bias of Adam depends on batching and data geometry, and to contrast it with Signum and full-batch Adam in the max-margin regime.

Method: Theoretical analysis of incremental Adam (one-sample-at-a-time) for logistic regression on linearly separable data; construction of structured datasets that force incremental Adam to converge to the L2 max-margin; development of a proxy algorithm for general data capturing the limiting behavior as beta2→1; a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation to characterize convergence direction; comparison with Signum across batch settings.

Result: Incremental Adam can bias toward the L2 max-margin on certain datasets, deviating from the L-infinity bias seen in full-batch Adam; for general datasets, a proxy algorithm and dual fixed-point framework describe the limiting behavior; Signum converges to the L-infinity max-margin for any batch size when beta is large enough, highlighting a robust invariant.

Conclusion: The implicit bias of Adam is not universal—it depends on both the batching scheme and the data geometry—while Signum exhibits a batch-invariant L-infinity max-margin bias as its hyperparameters approach 1.

Abstract: Adam [Kingma and Ba, 2015] is the de facto optimizer in deep learning, yet
its theoretical understanding remains limited. Prior analyses show that Adam
favors solutions aligned with $\ell_\infty$-geometry, but these results are
restricted to the full-batch regime. In this work, we study the implicit bias
of incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on
linearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the
full-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured
datasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\ell_2$-max-margin
classifier, in contrast to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch
Adam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the
limiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\beta_2 \to 1$ and we characterize
its convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation.
Finally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges
to the $\ell_\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\beta$
close enough to 1. Overall, our results highlight that the implicit bias of
Adam crucially depends on both the batching scheme and the dataset, while
Signum remains invariant.

### [199] [Model Inversion with Layer-Specific Modeling and Alignment for Data-Free Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26311)
*Ruilin Tong,Haodong Lu,Yuhang Liu,Dong Gong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI) plus Gaussian feature modeling to enable data-free continual learning by generating pseudo-images from semantic-aware projected features, improving efficiency and reducing drift in large models like CLIP.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data-free continual learning is essential when access to previous data is restricted by privacy or security. Prior approaches struggle with drift when inputs are synthesized from labels and with high computational cost of full-model inversion, especially in large pre-trained models.

Method: Introduce Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI) to provide strong initialization for full-model inversion by exploiting fast convergence in single-layer optimization. Model class-wise features as Gaussian distributions and use a contrastive model to align synthetic features with real features, mitigating feature shift. Generate pseudo-images from semantic-aware projected features and combine PMI with feature modeling to enable replay-like updates without stored samples.

Result: The method achieves strong effectiveness and compatibility across multiple continual learning settings, improving efficiency (fewer inversion iterations) and reducing feature shift, enabling data-free continual learning for large pre-trained models.

Conclusion: PMI and feature modeling together enable practical data-free continual learning by generating semantically aligned pseudo-images from projected features, suitable for updating models on new tasks while preserving prior knowledge.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to incrementally train a model on a sequence of
tasks while retaining performance on prior ones. However, storing and replaying
data is often infeasible due to privacy or security constraints and impractical
for arbitrary pre-trained models. Data-free CL seeks to update models without
access to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to
synthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing
samples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)
generating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between
synthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)
inversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through
the full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as
CLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI),
inspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides
strong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing
iterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via
Gaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between
synthetic and real features. Combining PMI and feature modeling, our approach
enables continual learning of new classes by generating pseudo-images from
semantic-aware projected features, achieving strong effectiveness and
compatibility across multiple CL settings.

### [200] [On the Impact of Weight Discretization in QUBO-Based SVM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26323)
*Sascha Mücke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Low-precision QUBO SVM training can rival or exceed LIBSVM performance; more bits do not guarantee better accuracy; the selection of support vectors may matter more than precise weighting; hardware scaling could unlock efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess how discretization level (number of qubits) in a QUBO formulation of SVM impacts predictive performance and to compare quantum-annealing-based training with a classical solver (LIBSVM).

Method: Formulate SVM training as a QUBO problem and vary the bit-depth per dual weight (e.g., 1 bit per parameter). Evaluate on multiple datasets, comparing against LIBSVM, and analyze how bit-depth affects regularization capacity and classification accuracy.

Result: Even 1-bit-per-parameter QUBO encodings yield competitive or superior accuracy on some datasets. Increasing bit-depth enables larger regularization parameters but does not universally improve classification. The results imply that selecting the right support vectors may matter more than precise weighting.

Conclusion: QUBO/SVM with quantum annealing shows promise as hardware scales; current device limits constrain QUBO size, but low-precision encodings can be effective, suggesting potential for efficient SVM training with future quantum hardware.

Abstract: Training Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can be formulated as a QUBO problem,
enabling the use of quantum annealing for model optimization. In this work, we
study how the number of qubits - linked to the discretization level of dual
weights - affects predictive performance across datasets. We compare QUBO-based
SVM training to the classical LIBSVM solver and find that even low-precision
QUBO encodings (e.g., 1 bit per parameter) yield competitive, and sometimes
superior, accuracy. While increased bit-depth enables larger regularization
parameters, it does not always improve classification. Our findings suggest
that selecting the right support vectors may matter more than their precise
weighting. Although current hardware limits the size of solvable QUBOs, our
results highlight the potential of quantum annealing for efficient SVM training
as quantum devices scale.

### [201] [Posterior Sampling by Combining Diffusion Models with Annealed Langevin Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26324)
*Zhiyang Xun,Shivam Gupta,Eric Price*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diffusion-models combined with an annealed Langevin dynamics enable conditional posterior sampling for noisy linear measurements under log-concave priors, with polynomial-time guarantees assuming an L^4 bound on score error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Posterior sampling for linear inverse problems (e.g., inpainting, deblurring, MRI) is valuable but generally intractable; Langevin dynamics needs exact or tightly bounded scores, while unconditional diffusion only requires milder L^2 error; bridging to conditional sampling with a diffusion model offers tractable guarantees.

Method: Learn/fit a diffusion-model score for the prior and run an annealed Langevin dynamics chain conditioned on y=Ax+ξ to sample from p(x|y). The analysis shows conditional sampling in polynomial time under an L^4 bound on the score estimation error for log-concave p(x).

Result: The paper proves that conditional sampling p(x|y) can be achieved in polynomial time using diffusion models with an annealed Langevin scheme, given an L^4 bound on the score error.

Conclusion: Diffusion models can be extended to reliable conditional posterior sampling in linear inverse problems under weaker score-error assumptions, offering a practical and theoretically grounded approach.

Abstract: Given a noisy linear measurement $y = Ax + \xi$ of a distribution $p(x)$, and
a good approximation to the prior $p(x)$, when can we sample from the posterior
$p(x \mid y)$? Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for
tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several
heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior
sampling is computationally intractable in general.
  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave
distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior
samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to
score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By
contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an
$L^2$ bound on the score error. We prove that combining diffusion models with
an annealed variant of Langevin dynamics achieves conditional sampling in
polynomial time using merely an $L^4$ bound on the score error.

### [202] [Agent Skills Enable a New Class of Realistic and Trivially Simple Prompt Injections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26328)
*David Schmotz,Sahar Abdelnabi,Maksym Andriushchenko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: The abstract argues that frontier LLMs with the Agent Skills framework are insecure due to prompt-injection vulnerabilities that can hide malicious instructions in Skill files and scripts, exfiltrate sensitive data, and bypass system guardrails, even enabling harmless approvals to trigger harmful actions; code is provided for demonstration.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Investigate continual learning in LLMs and evaluate security risks of the Agent Skills approach, highlighting practical attack vectors that undermine guardrails and data confidentiality.

Method: Demonstrate prompt-injection attacks by embedding malicious instructions within long Agent Skill files and referenced scripts, exfiltrate internal data such as files or passwords, and show how benign task approvals (e.g., 'Don't ask again') can be leveraged to perform related harmful actions.

Result: Identify actionable vulnerabilities in the Agent Skills framework, including data exfiltration and guardrail bypass, accompanied by a proof-of-concept and release of related code at a public repository.

Conclusion: Frontier LLMs remain susceptible to simple prompt injections in realistic scenarios; there is a need for stronger safeguards and mitigations in continual-learning/Agent Skills frameworks to prevent data leakage and unintended actions.

Abstract: Enabling continual learning in LLMs remains a key unresolved research
challenge. In a recent announcement, a frontier LLM company made a step towards
this by introducing Agent Skills, a framework that equips agents with new
knowledge based on instructions stored in simple markdown files. Although Agent
Skills can be a very useful tool, we show that they are fundamentally insecure,
since they enable trivially simple prompt injections. We demonstrate how to
hide malicious instructions in long Agent Skill files and referenced scripts to
exfiltrate sensitive data, such as internal files or passwords. Importantly, we
show how to bypass system-level guardrails of a popular coding agent: a benign,
task-specific approval with the "Don't ask again" option can carry over to
closely related but harmful actions. Overall, we conclude that despite ongoing
research efforts and scaling model capabilities, frontier LLMs remain
vulnerable to very simple prompt injections in realistic scenarios. Our code is
available at https://github.com/aisa-group/promptinject-agent-skills.

### [203] [Linear Causal Discovery with Interventional Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26342)
*Zhigao Guo,Feng Dong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces interventional constraints as high-level causal knowledge in the form of inequality constraints on total causal effects; formalizes for linear models and solves via a two-stage constrained optimization; improves accuracy, consistency with known findings, and explainability, while aiding discovery on real data.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To incorporate domain-level causal knowledge beyond direct interventional data, by enforcing inequalities on total causal effects to prevent incorrect causal inferences and to guide discovery.

Method: Define a metric for total causal effects in linear causal models, translate known causal influences into inequality constraints, and solve a two-stage constrained optimization problem to learn model parameters.

Result: Experiments on real-world datasets show improved model accuracy, consistency with established causal relations, and better explainability, with potential to discover new causal relationships that are costly to identify otherwise.

Conclusion: Interventional constraints provide a principled way to inject high-level causal knowledge into causal discovery, refining models and enabling both better interpretation and potential discovery without requiring direct perturbations.

Abstract: Incorporating causal knowledge and mechanisms is essential for refining
causal models and improving downstream tasks such as designing new treatments.
In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed
interventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional
data. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables,
interventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of
inequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset
(Sachs et al.\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3
exerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow
enforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from
PIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as
learning that "PIP3 inhibits Akt". Interventional constraints bridge this gap
by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs,
ensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize
interventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal
effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained
optimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We
evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating
interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures
consistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also
facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be
costly to identify.

### [204] [Reinforcement Learning for Pollution Detection in a Randomized, Sparse and Nonstationary Environment with an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26347)
*Sebastian Zieglmeier,Niklas Erdmann,Narada D. Warakagoda*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A Monte Carlo-based RL method augmented with hierarchical changes, multi-goal learning, and a location-memory filter outperforms Q-learning and exhaustive search in sparse, randomized, nonstationary tasks, indicating effective adaptation of RL to such environments.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL often struggles in random, nonstationary, and reward-sparse settings (e.g., underwater pollution cloud search with AUVs). The study revisits classical RL to enhance robustness and efficiency in these challenging environments.

Method: Systematic evaluation of numerous modifications to classical RL, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multi-goal learning, and the integration of a location-memory as an external output filter to prevent revisits; focus on a Monte Carlo-based approach.

Result: The modified Monte Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two exhaustive search patterns across the tested scenarios.

Conclusion: Reinforcement learning approaches can be effectively adapted for random, nonstationary, and reward-sparse environments; the proposed modifications enable better performance and practical applicability in complex settings such as autonomous underwater search tasks.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to optimize
problem-solving by learning actions that maximize rewards, a task that becomes
particularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments. Even
advanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in
these conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution
clouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate
reward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward.
This paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying
classical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and
nonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of
modifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning,
and the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to
prevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte
Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two
exhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to
complex environments. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning
approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and
reward-sparse environments.

### [205] [UnifiedFL: A Dynamic Unified Learning Framework for Equitable Federation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26350)
*Furkan Pala,Islem Rekik*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UnifiedFL enables cross-architecture federated learning under non-IID data and domain shift by modeling heterogeneous local networks as a directed graph parameterized by a shared GNN, with distance-based clustering and a two-tier aggregation policy; demonstrates improvements on MedMNIST and hippocampus segmentation.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Address architectural heterogeneity across clients, non-identically distributed data, and domain-fracture (test-domain shift) that hinder generalization in existing FL methods.

Method: Represent heterogeneous local models as nodes and edges in a directed model graph and optimize via a shared graph neural network (GNN). Introduce (i) a common GNN to parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering using Euclidean distances between client parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy balancing convergence and diversity.

Result: Empirical evaluation on MedMNIST classification and hippocampus segmentation benchmarks shows UnifiedFL achieves superior performance compared to baselines.

Conclusion: UnifiedFL offers a scalable framework for federated learning across heterogeneous architectures and data distributions, addressing both architectural and domain heterogeneity to improve generalization; code is available at the linked GitHub repository.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for collaborative model
training across multiple clients without sharing raw data, enabling
privacy-preserving applications in areas such as radiology and pathology.
However, works on collaborative training across clients with fundamentally
different neural architectures and non-identically distributed datasets remain
scarce. Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to
support architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate
variants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),
still presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate
federations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,
CNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical
heterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each
client's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,
undermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,
have non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,
current methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose
UnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous
local networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a
shared graph neural network (GNN). UnifiedFL introduces (i) a common GNN to
parameterize all architectures, (ii) distance-driven clustering via Euclidean
distances between clients' parameters, and (iii) a two-tier aggregation policy
balancing convergence and diversity. Experiments on MedMNIST classification and
hippocampus segmentation benchmarks demonstrate UnifiedFL's superior
performance. Code and data: https://github.com/basiralab/UnifiedFL

### [206] [Towards Explainable and Reliable AI in Finance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26353)
*Albi Isufaj,Pablo Mollá,Helmut Prendinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A framework for explainable and reliable financial AI that combines a time-series foundation model with reliability estimation and symbolic rule-based reasoning to enable only trustworthy, interpretable forecasts in finance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Finance increasingly relies on large, opaque models; regulatory and stakeholder trust requires transparent, auditable AI with quantified reliability to reduce misforecast risk.

Method: 1) Use Time-LLM prompts to steer forecasts toward correct direction. 2) Combine time-series foundation models with a reliability estimator to filter out unreliable predictions. 3) Employ symbolic reasoning to encode domain rules for transparent justification. 4) Integrate predictive performance with reliability estimation and rule-based justification in a single framework.

Result: Experiments on equity and cryptocurrency data show reduced false positives and enhanced selective execution, indicating fewer erroneous forecasts and more trustworthy outputs.

Conclusion: The framework advances transparent and auditable financial AI by linking predictive performance with reliability estimation and rule-based reasoning, enabling deployment only of reliable and explainable forecasts.

Abstract: Financial forecasting increasingly uses large neural network models, but
their opacity raises challenges for trust and regulatory compliance. We present
several approaches to explainable and reliable AI in finance. \emph{First}, we
describe how Time-LLM, a time series foundation model, uses a prompt to avoid a
wrong directional forecast. \emph{Second}, we show that combining foundation
models for time series forecasting with a reliability estimator can filter our
unreliable predictions. \emph{Third}, we argue for symbolic reasoning encoding
domain rules for transparent justification. These approaches shift emphasize
executing only forecasts that are both reliable and explainable. Experiments on
equity and cryptocurrency data show that the architecture reduces false
positives and supports selective execution. By integrating predictive
performance with reliability estimation and rule-based reasoning, our framework
advances transparent and auditable financial AI systems.

### [207] [Efficient Generative AI Boosts Probabilistic Forecasting of Sudden Stratospheric Warmings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26376)
*Ningning Tao,Fei Xie,Baoxiang Pan,Hongyu Wang,Han Huang,Zhongpu Qiu,Ke Gui,Jiali Luo,Xiaosong Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FM-Cast (Flow Matching-based AI) delivers fast, probabilistic forecasts of stratospheric sudden warmings, achieving above-50% ensemble skill up to 20 days for several events and competing with leading NWP, with minimal compute.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSWs drive subseasonal predictability but are hard to forecast due to incomplete physical representation, initialization challenges, and heavy ensemble compute. Data-driven probabilistic forecasts for 3D SSW dynamics remain underexplored, warranting an approach that bridges AI with physical understanding.

Method: Develop FM-Cast, a Flow Matching-based generative model that forecasts the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric circulation. Evaluated on 18 major SSW events (1998–2024) with 50-member ensembles for up to 30 days, achieving ~2-minute runtime on a consumer GPU and comparison to leading NWP systems. Idealized experiments link predictability to physical drivers and distinguish troposphere-forced vs internal dynamics.

Result: FM-Cast accurately forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 SSW events up to 20 days ahead, with ensemble skill above 50%. Its performance is comparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while being orders of magnitude faster (~2 minutes for 50-member, 30-day forecasts on a consumer GPU). The method enables causal insights into the physical drivers of SSW predictability, separating troposphere-forced from internally driven events.

Conclusion: The work provides a computationally efficient probabilistic forecasting framework for stratospheric anomalies and demonstrates AI’s potential to deepen understanding of atmosphere–climate dynamics, offering a path toward broader, physics-informed data-driven forecasting.

Abstract: Sudden Stratospheric Warmings (SSWs) are key sources of subseasonal
predictability and major drivers of extreme winter weather. Yet, their accurate
and efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather
prediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,
initialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.
While data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the
complex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic
forecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow
Matching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful
probabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric
circulation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast
skillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20
days in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is
comparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes
for a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging
FM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that
SSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,
distinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by
internal stratospheric dynamics. Our work thus establishes a computationally
efficient paradigm for probabilistic forecasting stratospheric anomalies and
showcases generative AI's potential to deepen the physical understanding of
atmosphere-climate dynamics.

### [208] [Adaptive Context Length Optimization with Low-Frequency Truncation for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26389)
*Wenchang Duan,Yaoliang Yu,Jiwan He,Yi Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Adaptive context-length MARL with a central agent using temporal gradient analysis and Fourier-based low-frequency truncation to filter redundant information, achieving state-of-the-art performance on long-term dependency tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Large fixed context lengths in deep MARL can reduce exploration efficiency and introduce redundant information; there is a need for adaptive context length that improves exploration and convergence in non-Markovian, long-horizon tasks.

Method: Introduce a central agent that dynamically optimizes the context length via temporal gradient analysis. Employ a Fourier-based low-frequency truncation to create an efficient input representation that filters redundant information and captures global temporal trends across decentralized agents.

Result: The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on long-term dependency benchmarks across multiple environments, including PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football, and SMACv2.

Conclusion: Adaptive context-length optimization coupled with efficient Fourier-based temporal representations enhances exploration and convergence in MARL, delivering superior performance on challenging long-horizon tasks.

Abstract: Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated
promising performance for solving challenging tasks, such as long-term
dependencies and non-Markovian environments. Its success is partly attributed
to conditioning policies on large fixed context length. However, such large
fixed context lengths may lead to limited exploration efficiency and redundant
information. In this paper, we propose a novel MARL framework to obtain
adaptive and effective contextual information. Specifically, we design a
central agent that dynamically optimizes context length via temporal gradient
analysis, enhancing exploration to facilitate convergence to global optima in
MARL. Furthermore, to enhance the adaptive optimization capability of the
context length, we present an efficient input representation for the central
agent, which effectively filters redundant information. By leveraging a
Fourier-based low-frequency truncation method, we extract global temporal
trends across decentralized agents, providing an effective and efficient
representation of the MARL environment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on long-term
dependency tasks, including PettingZoo, MiniGrid, Google Research Football
(GRF), and StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge v2 (SMACv2).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MTL can improve generalization, efficiency, and robustness when tasks are related, especially with limited data or high dimensionality. SVMs and TWSVMs offer interpretability and strong theoretical guarantees, making them valuable for margin-based MTL.

Method: Systematic survey of SVM/TWSVM-based MTL approaches, categorized by information sharing strategies (shared representations, task regularization, structural coupling), evaluation of theoretical properties, optimization approaches, and empirical performance, with discussion of applications and emerging extensions; identification of gaps and future directions.

Result: Consolidates current knowledge on margin-based MTL, provides comparative insights, notes that TWSVM extensions are promising but underexplored, and offers a resource for researchers and practitioners with guidance on scalable, interpretable margin-based MTL frameworks.

Conclusion: SVM/TWSVM-based MTL is valuable and promising but requires further development in scalable optimization, interpretability, and reliability across domains; the chapter maps a path forward for margin-based MTL.

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) enables simultaneous training across related tasks,
leveraging shared information to improve generalization, efficiency, and
robustness, especially in data-scarce or high-dimensional scenarios. While deep
learning dominates recent MTL research, Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Twin
SVMs (TWSVMs) remain relevant due to their interpretability, theoretical rigor,
and effectiveness with small datasets.
  This chapter surveys MTL approaches based on SVM and TWSVM, highlighting
shared representations, task regularization, and structural coupling
strategies. Special attention is given to emerging TWSVM extensions for
multi-task settings, which show promise but remain underexplored. We compare
these models in terms of theoretical properties, optimization strategies, and
empirical performance, and discuss applications in fields such as computer
vision, natural language processing, and bioinformatics.
  Finally, we identify research gaps and outline future directions for building
scalable, interpretable, and reliable margin-based MTL frameworks. This work
provides a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners interested
in SVM- and TWSVM-based multi-task learning.

TL;DR: Jointly train a latent action model with a pre-trained world model via a warm-up alignment phase, enabling effective co-evolution and outperforming two-stage pipelines.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Overcome inefficiencies and limited co-adaptation in the standard two-stage LAM+world-model training; avoid representational collapse when replacing the forward dynamics with a powerful world model; enable end-to-end synergy between action representation and world dynamics.

Method: Introduce CoLA-World with a warm-up phase to align the from-scratch LAM representations with the pre-trained world model, then train them jointly by replacing the forward dynamics with the world model. The world model acts as a tutor guiding the LAM, while the LAM provides a precise control interface to the world model, enabling a co-evolution cycle.

Result: Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage methods in video simulation quality and downstream visual planning, demonstrating a robust and efficient new paradigm for controllable world models.

Conclusion: Joint learning of LAM and a pre-trained world model is viable and beneficial, reducing training redundancy and enabling co-adaptation to improve video generation and planning tasks.

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models
via latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world
models. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent
action model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant
training and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple
and appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with
a powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and
prone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which
for the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving
the core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that
effectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the
pre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model
acts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM,
while the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the
world model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage
methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning,
establishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CFKD-AFN uses abundant low-fidelity simulations to boost outcome prediction on scarce high-fidelity trial data via cross-fidelity distillation and adaptive fusion, achieving large gains in COPD treatment outcomes and offering an interpretable variant.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The high cost and scarcity of high-fidelity clinical trial data limit predictive performance for personalized treatment outcomes. Leveraging abundant, cheaper low-fidelity simulation data can improve models trained on small patient groups.

Method: CFKD-AFN employs a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract complementary knowledge from a low-fidelity model, and an attention-guided fusion module to dynamically integrate information from multiple sources. An interpretable variant is also proposed to reveal latent medical semantics for decision support.

Result: On COPD treatment outcome prediction, CFKD-AFN outperforms state-of-the-art methods with accuracy gains ranging from 6.67% to 74.55% and shows robustness to different high-fidelity dataset sizes.

Conclusion: Cross-fidelity distillation and adaptive fusion effectively leverage abundant simulations to enhance prediction on scarce clinical data, with an added interpretable variant to aid clinical interpretation and decision-making.

Abstract: Personalized treatment outcome prediction based on trial data for
small-sample and rare patient groups is critical in precision medicine.
However, the costly trial data limit the prediction performance. To address
this issue, we propose a cross-fidelity knowledge distillation and adaptive
fusion network (CFKD-AFN), which leverages abundant but low-fidelity simulation
data to enhance predictions on scarce but high-fidelity trial data. CFKD-AFN
incorporates a dual-channel knowledge distillation module to extract
complementary knowledge from the low-fidelity model, along with an
attention-guided fusion module to dynamically integrate multi-source
information. Experiments on treatment outcome prediction for the chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrates significant improvements of CFKD-AFN
over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy, ranging from 6.67\% to
74.55\%, and strong robustness to varying high-fidelity dataset sizes.
Furthermore, we extend CFKD-AFN to an interpretable variant, enabling the
exploration of latent medical semantics to support clinical decision-making.

*Jiayi Luo,Qingyun Sun,Beining Yang,Haonan Yuan,Xingcheng Fu,Yanbiao Ma,Jianxin Li,Philip S. Yu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MRGC proposes a manifold-constrained framework to robustify graph condensation by keeping the condensed graph lies on a smooth, low-dimensional manifold, preserving classification complexity reduction while withstanding universal adversarial attacks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GC excels at producing compact yet informative graphs but is highly sensitive to adversarial corruption; existing robust graph learning methods offer limited protection, highlighting a need for robust GC methods.

Method: Introduce MRGC with three graph data manifold learning modules that regularize the condensed graph to reside on a smooth, low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving GC's classification complexity reduction while improving robustness under universal/adversarial attacks.

Result: Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MRGC achieves robust performance across diverse attack scenarios, maintaining GC effectiveness under perturbations.

Conclusion: Manifold-constrained robust graph condensation effectively strengthens GC against adversarial perturbations by enforcing low-dimensional smooth manifolds, preserving classification complexity reduction and enabling robust condensed graphs.

Abstract: Graph condensation (GC) has gained significant attention for its ability to
synthesize smaller yet informative graphs. However, existing studies often
overlook the robustness of GC in scenarios where the original graph is
corrupted. In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates
significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only
limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical
analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing
process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity.
Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability
and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data
manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation
framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold
learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth,
low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the
classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust
performance under universal adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the robustness of \ModelName\ across diverse attack scenarios.

*Qiaoling Chen,Zijun Liu,Peng Sun,Shenggui Li,Guoteng Wang,Ziming Liu,Yonggang Wen,Siyuan Feng,Tianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ReSpec adapts speculative decoding to RL-based LLM training to speed up generation, addressing speedups at scale, drafter staleness, and policy degradation, achieving up to 4.5x speedup on Qwen models (3B–14B) while preserving reward convergence and stability.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RL-based adaptation of large language models is bottlenecked by autoregressive generation time. Speculative decoding offers potential speedups in serving but its effects within RL training are not well understood, risking training stability and policy quality at scale.

Method: Three components: (1) dynamically tune speculative decoding configurations during RL training, (2) evolve the drafter using knowledge distillation to mitigate staleness, and (3) weight RL updates by rollout rewards to align learning with performance.

Result: On Qwen models (3B–14B), ReSpec delivers up to 4.5x speedups in generation during RL training while maintaining reward convergence and training stability, enabling more practical RL-based LLM adaptation.

Conclusion: ReSpec provides a practical framework for integrating speculative decoding into RL training to accelerate fine-tuning of LLMs without compromising learning outcomes.

Abstract: Adapting large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning (RL) is
often bottlenecked by the generation stage, which can consume over 75\% of the
training time. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive generation
in serving systems, but its behavior under RL training remains largely
unexplored. We identify three critical gaps that hinder the naive integration
of SD into RL systems: diminishing speedups at large batch sizes, drafter
staleness under continual actor updates, and drafter-induced policy
degradation.
  To address these gaps, we present ReSpec, a system that adapts SD to RL
through three complementary mechanisms: dynamically tuning SD configurations,
evolving the drafter via knowledge distillation, and weighting updates by
rollout rewards. On Qwen models (3B--14B), ReSpec achieves up to 4.5x speedup
while preserving reward convergence and training stability, providing a
practical solution for efficient RL-based LLM adaptation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based GAN with successive data injection and multi-metric gating improves time-series anomaly detection, achieving TaF1 of 89.43% and showing feasibility on IBM Q hardware.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Anomaly detection in time-series data is critical for network security. While quantum ML methods have potential, they are constrained by limited qubit counts; there is a need for robust, hardware-efficient quantum models for real-world deployment.

Method: Introduce a Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based GAN with Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric gating strategy. The quantum-enhanced generator outputs Gaussian parameters (mean and log-variance) via reparameterization; a Wasserstein critic stabilizes adversarial training. Anomalies are detected through a gating mechanism that uses Gaussian uncertainty estimates and validates them using a composite of critic scores and reconstruction errors.

Result: On benchmark datasets the model achieves a time-series aware F1 score (TaF1) of 89.43%, indicating strong anomaly detection performance compared to existing classical and quantum models. The trained QGRU-WGAN also runs on real IBM Quantum hardware, maintaining high detection performance on current NISQ devices.

Conclusion: The work demonstrates a robust, hardware-conscious quantum generative approach for time-series anomaly detection, achieving high accuracy and practical feasibility on NISQ hardware, and suggesting a viable path for scalable quantum-assisted security analytics.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time-series data is a critical challenge with
significant implications for network security. Recent quantum machine learning
approaches, such as quantum kernel methods and variational quantum circuits,
have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions for anomaly
detection but remain constrained by limited qubit counts. We introduce in this
work a novel Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) employing Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric
gating strategy for robust network anomaly detection. Our model uniquely
utilizes a quantum-enhanced generator that outputs parameters (mean and
log-variance) of a Gaussian distribution via reparameterization, combined with
a Wasserstein critic to stabilize adversarial training. Anomalies are
identified through a novel gating mechanism that initially flags potential
anomalies based on Gaussian uncertainty estimates and subsequently verifies
them using a composite of critic scores and reconstruction errors. Evaluated on
benchmark datasets, our method achieves a high time-series aware F1 score
(TaF1) of 89.43% demonstrating superior capability in detecting anomalies
accurately and promptly as compared to existing classical and quantum models.
Furthermore, the trained QGRU-WGAN was deployed on real IBM Quantum hardware,
where it retained high anomaly detection performance, confirming its robustness
and practical feasibility on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
devices.

*Erle Zhu,Dazhi Jiang,Yuan Wang,Xujun Li,Jiale Cheng,Yuxian Gu,Yilin Niu,Aohan Zeng,Jie Tang,Minlie Huang,Hongning Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CROPI uses off-policy influence estimation and sparse random projection to guide curriculum RL with RLVR data, yielding fast, data-efficient training.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Data selection in RLVR currently relies on heuristics without guarantees and is costly due to online policy rollouts; there is a need for theoretically grounded, scalable data influence estimation applicable to large models.

Method: Estimates data influence via influence functions; uses off-policy estimation with offline trajectories to avoid rollouts; applies sparse random projection to reduce high-dimensional gradients; implements a multi-stage curriculum RL that iteratively selects the most influential data per stage (CROPI).

Result: Empirical results show significant acceleration: up to 2.66x step-level speedup on 1.5B models using only 10% of data per stage; experiments on models up to 7B param models demonstrate training acceleration with CROPI.

Conclusion: Influence-based, off-policy data selection is a promising theoretical and practical tool for efficient RLVR, enabling faster training with fewer data and scalable to larger LLMs; suggests potential for broader generalization and application.

Abstract: Data selection is a critical aspect of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). Current data selection methods are largely heuristic-based,
lacking theoretical guarantees and generalizability. This work proposes a
theoretically-grounded approach using influence functions to estimate the
contribution of each data point to the learning objective. To overcome the
prohibitive computational cost of policy rollouts required for online influence
estimation, we introduce an off-policy influence estimation method that
efficiently approximates data influence using pre-collected offline
trajectories. Furthermore, to manage the high-dimensional gradients of LLMs, we
employ sparse random projection to reduce dimensionality and improve storage
and computation efficiency. Leveraging these techniques, we develop
\textbf{C}urriculum \textbf{R}L with \textbf{O}ff-\textbf{P}olicy
\text{I}nfluence guidance (\textbf{CROPI}), a multi-stage RL framework that
iteratively selects the most influential data for the current policy.
Experiments on models up to 7B parameters demonstrate that CROPI significantly
accelerates training. On a 1.5B model, it achieves a 2.66x step-level
acceleration while using only 10\% of the data per stage compared to
full-dataset training. Our results highlight the substantial potential of
influence-based data selection for efficient RLVR.

### [216] [Enhancing ECG Classification Robustness with Lightweight Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Filters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26501)
*Mustafa Fuad Rifet Ibrahim,Maurice Meijer,Alexander Schlaefer,Peer Stelldinger*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unsupervised anomaly detection as a resource-efficient upstream filter improves ECG analysis on wearables by removing OOD/noisy data; Deep SVDD offers the best performance–efficiency trade-off and boosts downstream classifier accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To ensure reliable continuous ECG monitoring in resource-constrained wearables where OOD signals and noise can yield high-confidence mispredictions, risking patient safety.

Method: Benchmark six UAD approaches (Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models, Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, diffusion models) optimized with Neural Architecture Search under a strict parameter budget (≤512k). Evaluate on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets for OOD class and noisy signals; simulate deployment with a diagnostic classifier.

Result: Deep SVDD consistently provided the best trade-off between detection performance and computational efficiency; integrating the optimized Deep SVDD filter with a classifier increased accuracy by up to 21 percentage points over a classifier-only baseline.

Conclusion: Optimized UAD filters can act as an effective upstream safeguard for ECG analysis on wearables, enabling safer, more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring.

Abstract: Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring via wearables offers
significant potential for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) detection.
However, deploying deep learning models for automated analysis in
resource-constrained environments faces reliability challenges due to
inevitable Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. OOD inputs, such as unseen
pathologies or noisecorrupted signals, often cause erroneous, high-confidence
predictions by standard classifiers, compromising patient safety. Existing OOD
detection methods either neglect computational constraints or address noise and
unseen classes separately. This paper explores Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
(UAD) as an independent, upstream filtering mechanism to improve robustness. We
benchmark six UAD approaches, including Deep SVDD, reconstruction-based models,
Masked Anomaly Detection, normalizing flows, and diffusion models, optimized
via Neural Architecture Search (NAS) under strict resource constraints (at most
512k parameters). Evaluation on PTB-XL and BUT QDB datasets assessed detection
of OOD CVD classes and signals unsuitable for analysis due to noise. Results
show Deep SVDD consistently achieves the best trade-off between detection and
efficiency. In a realistic deployment simulation, integrating the optimized
Deep SVDD filter with a diagnostic classifier improved accuracy by up to 21
percentage points over a classifier-only baseline. This study demonstrates that
optimized UAD filters can safeguard automated ECG analysis, enabling safer,
more reliable continuous cardiovascular monitoring on wearables.

### [217] [LLMs as In-Context Meta-Learners for Model and Hyperparameter Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26510)
*Youssef Attia El Hili,Albert Thomas,Malik Tiomoko,Abdelhakim Benechehab,Corentin Léger,Corinne Ancourt,Balázs Kégl*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LLMs can act as in-context meta-learners for model and hyperparameter selection by converting datasets into interpretable metadata and prompting the model either zero-shot or with meta-informed examples. They can propose competitive model families and hyperparameters without explicit search, with meta-informed prompts yielding further improvements.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To reduce reliance on expert intuition and costly automated search for model selection and hyperparameter tuning by leveraging LLMs' knowledge and pattern-recognition from past tasks.

Method: Represent each dataset with interpretable metadata (e.g., task type, size, feature characteristics, baseline performances). Use two prompting strategies: (i) zero-shot using pretrained knowledge, and (ii) meta-informed prompting that includes examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Prompt an LLM to recommend model families and hyperparameters. Evaluate on synthetic and real-world benchmarks against baselines that require search.

Result: LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search. Meta-informed prompting provides additional gains, demonstrating in-context meta-learning capabilities across tasks.

Conclusion: LLMs show promise as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and hyperparameter optimization, potentially reducing AutoML search cost and broadening access; further work should refine metadata schemas and assess generalization and limitations.

Abstract: Model and hyperparameter selection are critical but challenging in machine
learning, typically requiring expert intuition or expensive automated search.
We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can act as in-context
meta-learners for this task. By converting each dataset into interpretable
metadata, we prompt an LLM to recommend both model families and
hyperparameters. We study two prompting strategies: (1) a zero-shot mode
relying solely on pretrained knowledge, and (2) a meta-informed mode augmented
with examples of models and their performance on past tasks. Across synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, we show that LLMs can exploit dataset metadata to
recommend competitive models and hyperparameters without search, and that
improvements from meta-informed prompting demonstrate their capacity for
in-context meta-learning. These results highlight a promising new role for LLMs
as lightweight, general-purpose assistants for model selection and
hyperparameter optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ICPO uses in-context learning to guide policy optimization without requiring strong expert trajectories. It introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, Expert Region Reject Sampling, and Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping, yielding improved performance and stability on mathematical reasoning tasks.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing RLVR methods suffer from limited exploration due to on-policy rollouts and depend on expensive, advanced expert models for broader policy coverage. There is a need for scalable, data-efficient guidance that LRMs can access without requiring new trajectories from stronger models.

Method: Propose In-Context Steered Policy Optimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages LRM in-context learning to provide expert guidance from existing datasets. It combines Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing to broaden exploration beyond the current policy, Expert Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy data, and Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with later autonomous improvement.

Result: ICPO consistently improves reinforcement learning performance and training stability on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion:  ICPO offers a scalable and effective RLVR paradigm for LRMs by leveraging in-context guidance, enabling broader exploration and more stable optimization without relying on expensive expert-model trajectories.

Abstract: Existing Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) methods, such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have achieved remarkable progress
in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
However, they exhibit limited exploration due to reliance on on-policy rollouts
where confined to the current policy's distribution, resulting in narrow
trajectory diversity. Recent approaches attempt to expand policy coverage by
incorporating trajectories generated from stronger expert models, yet this
reliance increases computational cost and such advaned models are often
inaccessible. To address these issues, we propose In-Context Steered Policy
Optimization (ICPO), a unified framework that leverages the inherent in-context
learning capability of LRMs to provide expert guidance using existing datasets.
ICPO introduces Mixed-Policy GRPO with Implicit Expert Forcing, which expands
exploration beyond the current policy distribution without requiring advanced
LRM trajectories. To further stabilize optimization, ICPO integrates Expert
Region Reject Sampling to filter unreliable off-policy trajectories and
Annealed Expert-Bonus Reward Shaping to balance early expert guidance with
later autonomous improvement. Results demonstrate that ICPO consistently
enhances reinforcement learning performance and training stability on
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, revealing a scalable and effective RLVR
paradigm for LRMs.

### [219] [Polybasic Speculative Decoding Through a Theoretical Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26527)
*Ruilin Wang,Huixia Li,Yuexiao Ma,Xiawu Zheng,Fei Chao,Xuefeng Xiao,Rongrong Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Polybasic speculative decoding generalizes dualistic draft-verify to multi-model generation, offering a theoretical foundation for optimal inference time and practical speedups across several LLM families without changing the output distribution.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Inference latency is a major bottleneck for deploying large language models. While speculative decoding reduces compute, existing work relies on a dualistic draft-verify framework and lacks rigorous theory. A polybasic, multi-model framework aims to provide a broad, principled approach with guarantees and wider applicability.

Method: Develop a fundamental theorem characterizing the optimal inference time for multi-model speculative decoding. Analyze the interaction between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and computational cost in multi-model token generation. Provide a framework that can operate standalone or integrate with existing speculative techniques, and derive proofs. Validate theoretically and empirically across multiple model families with implemented code.

Result: Shows significant speedups across models: 3.31×–4.01× for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, 3.87× for LLaMA3-8B, 4.43× for Vicuna-7B, and 3.85× for Qwen2-7B, while preserving the original output distribution. The work provides theoretical proofs and implementation code to enable broader investigation into polybasic speculative decoding.

Conclusion: Polybasic speculative decoding offers a general, theoretically grounded framework that extends beyond dualistic methods, delivering practical speedups without distorting output distributions. It can be used standalone or with existing speculative techniques, and the authors provide proofs and code to support adoption and further research.

Abstract: Inference latency stands as a critical bottleneck in the large-scale
deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Speculative decoding methods have
recently shown promise in accelerating inference without compromising the
output distribution. However, existing work typically relies on a dualistic
draft-verify framework and lacks rigorous theoretical grounding. In this paper,
we introduce a novel \emph{polybasic} speculative decoding framework,
underpinned by a comprehensive theoretical analysis. Specifically, we prove a
fundamental theorem that characterizes the optimal inference time for
multi-model speculative decoding systems, shedding light on how to extend
beyond the dualistic approach to a more general polybasic paradigm. Through our
theoretical investigation of multi-model token generation, we expose and
optimize the interplay between model capabilities, acceptance lengths, and
overall computational cost. Our framework supports both standalone
implementation and integration with existing speculative techniques, leading to
accelerated performance in practice. Experimental results across multiple model
families demonstrate that our approach yields speedup ratios ranging from
$3.31\times$ to $4.01\times$ for LLaMA2-Chat 7B, up to $3.87 \times$ for
LLaMA3-8B, up to $4.43 \times$ for Vicuna-7B and up to $3.85 \times$ for
Qwen2-7B -- all while preserving the original output distribution. We release
our theoretical proofs and implementation code to facilitate further
investigation into polybasic speculative decoding.

*Adrien Weihs,Andrea Bertozzi,Matthew Thorpe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HOHL enforces higher-order smoothness via multiscale Laplacians on hypergraphs; this work proves the consistency of a truncated HOHL, derives explicit convergence rates when HOHL is used as a regularizer, and shows strong empirical performance in active learning and in non-geometric datasets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Extend the theoretical foundation of HOHL by establishing consistency and convergence guarantees, and demonstrate robustness across diverse learning settings.

Method: Prove the consistency of a truncated HOHL; derive explicit convergence rates for HOHL when used as a supervised regularizer; validate empirically in active learning and datasets lacking geometric structure.

Result: The truncated HOHL is shown to be consistent; convergence rates are derived for HOHL as a regularizer; empirically, HOHL exhibits strong performance in active learning and in non-geometric datasets.

Conclusion: HOHL is versatile and robust across learning settings; the truncated version retains theoretical guarantees while delivering strong empirical performance, broadening HOHL's applicability.

Abstract: Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL) was recently introduced as a
principled alternative to classical hypergraph regularization, enforcing
higher-order smoothness via powers of multiscale Laplacians induced by the
hypergraph structure. Prior work established the well- and ill-posedness of
HOHL through an asymptotic consistency analysis in geometric settings. We
extend this theoretical foundation by proving the consistency of a truncated
version of HOHL and deriving explicit convergence rates when HOHL is used as a
regularizer in fully supervised learning. We further demonstrate its strong
empirical performance in active learning and in datasets lacking an underlying
geometric structure, highlighting HOHL's versatility and robustness across
diverse learning settings.

### [221] [A Three-Stage Bayesian Transfer Learning Framework to Improve Predictions in Data-Scarce Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26541)
*Aidan Furlong,Robert Salko,Xingang Zhao,Xu Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A fully supervised, three-stage framework (staged B-DANN) merges parameter transfer with domain-adversarial latent-space adaptation and Bayesian uncertainty to robustly transfer learning under large domain shifts. Demonstrated on a synthetic benchmark and a nuclear-engineering task (predicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels with tube-experiment data as source), it achieves higher accuracy, better generalization, and calibrated uncertainty estimates.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DANNs can be unstable and often lack reliable uncertainty quantification; transfer learning via pretrained weights degrades under large domain shifts; many engineering datasets are sparse or noisy. A framework that stabilizes training, leverages source data, and provides calibrated uncertainty is needed for data-scarce, high-stakes engineering problems.

Method: Stage 1: Train a deterministic feature extractor on the source domain. Stage 2: Adversarially refine the extractor with a domain-adversarial neural network (DANN) to learn a shared latent representation. Stage 3: Build a Bayesian neural network on top of the adapted features to fine-tune on the target domain, enabling handling of conditional shifts and providing calibrated uncertainty estimates. The approach is fully supervised and combines parameter transfer with latent-space adaptation.

Result: In synthetic benchmarks, staged B-DANN significantly outperformed standard transfer techniques. In a nuclear-engineering application, it leveraged tube-experiment data as the source to predict critical heat flux in rectangular channels, achieving improved predictive accuracy and generalization.

Conclusion: Staged B-DANN offers a stable, fully supervised pathway that fuses parameter transfer and domain-adaptive representations with Bayesian uncertainty, showing promise for data-scarce, high-stakes engineering tasks (e.g., nuclear engineering) and potentially other domains.

Abstract: The use of ML in engineering has grown steadily to support a wide array of
applications. Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely
adopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,
high-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or
insufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which
leverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in
data-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where
pretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain
shifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by
learning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under
greater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be
unstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty
quantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,
the staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that
combines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a
deterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature
extractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a
Bayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for
fine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield
calibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first
validated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly
outperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of
predicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from
tube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the
staged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,
potentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.

### [222] [Clone Deterministic 3D Worlds with Geometrically-Regularized World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26782)
*Zaishuo Xia,Yukuan Lu,Xinyi Li,Yifan Xu,Yubei Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM) improve long-horizon world-model predictions by enforcing geometric continuity in latent space, yielding better latent representations and stability without changing the dynamics module.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Current world models degrade over long horizons due to high-dimensional exteroceptive inputs and entangled latents; improving representation learning could substantially boost world-model performance without altering the dynamics component.

Method: Introduce GRWM, which imposes that consecutive points along a sensory trajectory remain close in latent space (geometric regularization). It is plug-and-play, minimally modifies architecture, scales with trajectory length, and works with various latent backbones.

Result: Leads to latent representations that better reflect the environment’s topology; increases rollout fidelity and stability in deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon tasks.

Conclusion: Improving representation learning is a direct and effective path to robust world models, enabling reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

Abstract: A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.
Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the
embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for
enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic
settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and
degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation
quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or
entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask
whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve
world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly
accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing
a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We
propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that
consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent
representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent
representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.
GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales
with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative
backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,
GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that
its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric
structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation
learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering
reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.

*Jan Stenkamp,Nina Herrmann,Benjamin Karic,Stefan Oehmcke,Fabian Gieseke*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a compression scheme for boosted decision tree ensembles targeting resource-constrained IoT devices; achieves 4-16x memory reduction over LightGBM with adapted training and memory layout while preserving performance, enabling offline autonomous edge deployment.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The growing need to run ML on energy- and memory-constrained IoT devices for remote monitoring, edge analytics, and real-time decision making without constant communication or energy supply.

Method: Develops training objectives that reward feature and threshold reuse to compress the model, along with an alternative memory layout; trains compact boosted tree ensembles that maintain accuracy with substantially reduced memory footprints.

Result: Empirical evaluation shows the proposed approach reaches similar performance with a 4-16x compression relative to LightGBM; once deployed, devices can operate autonomously with minimal compute and energy.

Conclusion: The work enables practical deployment of boosted decision trees on constrained devices, expanding possibilities for IoT analytics and real-time decisions in isolated or power-limited environments; future work may explore broader hardware and further compression/optimization.

Abstract: Deploying machine learning models on compute-constrained devices has become a
key building block of modern IoT applications. In this work, we present a
compression scheme for boosted decision trees, addressing the growing need for
lightweight machine learning models. Specifically, we provide techniques for
training compact boosted decision tree ensembles that exhibit a reduced memory
footprint by rewarding, among other things, the reuse of features and
thresholds during training. Our experimental evaluation shows that models
achieved the same performance with a compression ratio of 4-16x compared to
LightGBM models using an adapted training process and an alternative memory
layout. Once deployed, the corresponding IoT devices can operate independently
of constant communication or external energy supply, and, thus, autonomously,
requiring only minimal computing power and energy. This capability opens the
door to a wide range of IoT applications, including remote monitoring, edge
analytics, and real-time decision making in isolated or power-limited
environments.

### [224] [On Measuring Localization of Shortcuts in Deep Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26560)
*Nikita Tsoy,Nikola Konstantinov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Shortcuts in deep networks are distributed across layers rather than localized to a single layer; shallow layers encode spurious features while deeper layers forget core predictive features; mitigating shortcuts is hard and likely requires dataset- and architecture-specific approaches.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understanding how shortcut learning shapes layer-wise feature representations is crucial for designing principled mitigation methods and improving generalization under skewed data.

Method: The authors design a novel layer-wise localization experiment that quantifies a layer's contribution to accuracy degradation due to a shortcut-inducing skew by counterfactual training on clean and skewed datasets. They evaluate CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and CelebA across VGG, ResNet, DeiT, and ConvNeXt architectures.

Result: Shortcut learning is distributed across the network, not confined to a specific layer. Shallow layers predominantly encode spurious features, while deeper layers tend to forget core predictive features from clean data. The study also characterizes differences in localization and identifies principal axes of variation.

Conclusion: General shortcut-mitigation methods are hard to design; effective strategies are likely architecture- and dataset-specific rather than universal.

Abstract: Shortcuts, spurious rules that perform well during training but fail to
generalize, present a major challenge to the reliability of deep networks
(Geirhos et al., 2020). However, the impact of shortcuts on feature
representations remains understudied, obstructing the design of principled
shortcut-mitigation methods. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the
layer-wise localization of shortcuts in deep models. Our novel experiment
design quantifies the layer-wise contribution to accuracy degradation caused by
a shortcut-inducing skew by counterfactual training on clean and skewed
datasets. We employ our design to study shortcuts on CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and
CelebA datasets across VGG, ResNet, DeiT, and ConvNeXt architectures. We find
that shortcut learning is not localized in specific layers but distributed
throughout the network. Different network parts play different roles in this
process: shallow layers predominantly encode spurious features, while deeper
layers predominantly forget core features that are predictive on clean data. We
also analyze the differences in localization and describe its principal axes of
variation. Finally, our analysis of layer-wise shortcut-mitigation strategies
suggests the hardness of designing general methods, supporting dataset- and
architecture-specific approaches instead.

### [225] [Multiclass Local Calibration With the Jensen-Shannon Distance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26566)
*Cesare Barbera,Lorenzo Perini,Giovanni De Toni,Andrea Passerini,Andrea Pugnana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Proposes a local calibration framework for multiclass classification, formalizes multiclass local calibration, analyzes pitfalls of current metrics, introduces a Jensen-Shannon distance–based training objective to align predictions with local class frequencies, and validates empirically against prior calibration methods.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing multiclass calibration methods ignore the input-space structure, leading to proximity bias where predictions in sparse regions of the feature space are poorly calibrated. This is especially critical in high-stakes domains like healthcare, where underrepresented regions may receive biased treatment. A local calibration notion seeks to ensure predictions reflect true class frequencies within local neighborhoods.

Method: 1) Formalize multiclass local calibration and relate it to strong calibration. 2) Theoretically analyze the limitations of current evaluation metrics when applied to local calibration. 3) Propose a practical NN training objective that enforces alignment between predicted probabilities and local class-frequency estimates using Jensen-Shannon distance as the divergence measure. 4) Empirically compare the proposed approach to existing multiclass calibration techniques on standard benchmarks.

Result: The paper provides a theoretical account of why existing metrics fail for local calibration and demonstrates empirical gains in local calibration quality. The proposed JS-distance objective yields better alignment between predicted probabilities and local frequencies and shows competitive or superior performance relative to existing multiclass calibration methods.

Conclusion: Local calibration is a crucial refinement of calibration for multiclass problems. The proposed Jensen-Shannon-distance–based approach reduces proximity bias and improves reliability of probabilistic predictions in sparse regions, with evidence from empirical validation; future work could extend to other model families and calibration metrics.

Abstract: Developing trustworthy Machine Learning (ML) models requires their predicted
probabilities to be well-calibrated, meaning they should reflect true-class
frequencies. Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong
calibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities
to be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing
approaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs,
which makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of
the feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant
in high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are
exactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this
main shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration.
First, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its
relationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the
pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local
calibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local
calibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted
probabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon
distance. Finally, we empirically validate our approach against existing
multiclass calibration techniques.

### [226] [Wasserstein Regression as a Variational Approximation of Probabilistic Trajectories through the Bernstein Basis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26607)
*Maksim Maslov,Alexander Kugaevskikh,Matthew Ivanov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Bernstein-trajectory Wasserstein regression for conditional distributions: geometry-aware, interpretable, competitive in accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Regression over distributions must respect the geometry of probability space while remaining computationally practical; existing approaches often ignore geometry or are expensive.

Method: Model a conditional distribution as a smooth trajectory of Gaussian components with their means and covariances parameterized by input via Bernstein polynomials. Train by minimizing the averaged squared Wasserstein distance between predicted Gaussian distributions and data using autodiff. Evaluation uses metrics that reflect distributional geometry (Wasserstein, Energy Distance) and RMSE, with interpretability via explicit control points.

Result: The approach yields competitive approximation quality in Wasserstein distance, Energy Distance, and RMSE, especially for pronounced nonlinearity. It produces smoother trajectories than alternatives, shows robustness to data structure changes, and maintains interpretability through explicit, control-point-based parameterization.

Conclusion: A balanced solution that combines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability. Future work includes extending to non-Gaussian distributions, applying entropy regularization to speed computations, and scaling to high-dimensional data for surfaces and more complex structures.

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of regression over distributions, which is
becoming increasingly important in machine learning. Existing approaches often
ignore the geometry of the probability space or are computationally expensive.
To overcome these limitations, a new method is proposed that combines the
parameterization of probability trajectories using a Bernstein basis and the
minimization of the Wasserstein distance between distributions. The key idea is
to model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined
by a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and
covariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein
polynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance
between the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which
takes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based
optimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic
datasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed
method provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein
distance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced
nonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than
or comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,
while maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via
control points. The developed approach represents a balanced solution that
combines geometric accuracy, computational practicality, and interpretability.
Prospects for further research include extending the method to non-Gaussian
distributions, applying entropy regularization to speed up computations, and
adapting the approach to working with high-dimensional data for approximating
surfaces and more complex structures.

### [227] [Aeolus: A Multi-structural Flight Delay Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26616)
*Lin Xu,Xinyun Yuan,Yuxuan Liang,Suwan Yin,Yuankai Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Aeolus presents a large-scale, multi-modal flight delay dataset with three aligned modalities (tabular data, a flight chain propagation module, and a flight network graph) to enable benchmarking across tabular, sequential, and graph learning; it includes temporal splits and leakage prevention, with baseline experiments and tools released at GitHub.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing flight delay datasets are mostly flat tabular collections, lacking explicit spatiotemporal propagation and relational structure. There is a need for a unified benchmark that supports diverse modalities and foundation-model research for structured data.

Method: Construct three aligned modalities: (i) a rich tabular dataset for over 50 million flights with operational, meteorological, and airport-level features; (ii) a flight chain module modeling delay propagation along sequential legs to capture upstream/downstream dependencies; (iii) a flight network graph encoding shared aircraft, crew, and airport resources for cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset uses temporal splits with leakage prevention and provides baseline experiments and preprocessing tools.

Result: Baseline experiments and preprocessing tools are released to facilitate adoption; the dataset supports a range of tasks including regression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning, acting as a unified benchmark across modalities.

Conclusion: Aeolus fills a key gap for both domain-specific flight-delay research and general-purpose structured-data research, enabling multi-modal modeling, robust evaluation, and baseline benchmarks. Code and data are available at the linked GitHub repository.

Abstract: We introduce Aeolus, a large-scale Multi-modal Flight Delay Dataset designed
to advance research on flight delay prediction and support the development of
foundation models for tabular data. Existing datasets in this domain are
typically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the
spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this
limitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with
rich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million
flights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along
sequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and
(iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport
resource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset
is carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and
strict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine
learning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including
regression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning,
serving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph
modalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to
facilitate adoption. Aeolus fills a key gap for both domain-specific modeling
and general-purpose structured data research.Our source code and data can be

### [228] [Omnipresent Yet Overlooked: Heat Kernels in Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26633)
*Colin Doumont,Victor Picheny,Viacheslav Borovitskiy,Henry Moss*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Unifying heat-kernel framework for combinatorial BO shows kernels relate to heat kernels; robust to optima location; enables a fast pipeline achieving state-of-the-art results.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There's a need to understand and unify combinatorial kernels used in Bayesian optimization; current kernels are fragmented and their relationships are unclear, impacting both theory and practice; robustness to optima structure and practical performance are desirable.

Method: Systematically derive heat kernels for combinatorial spaces, express them in closed form, map and relate existing kernels to heat kernels, analyze sensitivity to optima structure (in line with Bounce), and implement a fast BO pipeline using heat kernels; validate across datasets from materials science to neural architecture search.

Result: Many combinatorial kernels are related or equivalent to heat kernels; heat kernels are not sensitive to optima location; the heat-kernel pipeline matches or surpasses slower/complex algorithms and achieves state-of-the-art performance in experiments.

Conclusion: The heat-kernel framework provides a principled, efficient, and robust basis for combinatorial BO, unifying kernels, explaining empirical success, and enabling competitive performance without relying on complex kernels or expensive procedures.

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has the potential to solve various combinatorial
tasks, ranging from materials science to neural architecture search. However,
BO requires specialized kernels to effectively model combinatorial domains.
Recent efforts have introduced several combinatorial kernels, but the
relationships among them are not well understood. To bridge this gap, we
develop a unifying framework based on heat kernels, which we derive in a
systematic way and express as simple closed-form expressions. Using this
framework, we prove that many successful combinatorial kernels are either
related or equivalent to heat kernels, and validate this theoretical claim in
our experiments. Moreover, our analysis confirms and extends the results
presented in Bounce: certain algorithms' performance decreases substantially
when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. In
contrast, heat kernels are not sensitive to the location of the optima. Lastly,
we show that a fast and simple pipeline, relying on heat kernels, is able to
achieve state-of-the-art results, matching or even outperforming certain slow
or complex algorithms.

*Emmanouil Sylligardos,John Paparrizos,Themis Palpanas,Pierre Senellart,Paul Boniol*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A time-series classification–based model selection approach for anomaly detection, evaluated extensively, outperforms single anomaly detectors with similar runtimes; provides a strong baseline for AutoML in heterogeneous time-series settings.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: There is no universal best anomaly detector for highly heterogeneous time-series data; a scalable, data-driven model selection approach is needed to tailor detection methods to data characteristics and to enable practical AutoML pipelines.

Method: Evaluate 234 model configurations derived from 16 base classifiers, applied across more than 1,980 time series, treating time-series classification methods as model selectors for anomaly detection; compare against individual anomaly detectors in terms of accuracy and execution time.

Result: Model selection methods outperform every single anomaly detection method while maintaining comparable execution times; this constitutes the first extensive evaluation of using time-series classification for anomaly-detection model selection and provides a strong baseline for AutoML pipelines.

Conclusion: Time-series classification algorithms are effective for model selection in anomaly detection, validating their use as a component in AutoML workflows and guiding future research toward improved, data-adaptive anomaly-detection systems.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with
important implications for the downstream performance of many applications.
Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed
in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that
no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very
heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable
solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected
from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,
based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to
run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to
time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based
approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper
studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model
selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations
derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we
propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series
classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results
demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly
detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution
time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and
represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection
step in general AutoML pipelines. Preprint version of an article accepted at

### [230] [Curly Flow Matching for Learning Non-gradient Field Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26645)
*Katarina Petrović,Lazar Atanackovic,Viggo Moro,Kacper Kapuśniak,İsmail İlkan Ceylan,Michael Bronstein,Avishek Joey Bose,Alexander Tong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Curly-FM extends flow matching to learn non-gradient, potentially periodic dynamics by using a Schrödinger bridge with a non-zero drift reference, leveraging inferred velocities and population snapshots; demonstrates on biology and physics; code available.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Real-world transport dynamics often exhibit non-gradient, periodic behavior that gradient-based flow/bridge matching cannot capture. There is a need to learn such dynamics from population-level observations.

Method: Introduce a Schrödinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process, constructed from inferred velocities and population snapshot data. The method learns transport dynamics that align with both the reference process and the population marginals.

Result: Curly-FM learns trajectories that better match both the reference process and population marginals. Demonstrated on single-cell trajectories, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate velocities.

Conclusion: Curly-FM broadens flow matching to model non-gradient, periodic dynamics in physical systems, expanding applicability beyond population-level modeling; code is available at the provided GitHub repository.

Abstract: Modeling the transport dynamics of natural processes from population-level
observations is a ubiquitous problem in the natural sciences. Such models rely
on key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful
learning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de
facto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action
that results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an
energy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world
systems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit
non-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by
current state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this
paper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is
capable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a
Schr\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in
stark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is
constructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.
We showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single
cells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate
velocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better
match both the reference process and population marginals. Curly-FM expands
flow matching models beyond the modeling of populations and towards the
modeling of known periodic behavior in physical systems. Our code repository is

### [231] [Tight Differentially Private PCA via Matrix Coherence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26679)
*Tommaso d'Orsi,Gleb Novikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple, private rank-r approximation algorithm using SVD and standard DP perturbation achieves error bounds depending on rank-r coherence and spectral gap, resolving an open question and matching non-private guarantees in certain dense settings; coherence is preserved under Gaussian perturbations, with applications to private Max-Cut under low coherence.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Improve understanding of how differential privacy impacts the span of top singular vectors, and to identify structural properties (coherence) that govern private learnability in matrix approximation and related graph problems.

Method: Apply SVD to the data, then add standard differential privacy perturbations to release a private rank-r approximation. Analyze error in terms of rank-r coherence and the spectral gap; prove non-increase of coherence under Gaussian perturbations; extend coherence ideas to private graph problems.

Result: The proposed estimator achieves private rank-r approximation with error depending only on rank-r coherence and the spectral gap; matches non-private optimal performance in dense single-spike PCA within the Wishart model; outperforms previous private methods in several regimes; Gaussian perturbations preserve coherence; provides a DP algorithm for Max-Cut under low coherence.

Conclusion: Coherence (specifically, rank-r coherence) is a key determinant of private learnability for spectral methods, enabling near-optimal private PCA in challenging regimes and suggesting broader DP applications in graph problems under low coherence; Gaussian perturbations do not inflate coherence, reinforcing the robustness of DP mechanisms in structured settings.

Abstract: We revisit the task of computing the span of the top $r$ singular vectors
$u_1, \ldots, u_r$ of a matrix under differential privacy. We show that a
simple and efficient algorithm -- based on singular value decomposition and
standard perturbation mechanisms -- returns a private rank-$r$ approximation
whose error depends only on the \emph{rank-$r$ coherence} of $u_1, \ldots, u_r$
and the spectral gap $\sigma_r - \sigma_{r+1}$. This resolves a question posed
by Hardt and Roth~\cite{hardt2013beyond}. Our estimator outperforms the state
of the art -- significantly so in some regimes. In particular, we show that in
the dense setting, it achieves the same guarantees for single-spike PCA in the
Wishart model as those attained by optimal non-private algorithms, whereas
prior private algorithms failed to do so.
  In addition, we prove that (rank-$r$) coherence does not increase under
Gaussian perturbations. This implies that any estimator based on the Gaussian
mechanism -- including ours -- preserves the coherence of the input. We
conjecture that similar behavior holds for other structured models, including
planted problems in graphs.
  We also explore applications of coherence to graph problems. In particular,
we present a differentially private algorithm for Max-Cut and other constraint
satisfaction problems under low coherence assumptions.

*Amir Reza Mirzaei,Yuqiao Wen,Yanshuai Cao,Lili Mou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRAQuant enables highly efficient mixed-precision post-training quantization for LoRA adapters by applying SVD to concentrate information into select rows/columns, allowing important components to be quantized at higher precision while others use ultra-low bitwidth, reducing overall cost with maintained or improved performance.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Multi-adapter deployments for LLM customization incur large cumulative storage and compute costs. A lightweight, cross-adapter quantization approach is needed to reduce footprint without sacrificing performance.

Method: Each LoRA adapter is reparameterized via singular value decomposition (SVD) to identify the most informative rows/columns. The method quantizes the key components at higher precision and the remaining components to ultra-low bitwidth (mixed-precision post-training quantization). The approach is applied to LoRA-equipped models (LLaMA 2 7B/13B, Mistral 7B) and evaluated on diverse tasks.

Result: LoRAQuant achieves significantly lower bitwidths than competing quantization methods while delivering comparable or superior performance on math reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks across the evaluated models.

Conclusion: LoRAQuant provides an effective, scalable solution for quantizing multiple LoRA adapters with minimal performance loss, enabling cost-efficient deployment of personalized and task-diverse LLM configurations.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular technique for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). In many
real-world scenarios, multiple adapters are loaded simultaneously to enable LLM
customization for personalized user experiences or to support a diverse range
of tasks. Although each adapter is lightweight in isolation, their aggregate
cost becomes substantial at scale. To address this, we propose LoRAQuant, a
mixed-precision post-training quantization method tailored to LoRA.
Specifically, LoRAQuant reparameterizes each adapter by singular value
decomposition (SVD) to concentrate the most important information into specific
rows and columns. This makes it possible to quantize the important components
to higher precision, while quantizing the rest to ultra-low bitwidth. We
conduct comprehensive experiments with LLaMA 2-7B, LLaMA 2-13B, and Mistral 7B
models on mathematical reasoning, coding, and summarization tasks. Results show
that our LoRAQuant uses significantly lower bits than other quantization
methods, but achieves comparable or even higher performance.

### [233] [How Regularization Terms Make Invertible Neural Networks Bayesian Point Estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26704)
*Nick Heilenkötter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two regularization terms for training invertible neural networks yield Bayesian-like estimators in reconstruction: one aligns with the posterior mean, the other with the MAP. Theory shows how losses shape the learned forward operator and inverse map; experiments demonstrate data-dependent, stable, interpretable reconstructions.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Invertible networks offer stable, interpretable solvers for inverse problems. Existing Bayesian-inspired strategies (forward-operator or reconstruction-map training) have limitations. Introducing regularizers during training aims to imprint Bayesian point-estimator properties (mean and MAP) into the learned model upon inversion.

Method: Introduce two regularization terms into the training loss of invertible networks. The first term is connected to the posterior mean; the second to MAP-like behavior. Provide theoretical analysis of how each loss term shapes the forward operator and its inverse reconstruction map, and demonstrate data-dependence and stability through numerical experiments.

Result: Theoretical analysis characterizes how each loss shapes the learned forward operator and the inverse reconstruction map, showing connections to Bayesian point estimators (mean and MAP). Numerical experiments validate the theory and illustrate data-dependent, stable, interpretable regularization effects induced by the losses.

Conclusion: Loss-term regularizers effectively encode Bayesian properties into invertible networks for inverse problems, yielding forward operators and inverse reconstructions with posterior-mean/MAP-like behavior, and delivering stable, data-informed, interpretable reconstructions across experiments.

Abstract: Can regularization terms in the training of invertible neural networks lead
to known Bayesian point estimators in reconstruction? Invertible networks are
attractive for inverse problems due to their inherent stability and
interpretability. Recently, optimization strategies for invertible neural
networks that approximate either a reconstruction map or the forward operator
have been studied from a Bayesian perspective, but each has limitations. To
address this, we introduce and analyze two regularization terms for the network
training that, upon inversion of the network, recover properties of classical
Bayesian point estimators: while the first can be connected to the posterior
mean, the second resembles the MAP estimator. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes how each loss shapes both the learned forward operator and its
inverse reconstruction map. Numerical experiments support our findings and
demonstrate how these loss-term regularizers introduce data-dependence in a
stable and interpretable way.

*Giulia DeSalvo,Clara Mohri,Mehryar Mohri,Yutao Zhong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Introduces a budgeted deferral framework that trains deferral models by selectively querying a subset of costly experts, reducing training costs while maintaining accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deferral systems often query all experts for every training instance, which is prohibitively expensive when expert queries carry high costs. The goal is to minimize training-time query costs without sacrificing predictive performance.

Method: Proposes a budgeted deferral framework and new algorithms for two-stage and single-stage multi-expert deferral settings that selectively query only a subset of experts per training example. Distinguishes the setting from active learning by noting that labels are known and the challenge is selecting which experts to query. Provides generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.

Result: Theoretical guarantees (generalization bounds and label complexity) and empirical evidence across several domains showing substantial training-cost reductions with no loss in prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: Budget-aware deferral algorithms enable cost-effective training of deferral systems by selective expert querying, achieving lower training costs while preserving predictive performance and offering a practical path for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Learning to defer uncertain predictions to costly experts offers a powerful
strategy for improving the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning systems.
However, standard training procedures for deferral algorithms typically require
querying all experts for every training instance, an approach that becomes
prohibitively expensive when expert queries incur significant computational or
resource costs. This undermines the core goal of deferral: to limit unnecessary
expert usage. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the budgeted deferral
framework, which aims to train effective deferral algorithms while minimizing
expert query costs during training. We propose new algorithms for both
two-stage and single-stage multiple-expert deferral settings that selectively
query only a subset of experts per training example. While inspired by active
learning, our setting is fundamentally different: labels are already known, and
the core challenge is to decide which experts to query in order to balance cost
and predictive performance. We establish theoretical guarantees for both of our
algorithms, including generalization bounds and label complexity analyses.
Empirical results across several domains show that our algorithms substantially
reduce training costs without sacrificing prediction accuracy, demonstrating
the practical value of our budget-aware deferral algorithms.

*Chuyan Chen,Chenyang Ma,Zhangxin Li,Yutong He,Yanjie Dong,Kun Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ARC-Top-K is an All-Reduce-compatible Top-K gradient compressor that aligns sparsity across nodes with a gradient sketch, is contractive, and yields linear speedup with EF21M while matching Top-K accuracy.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Communication is the main bottleneck in large-scale distributed ML. Gradient sparsification helps, but Rand-K discards structure and Top-K loses the contraction property and relies on costly All-Gather. There is a need for an All-Reduce-friendly compressor that preserves global information and convergence guarantees.

Method: ARC-Top-K uses a lightweight gradient sketch to align sparsity patterns across nodes, enabling index-free All-Reduce. It preserves informative entries while maintaining contraction. The compressor is provably contractive and, when combined with momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper convergence rates under standard assumptions.

Result: Empirically, ARC-Top-K matches Top-K accuracy while reducing wall-clock training time by up to 60.7%. It also offers linear speedup and sharper convergence rates than EF21M under standard assumptions.

Conclusion: ARC-Top-K provides a robust and scalable gradient compression method that combines the robustness of Rand-K with the performance of Top-K. It delivers All-Reduce compatibility, reduced communication, and maintained accuracy, making it a practical solution for large-scale distributed training.

Abstract: Communication remains a central bottleneck in large-scale distributed machine
learning, and gradient sparsification has emerged as a promising strategy to
alleviate this challenge. However, existing gradient compressors face notable
limitations: Rand-$K$\ discards structural information and performs poorly in
practice, while Top-$K$\ preserves informative entries but loses the
contraction property and requires costly All-Gather operations. In this paper,
we propose ARC-Top-$K$, an {All-Reduce}-Compatible Top-$K$ compressor that
aligns sparsity patterns across nodes using a lightweight sketch of the
gradient, enabling index-free All-Reduce while preserving globally significant
information. ARC-Top-$K$\ is provably contractive and, when combined with
momentum error feedback (EF21M), achieves linear speedup and sharper
convergence rates than the original EF21M under standard assumptions.
Empirically, ARC-Top-$K$\ matches the accuracy of Top-$K$\ while reducing
wall-clock training time by up to 60.7\%, offering an efficient and scalable
solution that combines the robustness of Rand-$K$\ with the strong performance
of Top-$K$.

*Jamie Lanyon,Axel Finke,Petros Andreou,Georgina Cosma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Seed variation can drastically change empirical evaluations of machine unlearning methods; comparisons should report variability across training seeds.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MU algorithms are approximate; empirical evaluation may be biased by random seeds; need robust benchmarking.

Method: Expose seed sensitivity by running MU experiments multiple times from the same trained model across different seeds; analyze variability and representativeness of results.

Result: Demonstrates high sensitivity to seed; some MU methods yield non-representative performance depending on seed; traditional multiple-run practice is insufficient.

Conclusion: Recommend reporting seed-variability in MU algorithm comparisons; adjust benchmarking protocols to include training-seed variability and provide distributions.

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of certain data points
from a trained model without costly retraining. Most practical MU algorithms
are only approximate and their performance can only be assessed empirically.
Care must therefore be taken to make empirical comparisons as representative as
possible. A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times
independently starting from the same trained model. In this work, we
demonstrate that this practice can give highly non-representative results
because -- even for the same architecture and same dataset -- some MU methods
can be highly sensitive to the choice of random number seed used for model
training. We therefore recommend that empirical
comphttps://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#commentsarisons of MU algorithms should
also reflect the variability across different model training seeds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Uncharacterized mass spectrometry data limits biological and chemical insight. There is a need for more accurate spectral identification (notably for isomers) and for embeddings that enable downstream translational analyses and clinical interpretation.

Method: Train a large-scale foundation model on millions of tandem MS spectra to learn a semantic chemical space. Evaluate performance on spectral identification (including isomers), robustness under low concentration, and downstream tasks using spectral embeddings for disease state differentiation and clinical outcome prediction.

Result: 30% improvement in accuracy for identifying challenging isomeric compounds; 42% more correct identifications in complex biological samples; robust under low-concentration conditions; spectral embeddings enable direct biological interpretation and differentiation of disease states as well as prediction of clinical outcomes across diverse translational applications.

Conclusion: Foundation models trained on mass spectrometry data can substantially improve identification performance and produce biologically meaningful embeddings, enabling more direct clinical and translational insights from MS data.

Abstract: A vast majority of mass spectrometry data remains uncharacterized, leaving
much of its biological and chemical information untapped. Recent advances in
machine learning have begun to address this gap, particularly for tasks such as
spectral identification in tandem mass spectrometry data. Here, we present the
latest generation of LSM-MS2, a large-scale deep learning foundation model
trained on millions of spectra to learn a semantic chemical space. LSM-MS2
achieves state-of-the-art performance in spectral identification, improving on
existing methods by 30% in accuracy of identifying challenging isomeric
compounds, yielding 42% more correct identifications in complex biological
samples, and maintaining robustness under low-concentration conditions.
Furthermore, LSM-MS2 produces rich spectral embeddings that enable direct
biological interpretation from minimal downstream data, successfully
differentiating disease states and predicting clinical outcomes across diverse

### [238] [On Purely Private Covariance Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26717)
*Tommaso d'Orsi,Gleb Novikov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: A simple, differentially private perturbation mechanism for releasing d-dimensional covariance matrices that achieves optimal Frobenius error for large datasets and optimal Schatten norms (including spectral norm) across p in [1, ∞], and an efficient projection-based refinement for small datasets to attain optimal Frobenius error.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To enable private release of covariance matrices with strong, norm-wide error guarantees in both large- and small-sample regimes, matching or improving prior benchmarks.

Method: Introduce a simple perturbation mechanism; for small samples, project the released matrix onto the nuclear norm ball to control Frobenius error; analyze error across p-Schatten norms, showing optimality for p>=2 and spectral-norm optimality.

Result: For n ≥ d^2/ε, achieves provably optimal Frobenius error and best-known errors for all p-Schatten norms; information-theoretically optimal for p≥2; first purely private covariance estimator achieving optimal spectral-norm error; for n < d^2/ε, projection yields Frobenius error O( sqrt(d Tr(Σ) / n) ), improving prior bounds.

Conclusion: The proposed mechanism unifies privacy with tight, norm-wide error guarantees, delivering optimal or near-optimal performance across regimes and norms, and extends the state of the art in private covariance estimation.

Abstract: We present a simple perturbation mechanism for the release of $d$-dimensional
covariance matrices $\Sigma$ under pure differential privacy. For large
datasets with at least $n\geq d^2/\varepsilon$ elements, our mechanism recovers
the provably optimal Frobenius norm error guarantees of
\cite{nikolov2023private}, while simultaneously achieving best known error for
all other $p$-Schatten norms, with $p\in [1,\infty]$. Our error is
information-theoretically optimal for all $p\ge 2$, in particular, our
mechanism is the first purely private covariance estimator that achieves
optimal error in spectral norm.
  For small datasets $n< d^2/\varepsilon$, we further show that by projecting
the output onto the nuclear norm ball of appropriate radius, our algorithm
achieves the optimal Frobenius norm error $O(\sqrt{d\;\text{Tr}(\Sigma) /n})$,
improving over the known bounds of $O(\sqrt{d/n})$ of \cite{nikolov2023private}
and ${O}\big(d^{3/4}\sqrt{\text{Tr}(\Sigma)/n}\big)$ of
\cite{dong2022differentially}.

*Muhammad Faraz Ul Abrar,Nicolò Michelusi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OTA-FL over wireless channels with device heterogeneity allows a structured time-invariant model bias to mitigate variance, improves non-convex SGD performance; a finite-time stationarity bound is derived showing a bias-variance trade-off; a non-convex joint power-control problem is solved with a successive convex approximation algorithm using only statistical CSI, yielding faster convergence and better generalization in non-convex image classification.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Addresses key gaps in OTA-FL: (1) zero-bias updates under heterogeneity inflate variance and limit scalability; (2) prior biased analyses focused on convex objectives; (3) need to handle non-convex objectives and wireless heterogeneity in a scalable manner.

Method: Introduce OTA-FL SGD updates with a structured, time-invariant model bias to reduce update variance. Derive a finite-time stationarity bound highlighting bias-variance trade-off. Formulate a non-convex joint OTA power-control problem and solve it via a successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm using only statistical CSI at the base station.

Result: Theoretical finite-time bound shows a bias-variance trade-off under heterogeneity. Empirical validation on non-convex image classification demonstrates that the SCA-based power control accelerates convergence and improves generalization compared with prior OTA-FL baselines.

Conclusion: Structured approach to introduce bias in OTA-FL under wireless heterogeneity, coupled with SCA-based power control, achieves faster convergence and better generalization for non-convex objectives; practical method requiring only statistical CSI.

Abstract: Over-the-air (OTA) federated learning (FL) has been well recognized as a
scalable paradigm that exploits the waveform superposition of the wireless
multiple-access channel to aggregate model updates in a single use. Existing
OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming
\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or
forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \emph{heterogeneous}
wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device
and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL
largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly
non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless
heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured,
time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We
derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient
norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this
trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an
efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only
statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image
classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates
convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL
baselines.

*Shahriar Noroozizadeh,Vaishnavh Nagarajan,Elan Rosenfeld,Sanjiv Kumar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers develop a global, geometric memory of atomic facts that cannot be explained by local co-occurrence storage; this memory enables simple one-step geometric reasoning from multi-hop tasks, emerges via a spectral bias resembling Node2Vec, and suggests design directions to enhance geometric memory.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To understand why neural memories in sequence models exhibit geometry rather than merely storing local associations, and what this implies for knowledge acquisition and model capacity.

Method: Theoretically isolate a clean Transformer reasoning instance incompatible with memory-only local co-occurrences; analyze embedding geometries; connect to Node2Vec; discuss spectral bias; argue about pressures and design implications.

Result: Evidence that the learned geometry encodes global relationships (including non-co-occurring entities), converting an ℓ-fold composition problem into a 1-step geometric task; geometry emerges even without pressures that favor succinct local storage; a spectral bias explains the phenomenon; headroom identified to make Transformer memory more geometric.

Conclusion: The geometric view challenges default intuitions about memory in neural models and motivates revisiting approaches to knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery, and unlearning; practical implications include guiding architectural/optimization choices to foster geometric memory.

Abstract: In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.

*Marco Federici,Riccardo Del Chiaro,Boris van Breugel,Paul Whatmough,Markus Nagel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STaMP is a sequence-dimension transformation with mixed-precision quantization that preserves accuracy at low activation bit-widths by keeping a subset of tokens at higher precision, improving quantization for LVMs/LLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Quantization reduces latency, power, and memory but causes accuracy loss when activations are quantized below eight bits. Existing linear transforms (e.g., rotations) help but struggle with sequence data. Language and vision data exhibit strong local correlations along the sequence dimension. There is a need for a method that exploits these correlations to enable low-bit activation quantization without sacrificing accuracy.

Method: Apply invertible linear transformations along the sequence dimension to activations, exploiting local correlations. Use a mixed-precision approach by keeping a small number of tokens in intermediate activations at higher precision while quantizing the rest to lower-bit widths. Integrate with standard activation and weight quantization and compare with existing feature transformations on recent LVM and LLM architectures.

Result: STaMP significantly improves activation quantization at low average bit-widths, outperforming baseline quantization methods and complementing existing activation/weight quantization and feature transformation techniques; demonstrated on recent LVMs/LLMs.

Conclusion: STaMP provides a new quantization paradigm that leverages sequence-dimension transformations and mixed precision to maintain accuracy under aggressive activation quantization, enabling better deployment of quantized LVMs/LLMs and synergizing with other quantization methods.

Abstract: Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power and
memory footprint of generative AI models. However, accuracy often degrades
sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits. Recent work suggests
that invertible linear transformations (e.g. rotations) can aid quantization,
by reparameterizing feature channels and weights. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision} (STaMP) quantization, a
novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the \textit{sequence}
dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data.
By keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher
precision, we can maintain model accuracy at lower (average) activations
bit-widths. We evaluate STaMP on recent LVM and LLM architectures,
demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation
quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization
methods including recent feature transformations.

*Jungyeon Koh,Hyeonsu Lyu,Jonggyu Jang,Hyun Jong Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Two feature- and logit-based samplers make influence-function estimation more efficient and accurate for black-box models by selecting representative small training subsets.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Computing the Hessian over the entire training dataset is costly, and random subset sampling yields high variance in influence-function estimates, making IFs impractical for large models.

Method: Introduce two sampling techniques based on features and logits that pick a small, representative subset by accounting for the stochastic distribution of features or logits; evaluate via class-removal experiments using F1-score to measure forgetting of the removed class while preserving performance on remaining classes.

Result: Computation time reduced by 30.1% and memory usage reduced by 42.2%; or the F1-score improved by 2.5% compared to the baseline.

Conclusion: The proposed feature- and logit-based samplers improve the efficiency and reliability of influence-function estimates on black-box models, enabling more practical analysis of training-data influence.

Abstract: How can we explain the influence of training data on black-box models?
Influence functions (IFs) offer a post-hoc solution by utilizing gradients and
Hessians. However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is
resource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach
involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method
often results in highly inconsistent IF estimates due to the high variance in
sample configurations. To address this, we propose two advanced sampling
techniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet
representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic
distribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF
estimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a
typical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the
model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the
remaining classes. Our method reduces computation time by 30.1% and memory
usage by 42.2%, or improves the F1-score by 2.5% compared to the baseline.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Forecasting-trained representations, when frozen, can power time series classification competitively with task-specific pretraining.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To assess whether representations learned by frozen pre-trained forecasting models are generalizable for classification and to challenge the assumption that task-specific pretraining is required.

Method: Compare representation extraction strategies from frozen forecasting models and introduce two model-agnostic embedding augmentations; evaluate on classification tasks and compare to models pre-trained for classification; examine correlation between forecasting and classification performance.

Result: Best forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or exceeds state-of-the-art models pre-trained for classification; a positive correlation exists between forecasting performance and classification performance.

Conclusion: Forecasting objectives can yield general-purpose time-series representations, suggesting task-specific pretraining may be unnecessary and supporting forecasting as a route to general-time-series foundation models.

Abstract: Recent research on time series foundation models has primarily focused on
forecasting, leaving it unclear how generalizable their learned representations
are. In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models
can provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we
compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two
model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best
forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even
surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for
classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting
and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that
task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast
may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series
foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bridge the gap between research benchmarks and real economic value by quantifying how AI performance translates into automation and labor impact.

Method: Introduce a broad, multi-sector benchmark (RLI) of real-world, economically valuable projects to assess end-to-end agent performance in practical settings.

Result: AI agents perform near the floor on RLI; the top-performing agent automated only 2.5% of tasks, providing empirical grounding for discussions of AI-driven labor automation.

Conclusion: RLI offers a standard for tracking AI impact on labor and helps stakeholders proactively navigate automation risks and opportunities.

Abstract: AIs have made rapid progress on research-oriented benchmarks of knowledge and

TL;DR: Switching RL fine-tuning from BF16 to FP16 resolves the training/inference policy mismatch caused by rounding errors, yielding more stable optimization and better performance with minimal changes.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Instability in RL fine-tuning of LLMs is driven by numerical precision mismatch; BF16's rounding errors break training-inference consistency, motivating a reevaluation of precision choices.

Method: Empirical evaluation across diverse tasks, RL algorithms, and frameworks comparing FP16 vs BF16. Implement FP16 with only a few lines of code changes, with no changes to model architecture or learning algorithm; assess stability, convergence, and performance.

Result: FP16 produces more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger performance across tasks, algorithms, and frameworks.

Conclusion: Precision selection is a crucial lever in RL fine-tuning. The findings advocate reconsidering BF16 usage in favor of FP16 and suggest broader scrutiny of precision trade-offs in RL training.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) often
suffers from instability due to the numerical mismatch between the training and
inference policies. While prior work has attempted to mitigate this issue
through algorithmic corrections or engineering alignments, we show that its
root cause lies in the floating point precision itself. The widely adopted
BF16, despite its large dynamic range, introduces large rounding errors that
breaks the consistency between training and inference. In this work, we
demonstrate that simply reverting to \textbf{FP16} effectively eliminates this
mismatch. The change is simple, fully supported by modern frameworks with only
a few lines of code change, and requires no modification to the model
architecture or learning algorithm. Our results suggest that using FP16
uniformly yields more stable optimization, faster convergence, and stronger
performance across diverse tasks, algorithms and frameworks. We hope these
findings motivate a broader reconsideration of precision trade-offs in RL
fine-tuning.

### [246] [Learning Pseudorandom Numbers with Transformers: Permuted Congruential Generators, Curricula, and Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26792)
*Tao Tao,Maissam Barkeshli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Transformers can learn and predict sequences produced by Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs) even under heavy bitwise transformations, with strong in-context prediction across variants, a square-root scaling law with modulus, and embedding clustering that supports transfer across moduli.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCGs are a challenging, non-linear, bit-level PRNG family. Understanding whether Transformer-based models can in-context learn their dynamics sheds light on the capabilities and limits of sequence modeling, with implications for security and algorithmic learning.

Method: Train transformers (up to 50M parameters) on datasets up to 5B tokens generated by diverse PCGs with moduli up to 2^22, using in-context prediction tasks (including single-bit outputs). Evaluate learning under multiple simultaneous PRNGs, analyze scaling with modulus m, observe optimization dynamics (including stagnation phases), and inspect embedding layers for structure such as clustering.

Result: Models achieve near-perfect in-context prediction even when outputs are truncated to a single bit; can jointly learn multiple PCGs; scaling shows the required number of in-context elements grows roughly with sqrt(m); large moduli induce extended optimization stagnation, mitigated by curriculum learning from smaller moduli; embeddings reveal bitwise rotationally-invariant clustering, suggesting transfer of representations from smaller to larger moduli.

Conclusion: Transformers possess substantial capacity to learn and transfer PCG structures in-context, though training large moduli benefits from curriculum strategies and diverse training data. The observed embedding clustering points to interpretable representations and potential generalization across modulus scales.

Abstract: We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by
Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random
number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty
over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise
shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that
Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on
unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published
classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up
to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.
Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can
be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented
together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying
structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with
modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for
near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization
enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq
2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating
a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding
layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously
groups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,
revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.

### [247] [Shortest Paths, Convexity, and Treewidth in Regular Hyperbolic Tilings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26110)
*Sándor Kisfaludi-Bak,Tze-Yang Poon,Geert van Wordragen*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: Proposes efficient computation of the isometric closure of terminals in hyperbolic tilings, showing hull size scales linearly with path length and that the geodesic convex hull has bounded treewidth, enabling near-linear-time subset TSP and Steiner tree algorithms.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Understand the structure of shortest paths in hyperbolic tilings to enable efficient network optimization problems (TSP, Steiner) on such graphs.

Method: Compute the isometric closure of a set of terminals using a classic geometric convex hull algorithm as a black box; analyze the hull size and treewidth of the geodesic convex hull in hyperbolic tilings; derive algorithmic consequences.

Result: The convex hull size is O(N), where N is the total length of the paths from a fixed origin to the terminals. The geodesic convex hull of n terminals has treewidth bounded by max(12, O(log(n/(p+q)))). Consequently, subset TSP and Steiner tree can be solved in time O(N log N) + poly(n/(p+q)) · N.

Conclusion: Structural properties of shortest paths in hyperbolic tilings yield near-linear-time algorithms for core combinatorial problems (subset TSP, Steiner tree) by leveraging a bounded-treewidth hull and a convex-hull-like closure.

Abstract: Hyperbolic tilings are natural infinite planar graphs where each vertex has
degree $q$ and each face has $p$ edges for some $\frac1p+\frac1q<\frac12$. We
study the structure of shortest paths in such graphs. We show that given a set
of $n$ terminals, we can compute a so-called isometric closure (closely related
to the geodesic convex hull) of the terminals in near-linear time, using a
classic geometric convex hull algorithm as a black box. We show that the size
of the convex hull is $O(N)$ where $N$ is the total length of the paths to the
terminals from a fixed origin.
  Furthermore, we prove that the geodesic convex hull of a set of $n$ terminals
has treewidth only $\max(12,O(\log\frac{n}{p + q}))$, a bound independent of
the distance of the points involved. As a consequence, we obtain algorithms for
subset TSP and Steiner tree with running time $O(N \log N) +
\mathrm{poly}(\frac{n}{p + q}) \cdot N$.
