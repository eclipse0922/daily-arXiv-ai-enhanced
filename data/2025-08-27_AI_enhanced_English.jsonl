However, the\neffectiveness of VQAs is often constrained by the so-called barren plateau\nproblem, wherein gradients diminish exponentially as system size or circuit\ndepth increases, thereby hindering training. In this work, we propose a\nreinforcement learning (RL)-based initialization strategy to alleviate the\nbarren plateau issue by reshaping the initial parameter landscape to avoid\nregions prone to vanishing gradients. In particular, we explore several RL\nalgorithms (Deterministic Policy Gradient, Soft Actor-Critic, and Proximal\nPolicy Optimization, etc.) to generate the circuit parameters (treated as\nactions) that minimize the VQAs cost function before standard gradient-based\noptimization. By pre-training with RL in this manner, subsequent optimization\nusing methods such as gradient descent or Adam proceeds from a more favorable\ninitial state. Extensive numerical experiments under various noise conditions\nand tasks consistently demonstrate that the RL-based initialization method\nsignificantly enhances both convergence speed and final solution quality.\nMoreover, comparisons among different RL algorithms highlight that multiple\napproaches can achieve comparable performance gains, underscoring the\nflexibility and robustness of our method. These findings shed light on a\npromising avenue for integrating machine learning techniques into quantum\nalgorithm design, offering insights into how RL-driven parameter initialization\ncan accelerate the scalability and practical deployment of VQAs.
