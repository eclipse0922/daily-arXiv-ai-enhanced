In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs\nsuggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand\nimages involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can\ngeneral-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do\nthey compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark\nthat can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as\nHICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their\nevaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is\npoorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple\nvalid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may\ncapture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted\nas either \"throwing\" or \"catching\". When only \"catching\" is annotated, the\nother, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact\nmatching is used.

A standard solution is early stopping using a hold-out validation set,\nwhich halts the minimisation when the validation loss stops decreasing.\nHowever, this hold-out set reduces the data available for training. This paper\npresents {\\sc gradstop}, a novel stochastic early stopping method that only\nuses information in the gradients, which are produced by the gradient descent\nalgorithm ``for free.''

Our empirical evaluation shows that\n{\\sc gradstop} achieves a small loss on test data and compares favourably to a\nvalidation-set-based stopping criterion. By leveraging the entire dataset for\ntraining, our method is particularly advantageous in data-limited settings,\nsuch as transfer learning.
